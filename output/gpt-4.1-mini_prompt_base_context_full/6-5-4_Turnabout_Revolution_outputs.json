Rayfa actor: Aaah! Why me?! Dhurke actor: Mwahahahaha! It's time for a revolution! Rayfa actor: No! Let go of me! Plumed Punisher actor: That's far enough! Dhurke actor: Who's there?! Plumed Punisher actor: It is I-- The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm! Dhurke: Good people of Khura'in, we can't allow things to go on like this. The Defense Culpability Act has done nothing but produce countless victims of wrongful convictions. The time to act is now. For we, the Defiant Dragons, have obtained the ultimate weapon: the Founder's Orb! And to the Ga'ran regime: Make no mistake about it-- I will personally dethrone you! A dragon never yields. Nor will he rest until his revolution is complete. May 16, 11:00 AMWright Anything Agency TV: ...And this concludes our report on the recent television hijacking in Khura'in. But really, who could have anticipated a surprising turn of events? Trucy: Did you hear that, Polly? Someone hijacked the airwaves over there! It's like something out of a movie! Apollo: ......... Trucy: Apollo? Apollo: ......Um, yeah. Dhurke... What are you up to this time? Trucy: Wait a second... Do you know the TV hijacker or something, Apollo? Apollo: ......You could say that... but it was a long time ago. Trucy: ...And WHY do you know someone like that? I mean, they're calling him an \"insurgent.\" Apollo: Y-Yeah, about that... ???: Hey now. Is that any way to talk about the man who raised you? Apollo: Huh? Dhurke: Hey there, Apollo! Long time no see! How've you been, son? Apollo: I-I-It's-- Trucy: It's that guy that was on TV! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Guilty as charged! Surprised to see me, Apollo? I just beamed in from Khura'in, and boy are my arms tired! Apollo: Th-Th-This can't be happening! ...I must be dreaming... or hallucinating... or both... Trucy: No, you're not, Apollo! It's that TV hijacker-slash-insurgent in the flesh! Apollo: ........ (I'm so confused.) Trucy: Um! Mr. Hijacker! Sir! I have SO many questions, I don't even know where to begin! But let's start with that bit about \"the man who raised you.\" Dhurke: Wait, don't tell me you haven't told anyone about me, son? It's okay to brag about it. Tell everyone your old man's me, the rebel Dhurke! I mean, my face is all over TV these days! I'm practically a celebrity, hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: .........Trucy, what do you say we close up early today? Trucy: What?! Why?! Dhurke: ...Aw, come on, son. No need for the cold shoulder! Apollo: ......... (*sigh* I know I'm going to regret this, but...) What do you want, Dhurke? You just show up here without warning after all this time... What gives? Dhurke: I came all this way to see you, son! Come, rejoice! Apollo: Riiight... Why don't you tell me the real reason you're here. Dhurke: W-Well... Okay, so maybe there's a little something I need your help with, too, but... The fact is I came here to see you. That's the honest truth. Apollo: Yes, I think we've established that. (It figures... I haven't seen him in ten plus years and he's already asking for a favor. He really is a rebel in the purest sense -- he just does whatever he pleases.) Trucy: C'mon, Polly! I need details. Inquiring minds want to know! Apollo: Okay, okay. Hold your horses. First, I've got a few questions of my own. Examine Bookshelf Dhurke: Hm? Why, this is Apollo's journal. Apollo: Huh?! What's it doing at the office? Trucy: It's magic! Dhurke: Let's see what he wrote... Apollo: N-No, don't! Dhurke: Huh... There's nothing in here. Apollo: What? Trucy: This calls for a special spell! Presto diario! Dhurke: Why, there's writing appearing right before my very eyes! Trucy: Like I said, it's magic! Now go ahead, read to your heart's content! Apollo: Wow! ...Er, I mean, give me that! Charley the plant Apollo: That's Charley the houseplant. Dhurke: You know, my hideout used to have a houseplant, too. We called it \"Apollo.\" Trucy: I bet it was a cactus! Dhurke: How'd you guess? Trucy: Because Polly's hair's just as spiny! Apollo: Hey, leave my hair out of this. Trucy: And he has a prickly attitude, to boot! Apollo: (I better quit while I'm ahead.) Hula hoop Dhurke: More magic props... Oh! I've seen a ring like this before! I used to be quite good with these. Apollo: Really? Why don't you show us? Dhurke: Well, if you insist! I'll show you the act of daring-do I used to perform to supplement my income. First, I have to light the ring on fire, then I'll jump through it... Apollo: That's a fire hoop, this is a kid's toy, Dhurke... Magic props Dhurke: This is one seriously cluttered office. I mean, do you really need a piano here? Trucy: Well, it has sentimental value for Daddy, you see... Apollo: Yeah, but this office could use a little help with its bottom line. What if we sold it? Trucy: Apollo! ...You'd better give me a cut of the proceeds when you do. Dhurke: Money before memories, eh? This office's finances really must be in dire straits then. Magic split box Dhurke: This is one of those contraptions for cutting people into pieces! Trucy: How did you know that, Mr. Dhurke? Dhurke: Well, it just so happens I've been in one of these myself. Apollo: Really? Trucy: You have? Dhurke: Yes. Once, when I was being held prisoner by Minister Inga's secret police... ...they tried to torture me into revealing one of my compatriot's hideouts. Apollo: That's a torture device, this is a magic prop, Dhurke... Dhurke: Man, I barely escaped that thing alive! Trucy: Well, you have my respect as a magician for your death-defying spirit! Table Dhurke: What's with this bright red jacket? Who would wear such a garish thing? Trucy: Maybe one of our clients forgot it here. Dhurke: I'd love to get a look at the man who'd dare wear something like this! Trucy: Me, too! Apollo: (I know I don't wear it much, but... she has to know it's mine, right?) Talk Dhurke Dhurke: Pleased to meet you, little lady. My name is Dhurke Sahdmadhi. I'm a... well... a rebel by trade. Trucy: A rebel? But on TV, they were calling you an insurgent. So which is it? Personally, I vote for a rebel with a cause -- a real \"head\"-ache for anyone in your way! Apollo: Trucy...! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! You got me there. I'm the head of a resistance group. The Defiant Dragons. We're like the good, the bad, and the ugly... but without the good part. In Khura'in, I'm like the bogeyman -- a tall tale parents use to spook their kids straight! Trucy: That's too bad. You seem like you'd be a fun, cool guy to hang with! Dhurke: ...This little lady's a real catch, son. I'm talking bride material, if you get my drift. Apollo: Wait, what? Trucy: Oh! Stop it! You're embarrassing me... Dad. Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha. She's a plucky one, all right! Apollo: Someone pluck me out of my misery... Trucy: Now, about that \"man who raised you\" business... Foster father (appears after \"Dhurke\") Trucy: What did Mr. Dhurke mean when he said that he's \"the man who raised you,\" Apollo? Apollo: The truth is, I grew up in the Kingdom of Khura'in. Did I, uh... never mention that? Trucy: Oh, so you grew up in... Khura'in?! Wait, are you saying... ...you're not from around here, Polly? Apollo: No, it's just I was raised in Khura'in when I was really little. Trucy: Still, that's a shocker. It's like I hardly know anything about you! How come you never told me?! Dhurke: ...Apollo. You really haven't said a word about your past, have you? Apollo: What, that I was raised by a wanted criminal? It's like a bad joke. Trucy: It does sound rather melodramatic. I doubt anyone would even believe you. So you two haven't seen each other in a while, huh? Apollo: You could say that. I'd wager it's been at least ten years. Trucy: Wow... That's a really long time. Apollo: Yeah, well, I figured he'd forgotten about me. Dhurke: Not a chance! It's just, well... Starting a revolution takes time, and keeping it going even more so... And being a wanted man, I couldn't just hop a plane to come say hello. Apollo: ...I get it. It's fine. (Though, truth be told... ...it's weird having Dhurke suddenly show up acting all paternal. I'd even almost forgotten about Khura'in... No, that's not true. I probably tried to forget about it on purpose.) Trucy: Now then, Mr. Dhurke, what is it we can help you with? Request (appears after \"Foster father\") Dhurke: I need to get my hand on the Founder's Orb, the most sacred treasure of Khura'in. That's where you come in. Apollo: The Founder's Orb? Trucy: Wait, but didn't you say you already have it in that broadcast of yours? Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Don't go believing everything you see on TV, little lady. No one's seen hide nor hair of the Founder's Orb for some time. Trucy: No way! Apollo: S-So that was just a bluff...? What are you going to do if you DON'T find it? Dhurke: I don't know. Guess that just means we HAVE to find it, son. 'Cause I can't really back down now, can I? Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (*sigh* Different year, same old Dhurke. It's all coming back to me now.) Hold on. I think I read something about this in the newspaper a while back. Something about you stealing a sacred treasure from a temple's treasure room. Dhurke: That's a load of crock. We didn't lay a finger on the orb. Apollo: Really? Dhurke: Yes, Baseless allegations, all of it. Our enemy has really found a way to keep us all on our toes. Trucy: Ooh! So it's like a setup! Dhurke: That's the long and short of it. However, my compatriot has been hot on the orb's trail. And just the other day, his hard work finally paid off. We now know the Founder's Orb is in... Kurain Village. Apollo: Kurain Village? Dhurke: Yes. I hear there are spirit mediums there. They even have direct relations with Khura'in. Apollo: Spirit mediums... Right... Dhurke: Some doctor of archeology there supposedly has the orb. His name is Archie Buff. My Defiant Dragon compatriot has already made contact with him. Apparently, someone asked the doctor to study the orb. Apollo: So whoever asked him to do that is the real thief? Dhurke: Most likely. Apollo: And you think this guy will just hand the orb over to you? Dhurke: My compatriot, Datz, says Dr. Buff has already promised to do so. It seems he knew it was stolen, and wanted to do the right thing. Apollo: (Datz... I remember running around him when I was a kid.) (So he's here, too, huh.) Dhurke: Apollo, I want you to be present as my lawyer when I take possession of the orb. Would you do that for me? Fine Leads to: \".........Fine, but I'll charge my standard fee.\" Nope Apollo: I haven't seen you in years, and you waltz in here asking for a favor? You have a lot of nerve, you know-- Trucy: Of course we'll help! Right, Apollo?! Apollo: W-Wait, Trucy...! Trucy: Oh, come on. It's not like you have any work anyway. Besides, we're talking about rebels and legendary treasure here. It'll be fun! Apollo: (*sigh* Why is she always into the things I'm not?) Leads to: \".........Fine, but I'll charge my standard fee.\" Apollo: .........Fine, but I'll charge my standard fee. Now tell me about the Founder's Orb. The Founder's Orb (appears after \"Request\") Apollo: If I remember correctly, the founder is always depicted as a faceless spirit medium. Trucy: What do you mean \"faceless\"? Dhurke: Images of the founder, the Holy Mother of Khura'in, never show her face. To depict it is to commit the greatest taboo in Khura'inism. Apollo: The greatest taboo, huh? (I wonder why? I mean, what could she have looked like to make them hide her face like that? Dhurke: As for the Founder's Orb, it was discovered during an excavation eight years ago... ...and has an interesting legend that goes along with it. It's said that there's a riddle to the orb, and that any who can solve it... ...will receive immense spiritual power from the founder herself. Apollo: Sounds like one big fairy tale to me. Dhurke: In any case... ...it's just what us Defiant Dragons need to get our revolution started. With it, we can gain the spiritual power, and thus, the legal authority to rule Khura'in! Apollo: Wait, suppose I believe this legend. Then, anyone could become king or queen? And THAT'S why you think it'll help you overthrow the Gar'an regime? Dhurke: Only the rulers of Khura'in have ever laid eyes on the orb, Apollo. A legendary treasure that bestows immense spiritual power... Doesn't that sound like something you'd want to see with your own two eyes? Apollo: (...That does sound just a tiny bit intriguing.) Founder's Orb added to the Court Record. Dhurke: That should just about cover everything. Any other questions? Apollo: Not right now. Dhurke: Ah, I almost forgot. I brought you a present. Eat up, son! Apollo: ...Sushi? Dhurke: I figured you probably couldn't afford three square meals a day, so... Trucy: Yay! I was just thinking it was time for lunch! Dhurke: You dig in, too, little lady. After all, we're practically family, right?! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Trucy: Thanks, Dad! Ooh, that tuna looks good! *chomp* *nom nom nom* Dhurke: This salmon sushi's got my name on it! *chomp* *chew chew chew* Aren't you hungry, son? This is some of the best sushi you'll ever have! Apollo: .........I'm... I'm good. Dhurke: O-Oh, well... Okay then. ...Actually, I have one more present for you. Here. Apollo: What's this? Dhurke: A picture of your father. It's been twenty-three years since he passed away. Apollo: Huh?! This... This is my father? Dhurke: His name was Jove Justice. Apollo: Jove... Dhurke: I haven't talked to you about your real father in some time, but as you know... ...he was a musician -- a wandering minstrel, if you will -- and a talented one at that. Apollo: ............ Why... Why are you giving this to me now? Dhurke: I thought it was sad you didn't know what your old man looked like. I searched high and low to find that one picture. Apollo: ............ Trucy: What's wrong, Apollo? Don't you want it? Apollo: (I don't know. I mean, it's not like I ever met the guy.) Dhurke: Well, I went through all the trouble of finding it, so go on, take it! And don't ever let it go, you hear? Photo of My Father added to the Court Record. Dhurke: Well, now that our bellies are full, what do you say we hit the road? Apollo: One second. Hey, Trucy, any idea where Athena is? Trucy: She left early this morning to pick up Daddy from the airport. Apollo: Oh, I almost forgot. Mr. Wright is coming back today. Trucy: Yeah... but I wonder why he cut his trip short like that. Anyway, shouldn't they have been back by now? Apollo: Knowing Athena, she probably got lost. Well, there's no point sitting around here waiting. Let's get going. Trucy: I can't wait to see that super mysterious treasure! Dhurke: To Kurain Village, then! The Founder's Orb awaits! The Founder's Orb (subsequent times) Apollo: If I remember correctly, the founder is always depicted as a faceless spirit medium. Trucy: What do you mean \"faceless\"? Dhurke: Images of the founder, the Holy Mother of Khura'in, never show her face. To depict it is to commit the greatest taboo in Khura'inism. Apollo: The greatest taboo, huh? (I wonder why? I mean, what could she have looked like to make them hide her face like that? Dhurke: As for the Founder's Orb, it was discovered during an excavation eight years ago... ...and has an interesting legend that goes along with it. It's said that there's a riddle to the orb, and that any who can solve it... ...will receive immense spiritual power from the founder herself. Apollo: Sounds like one big fairy tale to me. Dhurke: In any case... ...it's just what us Defiant Dragons need to get our revolution started. With it, we can gain the spiritual power, and thus, the legal authority to rule Khura'in! Apollo: Wait, suppose I believe this legend. Then, anyone could become king or queen? And THAT'S why you think it'll help you overthrow the Gar'an regime? Dhurke: Only the rulers of Khura'in have ever laid eyes on the orb, Apollo. A legendary treasure that bestows immense spiritual power... Doesn't that sound like something you'd want to see with your own two eyes? Apollo: (...That does sound just a tiny bit intriguing.) Present Attorney's Badge Dhurke: What's that? Apollo: It's my attorney's badge. Dhurke: I can relate. I used to want to show mine off, too. But don't ever show it to anyone in Khura'in. They'll run you right out of town the moment they find out you're a lawyer. Apollo: I wonder how it went for Mr. Wright. Knowing him, he probably flashed his left and right... Founder's Orb Dhurke: The Founder's Orb... They say the Holy Mother will return when the riddle of the orb is solved. And she will bestow great spiritual power upon whoever accomplishes that feat. Apollo: (I wonder if I could channel spirits if I had such power.) Photo of My Father Dhurke: Brings back memories... He was a fine young man. So cheerful and fun to be around. His big, booming singing voice would captivate everyone in the tavern. But looks-wise, he was like a grownup version of you. Apollo: Um, that still doesn't give me a sense of what my real father was like. After clearing \"The Founder's Orb\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency: May 16Kurain Village Apollo: (So this is Kurain, the mystical village of spirit channeling... ... and where ancient traditions come alive. Looks like a really peaceful place.) Dhurke: Ahh, I love the air here! Nothing beats the mountains, huh, Apollo?! Apollo: (Come to think of it... We used to live way up in the mountains, too, just like this.) Dhurke: Sure brings back memories. Those were the days. The three of us living happily in peace. Trucy: ...I still can't wrap my mind around it all, you know. That Mr. Dhurke is not only Polly's daddy, but Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's as well. And the way you two talked about it like it was nothing the whole bus ride here! Apollo: (I guess it IS a lot to take in...) Trucy: So tell me, Mr. Dhurke, what was Apollo like as a kid? Dhurke: Oh, he was full of piss and vinegar, he was. A real rascal! He and Nahyuta used to run around in the open fields, naked as jaybirds. I've even got pictures of him posing in his birthday suit! Apollo: Whoa, whoa, Dhurke! Trucy: No way! Prosecutor Sahdmadhi used to be like that, too? Dhurke: The two of 'em would end up with leeches on their butts and cry like babies, hah-ha ha! Apollo: Dhurke! Don't you think you've said enough?! Dhurke: Aw, you're no fun. Trucy: Yeah! I wanted to hear more about the misadventures of Polly! ???: Hey, what are you people doing here? Apollo: Ema? Dhurke: You know this lady, son? Apollo: Yeah, this is Ema Skye. She's a detective. Ema: Technically speaking, I'm a forensics expert, but I'll let it slide. ...Anyway, I can't say I'm surprised to see you here. You always seem to pop up whenever there's trouble afoot. Still, what are the odds of running into you here in the boonies? Apollo: By \"trouble,\" you mean you're investigating a case? Ema: Does it look like I'm here to sightsee? .........Wait, don't tell me... You're not here to see Dr. Buff, are you? Apollo: Huh? How'd you know that? We're actually on our way to meet with him right now. Ema: Figures... Well, follow me. I'll show you the way. Apollo: ...Really? Dhurke: Don't look a gift horse in the mouth, son. Just follow the nice lady. Examine Phone booth Apollo: (A phone booth and a bus stop made of wood. They both look really old. You hardly ever see phone booths in the city anymore.) Dhurke: Apollo... what's this glass box for? Apollo: (I guess you hardly see them in Khura'in, too.) Kurain Boulder Apollo: There's a big boulder towering into the sky over there. According to the sign, it's called the \"Kurain Boulder.\" It also says that a spirit dwells within it. Hmm... A rock with a spirit in it? Dhurke: It's called animism -- the belief that spirits dwell within inanimate objects. They've probably enshrined this boulder as a sacred object. Their tradition of worshiping such objects is similar to our tradition in Khura'in. Apollo: I-Interesting... (Who knew Dhurke could make sense every once in a while?) Mountains Dhurke: Seeing those mountains really takes me back. I remember when we used to live high in the mountains to escape from the government. Apollo: So, you don't live there anymore? Dhurke: Nope. I needed a more convenient place to lead the revolution from. But that old mountain hut is still there. Apollo: (Man, I miss that hut...) Dhurke: What, are you getting homesick, Apollo? You can come on back to Khura'in anytime, you know? Apollo: N-No, no, I'm fine. Besides, I've got a lot on my plate here... Fey Manor Apollo: A thatched roof... First time I've ever seen one in real life. Dhurke: It looks just like the traditional thatched roofs they use in Japan. All we need now are some samurai with topknots, a few ninjas, and a cuddly mascot. Apollo: When was the last time you were in Japan? Talk Any ideas? Dhurke: Mass transit and electronic communications... This country's infrastructure is really advanced compared to Khura'in. Apollo: Why don't you see the sights once you have the orb? Dhurke: Well... I guess I could use a break. How about you show me around? Apollo: ...Oh, um, I'll probably be busy with work, so, uh... Dhurke: ...I-I see. Trucy: What are you talking about, Polly? Your only work right now is cleaning the office. What to do Dhurke: The Founder's Orb should be with the doctor right now. What do you say we go take a gander? Apollo: What if he doesn't have it? What if you came all the way from Khura'in for nothing? Dhurke: I'll cross that bridge if and when I come to it. Besides... even if I leave empty-handed, at least I got to see you, son. Apollo: ...Oh, ha ha. Thanks? Dhurke: N-No, no -- I really mean it. May 16Kurain Village - Doctor's Study Apollo: So this is Dr. Buff's study... Trucy: Wow, look at all those books! The shelves go from floor to ceiling! It's like a library in here! Dhurke: Yes, and lots of artifacts, too. A true archeologist's paradise. Look, son! There are so many relics, they're spilling onto the floor! What a delightfully amusing room! Apollo: All I see is a mess. (And what's with that white outline...?) ...Um, Ema, where's the doctor? Ema: Well the thing is... he died last night. Apollo: Wait, what? Ema: It seems an avalanche of books knocked him off his bookshelf ladder. We're labeling it an accidental death. Apollo: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Please tell me you're joking... Ema: As if I'd come all the way out here for a few laughs, Apollo. Apollo: ...Yeah, I guess not. Dhurke: A scholar killed by his own books... Apollo: Oh man. What do we do now? I mean, how can he transfer ownership of the orb to you if he's dead? Dhurke: Yes, that is a problem. Apollo: Ema, can you please tell us exactly what happened? Examine Ema: What do you think you're doing? You can't just poke around without my permission. Apollo: (Guess I should ask her what's going on first.) Talk The doctor's death Apollo: So the doctor died in an accident? Ema: I received a call this morning saying Dr. Buff had been found dead under a pile of books. Apollo: This morning? (Talk about bad timing...) You mentioned that he had fallen off a ladder. Ema: Right. We believe he fell from the top of that big ladder there. Apparently, he triggered an avalanche of books while fumbling to reach one. And that sent him headlong on a fatal fall onto the hard floor. Trucy: How sad... Killed by his own books. But at least he was doing something he loved. Dhurke: For a scholar, I suppose it's kind of like a soldier killed in the line of duty. You could say he died an honorable death. Apollo: Ema, who was the first one to discover the body? Ema: About that... Whoever it was, it seems they wanted to remain anonymous. Apollo: What? Ema: It happens now and then. Some people would rather not get involved with the police. Dhurke: I can relate to that. Apollo: (Yeah, being a wanted man and all.) What now, Dhurke? A dead man can't exactly hand over the orb. Dhurke: We'll just have to find it. It must be around here somewhere. Apollo: Just to fill you in, Ema, we're actually here to get something. The Founder's Orb (appears after \"The doctor's death\") Apollo: Pops here had an agreement with the doctor. The doctor was supposed to hand over a sacred relic known as the Founder's Orb. Dhurke: \"P-Pops\"...? Ema: Oh, I see. That could be a problem, considering he's dead. Do you have a plan B? Apollo: Umm... Dhurke: I have an agreement in writing. My compatriot Datz should have it. Ema: Well, there shouldn't be any problems, then. So, who IS this gentleman you're escorting? Dhurke (appears after \"The Founder's Orb\") Leads to: \"Oh, right, I haven't introduced you yet. This is Dhurke. He's from the Kingdom of Khura'in.\" Present Attorney's Badge Ema: Your attorney's badge? Huh... Apollo: What, that normally gets a better reaction from you. Ema: I'm tired of collecting your fingerprints. It's kind of lost its luster. Apollo: Yeah, but who knows? There could be other people's prints on it. Ema: Ooh, that's true! Hand it over, buddy! Apollo: Ah! Ema: ............Hmph. The only prints I found were yours. Apollo: (Argh, it's all dusty now.) Founder's Orb Ema: Scientifically speaking, ancient relics are highly fascinating. Apollo: Why's that? Ema: Because of all the tests I can run. CT scans, electron microscopy, chemical analysis... The list goes on and on! If you ever do find one, you'd better bring it to me straight away! Apollo: Can I count on getting it back intact? Ema: We'll see. Scientific advances don't come without sacrifices, you know. Apollo: (...I know someone who WON'T be seeing the orb anytime soon.) Anything else Ema: You sure like to shove things in people's faces, don't you? Apollo: What about you? You're always dusting around for prints. Ema: That's my job! Apollo: Well, it's not like I'm presenting evidence for the fun of it, either. Ema: Really? Because it sure seems like you enjoy it, Apollo. Apollo: Right back at you, Ema. Apollo: Oh, right, I haven't introduced you yet. This is Dhurke. He's from the Kingdom of Khura'in. Ema: All the way from Khura'in, huh? So, what do you do there? Dhurke: I used to practice law, but I'm taking a break from all that. I'm focused now on making Khura'in a better place through... volunteer work. Ema: Volunteer work, huh? How interesting... Apollo: (...Well, it's not technically a lie.) Ema: So, how do you two know each other? Apollo: Oh, um... He's sorta my foster father. Ema: Come again? Trucy: Yeah! And he's Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's real father, too! Ema: Whaaat?! You mean you... and Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... ............I'm so sorry. It seems you've had quite a life. Apollo: (...Guess she's put a few things together.) Ema: Actually, Dhurke, you look kind of... familiar. Have we met before? Dhurke: Um, not that I recall. Apollo: (Great... She must've seen that news report on TV. It will really complicate things if she figures out he's a wanted man.) There are lots of guys who look like him. Sure you're not mistaking him for someone else? Ema: Are there, really? I mean, a middle-aged man with long hair and an eye patch? You don't see that every day. Apollo: W-Well, I'm sure you're just imagining things. Ema: So what does that sacred relic you're searching for look like? I mean, there's lots of stuff in here that's old and relic-y. Dhurke: Indeed. Unfortunately, I've no idea what it actually looks like. Apollo: So then, how are we supposed to find it? Dhurke: That, I do not know, either. We'll just have to go through each candidate one by one. Apollo: Great plan of attack there, Dhurke. Well, Ema, do you mind if we give this room a once-over? Ema: ...I guess not. But in exchange, you're going to help me in my investigation. Apollo: Sure. It can't hurt. Trucy: Ooh, I can't wait to get started! It'll be like hunting for buried treasure! Examine Body outline or pile of books Apollo: So this is where Dr. Buff died. Ema: Poor man... He fell right on his head, and probably died almost instantly. Apollo: I see some blood on the book there, but what's that dark stain? Ema: It appears to be coffee. It's still damp, so it must have gotten on there recently, perhaps even last night. Dhurke: That's a mighty big window he's next to -- big enough for someone to see inside. Ema: Exactly. That's how the local resident who reported his death found him to begin with. The doctor's body was visible from outside the window. And a passerby called in earlier this morning to report what they'd found. Apollo: So you mean this case is still only a few hours old? Dhurke: That explains why your investigation is just getting underway. Study Photo added to the Court Record. Study Diagram added to the Court Record. Body outline or pile of books (subsequent times) Apollo: So this is where Dr. Buff died. Dhurke: Yeah, the police received a call this morning... ...so their investigation is still just getting started. Glasses Apollo: There's a pair of glasses on this little pyramid here. Ema: They belonged to the doctor. Scientifically speaking, they appear to be your ordinary run-of-the-mill glasses. Trucy: I guess they don't pique her interest, scientifically speaking. Computer Apollo: This PC is password protected. Trucy, you think your magic can do something about this? Trucy: Hmm... I don't think it can override a password. Now, a locked desk... That I can get into. Like yours back at the office, Polly! Apollo: (Yikes... I'd better watch what I put in there.) Trucy: What? Do you put weird stuff in your desk? Stuff you don't want anyone to see? Apollo: Jeez, are you a mind reader, too? Trucy: No, but unlocking your thoughts is a cinch! Ladder or bookshelves Apollo: The doctor fell from the top of that ladder. Dhurke: Hmm... From that height, a fall onto a hard surface would probably kill anyone. Apollo: I don't know why anyone would want to climb that high in the first place. Trucy: Guess you can say he climbed it all the way to heaven... Raincoat Apollo: It's a two-tone raincoat. Dhurke: It's still a bit damp. I think someone might've worn it recently. Shoe shelves Apollo: There are a few pairs of shoes here. I guess there must be an entrance on this floor, too. Ema: Yeah, there's a backdoor over that way. But it's usually locked from what I can tell. The visitor's entrance is up that spiral staircase. Apollo: (That's the way we came in.) Geoglyph Apollo: There are animal drawings on the floor. They look like those famous geoglyph things. Dhurke: They remind me of the chalk outlines detectives draw around bodies. And the doctor's has [sic] just joined them. Now that's what I call dedication to one's field. Apollo: I don't think it was on purpose. Window Apollo: What a huge window. I bet you could see the entire study from the outside. Dhurke: How could he concentrate in here? I'd feel so exposed. Apollo: Well... He does have a bookshelf positioned for some privacy around his desk. Mechanical statue Dhurke: There's some sort of machinery inside this clay figure. Apollo: Whoa, it's moving! EX-TER-MI-NATE. EX-TER-MI-NATE. DES-TROY ALL TAR-GETS. EX-T-T-TERRRrrr... *scrape* *grind* Apollo: D-Do I even want to know what that thing is for?! Notebook Apollo: Look, it's one of the doctor's notebooks. Dhurke: Maybe there's something about the orb in there. It's a photo of the treasure box! The one from Tehm'pul Temple's treasure room. These must be his research notes on the Founder's Orb. Apollo: What's that on the right page? It looks like a poem or something. Dhurke: Let's see... Oh, it's the song that's performed during the Dance of Devotion. It's been sung during Khura'inese rites of offering since ancient times. Apollo: Oh, I think I've heard of that. Dhurke: There's also a legend associated with the song. Some say the solution to the orb's riddle is contained therein. Apollo: It's a song everyone in Khura'in knows? Not much of a way to keep it secret. Trucy: It's called \"hiding secrets in plain sight,\" Polly. Us magicians know all about that. Dhurke: Huh. That's strange. Apollo: What is? Dhurke: Dr. Buff's notes contain the second half of the song. Only the first half is sung during the Dance of Devotion. Most people haven't even heard the second half. Apollo: The second half? As in the part that begins, \"Offer thy prayers\"? Dhurke: I'm impressed. That's some thorough research he was conducting. Research Notes added to the Court Record. Model plane Apollo: Is this a bird? Dhurke: It looks like an airplane to me. Apollo: No, there couldn't have been any planes back when this was made. Dhurke: Yes, but it has wings and both horizontal and vertical stabilizers. That makes it an airplane. Apollo: No, it's definitely a bird. Dhurke: Open your eyes, son... As a lawyer, your job is to see the true nature of things. Apollo: (I still say it's a bird.) Misty Fey scroll Apollo: There's a brown stain on this scroll. Hm? Why does it smell like... gravy? Dhurke: Why would there be a gravy stain on it? Apollo: Who knows? But it looks like it's meant to be there. Dhurke: Maybe the artist was trying to inspire a \"gravy\" new trend: food splatter art. Apollo: That pun wounded me \"gravy-ly,\" Dhurke. Coffee machine Apollo: A coffeemaker and a bunch of coffee cups... He must've taken his coffee breaks here. Oh, and there's a filter with old coffee grounds in here. *sigh* Guess I'd better clean this up. Dhurke: What are you doing there, son? Apollo: Ah! (What AM I doing, cleaning this office?!) Dhurke: Don't tell me they have you on coffee duty back at your office. Apollo: N-No, no... It's just, if I don't keep the place clean, no one will. Ami Fey statue Apollo: It's a golden statue. Looks pretty old, too. Dhurke: Hmm... I imagine it has great archeological value... Maybe too great for a private researcher of Dr. Buff's caliber. Apollo: I wonder how he got his hands on something like this. Sacred Urn Apollo: \"Ami\"... Hmm... Why's someone's name written on here? Trucy: Maybe it's so if it ever got lost, someone could return it to its owner. You know, like how school kids put their names on things. Apollo: Yeah, but this is just an urn. And the name is written so big. Trucy: Well, I wrote my name on my magic panties. It says W-R-I-G-H-T in super big letters! Apollo: (The less said about this, the better.) Spiral staircase Apollo: It's a spiral staircase... And it's connected to a hallway up there. Why'd they have to place the second floor so high up? Ema: Wait... You're not afraid of heights, are you? Apollo: Oh, um... Well... Trucy: Oh, Polly's hilarious around high places. He gets all wobbly, like a baby deer taking its first steps. And his face turns as green as a watermelon. Apollo: It's not nice to make fun of people's phobias, you know. Dhurke: Come to think of it, the visitor's entrance is on the second floor. What an odd layout for a house... Wall relief Apollo: What a huge wall relief. Hmm... It seems to depict a spirit channeling. Dhurke: Hey... this spirit medium looks like the Holy Mother of Khura'in. Apollo: Yeah, her face was left blank, but the rest is clearly detailed and well-crafted. Dhurke: Did you know some researchers claim that the Holy Mother had three eyes? And that her third eye was able to divine the truth, just like the gods above. It is said to be on her forehead. Apollo: Like you said, you shouldn't believe everything you hear. Suitcase Apollo: That's one big suitcase. Dhurke: It's locked. Is it the doctor's? Ema: No, someone left it here last night. Apollo: So the doctor might've had a visitor? But how can you tell? Ema: That sticker there. You only see those on airport luggage. Which means, its owner is likely from overseas. Dhurke: Is there any way to figure out who it belongs to? Apollo: Not unless we can open it to see what's inside. Dhurke: Guess not... ???: Heh heh heh. Ah-ha ha ha! Ema: That's because you're not me: Ema Skye, forensics expert extraordinaire! Try as you might, you won't find the word \"impossible\" in my forensics handbook! Dhurke: I-Is she okay, son? It's like she became an entirely different person. Apollo: Oh, that's just what happens when her forensics switch gets flipped. Ema: With this, identifying the suitcase's owner will be easy as pie! Apollo: Is that fingerprint powder? Ema: That's right. And there's no better time than the present to use it! Here we go! You remember how to do this, right? Apollo: I apply the powder to where I think some prints might be, and blow any excess off? Ema: Exactly. Well, have at it! Apollo: (Hmm... Now where would I expect to find prints on a suitcase?) Examine any fingerprint on stickers closest to keyhole Leads to: \"Hey Ema, I've got a pretty clear print here.\" Examine any fingerprint on handle Ema: This one isn't clear enough for a match. Apollo: Hmm... Where else could someone leave prints behind? Dhurke: Think, son. How might someone handle a suitcase? Start by considering what you do with them. Apollo: Well, besides being wheeled or carried, they can be opened and closed. So, I should look for prints that would be left at those times. Examine any incomplete fingerprint Ema: You'll need to use more powder than that to get a clear print. Examine excess powder Ema: There's still too much powder left. Try blowing some more off. Apollo: Hey Ema, I've got a pretty clear print here. Ema: Okay, now let me know who you think it could belong to. Apollo: (Hmm, who could it be? It would have to be someone who would've paid Dr. Buff a visit.) Compare Datz Are'bal profile Analyzing...Analysis CompleteMatch Found Leads to: \"We have a match!\" Compare anyone else Analyzing...No Match Found Ema: We didn't get a match. Trucy: Any other ideas, Apollo? Apollo: Hmm... Well, we can probably assume the print belongs to the suitcase's owner. (But who could that be? It would have to be someone who would've visited the doctor.) Leads back to profile selection Ema: We have a match! Apollo: Datz... Come to think of it, he did stop by to see the doctor, didn't he? To conclude the orb transfer agreement. Dhurke: So he's the one who forgot his suitcase here. Apollo: Where do you suppose he is now? Dhurke: Haven't heard from him in a while, and he's not answering his phone. Trucy: Wait, you don't think he left his phone inside his suitcase, do you? Dhurke: I wouldn't put it past that knucklehead. Ema: Actually, I think we may have run into him earlier. Apollo: Really? Ema: A suspicious man had been reported in the area, but when one of my officers approached to question him, he took off like a shot. Apollo: What?! Dhurke: Sorry about that. Khura'inese people aren't all like him... I swear. Ema: Well, he's probably still in the village somewhere. Apollo: Maybe he knows something about the orb. Suitcase (subsequent times) Apollo: So this suitcase belongs to Datz. Dhurke: How could he leave something so big behind? Apollo: Because, you know... it's Datz. Talk Dhurke Apollo: Oh, right, I haven't introduced you yet. This is Dhurke. He's from the Kingdom of Khura'in. Ema: All the way from Khura'in, huh? So, what do you do there? Dhurke: I used to practice law, but I'm taking a break from all that. I'm focused now on making Khura'in a better place through... volunteer work. Ema: Volunteer work, huh? How interesting... Apollo: (...Well, it's not technically a lie.) Ema: So, how do you two know each other? Apollo: Oh, um... He's sorta my foster father. Ema: Come again? Trucy: Yeah! And he's Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's real father, too! Ema: Whaaat?! You mean you... and Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... ............I'm so sorry. It seems you've had quite a life. Apollo: (...Guess she's put a few things together.) Ema: Actually, Dhurke, you look kind of... familiar. Have we met before? Dhurke: Um, not that I recall. Apollo: (Great... She must've seen that news report on TV. It will really complicate things if she figures out he's a wanted man.) There are lots of guys who look like him. Sure you're not mistaking him for someone else? Ema: Are there, really? I mean, a middle-aged man with long hair and an eye patch? You don't see that every day. Apollo: W-Well, I'm sure you're just imagining things. Present Study Photo Ema: Maybe it was Dr. Buff's wish to die under a pile of his beloved books. I know I could die happily under a big pile of forensic equipment. Apollo: Well, I'll pass on dying under a big pile of evidence from my past cases. It's all murder weapons and photos of dead bodies. Ema: So, what? Are you saying you don't love your job? Apollo: Being buried in the tools of one's trade is hardly a valid way to assess dedication, Ema. After examining body outline or pile of books, ladder or bookshelves, notebook, Sacred Urn, spiral staircase, and suitcase: Dhurke: It seems the orb isn't here. Apollo: That means Datz might be our only lead at this point. Dhurke: Detective Skye said he might still be here in the village. We should try to find him. May 16Kurain Village ???: Good day to you, citizens of Kurain Village! My name is Paul Atishon, and I want your vote! Apollo: Wow, that's REALLY loud. Trucy: Look, something's coming this way. ???: Paul Atishon, savior of Kurain, has come to-- Ahhh! It's you people! Dhurke: Apollo? What is that strange conveyance coming this way? Staff: Right, left, right, left, HALT! Apollo: (It's one of those... what-do-you-call-'ems? Palanquins...?) ???: So, you finally left Dr. Buff's house! What were you doing there?! ...What a bunch of shady-looking characters. Apollo: (And you aren't?) So I take it you knew the doctor? ???: Heh, what a foolish question. I've memorized the names and faces of the entire electorate here in Kurain. After all, I am the man who's destined to be king of this fine nation someday. Apollo: Um... who are you? (And what do you mean, \"king\"?) Atishon: Ignorant fools. I am THE Paul Atishon. I am a soon-to-be eminent politician -- a man whose name will go down in history. You should be ashamed that you've never heard of me before. Dhurke: Is he really that famous of a politician, Apollo? Apollo: Not that I know of. Atishon: I'm running for a seat on the local council right now. Apollo: (I guess even Jerk Q. Public has to start somewhere.) Atishon: But my election is a sure thing, I'm told. After all, my grandfather was a famous politician with untold influence. In short, I'm the chosen one, the golden boy, the powerhouse of politics! Trucy: ...And rider-of-his-grandfather's-coattails. Atishon: Heh heh heh. Are you blinded by my majesty? Go ahead! Bask in the resplendent glory that is me, the chosen one! Apollo: Um... Sure... Atishon: ...Ah! A pleasant day to you, good people of Kurain! I am Paul Atishon! It's time to reclaim the glory of Kurain, together! A convenience store on every corner, a karaoke bar in every home! A vote for Paul Atishon is a vote for a happier, hopey-er Kurain Village! Old Man: Turn off that infernal racket, you fool! You're a stain on your grandfather's good name! Atishon: Thank you, good sir! Your support is appreciated, as always! Trucy: I guess he's one of those people who only hears what they want to hear. Apollo: ...In other words, he's a model politician. Atishon: Now where was I? Oh right, you were in the doctor's house. Just what in the world were you doing in there? Hmm? Talk Paul Atishon Apollo: Is this what you ride around in when you're campaigning? Atishon: That's right. It's perfect for the narrow roads and steep hills here in this village. It has a top speed of five miles per hour, but it suffers from serious reliability issues. (Changed from [It has a top speed of 5 miles per hour, but it suffers from serious reliability issues.] in the original release) Namely, these imbeciles tire out too quickly. Staff: *cough* *huff, puff* We'll try harder next time, sir! Apollo: (Poor guys... They're exhausted and covered in sweat.) Atishon: The Atishon family has been in politics for generations, even back in the old country. Apollo: Really? Atishon: My grandfather, Abe Atishon, was a prominent member of Congress. And he was born right here in Kurain. There isn't a person here who hasn't heard of him. Apollo: (All I asked about was his palanquin.) Atishon: You must've heard of the Atishons. I'm even reviving our old country campaigning style. Apollo: ...Oh, um... politics aren't really my thing. Trucy? Trucy: I don't recall ever reading about them at school. Atishon: Feh... Young people today. You people really need to pay more attention to politics. The doctor's house Atishon: So, what business did you people have at Dr. Buff's house? Apollo: He was going to transfer ownership of the Founder's Orb to us. It's a sacred relic from the Kingdom of Khura'in. Atishon: The Founder's Orb? So you tried to get your hands on it, did you? Apollo: Wait, what do you know about the orb? Atishon: Heh. I know that it's mine, that's what. Apollo: How do you figure that? Atishon: Because I know it's not the Founder's Orb. Its real name is the Crystal of Ami Fey. Apollo: The Crystal of Ami Fey? Atishon: That's right. It's been passed down for generations in the Atishon family. Until it was stolen, that is. But just when I had zeroed in on the culprit... ...the doctor hid it away and then kicked the bucket. Apollo: So you're saying Dr. Buff stole your family heirloom? (That's not what Dhurke said. Strange...) But I've been told the doctor himself said that... ...he had the \"Founder's Orb.\" Atishon: It's all that weird foreigner's doing! He filled the doctor's head with nonsense! Nonsense like the Crystal of Ami Fey being the Founder's Orb. Apollo: \"Weird foreigner\"? (Could he mean...?) Is this the foreigner you're talking about? Present Datz Are'bal profile Apollo: Atishon: Yes, that's him! Apollo: I thought so. (Now we really have to find Datz.) Leads back to Talk options Present anyone else Apollo: Atishon: Who's that? Wait, I know everyone around here, so this must be a new eligible voter for me! Apollo: Yes, wouldn't that be nice. (Because I certainly wouldn't vote for you. It seems this isn't the person he's talking about. But I can't imagine the doctor had contact with that many foreigners way out here.) Leads back to Talk options Datz (appears after presenting Datz Are'bal profile upon selecting \"The doctor's house\" Talk option) Dhurke: Do you know where this man is now? Atishon: I imagine he's at the Detention Center by now. I called the authorities after I found him hiding in my dog's doghouse. Apollo: Whaaat?! Dhurke: That buffoon... Apollo: Well, at least we know where he is now. Dhurke: Let's head over to the Detention Center and see what he knows about the Founder's Orb. Atishon: So, you really are after my crystal. Apollo: No, we're looking for the Founder's Orb, and we have an agreement to prove it. Atishon: Well, just so you know, you're not going to lay a finger on it. It's mine. And I intend to give it to my benefactor. Apollo: Your... benefactor? Your benefactor (appears after \"Datz\") Athison: My benefactor is ready to support my rise to the pinnacle of the political world. They have immense influence here, you see, and I intend to harness that influence. Apollo: So you're just going to give your family heirloom away to this person? Atishon: That's right. It's a purely political decision. Apollo: And in exchange, your patron will get the people of Kurain to vote for you? Atishon: Heh heh heh. Eminent politicians are skilled at leveraging all of their connections. Apollo: ......... (Isn't it illegal to buy votes?) Well, good luck with that, I guess. Atishon: Heh, you just wait. Paul Atishon will reign supreme someday. Present Attorney's Badge Apollo: Actually, I'm a lawyer. Atishon: Heh heh heh. You're so shallow. Relying on your badge to impress people... What would you be without it? I petty men like you have no sense of self. Real men make their own mark in this world. Apollo: (Says the man who's riding on his grandfather's coattails.) Anything else Apollo: What do you think about this? Atishon: Paul Atishon is the \"squeaky-clean candidate.\" So if you're going to bribe me, try to be a little more subtle about it, would you? Apollo: Huh? I wasn't trying to bribe you. Atishon: \"Don't accept any bribes unless they come in unmarked bills.\" This is but a fraction of the political wisdom my grandfather shared with me. Better luck next time. Apollo: (After a spin cycle or two with those bills, I bet I'D be \"squeaky-clean,\" too.) Wright Anything Agency (after examining body outline or pile of books, ladder or bookshelves, notebook, Sacred Urn, spiral staircase, and suitcase in Kurain Village - Doctor's Study, then visiting Kurain Village) Talk Any ideas? Dhurke: About that Paul Atishon fellow... He's aiming to be a councilman and beyond, as his famous grandfather once was, right? No doubt some would vote for him on the merits of his grandfather's achievements. I see a grim future for Kurain Village if someone like that is able to climb the ranks. Apollo: I wouldn't worry about it. Who in their right mind would vote for him with the way he's campaigning? Dhurke: So the more aggressively he campaigns, the less people will want to vote for him? That makes me want to get out there and help him fail. What to do Apollo: We turned the doctor's study upside down, but never found the orb. Dhurke: Yeah, I didn't expect this to be so hard. Trucy: Well, I think it's fun. It's like a big old treasure hunt! Dhurke: That orb is the key to Khura'in's future, you know. Trucy: Yeah, and our office's future, too! Apollo: (She does realize it's not up for sale, right?) Present Anything else Dhurke: Ah, the old show-'em-and-see-what-they-say tactic. I used to try that whenever I had nothing else to say. Apollo: Who says I have nothing else to say? Dhurke: It's written all over your face. Apollo: Like you have anything to add right now. After clearing all Talk options with Paul Atishon in Kurain Village: May 16Detention Center - Visitor's Room Datz: ......... Dhurke: .........Hey. Datz: Yipes! Apollo: What's he doing under the desk...? Datz: Foul cogs of the corrupt regime! I've nothing to say to you! Dhurke: Datz, it's me, Dhurke. Datz: Oh! Dhurke! You're a sight for sore eyes! I knew you'd come save me! Dhurke: Well, this is another fine mess you've gotten yourself into. Datz: Har har har har har! My bad, my bad! 'Least the grub here's pretty good compared to that prison back home! Ya get three squares plus a place to sleep! Why don't ya join me, Dhurke?! Dhurke: No thanks. They'd just send me back to Khura'in where I'd face immediate execution. Datz: Yeah, I guess that wouldn't be such a good idea. Apollo: (Looks like he's still the same, too.) ...Long time no see, Datz. Datz: Huh? Hey, ya look... kinda familiar... A-A-A-Apollo?! Is it really you, m'boy?! A-to-the-J, all grown up and whatnot! How've ya been?! Apollo: Fine. And you, Datz? You look good, besides the incarceration and all. Datz: ...Pffffff! Haaaaar har har har har! Those horns, AJ! Apollo: Horns? Datz: They've grown up with ya, just like a stag's antlers! I can't take it! Apollo: *sigh* You really haven't changed a bit. Anyway, there's something we needed to talk to you about. Datz: Sure, pull up a chair. I've got all the time in the world. The slammer's like my second home. It's really not so bad once ya get used to it. Trucy: He's rather laid back for someone in police custody. Talk About the orb Apollo: Datz, was what the doctor had really the Founder's Orb? Datz: Absolutely positively! The doc was sure of it! Dhurke: Really? Because someone from the village is calling the Crystal of Ami Fey. He also claims you were filling the doctor's head with lies. Datz: That ain't true! The doc said he was sure it was the real deal. All his fancy research confirmed it was the Founder's Orb. Apollo: So then that Paul Atishon character was lying? Imagine that, a politician who lies... Datz: I bet he wants the orb all to himself! Trucy: Hmm... I wonder who's telling the truth? Datz: Well, take a look at this! It proves the doc believed he had the Founder's Orb! Dhurke: Let me see that. \"I agree to hand over the Founder's Orb to the Defiant Dragons... ...if I will come to no harm.\" Signed, Dr. Archie Buff. Datz: See, I got it all down in writing! Dhurke: But Datz... ...why does it say, \"if I will come to no harm\" at the end here? Trucy: Sounds like he was scared of you. Apollo: Datz, did you threaten the doctor in any way? Datz: No, ya got it all wrong! It was the doc's friend! HE told the old man us rebels were dangerous. It's his fault the doc thought I might hurt him! Apollo: Sounds like the work of that politician. He's really made a mess of things. Orb Transfer Agreement added to the Court Record. About the orb (subsequent times) Apollo: Datz, was what the doctor had really the Founder's Orb? Datz: Absolutely positively! The doc was sure of it! Dhurke: Really? Because someone from the village is calling the Crystal of Ami Fey. He also claims you were filling the doctor's head with lies. Datz: That ain't true! The doc said he was sure it was the real deal. All his fancy research confirmed it was the Founder's Orb. Apollo: So then that Paul Atishon character was lying?

Datz: No, ya got it all wrong! It was the doc's friend! HE told the old man us rebels were dangerous. It's his fault the doc thought I might hurt him! Apollo: Sounds like the work of that politician. He's really made a mess of things. Reason for arrest Dhurke: What have you done now, Datz? Datz: Nothing! I'm innocent, I tell ya! It all started when this dog-faced cop tried to question me! He looked so funny, I started laughing at him. That's when they came after me. But it was hilarious, I tell ya! I mean, a human police dog? How funny is that! Apollo: Right... So what happened after that? Datz: They caught me hiding in a doghouse. Dang pooch ratted me out! I guess that's what I get for laughing at one of his doggy comrades. Apollo: Sounds like the dogs got the last laugh. Dhurke: Datz, weren't you cleared of those jailbreak charges? And your capture by Lady Kee'ra deemed unlawful? Datz: Yeah, but... The cops here don't seem to like me anyway. Apollo: What are the charges this time? Datz: Unauthorized entry, or something like that. They think I'm an illegal alien! And I can't prove otherwise 'cause I lost my passport! Trucy: Is there any way they'd let you go? Datz: Not without my passport... If only I had it! Dhurke, AJ! You gotta find my passport! Apollo: ...All right, we'll find it. (One more thing to add to our to-do list. Now, where might Datz's passport be?) Examine Security camera Apollo: I hate the feeling of being constantly watched. Dhurke: Indeed. Considering my current situation, the less I'm seen, the better. Apollo: Well, it's not like there's an international arrest warrant out for you. Dhurke: True, but I seem to have made quite an international splash with that hijacking stunt. I had to sign a ton of autographs and take a load of selfies before I got to your office. Apollo: Wait, what? Dhurke: Maybe they thought the hijacking was part of some movie's promotion. Guard Apollo: He's completely uninterested in us. Dhurke: That suits me fine. It will only complicate things if I'm recognized. Apollo: Right... You're known as some sort of scary terrorist who fled from Khura'in. Though, in reality, no one would believe you're the real Dhurke of legend anyway. Microphone Apollo: Dhurke, why are you holding that mic? Dhurke: I get this strange urge to speak whenever there's a microphone before me. We, the Defiant Dragons, shall--! Apollo: No, stop! Stop...!!! Present Attorney's Badge Datz: Why, AJ! You've become a fine lawyer in your own right! Apollo: Nah, I still have a lot to learn. Datz: Aw, c'mon, don't be so hard on yourself. If I ever went to trial, I'd definitely want you on my side! Apollo: Knowing you, you'd probably skip town before the trial even started. Founder's Orb or Orb Transfer Agreement Datz: The doc agreed in writing to hand the orb over to me, but he kept stalling, like he didn't trust me or something. Dhurke: That scary mug of yours no doubt frightened him. Datz: Look who's talking! Trucy: Honestly, I think you're both about equally scary looking. Apollo: (Ouch... Both Dhurke and Datz look like they've been stabbed right in the ego.) Anything else Datz: Oh, is that for me!? Apollo: No, I was just showing it to you. Datz: Anything I could use here in the slammer is more than welcome! Apollo: Um, Datz, the guard is giving you some serious side eye. After clearing all Talk options: Datz: Oh! About the orb's whereabouts... Maybe the doc's kid knows something! Apollo: The doctor has a kid? Datz: Yeah... A bit of a shut-in, though. The poor thing's own bedroom has become like a self-imposed prison. Apollo: A shut-in? Sounds like it will be a challenge just to get a conversation going. Guard: Time for your questioning. Follow me. Datz: It must be lunchtime. Today is fried chicken, if I'm not mistaken! Guard: You'll get your lunch IF you behave yourself. Datz: Dhurke, AJ. I'll see ya guys around! Dhurke: Our only lead now is Dr. Buff's kid. But luring a shut-in out is... Apollo: ...Not going to be easy. I know. May 16Kurain Village - Doctor's Study ???: Oh, it's you again. Ema Looking for Mr. Wright? He was just here a second ago. Apollo: He was?! Trucy: What was Daddy doing here? Apollo: Good question. Ema: He said he was looking for something. Apollo: Did he say anything else? Ema: Let me think... Something about how his ride never showed up at the airport. Yes, that was it. Apollo: (I guess Athena really did get lost...) Trucy: But what's Daddy doing all the way out here in the first place? He can't be looking for us since no one told him we'd be here. Apollo: Hmm... Ema: Well, if you're here to take another look around, be my guest. I have other work to do, so if you'll excuse me. Apollo: Of course. Thanks, Ema. Dhurke: First and foremost, we'd better find Datz's passport. We should also have a word with Dr. Buff's child. Trucy: Hey, is it just me... or is there something new in here? Dhurke: ...Oh, you mean that thing? Yeah, we should take a closer look at it, too. Apollo: Let's not forget about Datz's passport. It should be around here somewhere. Examine Suitcase Apollo: Datz's suitcase... Maybe his passport's in there. Trucy: Annggh! It's no good. It's locked tight. Apollo: We should've asked him for the key. Drone Apollo: What's this? A model helicopter? Trucy: Don't you know anything, Apollo? It's a drone! They're all the rage right now. I bet it belongs to the doctor's kid. Dhurke: We need to ask them about the orb's whereabouts. Apollo: Yeah, but luring out a shut-in isn't going to be easy. Any other point of interest Apollo: Nothing new here. Let's go look somewhere else. After examining suitcase and drone: Apollo: What are we going to do about Datz's passport? It's probably right there inside his suitcase, but we can't get it open. Trucy: Why don't I take it over to Datz so he can unlock it? That way, you guys can continue looking for the orb. Apollo: Good thinking, Trucy! Trucy: Okay, here I go! ...Huh? What the...? Hrrgh...! This thing weighs a ton! Apollo: Let me try. ............Jeez, how can a suitcase be so heavy? Is it filled with bricks or something? Dhurke: Knowing Datz, he probably packed his dumbbells in there. It's certainly much too heavy to lug all the way to the detention center. Here, let me take a crack at that lock. Apollo: What, are you going to pick it? *click* *click, click* *click* *click* Dhurke: There you go. Apollo: That was fast. Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha! A lock like that is child's play to me. Especially after all the wrongly imprisoned compatriots I've busted out over the years. Apollo: You've sure seen a lot of action for an ex-lawyer. Dhurke: Aaand here we go. Datz's passport. Trucy: I'll take it over to him. Apollo: Thanks, Trucy. Trucy: No problem! Now you guys enjoy some quality father-son treasure hunting time, okay? See you later! Apollo: (There she goes. I wish she wouldn't make such a big deal out of our little \"family\" situation.) Dhurke: Father-son time, eh? Hmm... Been ages since we've had a father-son talk, huh, son? Apollo: Yeah, well over a decade. Dhurke: So, Apollo, um... how've you been? Apollo: Oh, uh... Fine. I'm fine, I guess. Dhurke: Is that so? Fine, you say? Well, fine is fine by me! Good to hear! Apollo: ...Um, okay. .................. Dhurke: ........................... Apollo: ............ (Umm... So what do we talk about now...?) Dhurke: ...Hm? Get down! Hit the dirt, son! Apollo: Huh? What the--? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! .........Unngh......Oof... ......... Dhurke: Speak to me, son! Say something! Apollo: ......Ooh... Th-that smarts... ???: Youuuu maggots! Whattaya think yer doin', invading Buff airspace?! It'll be a scorching day in Siberia before you get past me, ya yellow-bellied yahoos! Apollo: Whoa! ...It can talk?! What kind of drone is this, anyw... ...AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYY! ???: Drone, nothin'! That's Sergeant Buff to you, soldier! You got that, you lowly grunts?! Apollo: Oww... What the who now...?! Dhurke: Buff? Sounds like the doctor's son is behind the controls. Apollo: He's controlling this thing? Dhurke: Apollo, let's play along for now. At least until we can get the information we need out of him. Apollo: G-Got it. Um... Sergeant Buff? Sarge: Sergeant Buff, sir! You forgot to say, \"sir\"! Ain't you never seen a war movie before?! Apollo: Oh, right. Let me try that again. Sergeant Buff, sir! Sarge: Better. Much better. Now, state your name, unit, and rank, soldier! Apollo: Oh, um, I'm Apollo Justice. I serve at the Wright Anything Agency. And my rank is, um... fledgling lawyer? ...Sir! Sarge: Affirmative, Private Justice. Apollo: P-Private? Sarge: Listen up, diaper baby! Your commanding officer's orders are absolute! Disobedience means a one-way trip to the firing squad! Do I make myself clear?! Apollo: Oh, um... sir! Yes, sir! Sarge: Good, good, we might make a man out of you yet, private! Now for you, Cyclops! Dhurke: Huh? ...Oh, you want my name, unit, and rank, too? Um, I'm Dhurke Sahdmadhi. I command the rebel group the Defiant Dragons, and my rank is... um... leader, sir! Sarge: Excellent! Welcome aboard, Komandir Dhurke! Wait a second! What's with that ridiculous mop you call a head? Soldiers should be clean cut! Dhurke: S-Sorry, but this is my signature look. I'm not going to-- WHOOOOOOOOOA! Fine, fine! I'll get a haircut before we ship out! Sarge: Listen up, you! It's kill-or-be-killed out on that battlefield. No place for leave-in conditioners. All you've got is your life, and you're lucky to have that! Apollo: (He's oddly obsessed with field survival for someone who never goes outdoors...) Dhurke: This is going to be harder than I thought, son. Examine Anything Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Sarge: Don't let me catch you stepping out of line again. Apollo: (...Guess I'd better play along and ask what he wants.) Talk Sergeant Buff Apollo: Um, are you controlling that drone from your room, sir? Sarge: Affirmative! But I can see everything you do from here, so... Teeen-HUT, soldier! Wipe that stupid look off your face! I'm going to whip you sheltered peaceniks into shape! Apollo: (With what? Your \"charming\" personality?) Dhurke: Look, it's got a camera and speakers, too. Sarge: And that's not all, Komandir! With these arms, I can cook and clean, too! Speaking of which... Private Justice! You're on latrine duty! Snap to it, on the double! Apollo: ...*sigh*... As if I don't see enough of the toilet back at the office. Sarge's Drone added to the Court Record. Dhurke: That thing's pretty handy. Us Defiant Dragons could use one of those. Sarge: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Yes, it is a fine piece of hardware, isn't it? I modified it especially for siege defense! Apollo: Siege defense...? You mean how you won't leave your room? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! Sarge: Holing up in a stronghold to defend against an enemy is an age-old military tactic! A timeless strategy still applicable in modern warfare! I hope you're not trying to mock the wisdom of my forefathers! Apollo: I-I... I meant no offense. It was just an observation. Sarge: So the greenhorn who ain't even discharged a firearm's got something to say, does he?! Apollo: S-Sorry, sorry! It won't happen again, sir! Sarge: Darn tootin'. Now, state your intentions, soldier. Sergeant Buff (subsequent times) Apollo: Um, are you controlling that drone from your room, sir? Sarge: Affirmative! But I can see everything you do from here, so... Teeen-HUT, soldier! Wipe that stupid look off your face! I'm going to whip you sheltered peaceniks into shape! Apollo: (With what? Your \"charming\" personality?) Dhurke: Look, it's got a camera and speakers, too. Sarge: And that's not all, Komandir! With these arms, I can cook and clean, too! Speaking of which... Private Justice! You're on latrine duty! Snap to it, on the double! Apollo: ...*sigh*... As if I don't see enough of the toilet back at the office. Dhurke: That thing's pretty handy. Us Defiant Dragons could use one of those. Sarge: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Yes, it is a fine piece of hardware, isn't it? I modified it especially for siege defense! Apollo: Siege defense...? You mean how you won't leave your room? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! Sarge: Holing up in a stronghold to defend against an enemy is an age-old military tactic! A timeless strategy still applicable in modern warfare! I hope you're not trying to mock the wisdom of my forefathers! Apollo: I-I... I meant no offense. It was just an observation. Sarge: So the greenhorn who ain't even discharged a firearm's got something to say, does he?! Apollo: S-Sorry, sorry! It won't happen again, sir! Sarge: Darn tootin'. Now, state your intentions, soldier. Location of the orb (appears after \"Sergeant Buff\") Apollo: We had an agreement with your father. He had promised to hand over the Founder's Orb to us. Sarge: What?! Papa promised you that?! Dhurke: He did. But he died before he could tell us where it's hidden. Now we have no idea where it is. Sarge: .................. ...Oh. *sniffle* Apollo: Hm? Sarge: P-Papa... Why...? Why'd you have to die? Dhurke: It was an unfortunate accident. And I'm sorry for your loss. Apollo: If it helps at all, I know how you feel, Sergeant Bu-- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! What'd I do nowww?! Sarge: Y-You insignificant maggot! What would an unseasoned rookie like you know about how I feel?! First I lost Mama... and now I've lost Papa! Apollo: You lost your mother, too? Sarge: She's been gone for some time now. I'm... I'm all alone now. All alone... *sniffle* Dhurke: ...Sergeant Buff, would you tell us a little more about what happened to your mother? Your mother (appears after \"Location of the orb\") Sarge: Mama passed away about six months ago. We were still living in our apartment in the city. Back then, I had yet to engage in my siege defense strategy. Apollo: (In other words, something caused him to withdraw from the world.) Sarge: ...It was arson. It happened so suddenly... and before we knew it, our apartment was a sea of flames. Mama and I were trapped inside. But help never came. So Mama cradled me in her arms... ...kicked out a window... and jumped! Apollo: She did what?! Sarge: She was like a walkin', talkin' medal of valor, my mama was. She delivered me safely to terra firma with a perfectly executed PLF. It's a five-point landing technique used by paratroopers to land safely on the ground. Apollo: (She sounds like a superhero or something.) Sarge: But from that height, she suffered massive injuries in order to protect me. She... She died so that I could live! AHHHHHHHHHHHH! MAMAAAAAAAAAAAA!!! Apollo: I... I don't know what to say... Dhurke: And the person who started the fire? Sarge: He was immediately apprehended. They say he was standing outside laughing while the building burned. Dhurke: At least justice was served. I hope that brought you some solace. Sarge: I've lost both my parents now. You can't possibly know how I feel! *sniffle* *sob* Mama... Papa... Apollo: (Poor kid. It's hard losing both your parents at such a young age. He must really feel alone now.) Dhurke: Apollo... I imagine you know what he's going through. Apollo: I do? Dhurke: The road to recovery begins by talking to someone who's suffered the same hardship. I know you have something that shows you understand. Present Anything (before clearing \"Your mother\" Talk option) Sarge: What insubordination! Apollo: ARRRRRRAGH! Sarge: Petty trinkets have no place in Buff's army, soldier! Now drop and give me twenty! Apollo: (Sheesh... At least let me show the evidence before you shoot it down...) Photo of My Father (after clearing \"Your mother\" Talk option) Leads to: \"Um, sergeant, sir. Would you please take a look at this?\" Apollo: Um, sergeant, sir. Would you please take a look at this? Sarge: What do we have here? Apollo: It's a photo of my father. I wasn't even a year old when he died... in a fire. Sarge: What?! Dhurke: And like your mother, he died in an arsonist's blaze. But in his final moments, he managed to save his infant son. Sarge: P-Private Justice, you've suffered a loss just like mine. Apollo: I have... And that's why I know how you feel. Sarge: B-But... you still have your mother, don't you?! Apollo: No, I lost her, too. Sarge: What?! Apollo: She disappeared after the fire. I don't know if she's still alive or dead. Heck, I don't even know what she looks like. Sarge: Wow... Dhurke: Sergeant Buff, his experience is very much like your own. If anyone can understand the sadness in your heart, it's him. Sarge: Rrrr... Nnngh... .............................. ATTEEEEEENSHUN!!! I salute you, Comrade Justice! You are no longer a private in the Buff Army! Henceforth, you will be a corporal! Apollo: Corporal? Dhurke: Congratulations on your promotion, Corporal Justice! Apollo: ...I'm just glad that seemed to cheer him up a bit. Sarge: Now, comrade, let's toast to your new stripes! And call me Sarge! Don't be shy! We're a band of brothers now! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Dhurke: Now's our chance, corporal! Ask him about the Founder's Orb. Apollo: (Dhurke's getting waaaaay too much of a kick out of this.) Examine Ladder or bookshelves Apollo: Sarge, sir, do you ever read these books? Sarge: Why, of course! Soldiers must have extensive knowledge, as well as fighting prowess. I'm learning all I can each and every day in preparation for the big battle! Apollo: The big battle? Sarge: Um, you know... for when I go back to school. I'll need to be up to date on every subject. Stuff like... y'know, the latest comics and Hollywood gossip... Apollo: Oh, I see... (What about reading, writing and arithmetic?) Well, I'm rooting for you, Sarge! Sarge: Th-Thanks. I'll try my best. Computer Apollo: This computer could provide some useful information. Drat. It's password protected. Dhurke, you're good at getting into places you're not supposed to. Dhurke: Don't look at me. I don't know the first thing about computers. Sarge: Ha ha ha ha ha! Leave it to me! A modern day warrior must be well-versed in technology... and have a mean, mean pride! After all, he who controls information, controls the battlefield! *click clack click clack click clack* Sarge: Aaaaand I'm in! Apollo: Looks like modern day warriors have mean, mean keyboard skills, too. Dhurke: Okay, let's see what we can find. *click clack click clack click clack* Dhurke: Oh, what's this...? An e-mail message? Now this is interesting. It's a research report to whoever asked the doctor to study the orb. Sarge: Here, I put the data on this! Take it and use it well, soldier! E-Mail added to the Court Record. Computer (subsequent times) Apollo: The doctor's computer. It contains an e-mail detailing the progress of his research. Dhurke: I wonder who he prepared the report for. Glasses Apollo: Are these the doctor's? Sarge: Yes, those are Papa's reading glasses. He said he'd been having trouble reading lately. But those glasses seemed to help. Dhurke: Reading glasses, eh? I'll just hold on to these. Apollo: ...Dhurke. Don't tell me you're having trouble reading, too? Dhurke: Perish the thought! ...I-I just don't want to leave any stone unturned. Doctor's Reading Glasses added to the Court Record. Raincoat Apollo: It's a raincoat... Hm...? It's a bit wet, and there's fresh mud on it... That must mean someone wore it recently. Dhurke: Indeed. Maybe even as recently as last night. Apollo: Sarge, did it rain here last night? Sarge: Negative. There wasn't a cloud in the sky. Apollo: Hmm... Then how did this raincoat get all muddy and wet? Sarge: When I saw it last evening, it looked pretty clean and dry to me. Apollo: That means it got like this later at night. Dhurke: Good eye, son. This may very well turn out to be a vital clue. Raincoat added to the Court Record. Raincoat (subsquent times) Apollo: It's a raincoat... Hm...? It's a bit wet, and there's fresh mud on it... That must mean someone wore it recently. Dhurke: Indeed. Maybe even as recently as last night. Apollo: Sarge, did it rain here last night? Sarge: Negative. There wasn't a cloud in the sky. Apollo: Hmm... Then how did this raincoat get all muddy and wet? Sarge: When I saw it last evening, it looked pretty clean and dry to me. Apollo: That means it got like this later at night. Dhurke: Good eye, son. This may very well turn out to be a vital clue. Statue EX-TER-MI-NATE. EX-TER-MI-NATE. DES-TROY ALL HU-MANS. Apollo: What's this thing's problem...? Sarge: It's an OOPArt -- an our-of-place artifact. Papa won it in an online auction. Apollo: An online auction? Sarge: Yes, he said it's an alien weapon that destroyed an entire ancient civilization. Apollo: (...Where do I even start with an explanation like that?) Sacred Urn Apollo: This urn with \"Ami\" painted on it looks really old. But I don't think it's going to provide any info we need. Spiral staircase Apollo: Is your room upstairs, Sarge? Sarge: Yes, it's the one at the end of the hall. Dhurke: What do you say you come out, so we can enjoy a snack together? Sarge: B-But... Dhurke: I promise we won't bite! Sarge: ...............If you insist... ...then I'm not going to talk to you anymore! Dhurke: No, wait! Apollo: Dhurke, you'd better apologize quick. Dhurke: ...I'm sorry for pushing. Sarge: V-Very well. As long as you don't do it again, I'll let it slide this one time. Suitcase Apollo: It's Datz's suitcase. It's full of survival gear and questionable souvenirs. But we already got his passport, so we can leave it be for now. Shoe shelves Apollo: It's a shoe cubby. Hmm, these shoes look like they belong to Sarge and his dad. ...Ah, these boots here are a little damp! Dhurke: And it looks like there's something inside this one. Apollo: Maybe Doctor Buff wore them last night. Dhurke: They might lead us to where he hid the orb. Let's take a closer look. Examine outsole Apollo: There's a question mark on the bottom of this boot. Sarge: Papa had those custom-made for his archeological fieldwork. He had the soul of an adventurer. Dhurke: This boot had the \"sole\" of an adventurer, too. Examine residue on insole (before examining hook-and-loop fastener straps) Apollo: Something's giving off a soft glow inside this boot. But it's too dark in there to see what it is. Examine hook-and-loop fastener straps Apollo: We might get a better look inside if we undid these straps. Examine residue on insole (after examining hook-and-loop fastener straps) Leads to: \"It looks like some kind of glowing moss.\" Apollo: It looks like some kind of glowing moss. Dhurke: It could've come from wherever the doctor went last night. Must've gotten in with some of that mud. Apollo: It might be worth looking into... ...if it'll help us pinpoint where the doctor hid the orb. Glowing Moss added to the Court Record. Shoe shelves (subsequent times) Apollo: There's some glowing moss inside this boot. Dhurke: I'm willing to bet it got there from wherever the doctor went last night. Talk Location of the orb Apollo: Sarge, sir. Do you have any idea where the orb might be? Sarge: It was here in Papa's study until last night. But he said he was going to go hide it somewhere. He mentioned something about a shady character being after it. Apollo: Where do you think he could've hidden it? Sarge: Hmm... Somewhere in the village, I'd guess. He said he'd found a suitable hiding place for it. Apollo: So, it was here last night. That is, until he went out to hide it somewhere in the village. The only question is where? Dhurke: Maybe he left some clue here in his study. Let's search the place again. Apollo: (We should also find out more about Dr. Buff. It might steer us toward the hiding place.) Doctor Buff (appears after \"Location of the orb\") Apollo: So, Sarge, what was your father like? Sarge: Papa was as king as Mama was courageous. His whole reason for moving to the countryside was for me. Apollo: What do you mean? Sarge: I initiated my siege defense strategy after Mama died. Papa was so worried about me, he moved us here to the countryside. He thought the fresh air, blue skies, and natural surroundings might alter my tactics. Dhurke: What a fine father. Sarge: He even quit his position at the university to move here. Apollo: He did? Sarge: He did. He gave up his beloved research position just for me! \"A parent must be prepared to sacrifice everything for his child.\" That's what Papa said! Dhurke: ...Well, I'm feeling about two inches tall right now. Sarge: There's no one in the world I respected more than him. But that just makes his passing all the more devastating. *sniffle, sniffle* Papa, may you continue your beloved research up there with the angels! Present Attorney's Badge Sarge: What's that? Apollo: It's my attorney's badge, sir! Sarge: You mean like a medal?! What act of valor earned you such an honor? Apollo: I rescued my clients from those who would brand them as guilty, sir! Sarge: A heroic act, indeed! Apollo: Thank you for your kind words, sir! (This whole \"sir\" thing is getting real old, real quick.) Photo of My Father Sarge: Corporal Justice... you shoulder a bitter past. Apollo: You've been through quite a lot yourself, Sarge. Sarge: ...Corporal, if I may... um... Apollo: Yes? Sarge: ...Well... um... it doesn't have to be that often, but... W-W-Would you mind coming over from time to time? Apollo: You want me to visit you? Sarge: O-Only if you want to, of course! Apollo: ...Sure. I'll come by, and I'll even bring along my coworkers, Sarge. Sarge: R-Really?! Yaaaaaay! Our band of  brothers continues to grow in rank! Ha ha ha ha! Dhurke: ...Nice work, son. Glad to see you haven't changed one bit. Apollo: (What's that supposed to mean?) Study Photo or Research Notes Sarge: Why...? Why did Papa have to fall in battle? Apollo: (He's putting on a brave face, but he's still just a child.) Sarge: In honor of Papa's heroic sacrifice...  let us march on, comrade! To victory! Apollo: Huh?! I-I mean, sir! Yes, sir! Dhurke: Are you two seriously bent on waging war against that bookcase? Sarge's Drone Apollo: It looks like you can do everything by yourself. Sarge: Indeed! I can even cook and build things whenever I want! Apollo: So there's really no reason for you to leave your room, huh. Sarge: Yes, but there is still one gaping hole in my siege defense. ...Going to the bathroom. Apollo: When nature calls, it's best not to fight it. Sarge: Yes, all great tacticians will say never wage a battle you have no hope of winning. Anything else Apollo: Please take a look at this. Sarge: Let me ask you something, Corporal Justice! How does that aid you on the battlefield?! Apollo: Um, well, if you count the courtroom as a battlefield, it's a fairly useful weapon. Sarge: Good answer! A military man must know his weapons inside and out! Keep up the good work, corporal! Apollo: S-Sir, yes, sir! (I guess that's all he has to say about that.) After clearing \"Doctor Buff\" Talk option and examining computer, glasses, raincoat, and shoe shelves: Apollo: Okay, let's go over what we've learned so far. Wherever it was that Dr. Buff went, he needed a raincoat. And it was somewhere where this glowing moss grows. Any ideas where that might be, Sarge? Sarge: Negative, comrade. I hate to say my intel's a little thin on this one. I've been occupied with my siege defense strategy ever since we moved to the village. Dhurke: Well, son, it seems we have no other choice. We'll have to ask the locals if they know of a place like that. Wright Anything Agency Trucy: Ah! Apollo, Mr. Dhurke! Did you have some quality father-son time together? Talk Any ideas? Dhurke: That poor child... How is he going to survive all on his own? Apollo: Yeah, it's not like he can go out grocery shopping on his own. We should drop off some food later. Dhurke: No, that would only make it worse. We should be encouraging him to come out on his own. Once his food runs out, he'll have to leave the house if he wants to eat. Apollo: Talk about your old-school siege tactics. Sounds more like you want to starve him out... What to do Apollo: Um... Dhurke: Yes? What is it? Apollo: ............ Dhurke: ............ Apollo: (Talk about an awkward silence. I have no idea what to say.) ............ (Yeah... I've got nothing.) Dhurke: Aw, come on, son! Don't tell me you've got nothing! May 16Kurain Village Apollo: Ugh. It feels like somebody's watching me, and it's really creeping me out. Oh, it's just Paul Atishon's campaign posters. When did he put these up? (Whatever. I've got more important things to be paying attention to.) Dhurke: What great weather! It really lifts the spirits. I know! After our little treasure hunt, what do you say we go hunting, son? Apollo: Hunting? We used to do that a lot... didn't we? Dhurke: Just look at that mountain. I bet there are some feisty wild boars up there! Apollo: I... think I'll pass... but thanks. Dhurke: Oh, so hunting's a no-go. Um, well... I guess that wild boar stew will have to wait, then. .........Hm? Apollo, something seems different from the last time we were here. Apollo: Uh... You mean the posters? Dhurke: No, not those. Apollo: (What's he talking about...? Guess I should take a look around myself.) Examine Paul Atishon campaign posters Apollo: When did Paul Atishon have a chance to put up all these election posters? Old Man: That fool keeps stickin' 'em on our houses! He's a disgrace to his distinguished heritage! Apollo: He's doing this without permission? Fey Manor Apollo: A thatched roof... First time I've ever seen one in real life. Dhurke: It looks just like the traditional thatched roofs they use in Japan. All we need now are some samurai with topknots, a few ninjas, and a cuddly mascot. Apollo: When was the last time you were in Japan? Bus stop Apollo: (A phone booth and a bus stop made of wood. They both look really old. You hardly ever see phone booths in the city anymore.) Dhurke: Apollo... what's this glass box for? Apollo: (I guess you hardly see them in Khura'in, too.) Mountains Dhurke: Seeing those mountains really takes me back. I remember when we used to live high in the mountains to escape from the government. Apollo: So, you don't live there anymore? Dhurke: Nope. I needed a more convenient place to lead the revolution from. But that old mountain hut is still there. Apollo: (Man, I miss that hut...) Dhurke: What, are you getting homesick, Apollo? You can come on back to Khura'in anytime, you know? Apollo: N-No, no, I'm fine. Besides, I've got a lot on my plate here... Kurain Boulder Apollo: There's a big boulder towering into the sky over there. According to the sign, it's called the \"Kurain Boulder.\" It also says that a spirit dwells within it. Hmm... A rock with a spirit in it? Dhurke: It's called animism -- the belief that spirits dwell within inanimate objects. They've probably enshrined this boulder as a sacred object. Their tradition of worshipping such objects is similar to our tradition in Khura'in. Apollo: I-Interesting... (Who knew Dhurke could make sense every once in a while?) Canvas Leads to: \"What do we have here?\" Apollo: What do we have here? It looks like an unfinished picture... like something a little kid might paint. Dhurke: Hmm, you're right. But I can't quite tell what it's of. Apollo: I think it's supposed to be nighttime, but what's that thing on the left? Dhurke: Um... A monster, or some kind of alien, perhaps? In any case, it's a pretty poor excuse for a drawing. Apollo: Well, what did you expect from a little kid? ???: A... little kid...? Apollo: Huh? Oh, it's you, Pearl! Pearl: Why, Mr. Apollo, is that you? What a pleasant surprise! It's been quite some time. How have you been? Apollo: Fine, thanks. You're looking good, too, Pearl. Dhurke: Aren't you going to introduce me, son? Apollo: Of course. This is Pearl Fey. She's a spirit medium here in Kurain Village. Pearl, this is Dhurke, my umm... client. Pearl: Hello, sir. Pleased to meet you. If there is anything I can do to help, please let me know. Dhurke: Nice to meet you, too. And what a polite little girl you are! Pearl: ...Um, actually... I'm a high schooler. Dhurke: Whoops! Sorry about that! So, you're a spirit medium? Does that mean you can channel spirits, then? Pearl: Yes. I'm still in training, though. But I'm well-versed in the art of spirit channeling. Dhurke: Well now, isn't that something! I mean, back in my country, our little princess hasn't channeled a single spirit yet! Pretty impressive, young lady! Pearl: Oh, but compared to Mystic Maya, there is so much more I must learn! Apollo: Mystic Maya? Oh, right, Maya Fey... Mr. Wright's former courtroom assistant. He told me all about her. She's a spirit medium, too, if memory serves. Pearl: Yes, she's an amazing medium. And soon, she'll be the next lead of the Fey clan, too! Apollo: (Mediums and spirit channeling... I've heard all about it from Mr. Wright. He said that mediums will even physically become the person they're channeling. I wonder if even little Pearl would turn into a hulking giant if she hand to channel one...) Pearl: I hope you don't mind me asking, but what brings you all the way out here, Mr. Apollo? Apollo: Oh, just a small matter to take care of. Pearl: ...Wait, would it happen to be the matter Mr. Edgeworth is looking into? Apollo: Prosecutor Edgeworth? What's he doing here? Pearl: Oh, so it's a different matter, then? Because I just saw him a moment ago. He appeared to be searching for something. Apollo: Oh? Hmm... (Mr. Edgeworth is a friend of Mr. Wright's, and the district's chief prosecutor. Why would HE be here in Kurain? Well, no point obsessing over it.) Come to think of it, you live here in Kurain Village, don't you, Pearl? Pearl: Yes, I was born and raised here. Dhurke: This is perfect, Apollo. Let's ask the young lady if she knows where the doctor might have gone last night. Apollo: I was thinking the exact same thing. (Maybe I should show her what we found in the doctor's study.) Examine Paul Atishon campaign posters Pearl: Honestly! Why does he keep putting these up? And on people's houses, no less! Apollo: That's got to violate some campaigning law or something... Here, Pearl, I'll help you take them down. Apollo: Whew... Why did he have to put up so many... Pearl: Yeah... And it won't be long before he puts more up. It's really driving me crazy. Dhurke: Why don't you scribble something on them? You know, just some harmless graffiti? Pearl: ...Actually, that's just what I was thinking when I was sketching. Apollo: ...Why don't you join us for lunch at the office sometime? It'll get you away from all this. House Pearl: This is Fey Manor. Mystic Maya lives here. I hope she's doing well... Apollo: (Oh right. Ms. Fey's off studying and training in Khura'in.) Mountains Apollo: There's a lush, green mountain in the distance there. Pearl: It's home to a variety of animals. They sometimes come down to the village. I've seen foxes, badgers, and even bears. Apollo: B-Bears? Dhurke: Well, one would certainly never go hungry around here. Pearl: The poor animals! They are not for hunting or eating! Understand?! Dhurke: But badger and bear meat are so good... Canvas Dhurke: This picture looks like something you might've painted when you were little, son. Apollo: I think I would've done a little better than this. Pearl: ......... Canvas (after perceiving) Apollo: On closer inspection, there's more to this picture than meets the eye. Dhurke: Son, didn't you ever learn that honesty is the best policy? Apollo: Way to go, Dhurke! I was trying to get us out of the hole we dug ourselves into earlier! Talk Kurain Village Dhurke: What a peaceful place. Ahh... Nothing beats mountain air. Pearl: Many of the villagers have left for the city, but I just love it here. Blue skies, lush forests, star-filled skies at night, and fireflies in the summer. Plus, the big, beautiful, blue ocean is just beyond that mountain! Dhurke: The ocean?! What do you say we go for a swim, son? Apollo: ...Oh, um... I think I'll pass. (Besides, I can't swim.) ...Um, Pearl? Kurain Village is like, \"the home of spirit mediums,\" right? Pearl: Yes, and I'm a part of a long line of mediums. Apollo: I've never seen a channeling before, but... ...is it possible to channel the spirit of anyone who's passed away? Pearl: No, not just anyone. You must know their face and true name. Apollo: Really? You can channel a spirit just by knowing their face and name? That's an amazing ability. Pearl: It is, but it can only be learned by those with a gift occurring in certain bloodlines... ...and years of intense training. At present, Mystic Maya and I are the only ones in our village who can channel spirits. Dhurke: Looks like spirit mediums are highly valued here, much like they are back in Khura'in. Pearl: I heard there used to be many more of us a long time ago... ...but now, we are in very short supply. Most of the women nowadays don't want to stay; they want the thrill of the big city. Apollo: Yeah, well, you guys aren't exactly close to any shopping malls or nightclubs out here. But what about you? Are you NOT interested in things like that? Pearl: W-Who, me? Well, I... I wouldn't mind a new outfit or two, and, well... Oh, never mind. Apollo: It's okay, Pearl. You are at that age, after all. Paul Atishon (appears after \"Kurain Village\") Apollo: Oh! We met this weirdo earlier named Paul Atishon. Do you know anything about him? Pearl: Yes, he's been campaigning a lot around here lately. And the noise he's been making has become quite a problem. People are especially upset that he's campaigning at all hours of the night and day. Dhurke: Hmm, well... The local police should arrest him for disturbing the peace. Pearl: Unfortunately, there's little they can do because the Atishon family is so powerful. Apollo: (...Well, isn't HE the proverbial pampered provincial prince.) He seems pretty intent on winning here in Kurain. Is there some special reason why? Pearl: I'm not sure, but I have an idea. The spirit mediums of Kurain once held considerable sway in the political world. Judging by his slogan, maybe that's what he's after. Apollo: Great, so he's just another politician seeking powerful connections... Dhurke: The ability to commune with the dead gives comfort to those anxious about the future. Tiny Khura'in has preserved its independence by the queen's power of spirit channeling. It must play a similar role in this village. Pearl: Yes. Even today, many here revere those with spirit medium blood flowing in their veins. Apollo: So basically, as Paul Atishon's benefactor goes, so goes the whole village? (Who is this benefactor? Who could hold this much sway over Kurain Village?) Where the doctor went (appears after presenting Glowing Moss) Apollo: Pearl... Do you have any idea where Dr. Buff might've gone last night? Pearl: Umm... Well... Apollo: ......... Pearl: ...Uhh, about that... ...All I know is Dr. Buff was somewhere on Mt. Mitama. BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: ...! (My bracelet...! It's reacting! Which means Pearl is hiding something from me.) Present Bracelet Pearl: All I know is Dr. Buff was somewhere on Mt. Mitama. Percieve twitching left thumb on \"Mt. Mitama.\" Apollo: Apollo: Pearl, you seem anxious around the topic of Mt. Mitama. I could tell because you'd rub your thumb over a splotch of dried paint as you said it. Pearl: Oh! U-Um, well...! Apollo: That nighttime painting is yours, isn't it? Pearl: .........! ...This is so embarrassing. As you saw, I'm not a very good artist. But that picture has nothing to do with Dr. Buff! Apollo: I'm not so sure about that. In fact, I'm going to guess that while you were out here painting last night... ...you actually saw the good doctor heading out to Mt. Mitama from the bus stop. Pearl: N-No! I-I didn't see anything like that! I swear! Apollo: ...No, I'm positive you saw the doctor. After all, he's right here in your picture. Present human-like figure Apollo: Leads to: \"Y-You think that's the doctor?\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: See? Isn't the doctor right there? Pearl: Really? That doesn't look like him to me. Apollo: Well, I guess it IS pretty abstract. Pearl: Oh... Is it really that hard to make out? Er, what I mean is, it has nothing to do with Dr. Buff! After all, I never even saw him that night! Leads back to: \"...No, I'm positive you saw the doctor. After all, he's right here in your picture.\" Pearl: Y-You think that's the doctor? I may not be a very good artist, but at least I know how to draw a person! Apollo: Okay, if this isn't a person, then what is it? Pearl: Er... Th-That's a... a rain spirit! Apollo: ......... Pearl: .................. Apollo: ...Um, and what's a rain spirit doing at a bus stop? Pearl: Oh, umm, rain spirits have places to go, too! Apollo: ........ (This is getting ridiculous.) Sorry, Pearl, but you're not a very good liar. That is Dr. Buff, and this piece of evidence proves it! Present Raincoat Apollo: Leads to: \"This is the raincoat we found in the doctor's study.\" Present anything else Apollo: Pearl: The only thing I'm guilty of is being a terrible artist. But you're taking advantage of that to claim the picture is something it's not! Apollo: N-No no, it's... (...totally like that, but...) Pearl: That isn't a person! It's a rain spirit, I tell you! Apollo: No, Pearl, that isn't a rain spirit. Leads back to: \"That is Dr. Buff, and this piece of evidence proves it!\" Apollo: This is the raincoat we found in the doctor's study. It's still wet and muddy, so we know that someone wore it last night. Now, let's see how this pattern is the same as the \"rain spirit\" in your picture? Pearl: ...Ah! Apollo: You didn't see a rain spirit last night. You saw Dr. Buff wearing this raincoat! Pearl: Ah! ...I... I'm sorry. I know I'm not supposed to lie, but... Leads back to Talk options Percieve wrong area Apollo: Apollo: Pearl, you seem uneasy about something. Pearl: Anyone would feel uneasy being stared at like that! Apollo: Huh? But I...! Dhurke: I'd be unnerved, too. I mean, your eyes are practically popping out of your head. Apollo: I-I get it. I'll tone it down a little. (Guess I was wrong.) Leads back to Talk options Where the doctor went (after perceiving) Pearl: I'm sorry I didn't tell you before, Mr. Apollo, but I did see the doctor last night. Apollo: It's all right. Just, please, tell me everything you know. Pearl: ...Of course. I was painting out here last night... when the doctor came up to the bus stop. He was wearing a raincoat, even though it wasn't raining, and a helmet with a light on it. Apollo: Sounds like he was well-prepared for something. Pearl: I know. That's why I asked him if he was going off exploring again. He looked startled, like he hadn't noticed me there. And then, he suddenly said... \"Please don't tell anyone you saw me here.\" Apollo: Why would he want to silence you like that? Dhurke: Something must've happened to spook him. And he didn't want anyone to know where he was going to hide the orb. Apollo: But where could he have been going dressed like that? Pearl: My best guess is a cave somewhere on Mt. Mitama. I heard there's a cave there where mediums of the Kurain tradition went to train long ago. Legend has it, there are some sort of mystical ruins in there. Apollo: Mystical ruins? Sounds like the exact sort of place an archeologist might go. Present Attorney's Badge Pearl: Hee hee. Seeing you present your badge like that... ...reminds me of when I used to investigate cases alongside Mr. Nick. Apollo: You used to help Mr. Wright all the time, I hear. Pearl: That I did! Doing so helped me expand mu horizons beyond this tiny little village. So please, Mr. Apollo! If there's anything I can help you with, you just let me know! Apollo: I will. (What I'd really like is her help with cleaning the office again.) Glowing Moss Apollo: Pearl, do you have any idea where this moss might grow? Pearl: That looks like... Mitama Moss. It grows on Mt. Mitama, and gives off a soft glow in the dark. Apollo: Mt. Mitama? Pearl: See that mountain over there? That's Mt. Mitama. Dhurke: And how would one get there? Pearl: You can take a bus from that bus stop over there. ...Um, may I ask why you're so interested in that moss? Apollo: Well, Dr. Buff was supposed to give us something. But it seems he hid it somewhere last night. Pearl: H-He did? Maybe that's why he, um... Apollo: Pearl? Do you know something that might help us? Pearl: Um, well... Apollo: (Sounds like I'd better find out what she knows.) Anything else Pearl: Oh, um... Sorry, I wish I could help, but... Apollo: No, don't worry about it! I'm sorry I wasted your time like that. Pearl: Um... At least let me offer you some tea. I mean, you must be tired from all your investigating. Pearl: Oh, no, you don't have to do that. We'll be just fine, thank you. (She's so polite, it's hard NOT to feel rude around her.) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: Well, we should get going now, but thanks for all your help, Pearl. Pearl: You're welcome, Mr. Apollo. Please take care. Dhurke: What do you say we go find that cave, son? I sense that the orb might finally be within our grasp. Apollo: This treasure hunt is shaping up to be the real deal. Dhurke: Hah hah hah. Really gets the blood pumping, doesn't it?! Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go! May 16Mt. Mitama - Cave Entrance Apollo: Whew, I'm all out of breath. Dhurke: Aw, come on, that was nothing. And you're so much younger than me. Apollo: I, uh... *huff* *puff* ...don't normally get this much exercise... *cough* *sputter* Dhurke: Need a break? Apollo: N-No, I'm fine. *huff* *puff* Dhurke! Look! There's Mitama Moss growing in that cave over there. Dhurke: This must be where the doctor was last night. Let's take a look inside. May 16Mt. Mitama - Cave Apollo: ............ I can't see a thing. Dhurke: Relax. Your eyes will adjust eventually. Now, follow me. Apollo: I-I really think we need a flashlight, Dhurke. Dhurke: Should've brought one along then, son. ???: ...Here, use mine. Apollo: Thanks! Wait, were you holding out on me? Dhurke: Um... who are you talking to, Apollo? Apollo: ...You...? Whoa! (Someone just pushed me!) Dhurke: Apollo? What the--?! Apollo! Ah... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Apollo: Oww... Dhurke: Are you all right, son? Apollo: Y-Yeah... Looks like someone got the drop on us. Dhurke: Quite literally. Apollo: But who--? I mean, we could've died from that fall! Dhurke: I don't know... Hmm... But I don't think we'll be getting out the way we came in. Looks like we're in a pretty deep cave. Nothing to do but press on, son. Apollo: How can you even see in here? Dhurke: ...Come on, let's go. Apollo: H-Hey, wait! (One false step and we're dead... What in the world should we do...?) Wait here Apollo: How about we wait for help to come? Dhurke: And how are we to call for said help, hmm? Apollo: With my phone, obviously. I'll just-- Argh...! Of course we're in a dead zone... *sigh* Dhurke: Guess that's that. Apollo: (Just great...) Leads back to: \"What in the world should we do...?\" Go forward Leads to: \"I guess we keep going.\" Climb back up Apollo: Let's try climbing back up. Dhurke: Can you even see the wall in front of you? Apollo: ...No... Dhurke: Well, I can tell you it's far too steep. Apollo: You never know until you try! Here goes nothing! Hrrrgh... Annngh... Dhurke: Your loud voice may move mountains... ...but you've barely moved an inch, son. Apollo: (Argh!) Leads back to: \"What in the world should we do...?\" Apollo: I guess we keep going. There must've been some path for Dr. Buff to follow when he came to hide the orb. Dhurke: Right. By the way, it looks like our attacker left us with this useful parting gift. Apollo: From lawyer to spelunker... How do I always get myself into these situations...? We're never going to make it out alive, I hope you know. Dhurke: Don't tell me you're scared, son. We're just getting started. The greatest treasures are only ever found at the point of a blade, or the edge of a cliff. Apollo: Yeah, sure... If I'd known I'd wind up at the bottom of some dark, damp cave... ...I would've never taken your request, Dhurke. Dhurke: Save your breath, Apollo. Just keep putting one foot ahead of the other. Apollo: There'd really better be a way out of here. Dhurke: We'll find one before you know it. You'll see. .................................................................. May 16Mt. Mitama - Cave Apollo: *huff* *puff* We've been walking for over an hour. It's like a maze in here. I couldn't go back to where we started if I wanted to. Dhurke: Y-Yeah... This cave goes deeper than I thought. Apollo: Wait, don't tell me there really is no way out... Dhurke: ...Where there's a will, there's a way. Apollo: Ever the optimist, aren't you... (Maybe we should cut our losses while we still can...) Forge ahead Leads to: \"Even if we were to turn back, we wouldn't make it up that wall of solid rock.\" Turn back Apollo: I seriously think we're going to get completely turned around if we go any further, Dhurke. I mean, we don't even know if there's a way out up ahead. Dhurke: But we DO know we can't climb up that wall. Apollo: Yeah, but... Dhurke: I still know the way back from here. Don't worry, son. We can always go back there any time we want. Apollo: I-If you say so. (Famous last words if I've ever heard some...) Leads back to: \"Maybe we should cut our losses while we still can...\" Put my foot down Apollo: I'm not taking another step, Dhurke! Dhurke: Come on, now... Be reasonable... Apollo: No! I'm done, and that's final. Dhurke: I remember when you used to throw tantrums like this. Apollo: W-Well, I'm not a child anymore! Dhurke: There, there! It's okay. Daddy'll buy anything you want once we get home, son. Apollo: (...I'd better quit while I still have some manhood left to salvage... But it doesn't seem like Dhurke's about to quit any time soon. Even still...) Leads back to: \"Maybe we should cut our losses while we still can...\" Apollo: (Even if we were to turn back, we wouldn't make it up that wall of solid rock. So, I guess we keep going.) ............*sigh* How did I get stuck wandering around in a dark cave again? It's definitely not in my job description. Dhurke: Heh heh. Listen, son. Only the truly accomplished have the luxury of being so choosy. When I was just starting out, I did everything from street performing to yak milking. Apollo: And... that helped you become an accomplished attorney, how? Dhurke: It didn't. But when you need to make a living, you'll take on any job just to survive. ...Say, how IS your career going, by the way? Apollo: Well, it's been a harrowing adventure so far, to say the least. My first trial really put me through the wringer. And my next case had me investigating a pair of stolen panties. And just when I was hitting my stride, this one prosecutor branded me as \"Herr Forehead.\" Oh, and there's this other, ridiculous prosecutor who wields a samurai sword. Dhurke: ...Sounds like you've, um... seen quite a bit. Apollo: You're telling me. Dhurke: ...Listen, Apollo... I'm, uh, I'm sorry I didn't contact you for so long. Apollo: ............It's fine, Dhurke. What happened, happened. Dhurke: ...Hm? Careful, the ground doesn't feel as solid here. Apollo: What? Yikes! The cave floor's collapsing! Dhurke: Argh! Not agaaaain! Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH! May 16??? ???: Hey, Apollo. Can you hear me? Apollo: ...Unngh. (.........Dhurke?) Huh? Where are we? Whoa! What is this place?! Dhurke: I was shocked, too. These ruins look really old. Apollo: It's not exactly something you'd expect to find in the middle of a cave system, that's for sure. Maybe the doctor hid the orb here? I mean, those look like footprints over there. Dhurke: Son, I think our little adventure is about to pay dividends! Time to find that orb! Examine Plastic bottle Apollo: What's a plastic bottle doing here? Dhurke: There's seaweed stuck to it, which means it probably came from the ocean. Hmm... It's possible this cavern is connected to the sea somehow. Driftwood Apollo: Driftwood? How'd that get in here? Dhurke: By drifting on in, I'd assume. The only question is, from where? Cavern wall near stone altar Apollo: So that's the hole we fell through. Doesn't look like we'll be going back that way. We're lucky we survived the fall from way up there. Dhurke: Indeed. If that hole hadn't been above the lake, we'd be history. You passed out the moment you hit the water. Apollo: Yeah, well, water's not really my thing. Dhurke: Hmm, this cavern is solid rock all around. Looks like we either go back through that hole... ...or find some other way out. Apollo: Ugh. Why am I always between a rock and a hard place? Stone altar Apollo: It's a big stone altar. One false move, and some god might come and smite us. Dhurke: Oh, come on. It's not all doom and gloom. Apollo: ...I dare you to look at our surroundings and say that again, Dhurke. Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! You've got me there, son. Apollo: (Dear gods, please smite me now.) Water Apollo: This lake looks really deep. I can't even see the bottom. (A bottomless lake in the depths of a mountain cave system. My blood runs cold at the thought of falling in there.) Dhurke: The water... It's salty. This lake may very well lead to the ocean. Apollo: Didn't Pearl mention something about the ocean? ...Like how it's on the other side of the mountain? Can't imagine she meant it literally. Footprints Apollo: These have gotta be the doctor's footprints. They match the bottoms of the boots we saw in his study. Dhurke: So he made it all the way down here. Hmm... The water's washed and most of them away, but his footprints are everywhere. Apollo: Really? 'Cause these are the only sets I see. Dhurke: He must've been looking for something. ...Ah. Those prints... They're coming out of that lake. Apollo: Hey, you're right. But that would mean Dr. Buff came walking out of the water. Box on altar Apollo: This box looks pretty new. I'm guessing... the doctor's the one who brought it down here. Dhurke: It's no good. It's locked tight. Apollo: There's no way to open it? Dhurke: Doesn't look like it. There isn't even a keyhole. Which means... there must be a trick to opening it. We'll have to figure it out if we want to see what's inside. Talk Any ideas? Apollo: I wonder what this place was for before it was... well, ruins. Dhurke: I'm guessing it was a place for spirit mediums to perform their rites. But earthquakes and the changing landscape eventually buried it. Apollo: If you're right, that would mean that it hasn't been used in ages. After examining cavern wall near stone altar, water, footprints, and box on altar: Dhurke: Let's sum up what we know so far. The orb is almost definitely inside this box contraption that we can't open. As for this cave, there doesn't seem to be any way out. Apollo: Nnrgh... We're THIS close to the orb... Dhurke: Aww, come now, son. Don't be like that. It's just a bit of bad luck. That's all. Apollo: A bit? Murphy called. He wants his law back. Dhurke: What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger, right? Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (How can he laugh at a time like this?) Dhurke: We're stuck here for now, so we might as well try to open this thing. Apollo: Okay, let's see what we're dealing with. Examine button Apollo: There's a big button here. ...Huh. Nothing happened. Examine pictures Apollo: This thing is covered with pictures. And, hey! Each section also rotates! Dhurke: Take a look at this, son. See the picture of a dragon battling a tiger? And this green and purple one... ...is of a Khura'inese butterfly and a mitamah. Apollo: ...I wonder if they're clues for figuring out how to open this box. After examining button and pictures: Dhurke: It appears this box uses a picture-based combination lock. We'll have to arrange the pictures on each side in the correct sequence. Apollo: Let's see... There's the dragon and tiger fight, a Khura'inese butterfly with a mitamah... Dhurke: ...And a number of pictures, too. Apollo: Dhurke, I was thinking... Maybe we should check the evidence we've collected so far. I think we have something that just might help us open it. Dhurke: You read my mind, son. Apollo: I think this will help us open the puzzle box. Present Research Notes Apollo: Leads to: \"Dr. Buff's research notes mention the Song of Ceremony.\" Present anything else Apollo: Dhurke: I don't see how that would help us. Apollo: Really? (Guess that wasn't it.) Dhurke: There's a dragon and tiger fighting, and a Khura'inese butterfly with a mitamah. We've gotta have something related to those things, don't we? Apollo: Hmm... Leads back to: \"I think this will help us open the puzzle box.\" Apollo: Dr. Buff's research notes mention the Song of Ceremony. Maybe its lyrics and the pictures on the box correspond somehow. Dhurke: I think you're on to something, son. Apollo: Okay, let's give it a shot. Each dial has six pictures... ...and there are four dials in all. The box should open once the pictures are arranged in the right order. Funky puzzle box... here comes Justice! Input tiger and dragon picture on top row, Khura'inese butterfly and mitamah picture on middle-top row, praying people and Holy Mother picture halves on middle-bottom row, and Holy Mother's spiritual blessing picture on bottom row Leads to: \"It opened!\" Input any other combination Apollo: It won't open. Dhurke: Maybe the pictures aren't in the right order. The case should open if the pictures are arranged properly, but... Apollo: I know. I should carefully consider which part of the song corresponds to which picture. Apollo: It opened! So this is the Founder's Orb... Dhurke: We did it, son! The orb is finally ours! Founder's Orb updated in the Court Record. Dhurke: At last, the Founder's Orb is ours! And it's all thanks to you, son! Well done! Then again, I'd expect nothing less from my boy! Apollo: Oh, uh, ha ha. It's no big deal. Dhurke: Don't sell yourself short! You may think it's nothing... ...but your insights and reasoning led us here. And I'd say that's truly impressive! Apollo: I don't know about that, ha ha ha. Dhurke: All those battles you fought in the courtroom have shaped you into the man you are today. And I couldn't be prouder! Apollo: ...W-Will you cut it out, already? (...Before I turn into a sun-ripened tomato.) Dhurke: With this orb, I can finally deliver a fatal blow to the Ga'ran regime. Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: So, how exactly do you plan on using it? You're not going to try to become a spirit medium, are you? Dhurke: Don't be ridiculous. I don't need supernatural powers like that. Apollo: So then, are you going to use it as a bargaining chip with Queen Ga'ran? Like demanding she abolishes the Defense Culpability Act? Dhurke: Well, the thought had crossed my mind, but... ...the main thing is returning this to the Kingdom of Khura'in. After all, as a sacred relic of Khura'inism, that is where it belongs. Apollo: Really? That's all you wanted to do? Dhurke: Mm-hm. Because my true objective has always been... ...to find out who asked Dr. Buff to study it and why. Apollo: I'm not sure I follow. Examine Box on altar Apollo: That was one fancy puzzle box. Dhurke: The fact that he chose to use such an elaborate box... ...makes me think that Dr. Buff must've had a rather playful side to him. Apollo: I can almost imagine him saying, \"Go ahead. Open it if you can.\" Talk The orb's significance Dhurke: The official story is that the orb was stolen from the Tehm'pul Temple treasure room. Apollo: Yeah, I heard about that on the news. They also said your group was behind the theft. Dhurke: That's not good... We're probably on an international most-wanted list now. ...Let me ask you something, Apollo: Who do YOU think really stole the orb? Apollo: Umm, I really haven't a clue. Dhurke: Well, I think it was one of the royals. Apollo: Really? Someone from the royal family? Dhurke: Yeah, and I've got a pretty good idea which one it was. Apollo: (He knows who it is?) Care to share your hunch? Dhurke: All I'll say at this point is this: Security is pretty tight, but the royals have unfettered access to the treasure room. Plus, they seem to be turning a blind eye to the orb's loss. Apollo: But why would a member of the royal family do that? Dhurke: ...That, I haven't figured out yet. But whatever the reason, it can't be good. I mean, a Khura'inese royal stealing a national treasure of such religious significance? And then pinning the crime on us, the Defiant Dragons? Apollo: Sounds like a conspiracy or something. Dhurke: I agree. And if the truth were to come to light, it would be a scandal of epic proportions. To allow a foreign national to study a treasure so sacred that it's off limits to the public... It would be seen as an utter sacrilege to those who truly revere the Holy Mother. Apollo: So if this were to go public, support for the Ga'ran regime would weaken. Dhurke: But that's not all. This is just a hunch, but I believe there's something even bigger here. Something that would explain why the orb was being studied in the first place. Something that would shake the Kingdom of Khura'in to its very core. And I'm going to find out what. Apollo: (.........He's probably right. His intuition is usually spot on.) Dhurke, why are you so bent on revolution, anyway? Is it to reform the legal system in Khura'in? Dhurke: There's that. But I'm  also doing this for my children... I want to save Nahyuta. Apollo: What do you mean? Dhurke: ...This is for your ears only. It's the other reason why this revolution needs to succeed. Nahyuta (appears after \"The orb's significance\") Apollo: Nahyuta... I never thought that our reunion would take place in a courtroom. Dhurke: Oh, so you've run into each other already. Apollo: Yeah, but it was like he was a different person. He used to be such a kind, cheerful kid -- always smiling and stuff. But now... He tried to convict Trucy for a crime she didn't even commit. Plus, he kept telling me I had a \"putrid mind\" and to \"let it go, and move on.\" Dhurke: Has it really gotten that bad? It must be Ga'ran's influence. He wasn't like that when he first stepped into the courtroom. Back then, he still had a keen sense of justice. \"I vow to bring the Ga'ran regime down and reform the legal system.\" Dhurke: That's what he swore to do... but that was also five years ago. He'd been the shining star of the Defiant Dragons, and our greatest hope. Apollo: Wait, Nahyuta was a Dragon? Dhurke: He was. But these days, he's more like Ga'ran's lapdog. Apollo: Talk about a complete about-face. Why would he do that? Dhurke: Something must have happened to him. Something that sparked a radical change. Still... I don't think he truly believes in the new path he's taken. It's not conviction that fills his heart; it's resignation and despair. Apollo: I-I see... Dhurke: ...The only thing I know for sure is... Nahyuta is suffering... and he is suffering in silence. Apollo: Nahyuta... is suffering...? Dhurke: Yes. He knows the rightful state of Khura'in's legal system... ...but something forces him to bend to Ga'ran's will, and it's tearing him apart. Apollo: But it's been five years. Do you really think he even still wants to reform the legal system? Dhurke: ...As long as he carries what I've taught him in his heart, I do. Dhurke's teachings (appears after \"Nahyuta\") Leads to: \"\"A dragon never yields.\" ...That's what you always told us.\" Present Founder's Orb Dhurke: The orb is ours at last! Apollo: I'm just glad we were able to make what you said in your broadcast a reality. Dhurke: Me, too. I didn't want to admit it before, but I was starting to have second thoughts about making such a big, bold move. I kept thinking, \"What would happen if we failed to get the orb?\" Apollo: Just another example of how a bluff can be the starting point in the quest for the truth. Dhurke: And what a hard-won truth it was. But I couldn't have done it without you, son. Apollo: \"A dragon never yields.\" ...That's what you always told us. Dhurke: That I did. It's a belief I've held since back when I was lawyer. [sic] The dragon stands at the pinnacle of the natural world. Nothing and no one can bend its will. Apollo: That's why we lawyers must pursue the truth like an unyielding dragon, right? We must fight for truth to the bitter end, no matter what it takes... (Dhurke and Mr. Wright... they have that much in common.) Dhurke: That's why I've held onto this badge, even though there are no more lawyers in Khura'in. I believe that one day, our legal system will return to its former glory. And this badge here is a testament to that belief. Apollo: ...Hmm... I wonder if Nahyuta still believes in what you taught us? Dhurke: He does. That much I'm sure of. A dragon never yields. Dhurke: I know that belief is etched deep in his heart. ...I'd bet my life on it. After all, he is my flesh and blood! Apollo: ............ (This unshakable faith and confidence... It's what draws people to him, whether they like it or not. ...Even people like me.) You know, I remember back when we were kids... ...Nahyuta used to say with great pride, \"I have the blood of the dragon within me.\" Dhurke: Yes, and that's why I want to free him. Free him from the poisonous clutches of the Ga'ran regime. Apollo: So that's your other reason for starting a revolution... Dhurke: Yes. I need to smack some sense into that boy of mine. I mean, what else are fathers for? Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: ...I... I wouldn't know.) Dhurke: Now that we have the orb, on to the next problem -- getting out of here. Apollo: Well, we're not going back the way we came. That's for sure. That hole we fell through is way too high to climb back up to. Dhurke: Actually, I have an idea. That lake water tastes salty, which means it must connect to the ocean. Apollo: W-Wait a second. You're not suggesting we SWIM our way out of here...? Dhurke: That's exactly what I'm suggesting. Apollo: But we have no idea how deep that lake goes. It's pitch black down there. Dhurke: Not a problem. Apollo: How is that not a problem? I mean, how do you even know if there's really a passage to the ocean? Dhurke: Well, one of us has to try, and I'm the better swimmer. Time's a wastin'! I'll be back before you know it, son. Apollo: Dhurke! ...He's gone. I sure hope he knows what he's doing. May 16Mt. Mitama - Kurainese Ruins Apollo: ......... (It's been twenty minutes. I hope he's okay.) What's going on? Uh-oh. Th-The water...! It's rising! And fast! Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! (N-Need... air...) *cough* *sputter* *cough* *cough* ...Ahhh! I don't know how to swim! If I don't grab onto something that floats...! .................. *cough* *sputter* *cough* *cough* ...This is bad! I-I better think of something -- quick! Examine Plastic bottle Apollo: Hey, maybe I can use this like an oxygen tank! ...Wait, what am I thinking?! I need to stay calm and be more rational about this! Driftwood Apollo: I've got it! As long as I hold onto this, I should be able to stay afloat! Stone altar Apollo: This is not good. The water's almost up to the top of the altar. It won't be long before it reaches the roof of the cave. Box on altar Apollo: The puzzle box is still at the base of the altar. It must've been designed to stay put, even at high tide. Wait, that's it! Dr. Buff must've gotten in here from some ocean-side entrance at low tide. That's why his footprints were leading OUT of the lake. So it really DOES connect to the ocean. Not that that helps. I'd drown before I made it out. Top of cavern Apollo: Nnrrgh... It's no use! The hole's still too high up! I'll have to find another way -- and quick -- before I drown! After examining plastic bottle, driftwood, box on altar, and top of cavern: Apollo: The water won't stop rising! Aaaah! I-I'm getting swept away! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh! Please...! STOPPPP! Examine Plastic bottle Apollo: If only that bottle were a little bigger, it'd store that much more air... No, it wouldn't make that much of a difference... I need to stop with these harebrained ideas, and come up with a real way to escape! Cavern ceiling Apollo: The water's almost to the top now. At this rate, I'll run out of breathing room! I'm a goner if I don't find a way out quick! Hole in cavern Leads to: \"The water's just high enough for me to reach the hole!\" Apollo: The water's just high enough for me to reach the hole! I'm saved! All I have to do is go back the way we came! The water might even lift me all the way back up, over that wall of rock! Here goes! ...Huh? The hole! It's full of rubble. The tunnel collapsing above must've filled it in after we fell through it. Nngh... This... This can't be happening! No, I can't give up now. I refuse to die here! Th-The water...! I can't--! *cough* *sputter* I can't... I can't... breathe... .................. (Is this... the end?) .................. (Dhurke... I wonder if he made it out.) .................. (So this is what it feels like to drown. I would've eaten that sushi if I'd known it would be my last meal. ...I feel like I've been through this before. ...Ah, now I remember. It was back when all three of us were living in that shack in the mountains. Nahyuta and I were playing by the riverside when we got swept up in the rapids.) Apollo: AAAAAAHHH! Nahyuta: AAAAAAAGH! Apollo: (I thought we were goners, but then...) Dhurke: Nahyuta! Apollo! Hold on! I'm coming! Apollo: ...*sniffle*... *sniffle*... *sniffle*... Wahhhhh!!! Nahyuta: Waaahhhh!!! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! That was a close one! Thought I'd lost you two! Apollo: I-I'm sorry, Dhuuuuuuurke! Dhurke: All right, that's enough now. Didn't I teach you that boys don't cry? Nahyuta: ...Thank you, Father. Apollo: *sniffle* *hiccup* *hiccup* Nahyuta: You... You could've been killed... But you risked your life... to save us... Why...? Dhurke: What a silly question. What father wouldn't risk his life to save his own children? Nahyuta, Apollo... Don't you ever hesitate to call when you need me. Understand? Apollo: ...Hey Dhurke? This isn't forever, right? You'll bring me back from America someday, right? Dhurke: Of course... I'll come pick you up as soon as things settle down here. Promise. Apollo: Okay! You promised! Apollo: ...Dhurke. I waited and waited. For the day you'd come and take me home. But you never came. That's why I tried to forget about you... ...and my life back in Khura'in. ...Dhurke... Why...? Why... didn't you...? .................. ..................... ???: A... ...lo... A... pol... lo...! Apollo! Can you hear me?! Apollo: *cough* *sputter* *cough* .........D-Dhurke? Dhurke: Still can't swim, eh? Apollo: You... You came back? But why? Dhurke: I said I'd come for you, didn't I? Apollo: Yeah... But you can't hold me and swim...! We're both going to...! Dhurke: Stop talking. You'll bite your tongue. Apollo: What? Whoa whoa whoa! (We're being pulled under! What's going on?! Why is this happeniiiiing?!) .................. May 16??? Apollo: *cough* ...Uuuuugh. Wh-Where...? ???: Ahh, you finally came to, son. Dhurke: Get your fill of seawater? Good thing your name's not Neptune, huh! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: D-Dhurke... Datz: Har har har har har har! You're telling me! Check it out, snot's coming out of his nose! Trucy: What a miraculous escape! Not even some of the escape-artist greats could pull that off! Apollo: ...Wh-What on earth happened? Dhurke: Sorry it took me so long, son. I made it to the ocean, but I figured you still couldn't swim. So I found a local fisherman and had him take us out near the undersea cavern. He tied a rope to me, and I came and grabbed you. Then he yanked me back. Apollo: Oh, so that's what pulled us under with such force. Trucy: Don't forget about me! I assisted in your escape act, too, Polly! Dhurke: I've helped compatriots escape from all sorts of places -- mountain jails, island prisons... But an undersea cavern? Now that was a first! Apollo: ......... (Dhurke... He risked his life for me.) .........Dhurke. I'm only alive because of you. ...Thank you. Dhurke: Oh, uh... Y-You're welcome. I, uh... just did what any father would do for his son. Apollo: (.........He saved my life yet again.) *growl* ...Um... Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! I guess seawater doesn't make for much of a meal! Trucy: It's 'cause Polly didn't have any sushi! Apollo: (Oh, yeah. I haven't eaten anything since this morning.) Datz: ...Oh, that's right! Hey, AJ! Dhurke had me buy this for ya. Apollo: ! Dhurke: Thought you might be hungry. Ready to have some this time around? Apollo: .........Yeah. Thanks! *chomp* *nom nom nom* Oh wow, this is delicious! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Glad you approve! I'd better get some before you eat them all! *chomp* *chew chew chew* Apollo: (Just like old times. Dhurke used to slice up the fish he caught, and we'd all eat fresh sashimi together. He used to talk about all the vitamins and minerals packed in the raw fish.) Datz: *chomp* *munch munch munch* Hey, by the way! Lemme see that orb, AJ! Apollo: Here you go. Datz: Hoa, so that's what it looks like! Trucy: You found the legendary treasure! Nice work, Polly! Apollo: Thanks. ...Guess you could say, mission accomplished! Dhurke: With the orb, our revolution can take a big step forward. Let's celebrate the eve of our revolution! We'll all get dressed up and feast till dawn! Datz: Yeah! Now you're talkin'! Time to party! Apollo: ......... (After all that? I just want to go to bed. Sure wish Nahyuta was here. Maybe one day, we'll enjoy times like these together again. ...The revolution. If it can bring back those happy days... ...you can sign me up for--) ???: Sorry to interrupt your little party, but I'm here for my crystal. Staff: Right, left, right, left, HALT! Apollo: Ah! It's him again! Atishon: Heh heh heh. Well done. Then again, I always knew you could do it. After all, we politicians must be excellent judges of character. Still, I'm impressed you both made it out of there alive. Apollo: ...W-Wait a second. YOU'RE the one who shoved us into that pit? Atishon: It sounds so bad when you say it like that. All I did was give you a little nudge in the right direction. Dhurke: ...So... it was you... ............................................................... You no good, son of a--! Atishon: ...EEP! D-Don't look at me like that! The Crystal of Ami Fey is mine! Now, hand it over! Dhurke: Over my dead body! Atishon: EEK! Detective! Help! Ema: Yeah yeah, I know. Apollo: Ema? What's going on here? Ema: He filed a police report. He claims you're trying to steal his family heirloom. Atishon: Th-That's him! The one with the long hair! Arrest him this instant! He's the thief that made off with the Atishon family's most precious heirloom! Ema: Well, I suppose I should ask you to come in for questioning. Dhurke: Down at the police station? I... think I'll pass. After all, Mr. Atishon seems bent on having me arrested on theft charges. Apollo: (This is not good! If Dhurke gets arrested, he'll be sent back to Khura'in to face execution!) Ema: Sorry, but now that I know you have the crystal, or orb as you call it, I must insist. Will you please come with me, sir? Apollo: Apollo: Ema! I'm afraid I can't let you take Dhurke in! He received the orb from Dr. Buff in a perfectly legal transaction. Ema: Is that so? Can you prove it? Apollo: Of course. This should sufficiently prove that the orb now belongs to Dhurke. Present Orb Transfer Agreement Apollo: Leads to: \"Take a look at this agreement.\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: Look at this! It's proof that the orb is Dhurke's. Ema: Umm... All this proves is you're completely our of your mind. Apollo: Oops... (I guess that wasn't it.) But the doctor definitely transferred it over to us. Leads back to: \"This should sufficiently prove that the orb now belongs to Dhurke.\" Apollo: Take a look at this agreement. Ema: What do we have here? Let's see... \"I agree to hand over the Founder's Orb to the Defiant Dragons if I will come to no harm.\" Hmm... It appears to be a perfectly legal agreement. Atishon: Not so fast! That's not the Founder's Orb! It's the Crystal of Ami Fey, which means their agreement is null and void! Ema: Hmm, this is going nowhere fast. Apollo: You can say that again. ???: Then it will just have to go to trial. Right, Apollo? Apollo: M-M-Mr. Wright? Trucy: Daddy! Phoenix: What's with you two? You look like you just saw a ghost. Apollo: (...Oh yeah. Ema mentioned she had seen him around.) ...Um, what're you doing in Kurain Village, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Mr. Atishon has retained me as his lawyer. Apollo: Wait, you're his... lawyer? Examine Mountains Apollo: You can see Mt. Mitama from here. We're lucky we found the Founder's Orb, and even luckier we got out of there alive. I hope I never have to go through anything like that again. Talk Legal advisor Apollo: Mr. Wright, why are you serving as Mr. Atishon's lawyer? Phoenix: Because he hired me. He needed my help in getting a family heirloom back from Dr. Buff. And it seems he correctly foresaw that something like this might happen. Atishon: It's because those shifty insurgents were harassing poor Dr. Buff. So I knew I might need a lawyer if things went south. I figured with a celebrated lawyer like Phoenix Wright, I couldn't go wrong. Apollo: Is this what you came back from Khura'in for, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: It was just good timing. My work over there just happened to wrap up, so here I am. Plus... Mr. Atishon is a very important client. Apollo: (They know each other? But I've never heard Mr. Wright mention his name before.) The Crystal of Ami Fey Apollo: Mr. Wright, are you sure this is Mr. Atishon's family heirloom? Phoenix: That's my client's assertion. He says it's the Crystal of Ami Fey. Apparently, it's the crystal she once used when channeling spirits. Apollo: Who's Ami Fey? Phoenix: She brought Khura'inese channeling to Japan, and her descendants brought it here. Her true origins are still rather murky... ...but what's clear is she is the founder of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Apollo: Oh, so she's like the one they call the founder in Khura'in -- the Holy Mother. Present Anything Phoenix: I'd think you would have more pressing things to ask me about. Apollo: Y-Yeah... (I'd better ask what I can while I can.) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ...Apollo, I don't plan to betray my client's confidence. I may not know all the facts yet, but I do know we won't be handing the crystal over to you. Apollo: What? Are you saying...? Phoenix: .................. I'm really sorry it's come to this, but... Apollo: Mr. Wright? I don't understand. Phoenix: Let me spell it out then. If you continue to claim that the crystal belongs to your client... ...then I will be seeing you in court. Apollo: Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! Trucy: ...Wh-What's gotten into you, Daddy? Phoenix: Nothing. This is strictly business. Atishon: Heh heh heh. Two lawyers from the same firm facing off? What are the odds! Lucky for me, I believe I have the \"right\" man for the job! What ever are you going to do? Remember, he IS your boss. Apollo: Ngrrrgh... (How did it come to this?!) M-Mr. Wright! Please! Don't do this! Phoenix: Apollo, there's no point in arguing about it here... ...when it's now clear we're headed to court. That's where we'll find out who the crystal really belongs to. Apollo: (I don't believe it. Am I really going to face Mr. Wright in court?) Trucy: Daddy! Apollo! No! We can't have our agency's talent competing against each other! Phoenix: It's too late, Trucy. The die has been cast. We each have to fight for our clients' best interests. Trucy: B-But... Phoenix: So, what's it going to be, Apollo. Are we going to have to take this to trial? Apollo: (I have to battle Mr. Wright in court? THE legendary Phoenix Wright? No matter how many trials of his I've watched... ...no matter how dire the situation, he's always pulled out a win in the end. Can I do it? Can I really take on the man whose footsteps I've been following in...? I owe it to Dhurke to at least try. I... What should I do?) Battle Mr. Wright Leads to: \"There's no turning back now.\" Throw in the towel Apollo: (I can't do this. I mean, how can I go up against a man like him? I couldn't possibly win! ...But do I really want to give up without a fight? If I do, I'll be forever walking in his shadow! Plus, I'd be letting Dhurke down! And I can't let that happen!) Leads to: \"There's no turning back now.\" Apollo: (There's no turning back now.) If it's a trial you want, Mr. Wright, I'm more than happy to oblige! I'm ready to fight for my client... ...even if it means facing off against you! Phoenix: .................................... .................. ...All right. I won't be pulling any punches, either, Apollo. The kid gloves are officially off. May the best attorney win. Apollo: You got it! Trucy: Whoa whoa whoa! First Daddy, now you! Polly! You're not seriously... Apollo: ...Sorry, Trucy. But I have to do this. Phoenix: .................. Apollo... All right, then, I'd better go prepare for tomorrow. See you in court. Trucy: Daddy, no! Wait! Dhurke: A fine mess I've gotten you into, son. I mean, of all the lawyers we could've faced, it had to be him? He's practically a celebrity in Khura'in now. They're calling him the Fighting Phoenix. Apollo: ...I-I'll be fine! (After all, I've come a long way, too! Who knows? I could even end up winning. There's always a chance...... right?) Dhurke: You know, this may be a blessing in disguise. If the trial proves what we found is indeed the Founder's Orb... ...then whoever asked Dr. Buff to study it may be revealed, too. This is our chance to finally pull them out of the shadows! Apollo: ...The first step of your revolution, huh? Dhurke: Yes. The revolution to restore Khura'in to its former glory, and save Nahyuta's soul! Apollo: Dhurke... I swear to fight as hard as I can in court to make that a reality. We're going to win this one. You'll see. Dhurke: I know you can do it... son. Apollo: (It doesn't matter that I'll be going up against Mr. Wright. I have to win this for Dhurke... ...and for Nahyuta. His salvation, along with all of Khura'in, depends on it!) To be continued Nothing to examine during investigation Apollo: Nothing particularly interesting here. Area already examined Apollo: We've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around. Nothing to examine during fingerprinting session Apollo: Doesn't look like there are any prints here. Examine insignificant area on evidence Apollo: (Nothing particularly interesting here.) Consult (while opening puzzle box) Apollo: Hmm, this is harder than I imagined. I thought all we had to do was arrange the pictures according to the song. Dhurke: It's times like these you have to think outside the puzzle-box. Sometimes the truth can only be found when you look at things from a different angle. Apollo: A different angle? (Come to think of it, one of the pictures from the song is missing. Does this mean the pictures don't line up exactly one-to-one?) Turnabout Revolution Image Gallery Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 May 17, 10:08 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Trucy: Just so you know... I'm not going to take sides! Apollo: Message received, loud and clear. Trucy: Good, because I don't like this one bit! You and Daddy should be on the same team! Apollo: S-Sorry, Trucy... (Wow, she's really mad.) Dhurke: I'm sorry, too, little lady. This is all my fault. Trucy: I'm just worried things will never be the same between Daddy and Apollo... ...if they go through with this. Dhurke: Is that all? Well, I wouldn't worry about that. That's the way it is with us men. We may fight, but we don't burn bridges. Trucy: Really? Dhurke: Sure. One minute we're trading blows, and the next, we're having drinks together. We're simple creatures at heart. Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Trucy: I sure hope you're right... Athena: Sorry I'm late, Apollo! Apollo: Athena! There you are! What happened with you and Mr. Wright yesterday? Athena: O-Oh, about that... I ended up going to the wrong airport. I was waiting there, thinking his flight was really late... and before I knew it, I dozed off. By the time I woke up, it was already dark. Apollo: I figured something like that had happened. Being late and dozing off are the two things you do best. Athena: Ugh. Guilty as charged. Apollo: So then, I take it you have no idea what today's case is about? Athena: Not a clue. Sorry... Um, what IS today's case about, if I might ask? Another locked-room mystery? A suspect with a flimsy alibi? Ooh, or a dying message? Apollo: Sorry, strike three, you're out. It's a civil case. Athena: ...A civil case? Apollo: You act like I'm speaking Swahili here. Athena: It's just, the Wright Anything Agency specializes in criminal law, or so I thought. In civil cases, there are no prosecutors, right? Instead, both parties retain an attorney. Apollo: Right. And the other attorney is someone you know very well. Athena: Really? Who? Bailiff: The trial will begin shortly. Please proceed to the courtroom at once. Apollo: (...Okay, let's do this!) Athena: Apollo, wait. Who's the other attorney? And where is Mr. Wright? Apollo: No time to explain. Let's go. Athena: O-Okay! Right behind you! May 17, 10:30 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 6 Judge: Court is now in session. Oh, um... Uh, is this some sort of practice session? A mock trial, perhaps? Apollo: Um... no. No, it's not, Your Honor. Phoenix: It's the real deal, Your Honor. Judge: Hmm... So then you two have had a falling out? I won't have you use my courtroom for that, you know! Apollo: I-It's nothing like that, Your Honor! Phoenix: Exactly. It just so happens that we have different clients in this case. Judge: I see... Well, here's to hoping this has no adverse effect on your working relationship. Athena: You can say that again! I had no idea we'd be going up against the boss today! Ugh... You sure this is a good idea, Apollo? Apollo: ...What? Do you want to switch sides? Athena: Honestly, I'd rather be anywhere but here right now. Apollo: (Well, at least she IS here. I'm really going to need her help.) Phoenix: ...Mr. Justice. Apollo: Yes?! Phoenix: Don't expect me to pull any punches just because you're the opposing lawyer. As I said, the kid gloves are off, and come what may, they'll stay off. Apollo: ...Same here, Mr. Wright! If it's a fight you want, it's a fight you'll get! Phoenix: .................. Apollo: .................. Athena: Yeesh, you guys are really chomping at the bit, aren't you? Judge: Hmm... I don't mind a good fight between co-workers. Just keep this civil case civil. Now then, if the plaintiff would take the stand, we may begin. Staff: Right, left, right, left, HALT! Atishon: Noble judge, members of the gallery! Good day to you! I am Paul Atishon! This is but the start of my epic campaign! And you all have the honor of witnessing it! I believe the youth of this country are our very future. Too long have they been looked down on and given the cold shoulder! So, to them I say! Ask not what you can do for your country! Ask what you can do for me! Judge: M-Mr. Atishon! What is that crazy contraption you're riding in?! Atishon: Heh heh heh. It's my custom-made, election-winning campaign mobile. Beautiful, isn't it? Judge: You're at a witness stand, not a campaign podium. So come out of there this instant! Atishon: Feh... Judge: All right. Now, would the plaintiff's attorney, Mr. Wright... ...please explain the complaint filed against the defendant. Phoenix: Mr. Atishon's complaint against the defendant is simple. The defendant, one Dhurke Sahdmadhi... ...stole my client's family heirloom -- the Crystal of Ami Fey. Mr. Atishon merely seeks its return. Atishon: This wouldn't have happened if that archeologist hadn't kicked the bucket. Judge: ...I see. Well, Mr. Justice, let's have your opening statement, if you would. Apollo: The defense asserts the item in question is the Founder's Orb, a sacred relic from Khura'in. Judge: Hmm... Go on. Apollo: It seems someone asked an archeologist -- Dr. Archie Buff -- to study the orb. Dr. Buff determined that it was a Khura'inese national treasure known as the Founder's Orb. The very orb that was stolen from a treasure room in Khura'in several weeks ago. Judge: Why yes, I saw a news report about that! The theft of a Khura'inese national treasure caused quite an uproar in the kingdom. Apollo: Well, we believe it was not, in fact, a theft in the traditional sense. But rather, that it was spirited out of Khura'in by someone for Dr. Buff to study. Judge: You don't say... And...? Apollo: Around that time, an acquaintance of the defendant learned of Dr. Buff. He made contact with the doctor, who agreed to hand over the orb. Apparently, the doctor wanted nothing to do with it once he'd learned it had been stolen. Judge: Hmm... It seems you even have a transfer agreement between both parties. Apollo: Mr. Sahdmadhi also agreed to return the Founder's Orb to the Kingdom of Khura'in... ...once the doctor verified it was the real thing. Judge: I see... So this dispute centers on... ...whether the item is the Founder's Orb or the Crystal of Ami Fey. That, in turn, will determine the object's rightful owner. Apollo: (I'd better bring my A game. Going up against Mr. Wright won't be a walk in the park.) Judge: Hmm... Come to think of it, the name Dhurke Sahdmadhi sounds awfully familiar. But I can't recall where I've heard it. Apollo: ...Oh. umm, it's probably your imagination, Your Honor. He's just a tourist, after all. Judge: Hmm... My imagination, you say? Athena: Are you sure about this, Apollo? He's a wanted criminal in Khura'in, isn't he? Apollo: ...In Khura'in, yes. Here, he's just a tourist. Judge: Very well, let's begin the proceedings. Bailiff, would you bring in the first witness? Apollo: ...Ema? Ema: Show some manners. We're in court. Apollo: I know, it's just... This is a civil trial, so I was surprised to see a detective take the stand. Phoenix: I had her do some digging on Dr. Buff. Apollo: (What for?) Ema: You disappoint me, Apollo. First, you know I'm not just a detective. I'm a forensic scientist. Do try to remember that. Second, you owe Mr. Wright an apology. After all he's done for you, you have some nerve! Apollo: First, I'm sorry. And second, I'm really just trying to do my job. Ema: You'll never get anywhere with that attitude. Take some advice from someone who's been there. Apollo: Why do I feel like I'm on trial here? Judge: Detective Skye, your testimony, if you please. Witness Testimony -- The Doctor's Dark Secret -- Ema: The police have had their eye on Dr. Buff for some time. And just today, a number of stolen artifacts were discovered in his study. Among them were a priceless urn and a statue that were stolen from the Fey clan. It seems the doctor would do anything to study artifacts, including steal them. As for the relic at the center of this dispute, he likely stole it from the Atishon residence. Apollo: The doctor... is a thief? Why am I just hearing about this now? Ema: Well, \"cat burglar\" isn't something he'd put on his résumé. He was more careful than that. But the fact is, he was a classic treasure hunter. Athena: A treasure hunter, huh... Like people who have thrilling adventures in exotic places, risking life and limb for glory? Apollo: I doubt Dr. Buff was the star of his own hit movie series, Athena. Phoenix: Out of respect for the dead, I will say that Dr. Buff wasn't doing it to get rich. Apparently, he only wanted to borrow artifacts to study them. He would then return them as soon as his research was finished. Ema: According to the doctor's child... ...he would even repair or restore some of the artifacts he stole before returning them. He believed he was honoring the dead by discovering their history through artifacts. But whatever lofty ideals he had, it makes no difference. Larceny is larceny. Judge: Yes, he certainly sounds no different than a regular thief to me. Apollo: So, let's say for a moment that the doctor really did moonlight in stealing artifacts... Might he not have stolen the Founder's Orb in Khura'in and brought it back here himself? Phoenix: Nope. There's no records of him traveling overseas over the past few years. Plus, he couldn't very well leave his reclusive child at home all alone. Judge: Hmm... Then this really must be the Crystal of Ami Fey. Phoenix: Yes. He stole it from the Atishon residence, probably so he could study it. Apollo: ......... (This is the left hook I did not need.) Athena: I bet you never saw that coming, Apollo. Apollo: Yeah, when Mr. Wright said the kid gloves were off, he wasn't kidding. Phoenix: ......... Judge: Mr. Justice, you may proceed with your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- The Doctor's Dark Secret -- Ema: The police have had their eye on Dr. Buff for some time. Press Apollo: Apollo: How exactly did Dr. Buff arouse the suspicion of the police anyway? Ema: Chalk it up to good, old-fashioned sleuthing. After investigating countless artifact thefts over the years... ...the police finally zeroed in on him, and the doctor became their prime suspect. Phoenix: A number of those artifact thefts occurred in Kurain Village, too, if I might add. And they started right around the time the doctor moved there. Apollo: But he was never arrested. I take it there was nothing concrete linking him to a crime? Ema: No. Which is why we were never able to get a search warrant in the first place. It's hard to arrest artifact thieves unless you catch them red-handed. Still, the police had him under constant surveillance. Ema: And just today, a number of stolen artifacts were discovered in his study. Press Apollo: Apollo: Are you sure these allegedly stolen artifacts are the real deal? Ema: They're not fakes, that's for sure. Take the urn, for example. Apparently, it's an extremely intricate work of art. Its design, cracks, and other features would be impossible to replicate perfectly. Phoenix: Actually, I've had a few run-ins with that urn myself. So I was shocked to see it there in the doctor's study. I can say without a doubt, that that urn was stolen from the Fey clan. Apollo: I-I see... Judge: Detective Skye, please continue your testimony, if you would. Ema: Among them were a priceless urn and a statue that were stolen from the Fey clan. Press Apollo: Apollo: Were any other stolen artifacts found besides those belonging to the Feys? Ema: Yes. For instance... Remember the large relief on the wall? It was chiseled out some ancient ruins in the Kingdom of Khura'in several years ago. Apollo: Ch-Chiseled out...? Didn't that damage it? Ema: Well, he did restore the parts that were so faded you could barely see them anymore. It seems he intended to return it someday, so one could say his intentions were good. But good intentions are no get-out-of-jail-free card. That's a fact. Phoenix: If I might add, with respect for the deceased... ...the quality of the restorations was apparently exceptional. It seems the doctor invested a lot of money in hiring an extremely talented specialist. Athena: He sounds like a good man... who took a wrong turn somewhere. Apollo: (I guess Sarge takes after him in that way.) Ema: Any further questions? If not... Ema: It seems the doctor would do anything to study artifacts, including steal them. Press Apollo: Apollo: Had these alleged thefts been going on for some time? Ema: At least five years, as far as we can tell. All the recent thefts had been local... ...but before moving to Kurain Village, he had been stealing from ruins around the world. Apollo: (Dr. Buff was an international criminal?) Ema: This data lends itself to but one conclusion: Dr. Buff was a thief. Ema: As for the relic at the center of this dispute, he likely stole it from the Atishon residence. Press Apollo: Apollo: You claim he stole a family heirloom from the Atishon residence. But claiming something doesn't make it true. Ema: Unfortunately, it IS true. Apollo: How can you be so sure? Ema: A police report was filed concerning the theft -- one year ago, in fact. Apollo: What?! A whole year ago? Ema: August 25 of last year, to be exact. The report state, and I quote... \"The Crystal of Ami Fey was discovered to be missing... ...from the Atishon storehouse at 10 AM. The storehouse lock had been picked. Signed, Paul Atishon-Wimperson.\" Judge: Well, a year-old report certainly lends the the plaintiff's claim credence. The doctor could really have stolen the Crystal of Ami Fey. Phoenix: Not only that, Your Honor... ...but the Founder's Orb was only found to be missing several weeks ago. That is nearly a year after the crystal's theft was reported. Therefore, I believe we must consider the orb and the crystal to be two separate items. Apollo: ......... Athena: Paul Atishon-Wimperson? Not the most awe-inspiring tail end, is it? I see why he cut it. Apollo: Not that he inspires confidence without it. Still, I'd probably do the same in his shoes. Robbery Report added to the Court Record. Press (subsequent times) Apollo: Apollo: This police report say say the \"Crystal of Ami Fey,\" but... ...how do you know it's this relic right here? Ema: Because Mr. Atishon has stated as much. Apollo: (...Well, I'm not buying it.) Athena: Apollo, I was thinking... The plaintiff's legal name is pretty distinctive. Paul Atishon-Wimperson... Do we have any evidence related to his initials or his name? Apollo: We just might. It might even point out a flaw in something Ema said. Athena: You think her logic's faulty? Apollo: Yeah. If the doctor stole the relic from Mr. Atishon... er, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson... ...then there's one thing the doctor did that doesn't make any sense. Athena: Especially if Paul Atishon-Wimperson was desperately searching for his stolen relic. Apollo: (Okay, time to go over the evidence again.) Present E-Mail (after pressing fifth statement) Apollo: Leads to: \"The doctor stole the relic from the plaintiff?\" Before pressing fifth statement Athena: The trial's barely started and we're already backed into a corner. Apollo: To make matters worse the judge seems to agree with the plaintiff's case. But we've still got to give it our all. After pressing fifth statement Athena: A police report was filed about the crystal's theft a year ago. Apollo: But the theft of the Founder's Orb was only reported a few weeks ago. So the crystal's report was filed way before the orb was found missing. Athena: That suggests the stolen relic is the Crystal of Ami Fey, as Mr. Atishon-Wimperson asserts. Hmm... I doubt the police report is a fake. After all, Ema is the one who submitted it as evidence. Apollo: (Still, I feel like something we learned in the police report is important somehow...) Apollo: The doctor stole the relic from the plaintiff? Are you sure? Because that statement doesn't agree with a certain piece of evidence. Ema: What do you mean? Apollo: Take a look at this. Ema: What about it? Apollo: This contains an e-mail from the doctor's computer. Judge: ...E-mail? In that little piece of plastic? ......... I'm afraid I don't understand. Apollo: Oh, umm... This stick here can store all sorts of computer data. Judge: I still don't get it. Apollo: H-Here, just look at this! Apparently, the doctor was reporting his research findings to a certain individual. Now, take a look at this. It's the police report that Detective Skye presented to this court. You can see the plaintiff's legal name on it. Paul Atishon-Wimperson. Judge: I can see why'd he drop \"Wimperson\" from his name, but that's hardly breaking news. Apollo: Look closer, Your Honor. Phoenix: .........Ah! H-His initials! Apollo: Right. The plaintiff's full legal name is Paul Atishon-Wimperson. Now consider this... The e-mail's recipient address starts with three letters. Ema: P-A-W...? Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Don't tell me--! Apollo: Oh, but I will anyway. The individual who hired the doctor to study the disputed item... ...is none other than Paul Atishon-Wimperson. Ema: Wait, th-then that means... Apollo: Exactly. He wouldn't have asked the man who stole his family heirloom to study it. Therefore, how could this possibly be the Crystal of Ami Fey?! Ema: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! ...We never checked the doctor's e-mails. We couldn't even figure out the password to his computer. Apollo: The plaintiff willingly left the orb in the doctor's care so he could study it... ...at the behest of his \"benefactor\"! Ema: ...Wait. Then what about the police report? I have all the details of the theft right here! Apollo: It's probably for another relic -- the real Crystal of Ami Fey. He's just using the report as a way to claim that our orb is actually his stolen crystal. Phoenix: Phoenix: And how are you certain that \"PAW\" refers to my client's initials? Maybe the e-mail's recipient was a dog lover. Apollo: Perhaps. So let's get to know your client a little better, shall we? Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson! Atishon: Feh. I suppose shutting down detractors is all part of a politician's job. Apollo: Answer me this, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson: what is... Your shoe size? Apollo: What's your shoe size? Atishon: How should I know? Apollo: Wait, you don't know your own shoe size? Atishon: I have all my shoes handcrafted in Italy. And the shoemaker comes to my residence to take the necessary measurements. I have better things to do than memorize trivial information like that. Apollo: (Makes we wish I'd memorized the Italian for \"entitled jerk.\") Judge: Maybe this will help you memorize what happens to those who waste the court's time. Apollo: (I really put my foot in it this time.) Athena: Apollo, no matter what his shoe size is, there wouldn't be enough digits. We're looking for a three-digit number. Apollo: Oh, right. Let's see... Leads back to: \"Answer me this, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson: what is...\" Your favorite food? Apollo: What's your favorite food? Atishon: Curry rice. It's an old family favorite. Apollo: Really? As in, boil up some rice and dump some curry sauce on top? THAT curry rice? Atishon: Heh, I bet you assumed I would say French cuisine... ...just because I'm a member of the political elite. But nothing beats the delectable curry recipe my ancestors bright over from Japan. And I'm the kind of representative who upholds the value of such traditions! Apollo: (Is his entire strategy really just to pander to \"traditional values\" voters?) Judge: Your penalty is served, Mr. Justice. Let this be some food for thought! Athena: Apollo, why don't we take another look at the e-mail address? Apollo: No, it's fine! I just need another crack at this. Leads back to: \"Answer me this, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson: what is...\" Your birthday? Leads to: \"What is your birthday?\" Apollo: What is your birthday? Atishon: My birthday? It's July 11th, but what's it to you? (Changed from [My birthday? It's July 11, but what's it to you?] in the original release) ...Oh, I see. You can address birthday gifts to my office. But, full disclosure... I only accept gifts valued at one thousand dollars or more. (Changed from [But, full disclosure... I only accept gifts valued at $1,000 or more.] in the original release) Phoenix: ......... Judge: ......... Atishon: ...Hm? Why has everyone gone silent? Apollo: (How can anyone be that self-centered? Oh, right... politician.) Did everyone hear that? He said, \"July 11th.\" (Changed from [He said, 'July 11.'] in the original release) July 11 -- or rather, \"711\" -- matches the numbers in the e-mail address. Both the name and birthday are a match! I hardly think that's a coincidence! Atishon: .........Wait... Why you sneaky little--! Apollo: (Looks like someone finally decided to join the conversation.) Would the plaintiff care to explain? Atishon: I-I would like to say... that is q-quite... Apollo: Quite what? Atishon: Q-Quite... a thing... you've said. ......... Apollo Um... Any other thoughts? Atishon: No further comments. I stand by my previous statement. Apollo: Apollo: You can't just walk away. Even politicians have to explain themselves in a court of law! Atishon: ...I'm afraid I simply don't know how it happened. I can't possibly explain matters out of my purview. Perhaps it was a mistake on the part of my secretary? Apollo: (Oh no you don't, you slippery eel.) Mr. Wright, would you care to respond? Phoenix: ...I won't argue your assertion. My client lent the treasure in question to the doctor and asked him to study it. It seems that much is a fact. Apollo: (Now we're getting somewhere!) Phoenix: However, it has no bearing on the issue of ownership. Apollo: ...How so? Phoenix: Mr. Atishon, I fully understand your position here. You HAD to hide the fact that you sent the crystal out to be studied. Your family would've been very upset if they had found out. It's a family heirloom, after all. Apollo: You've got to be kidding me! Atishon: Mr. Wright is, well, right, of course. But then, he always is. That's why he's my lawyer. The crystal is a precious Atishon family heirloom, and has been for centuries. But Dr. Buff was so eager to study its proud heritage, I just couldn't say no. I didn't even tell my grandfather. Apollo: Apollo: But in order to win the backing of your so-called \"benefactor\"... ...you were going to give what you claim to be the Crystal of Ami Fey to that person? You were going to give a precious family heirloom away, just like that? Atishon: ...I-I was going to explain everything to grandfather later! Honest! Phoenix: My client's grandfather is very proud of his grandson for following in his footsteps. And if refusing him would've meant dashing the dreams of his darling grandson... ...I doubt the kindly old man could've said no. Judge: Well, grandchildren ARE meant to be spoiled. That's what grandfathers are for. Apollo: Your Honor... Please. (I mean, it's been in the family for centuries.) Atishon: My grandfather thinks highly of my talents as a politician. That's why he entrusted me with this very important name placard today. So I'm sure he would've been okay with me using the crystal as I saw fit. Apollo: (Grrr... Grandpa's spoiled little brat.) Athena: I think the judge is buying it, Apollo. Apollo: No surprise there. He's always going on and on about his own grandchild, after all. Ema: ...Excuse me. Can I leave now, Mr. Wright? I believe my work here is done. Phoenix: By all means, Detective Skye. Thank you for your assistance. Ema: You're welcome. It's nice to testify at a civil trial once in a while. See you around. Judge: Hmm... It seems the facts have changed somewhat. Mr. Atishon-Wimperson apparently lent his family heirloom to Dr. Buff. Mr. Justice. How would the defense like to proceed? Apollo: Oh, umm... (All right, now what?) Athena: Apollo, let's hear what what they know about this so-called \"Crystal of Ami Fey.\" Maybe we can find some inconsistencies in their statements. Apollo: Right... Okay then, Mr. Wright. If the item in question really is an Atishon family heirloom... ...then let's hear all your client knows about it. Phoenix: ...Of course. Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Please tell the defense everything you know about the crystal's origin. Atishon: All right. Now then, listen and learn. This is the tale of the Crystal of Ami Fey, and the illustrious history of the Atishon clan! Are you ready? Our story begins back in the old country, when the Atishon family reigned supreme... Witness Testimony -- The Illustrious History of the Atishon Clan -- Atishon: My ancestor was praised as a benevolent ruler. He protected the spirit mediums, a minority back then, from the rest of the locals. Some discriminated against them, you see, while others tried to abuse their power. As thanks, Ami Fey gave the crystal she had specially made as a gift to him. I am a descendent of that great lord. As such, my political power and influence is backed by centuries of history! Apollo: (Well, that devolved into a great load of self-aggrandizing propaganda fast.) Phoenix: As you can see... ...the Crystal of Ami Fey is an heirloom of the esteemed House of Atishon. Apollo: And you have proof that it has always been in the Atishon family? Phoenix: ...I have someone who gave a statement to that effect. My client's neighbor -- one Ives Shineto, age eighty-five -- gave the following statement: (Changed from [My client's neighbor -- one Ives Shineto, age 85 -- gave the following statement:] in the original release) \"The Atishons showed me the Crystal back when I was but a lad.\" Apollo: Apollo: Can we really trust the memory of an old man? Phoenix: ...Mr. Justice. Would you care you to explain that statement to the judge? Apollo: Oh... Er, I didn't mean-- What I'm trying to say is, um... Judge: Never underestimate the memory of your elders. I may forget my verdicts the next day, but the memories of my past are clear as day! Therefore, I find Mr. Ives Shineto's statement to be perfectly credible. Athena: Wow, did you see how Mr. Wright got the judge on his side? That's definitely a trick I want up my sleeve. Apollo: *sigh* You're not helping, Athena... Judge: You may cross-examine the witness, Mr. Justice. Cross Examination -- The Illustrious History of the Atishon Clan -- Atishon: My ancestor was praised as a benevolent ruler. Press Apollo: Apollo: Um, that object you set down there... Is it something of importance to you? Atishon: It's a name placard. This one here belonged to my grandfather, Abraham Atishon. He had it custom-made during his distinguished political career. It's special because it was crafted from the finest Italian plastic. Apollo: (I wasn't aware the Italians were famous for their fine plastic...) Atishon: Heh heh heh. You can touch it if you want. Apollo: No, I'm fine. Atishon: Very well. I'll just continue with my testimony. My ancestor was praised as a benevolent ruler. But he was also an eminent politician. Atishon: He protected the spirit mediums, a minority back then, from the rest of the locals. Press Apollo: Apollo: So I take it the relationship with the Fey clan was a close one. Atishon: A smooth and open line of communication with my entire electorate... That is the Paul Atishon way. Apollo: Huh...? Oh, sorry. I was asking about your ancestor. Atishon: Heh. Whether it's about me or my ancestor... ...feel free to ask me anything you'd like. Transparency in government! That's the Paul Atishon way. Apollo: (More like: Dodging questions! That's the Paul Atishon way.) Thanks. I'll be sure to ask when I have something you'll actually answer. Atishon: As I was saying, the Atishon family protected the Fey spirit mediums back then. Atishon: Some discriminated against them, you see, while others tried to abuse their power. Press Apollo: Apollo: Spirit mediums were targets of discrimination? Atishon: Yes. Some people even treated them like they were monsters. The transformation the mediums underwent when channeling spirits frightened the locals. And then there were those who tried to use them. Apollo: You mean they sought to control the channeling powers of the mediums? Atishon: Discriminating against a minority is absolutely despicable. A vote for me is a vote to end discrimination. I vow to root it out wherever it may be! That is my promise to you! Athena: He's totally ignoring your questions. It's like you're a moderator at a political debate. Apollo: Yeah, and only HE cares about his talking points. As thrilling as your campaign is, could we please get back to your testimony? Atishon: Feh. As you wish. Now then, as for the Crystal of Ami Fey... Atishon: As thanks, Ami Fey gave the crystal she had specially made as a gift to him. Press Apollo: Apollo: You said she had it made. So then it was made in Japan? Atishon: That's right. They say she hired a famous craftsman to make it. And they say it's quite valuable, too. Apollo: And you were going to take such a priceless family heirloom... ...and just give it to your patron? Atishon: Feh. That's so typical of you ignorant, common types. Making difficult decisions when the chips are down is what being a politician is all about. Apollo: (But only when it's in service of your own political career, you mean.) Atishon: The crystal is a testament to my ancestor's remarkable achievements. And furthermore... Present Research Notes Apollo: Leads to: \"You stated that Ami Fey had the crystal made for your ancestor.\" Atishon: I am a descendent of that great lord. Press Apollo: Apollo: So tell me, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, are you famous in Kurain Village? Atishon: You could say that. But I find my popularity to be rather bemusing. Apollo: Bemusing? Atishon: Yes, my campaign posters keep going missing as soon as I put them up. My avid supporters and female fans are likely taking them home to hang in their bedrooms. Apollo: (...I guess ignorance really is bliss.) Atishon: Heh heh heh. All this only proves my fine lineage. Atishon: As such, my political power and influence is backed by centuries of history! Press Apollo: Apollo: I'm sorry, but is any of that relevant to the issue of the relic's rightful owner? Atishon: ...Have you never heard of kingcraft? Apollo: Kingcraft? Atishon: It's the art of ruling as a king. My father drilled it into my head from a young age. And one of its precepts states: \"Ruin awaits a ruler who responds to every single issue posed by the masses.\" Apollo: (Well, that answered my question about what he meant by \"king of this nation.\" Progress.) Athena: Apollo, who is this Ami Fey, anyway? Apollo: I believe she was the founder of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Athena: The plaintiff claims she had the crystal made for his ancestor. That would mean it was made in Japan, right? Apollo: Yes, I suppose it would. Apollo: You stated that Ami Fey had the crystal made for your ancestor. So, am I to assume it was made in Japan? Atishon: That's right. The craftsmanship is unbeatable! Apollo: Well, that's strange. I don't see how your so-called crystal could've been made there. Atishon: What are you talking about? Apollo: It's quite obvious if you take a closer look at this. Present motif on Founder's Orb pedestal Apollo: Leads to: \"Take a look at the distinctive design here. According to Dr. Buff...\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: See this part right here? Doesn't it exude a mysterious, exotic charm? Judge: Hmm... I don't know about that. Phoenix: What I do know, Mr. Justice, is your assertion exudes a mysterious amount of nonsense. Apollo: ...Oops. Judge: And I assure you there's no mystery behind a penalty for aimless speculation, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Nope. No mystery there, Your Honor. Athena: Apollo, let's go over everything we have on the orb once more. Maybe there's something that can help us prove it wasn't made in Japan. Apollo: Your Honor, I can prove the orb wasn't made in Japan. Leads back to: \"It's quite obvious if you take a closer look at this.\" Apollo: Take a look at the distinctive design here. According to Dr. Buff... ...it's a mitamah motif dating back to the early days of the Kingdom of Khura'in. Judge: The Kingdom of Khura'in, hmm? And you base this on...? Apollo: Here, this piece of evidence, Your Honor. These are the doctor's research notes on the Founder's Orb. This is the box in which the orb was originally stored. It features the same pattern as the one found on the orb. Judge: Hmm... They do look like the same pattern. Apollo: Therefore, I assert that... ...the disputed item must have been made in the Kingdom of Khura'in! Atishon: AAAAAAAAAHHHH! Eeeeeeek! M-My placard...!!! Phoenix: Phoenix: The Kurain Channeling Technique originated in the Kingdom of Khura'in. And Ami Fey is known to have traveled there to train. With that in mind, what's to say she didn't bring that pattern back with her? Apollo: Apollo: But since this is CLEARLY a Khura'inese design... ...not even you can deny... ...the possibility that it was made there -- in the Kingdom of Khura'in! Phoenix: Phoenix: Anything is possible to some extent. That doesn't make it true. So you can't conclude that the orb is from Khura'in based solely on that pattern. If it were that simple... ...I could just as easily say it's Japanese. Judge: I have to agree with Mr. Wright. The pattern alone proves nothing. But that also means there's no basis to claim that the item in dispute was made in Japan, either. Hmm... At this rate, we're going nowhere fast. Apollo: (...Argh. He's right -- we're just spinning our wheels here.) Athena: I wonder if we have any evidence that could break this stalemate. Apollo: (Hmm... Evidence that could break this stalemate...) Exists Apollo: The defense would like to present a piece of evidence to the court. A piece that will finally break this stalemate! Phoenix: Oh? Well, you've sure piqued my interest. Let's see what you've got. Apollo: ...All right. I will now prove that this is, in fact, the Founder's Orb! Present anything Apollo: Phoenix: And just how does that piece of evidence prove that the relic is the Founder's Orb? Apollo: .........It doesn't, does it? Phoenix: Not by any means I can fathom. Athena: Sorry, Apollo, but I have to agree with the boss on this. Apollo: ...Me too, actually. Judge: Me three, defense! Apollo: Yikes! Judge: Time to think that one over again, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Y-Yes, Your Honor... Leads back to: \"Hmm... Evidence that could break this stalemate...\" Does not exist Leads to: \"There doesn't seem to be anything we can use. At least, not at this point.\" Apollo: There doesn't seem to be anything we can use. At least, not at this point. Athena: Well, unless we can find something, this trial won't be going anywhere. Atishon: ......... *whew* That's much better. Apollo: (What's his deal?) Phoenix: ...I have a suggestion. Why don't we consider this from a different angle? Apollo: I'm listening... Phoenix: What if... ...the Defiant Dragons really were authorized to take possession of the relic? Judge: Hmm... I'm afraid I don't know where you're going with this, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Consider the Orb Transfer Agreement, which states: \"I agree to hand over the Founder's Orb to the Defiant Dragons if I will come to no harm.\" What if, as the last part suggests, this was written under duress? That would render the agreement null and void. Apollo: ...What are you suggesting, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: While you were on your little cave expedition, I was investigating Dr. Buff's accident. And there was something you overlooked, Mr. Justice. Namely, that his \"accident\" might have actually been murder. Apollo: What?! (M-Murder?) Judge: M-Mr. Wright! You do realize such statements are not to be made lightly? Are you suggesting the doctor was murdered by the Defiant Dragons? Phoenix: Yes, but follow me on this for a sec. The books that came tumbling down were from the archeology shelf. However, among that mountain of books was a single volume on psychology. What's more, there was blood on it. Apollo: And you feel this is important because...? Phoenix: The took that came tumbling down were from the top shelf -- the archeology books. We know this because the doctor's books were meticulously organized by subject. Archeology took up the entire shelf, so that psychology book is completely out of place. Apollo: (Come to think of it, the shelves were arranged quite carefully.) Phoenix: It's also worth noting that psychology books only take up a tiny part of the bottom shelf. You might wonder why a book on psychology was found amid the pile of archeology books. But I believe I can explain what that single out-of-place book was doing there. The doctor was struck from behind while selecting a psychology book from the shelf. Apollo: And that's when the blood got on the book? Phoenix: Precisely. And to make it look like an accident... ...he was buried under a mountain of archeology books. Apollo: Apollo: W-Wait a second. This is all just speculation, right? Or do you have proof it was murder? Phoenix: Of course I do. Apollo: Y-You do? Phoenix: On a hunch, I had Detective Skye examine the doctor's head wound. She found that he'd been struck by the corner of some object or another. Apollo: Wait, what?! Phoenix: A would like that couldn't have resulted from a fall to a floor, you know. Do you understand what this means, Mr. Justice? The wound makes it crystal clear that Dr. Buff was murdered! Apollo: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Athena: Well, THAT was unexpected! Who'd have thought we'd break out of the stalemate like this! He pulled the ladder right out from under us. Apollo: (Still, if he thinks that's enough to make me back down, he's got another thing coming!) Even if the cause of death was murder, what makes you think it was the Defiant Dragons? You should know better than to hurl baseless accusations! Phoenix: Phoenix: Did you forget who you were up against, Mr. Justice? Apollo: Huh? Phoenix: You didn't actually think I'd come to court without witnesses and evidence, did you? Apollo: Wh-What are you talking about? Phoenix: I would like to request further testimony from the plaintiff. Specifically... ...I would like the court to hear how he saw one of the rebels leaving the crime scene! Apollo: He-- He-- He saw whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! Athena: If he can prove it was murder, that's the end of our client's right to the orb! Did he have this up his sleeve the whole time?! Apollo: Grrr... How could Mr. Wright do this to us? (He was just waiting to spring this trap!) Phoenix: ...Heh. Judge: Hmm... This trial has taken another unexpected turn. But I must mention, Mr. Wright, that you have yet to identify the murder weapon. Phoenix: The object used to commit the murder was not located at the scene of the crime. The murderer likely disposed of it elsewhere. Dr. Buff's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Judge: Well, I never thought we'd be deliberating the issue of murder at a civil trial. All right, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, your testimony, if you please. Atishon: Heh. Prepare to be dazzled! Dazzled by charismatic oration forged in the crucible of campaign battles! Witness Testimony -- The Rebel's Crime -- Atishon: That evening, I was walking alone, lost in thought. I passed by the doctor's house... and that's when I saw Mr. Are'bal. He was running out the front door. It was around 10 at night. Surely that must've been him fleeing the scene of his crime. A vote for me is a vote to end such violence. That is my promise to you! Judge: So the plaintiff saw a possible suspect fleeing from the doctor's residence? And it was within the window of the estimated time of death? Apollo: ......... (Datz Are'bal! What in the world were you doing there then?!) Study Photo updated in the Court Record. Phoenix: It seems that Mr. Are'bal was loitering about Kurain Village that day. There's evidence that he was in the doctor's study as well. Isn't that right, Mr. Justice? Apollo: ......Ah! You mean the suitcase? Phoenix: Exactly. He must have been in quite a rush to leave that behind. Oh, and by the way, Your Honor... ...Mr. Are'bal just so happens to be sitting in the gallery today. Datz: Ack! Phoenix: See? That's him trying to escape as we speak. Judge: Bailiff! Don't let that man get away! Datz: Wright, you backstabber! Why are you doing this to meeee?! Judge: All right. The... counsel-slash-defense may question the plaintiff-slash-witness once more. ...Ahem. Please proceed, Mr. Justice. Cross Examination -- The Rebel's Crime -- Atishon: That evening, I was walking alone, lost in thought. Press Apollo: Apollo: Why were you taking a walk? Atishon: Society is inundated with serious problems that must be solved. And as a politician... ...I'm always on the job, thinking hard about possible solutions, even on my walks. Apollo: Umm... (Thanks for the non-answer.) Atishon: While we live out our comfy lives... ...there are starving children who suffer in the back alleys of our major cities. It's not in me to ignore such suffering! A vote for me, is a vote to end hunger. ...And for world peace! Phoenix: Yes, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, we are well aware of your outstanding character. Now, please continue with your testimony. Atishon: Heh heh heh. I can practically hear my poll numbers surging. Now, on with my speech. After all, the voting public must be informed of the magnificence that is me! Atishon: I passed by the doctor's house... and that's when I saw Mr. Are'bal. Press Apollo: Apollo: Where exactly were you when you saw Mr. Are'bal? Atishon: Right here, under this tree. I saw him dashing out of Dr. Buff's front door. Apollo: And he didn't notice you? Atishon: No. I was hidden by the tree. Judge: Is it really all that important to know from where the plaintiff saw Dr. Buff? No, it isn't Apollo: No, I don't believe it bears any relevance to this case. Judge: All right, then. Will the witness please continue with his testimony? Leads back to cross-examination Yes, it is Apollo: Yes, I believe it matters a lot. I ask that it please be added to the witness's testimony. Adds statement \"I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal.\" if not already added Atishon: I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal. Press Apollo: Apollo: What were you doing under that tree? Atishon: A lack of lateral thinking... That is a politician's downfall. Apollo: What? Atishon: That is why, if I'm elected... I promise to think outside the box! Apollo: Um... uh... The question was, what were you doing under the tree, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. Atishon: Feh... I suppose I can't expect a plebeian such as yourself to understand my grand design. Apollo: (Oh, yeah? Try me, O Lord of Plebs.) Phoenix: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. I believe the court is well aware of your grand political vision. Now, let's have the rest of your testimony, if you please. Atishon: Heh, I can hardly wait for the upcoming election. Atishon: He was running out the front door. Press Apollo: Apollo: Did you notice anything unusual? Atishon: Yes, his behavior was incredibly suspicious. His eyes were darting all around as he ran off in total panic. As soon as I saw that, I knew he had done something, and it probably wasn't good. Apollo: Despite that, you still didn't report it to the police? Atishon: Who would've thought he had killed Dr. Buff? Not me. That's why I didn't report him. Judge: So the witness didn't notify the police. Is that an important statement, Mr. Justice? No, it isn't Apollo: No, it's not important. Judge: Hmm... All right, then. Let's have the witness continue with his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Yes, it is Apollo: Yes, it's important. I request that the witness add it to his testimony. Atishon: ...Feh. Sure, why not. Adds statement \"I had no idea Dr. Buff was dead. That's why I didn't call the police.\" if not already added Atishon: I had no idea Dr. Buff was dead. That's why I didn't call the police. Press Apollo: Apollo: You had no idea he was dead. In other words, you knew nothing about what had happened? Atishon: I am truly ashamed of myself. Apollo: What? Atishon: There's been a gruesome murder in my beloved village. What a fool I've been! I was thinking only of the village's future and world peace! It seems my earnest attitude and industrious nature have come back to haunt me! Apollo: (Only a politician would try to pass off self-aggrandizement as self-deprecation.) Athena: Apollo, you think this is how all politicians will be from now on? Apollo: We're all doomed if they are... Atishon: If you don't mind, I'd like to continue with my testimony. Present Study Photo or Study Diagram (after adding statement \"I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal.\") Apollo: Leads to: \"Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, rather than Mr. Are'bal...\" Atishon: It was around 10 at night. Surely that must've been him fleeing the scene of his crime. Press Apollo: Apollo: But at the time, you didn't know the doctor was dead. Is that correct? Atishon: ...It's true that I've been known as a prodigy from a very young age. Apollo: Huh? Atishon: I graduated high school and college with exceptional grades. As class president... ...I reformed stale old school traditions. My exploits were even covered in local papers. But as exceptional as I am, I can't possibly be expected to know everything at all times. Apollo: (This isn't working. He keeps bending the questions to serve his own needs.) Athena: Hang in there, Apollo! Phoenix: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. I believe the court is well aware of your exceptional nature. Now, would you please continue with your testimony? Atishon: Heh heh heh. I have the upcoming election in the bag. Atishon: A vote for me is a vote to end such violence. That is my promise to you! Press Apollo: Apollo: So, how do you actually intend to end such violence? Atishon: Elite politicians such as myself never reveal their strategies. Did you really think I would divulge such sensitive information to the likes of you? Apollo: Yeah, but, surely you have some sort of campaign platform you're running on? Atishon: ................................... ...No comment. Apollo: (Clearly, his is a platform, told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.) Before adding either statement Athena: They're accusing the Defiant Dragons of murder. If this sticks, we'll lose the orb! Apollo: Yeah, we need to sink Paul Atishon's testimony before it's too late. (Mr. Wright is pulling out all the stops. Then again, I'd expect nothing less from him.) After adding statement \"I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal.\", but before adding statement \"I had no idea Dr. Buff was dead. That's why I didn't call the police.\" Athena: He saw Mr. Are'bal from under that tree? Apollo, maybe there's some sort of an inconsistency there. Apollo: Hmm, I wonder... Athena: Why don't we review the evidence? Apollo: (Yeah. Maybe there's something we overlooked.) After adding statement \"I had no idea Dr. Buff was dead. That's why I didn't call the police.\", but before adding statement \"I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal.\" Athena: He didn't know the doctor was dead? Well, I guess that makes sense, considering the body was inside the study. Apollo: Right, how could he have known? (Guess I could find out where our weaselly witness was when he saw Datz.) After adding both statements Apollo: He said he saw Datz from under the tree. If that's true, then... Athena: Did you figure something out? Apollo: Yeah, I think he's hiding something. Let's take another look at the evidence, Athena. Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, rather than Mr. Are'bal... ...wasn't there's something else that should've had your undivided attention? Atishon: Like what? ...Oh, yes, of course! A politician must also keep his finger on the electorate's pulse, and focus on the nation's-- Apollo: Sorry, but you're way off. Atishon: I am? Hmm... Judge: Would you care to explain, Mr. Justice? Apollo: If the witness saw Mr. Are'bal from his position here... ...then he should've also been able to see the doctor's body. After all, it was right next to a huge window. Judge: Why, I believe you have a point there! Apollo: With the body THAT clearly visible to the witness... ...it's unthinkable that he wouldn't have reported it to the police! Phoenix: Ah! Judge: Hmm... Would the witness care to respond? Atishon: ........................... Apollo: ......... (Did he... fall asleep?) Judge: ...Um, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Atishon: ........................... Judge: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson!!! Atishon: Huh?! Oh, um. Hmm... There are many sides to any issue. Apollo: (What did I ever do to deserve this?) In any case, I'd like the court to acknowledge in the inconsistency in the witness's testimony. Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, did you really see Mr. Are'bal? Atishon: Yes! .................. Apollo: Apollo: Where do you think you're going?! Atishon: Oh, I thought I would return to my seat, seeing as I had already answered the question. Apollo: This isn't some small town hall debate, so you just stay right there until I say we're through. Atishon: I-I'll have to run that by my campaign manager before I... Apollo: Apollo: .........*glare* Atishon: *gulp* Phoenix: ...Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. I think it's time for you to come clean. Atishon: Huh?! Apollo: ...So then, does this mean he DIDN'T see Mr. Are'bal? Phoenix: As your lawyer, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson... ...I advise you divulge that matter we discussed. Silence is no longer an option. Atishon: ...Err, are you sure about this? I'm in the midst of running for office! I can't afford to let any strange rumors get out. Phoenix: Don't worry. You won't suffer any blowback for what you're about to reveal. Judge: \"Blowback\"? I'm not sure I like the sound of that, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Not to worry, Your Honor. Nothing untoward will come of this, I promise. Now then, Mr. Justice. Remember how it was an anonymous caller that reported the doctor's death? Apollo: Come to think of it... Apollo: Ema, who was the first one to discover the body? Ema: About that... Whoever it was, it seems they wanted to remain anonymous. Apollo: What? Ema: It happens now and then. Some people would rather not get involved with the police. Apollo: Wait... You're not saying that... Phoenix: Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. The anonymous source who contacted the police after discovering the body was... ...my client, Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson. Apollo: Wh-What?! (Y-You don't say...) Phoenix: So you see, he played his part as a concerned citizen -- quite admirably, if I may say so. Isn't that right? Atishon: .........Y-Yes, indeed... In our society today, there are too many who choose indifference over righteous action. But I don't number among them. That's why I did my duty as a concerned citizen. One might call me THE model citizen -- one worthy of standing above all the rest! Apollo: (What a real standard-bearer he is, reporting it anonymously.) Phoenix: ...Oh, and by the way, Mr. Justice. Wasn't there someone else at the scene of the crime when my client discovered the body? Apollo: ...Oh, um, you mean Mr. Are'bal? He would have been leaving the doctor's house right around then... Wait, th-that means...! Phoenix: Yes, it does. In short... ...what my client witnessed was Mr. Are'bal fleeing the scene of a heinous murder! Apollo: ...Aaaaaaah! Phoenix: And that's not all! Based on what we've heard so far... ...Mr. Are'bal looked exceedingly suspicious, and that's putting it mildly. We already know the Defiant Dragons threatened the doctor with bodily harm. And now that they've killed him, the so-called Orb Transfer Agreement is null and void! Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Athena: A-Apollo! If we don't come up wit with some sort of counterargument...! Apollo: A-And what sort of evidence do you have? Can you actually prove that it was Mr. Are'bal who killed the doctor? Athena: That move had \"desperate\" written all over it. Apollo: It's all I've got, so I'm going with it! Phoenix: ...Evidence? I suppose it's true that I don't have any... Apollo: I-I knew it! Phoenix: But I do have another witness. Apollo: You do? Phoenix: You should know I always come fully prepared, Mr. Justice. And my new witness will provide testimony proving Mr. Are'bal's guilt. Apollo: ...Gnrggh! Athena: A new witness? I wonder who it could be. Judge: ...Very well. Bailiff, please summon our new witness. In the meantime, the court will take a brief recess. I would like both sides to use this time to prepare properly, understood? May 17District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Apollo: Wow. I knew Mr. Wright would put up a tough fight, but... Athena: Yeah! Just when I thought we had him, he'd turn the tables on us. He really is the Turnabout Terror. Apollo: (We can't let him blindside us again.) Datz: Looks like they've got me again! Three times in one year! \"Datz\" a new record! Har har har har har har! Apollo: Datz, please... No more new records -- or bad puns, while you're at it. It's hard enough trying to help you as it is. Datz: Roger that. I'll be more careful next time! Dhurke: Datz, is what Mr. Wright said true? Did you really pay a visit to Dr. Buff that night? Datz: Sure did. Can't remember the exact time, though. All I know is he wouldn't hand over the orb. Someone put it in his head that we rebels were dangerous. That's why he threw me out. Apollo: So the doctor was still alive when Datz last saw him. Athena: We'll still have to prove it, though. Dhurke: ...Better brace yourself, son. The next witness's testimony could make or break this case. Apollo: Yeah, I know. Hey, where's Trucy? Athena: She went to go see her dad. Apollo: Hmm... Maybe she's still mad. Athena: More like worried. Worried that this trial will create a rift between you two... ...and that you might then leave the agency. Apollo: Ha ha ha. She has an active imagination. Bailiff: Excuse me. The trial will be resuming shortly. Apollo: Well, let's go see what new testimony awaits us. May 17District Court - Courtroom No. 6 Judge: All right, court is back in session. Mr. Wright, you said you had a witness...? Phoenix: Your Honor, I would like to call the lone survivor of the doctor's murder to the stand. Apollo: (Wait.. He can't mean... that Sarge is here?) You mean Dr. Buff's reclusive son? How did you get him to cooperate? Phoenix: ...Nothing a little persuasion couldn't handle. The poor child only agreed to help if it meant catching the killer. Apollo: (Getting a kid like that to overcome his fear... Now that's impressive.) Athena: This must be really important testimony for the kid to come out in public like this. Judge: Very well, Mr. Wright. Please call your witness to the stand. Judge: .........Oh, my! Sarge: Sergeant Buff at your service, sir! Apollo: ...He's here as the drone? Really? Judge: ...Um, Mr. Wright? What exactly is the meaning of this? Phoenix: Past trauma has rendered it impossible for the witness to venture into public. Leaving home was hard enough. And it seems leaving the witness lobby was just too much. But I would still like to continue with testimony delivered via this drone. Judge: Hmm... I understand it must be terrible to lose one's father like that... ...but testimony via a remote control toy? .........Well, let's take things for a spin and see how it goes. Apollo: (Just who's piloting this trial, anyway?!) Athena: The judge sure warmed up to the idea fast. Apollo: I think the phrase you're looking for is \"gave up.\" Sarge: You disappoint me, Corporal Justice! To think I once called you comrade! Apollo: AAAAAAAAAGH! Sarge: Defending the man who killed Papa?! That's full-on treason, soldier! I hereby demote you back to \"private\"! Athena: \"Corporal\"? \"Private\"? What's he talking about, Apollo? Apollo: It's... a long story. Judge: Now then, are you ready to testify, youngster? Sarge: Locked and loaded, sir! Ready to rain lead down upon the perpetrator! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Witness Testimony -- What Happened That Evening -- Sarge: Papa met with someone the night he died. I didn't have eyes on the ground, as I'd already mounted my siege defense, but... ...I did hear him arguing with someone in his study! From my window, I saw the one designated \"Datz\" getting ejected from the premises. After that, the man lingered around the perimeter for some time. He must have regrouped and killed my papa in the study later -- I just know it! Judge: Hmm... So he was thrown out, but later returned and committed the murder, did he? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. So the man my client saw... ...really must have been the fleeing Mr. Are'bal. Datz: Datz: Objeeeeection! Wright, you backstabbing, no good--! I-I didn't kill no one! Sarge: It's the enemy! Ready all missiles! And... FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRE!! Datz: WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA!!! Sarge: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Capitalist pig! I'll turn you into pork stroganoff! And that's just a taste of my ultimate anti-swine weapon! Apollo: (Whoa! It fires missiles, too?!) Judge: ...Yes, well, the witness is all yours, Mr. Justice. Cross Examination -- What Happened That Evening -- Sarge: Papa met with someone the night he died. Press Apollo: Apollo: Your father met with \"someone\"? Could you be more specific? Sarge: No. I was in the midst of a crucial defensive siege operation. Apollo: Right... You're referring to how you don't leave your room, correct? Sarge: You never know where the enemy might be lurking outside the siege perimeter. Apollo: What about, you know, school? Sarge: Oh, uhhh... I don't go to boot camp! I'm a soldier! A sergeant doesn't associate with rookies still too green to fight! Apollo: (With a kid like this, I bet Dr. Buff won't be getting any rest in the afterlife, either.) Judge: Hmm... It was very brave of you to come to the courthouse today. But what was that you said about a siege defense? Sarge: Oh, that? Well... Sarge: I didn't have eyes on the ground, as I'd already mounted my siege defense, but... Press Apollo: Apollo: Um, Sarge? I've always wondered... ...who or what are you battling? Sarge: ! Th-That's... classified. Apollo: Even so, it may be relevant to this case. Phoenix: Phoenix: Umm... I don't know if YOU'RE the right person to be asking things like that... Athena: That's right. Such matter need to be handled with a certain delicacy. Apollo: Oh, ha ha ha. I guess curiosity got the better of me. Sarge: You're all talk and no action, soldier! Out on the battlefield, it ain't the number of pretty words in yer repertoire... ...but the number of bullets in yer gun belt that counts! Apollo: (Easy for you to say. You're the one with all of them. Judge: Would the witness please tell the court what he saw and heard that night? Present Sarge's Drone Apollo: Leads to: \"Sarge, are you hiding something from me?\" Sarge: ...I did hear him arguing with someone in his study! Press Apollo: Apollo: What was the argument about? Sarge: I heard things like, \"Where's the orb?!\" and \"Are you Defiant Dragons really criminals?!\" It sounded real volatile, like a war might break out any second! Apollo: (So the two of them had an argument when Datz came to get the orb.) Did you see or hear anything else? Sarge: Yeah. I heard them arguing, and then, silence. Sarge: From my window, I saw the one designated \"Datz\" getting ejected from the premises. Press Apollo: Apollo: How was Mr. Are'bal acting? Sarge: Like a conquered trooper retreating with his tail between his legs. Apollo: A \"trooper\"...? Well, I guess he does dress like he's in the military. Athena: I bet those two would have really hit it off had they met under different circumstances. Apollo: Yeah, I can see that. Sarge: And so, the defeated soldier was expelled. But that wasn't the end. Sarge: After that, the man lingered around the perimeter for some time. Press Apollo: Apollo: That... does seem suspicious. Sarge: He kept hiding behind trees and telephone poles, and stealing glances at our house. Apollo: Well, he couldn't exactly leave without the orb...) Sarge: I bet he was angry that he'd been kicked out. Sarge: He must have regrouped and killed my papa in the study later -- I just know it! Press Apollo: Apollo: But don't you keep your front door unlocked? If so, anyone could've gotten in.. Sarge: That's true. Papa didn't keep our house locked up. He said there was no need because there were only good people in Kurain Village. Apollo: (Yet he ended up dead, anyway.) Sarge: Only a monster could do what they did to my kind, trusting Papa! There will be no mercy! I vow swift and terrible vengeance! I'll carpet-bomb the killer with everything in my arsenal! FIIIIIIRE!!! Judge: While I sympathize with you, witness, you will refrain from firing Gatling guns in this court. Athena: So Sarge saw Datz, too. Apollo: And just when I thought things couldn't get any worse. I wonder why he hung around after getting thrown out? Athena: I hate to say this, but if Datz is proven to be the killer... ...we'll lose the orb to the plaintiff. So our only option is to prove the Defiant Dragons had nothing to do with the murder! Apollo: Sarge, are you hiding something from me? Sarge: H-How dare you question your superior officer like that! You wanna get in on this stroganoff action with pig-boy over there, soldier?! Apollo: Sorry, but I'm afraid lawyers are missile-proof. Sarge: Wh-What?! Judge: Would the defense care to explain? Apollo: It's simple, Your Honor. Just as he is able to see what is happening in court right now... ...Sarge was able to see what happening in the study then. With his cherished drone, of course. Judge: Ahhh! Now that you mention it... And to think, the answer was right before our eyes this whole time. Apollo: Sarge! You were perfectly capable of patrolling the study that night! So you must've seen something! Sarge: Aaaaaaaaaagh! I'm hit! What is this strange new weaponry you're using against me?! Apollo: Courtroom warriors don't use guns or missiles, because evidence is our weapon of choice! And the evidence has exposed your bald-faced lie! My truth bomb, Sarge... has stripped your defenses bare! Sarge: A t-t... truth bomb?! Noooooooooooo! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH! Mayday, mayday!!! I'm going doooooooown!!! Judge: Oh, my! Are you all right?! Sarge: *cough* *sputter* Evidence... Never have I seen such fearsome ordnance. Apollo: Tell it to us straight, Sarge. After all, you want to help your father, don't you? Sarge: Papa... Apollo: Yes. You want to find out who killed him, don't you? So please. Tell us what you saw that night. Sarge: ...It's... It's... It's not what you think. I-I... I... I didn't see anything. I swear...! Apollo: ...You sure? You seem awfully stressed for someone who didn't see anything. Sarge: ...Grrrrrrr! Apollo: UWAAAAAAHHH! ...S-Sarge. You need to answer my question. Sarge: Shut your piehole, maggot! It'll be a scorching day in Siberia before a lowly private like you orders me around! Apollo: (...What's with him and Siberia, of all places? But if a scorching day is what it'll take, then maybe it's time to turn up the heat.) Hey, Athena. You think a therapy session might help? Athena: Well, it could help alleviate some of his anxiety. NOISE LEVEL100% Athena: ...Plus, I'm picking up a lot of discord in Sarge's voice. That usually means the patient wants to say something, but can't for some reason. Apollo: And in Sarge's case, I imagine whatever's plaguing him is pretty severe. In that case, I leave it to you and your Mood Matrix magic! Athena: You got it! Your Honor, I believe I can be of help here. Judge: Time for a therapy session, is it, Ms. Cykes? Athena: Yes. It will help the witness with his anxiety -- maybe even enough to testify! Judge: Then by all means, please bring the poor child out into the light of day. ...Oh, but I assume this will be all right with you, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Why not? It's not like we all haven't been through this before. Sarge: Wh-What are you butting in for, lady?! There ain't a place on this battlefield for you! Athena: Athena: I beg to differ, Sarge. This G.I. Jane's always ready for a fight in the courtroom! And wait until you see what I've got in my arsenal -- analytical psychology! With it, I'm going to blow a big ol' hole in the armor you've built around your heart! Sarge: UWAAAAAAH! First evidence, now analytical psychology?! Where are these WMDs coming from?! ...W-Well, if it's a battle you want, bring it on! You may have started this war, but I'm going to end it, Corpswoman Cykes! Athena: You got it, Sarge. Time to seek out the agony buried deep in your heart. Widget: Brace yourself! Sarge: I stayed in my room with my drone that evening. Sarge: I heard Datz and Papa arguing with each other. Sarge: Datz got kicked out, but I saw him still hanging around outside. Pinpoint Surprised marker Apollo: Leads to: \"That's strange...\" Sarge: I was in my room, so I didn't know Papa was dead until the next day. Pinpoint Surprised marker Apollo: Leads to: \"That's strange... You reacted with shock when you discovered your father's body... \" Apollo: So I'm looking for unexpected emotions and unnatural reactions, right? Athena: Right -- emotions and reactions that don't fit the content of his testimony. When you find one, make sure you point it out to me. Also, remember not to view his emotional reactions in isolation. Sometimes, it's important to see how they change from one statement to the next. Apollo: Okay, I'll give it a try. Apollo: That's strange... You reacted with shock when you discovered your father's body... ...yet, you weren't nearly as shocked then as when you saw Mr. Are'bal. Normally, you'd expect the death of one's father to be much more impactful. Sarge: ...Enemy fire! Direct hit!!! Athena: That IS strange. I wonder what it could mean. Apollo: Well, we know he wasn't as affected by his father's death as he should've been. And I think I know why. Athena: Oh? Apollo: Sarge, you weren't as shocked at seeing your father's body as seeing Mr. Are'bal because... You're scared of Mr. Are'bal Apollo: Maybe you were scared of him? Sarge: Why you--! How could you even THINK I was scared of that capitalist pig! Apollo: So you weren't scared? Sarge: Listen up, trainee! You feckless amateurs don't even know what true fear is! Naïve little babies like you wouldn't last two seconds out there. So he's your first lesson, private! A heaping spoonful of true, battlefield terror! Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Athena: I think that means you were wrong. But there's no need to look so bitter about it, Apollo. Apollo: No, but that was some bitter medicine... (Ugh, the aftertaste of failure...) Leads back to: \"Sarge, you weren't as shocked at seeing your father's body as seeing Mr. Are'bal because...\" You'd already seen his body Leads to: \"Sarge...\" Something else shocked you Apollo: Did... something else shock you when you saw Mr. Are'bal? Something even more shocking than your father's death? Athena: Hmm, like what exactly, Apollo? Apollo: I don't know... Maybe a mouse or a cockroach? Athena: Eeeuuuwww, gross!!! Sarge: Foolish cannon fodder! Vermin are powerless in the fact of my deadly arsenal! I'll pump 'em full of lead! Apollo: Sounds kinda messy, don't you think? Sarge: ...Ah! Th-Then I'll develop new weaponry! Maybe a flamethrower'd do the trick... Apollo: S-Sure... As long as you keep it \"for vermin use only\"... Athena: Guess it wasn't something like mice or cockroaches after all, huh. Apollo: No, but it was worth a try -- especially to see your reaction. (*sigh* What else could it be...?) Leads back to: \"Sarge, you weren't as shocked at seeing your father's body as seeing Mr. Are'bal because...\" Apollo: Sarge... Maybe the truth is, you left your room that night. And that's when you saw it -- your father's body. Sarge: I-I saw no such thing! Apollo: Really? You didn't see his body? All right then, what DID you see? Sarge: Err... NOISE LEVEL70% Athena: Look, Apollo! We've lost some noise! Apollo: So, just as I suspected... he really did see something. Sarge! Please. Tell us what you saw. Sarge: Ooh... B-B-But... .................. ........................... I-I... The moment I saw it, ooh... ...I-I.. I couldn't bear it. I couldn't stand to lose yet another loved one. Apollo: Huh? (Am I missing something here?) Is that you weren't very shocked when you found out your father was dead? Because you had already sensed he was a goner somehow? Sarge: M-Maybe... Apollo: Please, Sarge. What was it you saw on the night of your father's murder? Sarge: Ooh... Gah gah gah gah. I-I... I saw... ...Agh. Gah. Hrgh. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! UHWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Apollo: Wh-What's happening?! (I don't like where this is going...) Sarge: YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH! NO MORE! NO MORE, PLEEEEEEAAASE!!! Athena: Eeeeeek! Widget: Help! Sarge: I've confiscated your little toy! The battlefield has no place for unauthorized equipment! Athena: W-Widget...! A-Apollo! I can't continue the rest of the session without him! Judge: C-Calm yourself this instant, witness! I hereby order you to submit to your therapy session! What in blazes...?! Sarge: Lookit me! I'm judge, jury, and executioner now! I hereby convene a military tribunal! Apollo: Whoa, whoa... This has gone way too far. Judge: B-Bailiff! Arrest that drone this instant! Sarge: RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWRRRRRR! Bailiff: Stop resisting! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGHHHHH! If you don't come quietly, I'll--! Sarge: FIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRE! Bailiff: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Athena: Give Widget back right-- EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEKKK!!! .................................................................. Athena: *huff* *puff* *cough, cough* Whew, finally got him back. Apollo: Nice work. Judge: Hmm... This witness is truly a handful. Sarge: Ooh... hup, two, three, four... Uwoooooooooooooooooooooooooooh! Phoenix: Ms. Cykes, what is the witness's current psychological state? Athena: Let's see... He's emotionally all over the map. Apollo: So his out-of-control emotions are in control of him, huh. Does that mean we can calm him down if we can figure out the root cause? Athena: Yes. So let's see what we can find. Sarge! Can you hear me? Sarge: Ooh... I-Is that you, Corpswoman Cykes? Athena: I'm here. Now, I want you to take a few deep breaths. Just try to relax. Try it with me. Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out. Sarge: In... Out... In... Out... Athena: And now... Let your emotions take you where they will. Go on, just let it all out! Sarge: UHWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!!! All forces, attaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack! Apollo: (...That's the LEAST relaxing breathing exercise I've ever seen.) Sarge: Datz was still hanging around after he got kicked out when... Sarge: ...I heard more fighting, and I got worried about Papa. Sarge: So I left my room, but suddenly... Sarge: ...I got dizzy and passed out. Sarge: I remember a flame lighting up the room... Probe Flames Apollo: Leads to: \"That's it!\" Sarge: ...and Papa grinning with delight. Probe Flames Apollo: Leads to: \"That's it!\" Sarge: That's when he must have been killed. If only I hadn't passed out! Apollo: So he has two out-of-control emotions, huh. And all we have to do is find out what's causing them to run wild like this? Athena: Yes. Whatever the cause, it should appear somewhere in the Mood Matrix. Let me know if you think you've found it. Apollo: Ugh... Easier said than done. Don't suppose you have any ideas on where to start? Athena: Well... I would think about Sarge's personality and his past. Those are the things that shape a person's emotions. You should be able to find something to work with from there! Apollo: That's it! Sarge... You were overcome with shock and fear when you saw those flames, weren't you? Sarge: Was I...? Apollo: Yes. Just six months ago... ...you and your mother were caught up in an arsonist's blaze. So it's no wonder you would be extremely scared of fire. Sarge: ...Y-Yes, that does make sense. Athena: And maybe, just maybe... ...your subconscious fear of fire was what caused you to withdraw from the world. Sarge: What do you mean, Corpswoman Cykes? Athena: In the outside world, you were bound to come across all sorts of fire. Candles, cigarettes... heck, even the grill at a diner. Even if it's not that often, just the idea that you might see them... ...grew bigger and bigger until you couldn't shut it out. Sarge: ...! I... I think you might be onto something. Candles, cigarettes... Just thinking about them sends a chill down my spine. Apollo: (Wow, the things I take for granted.) Sarge: Now I see. I was afraid... Afraid of the fire. Strange, I didn't even realize it myself. Apollo: About that fire, Sarge... Can you tell me what it was burning? Athena: Just stay calm and maybe something will come to you. Sarge: Oh, umm... ............. ..................Oh! I'm starting to remember! I-It was...! It was that relic! That relic Papa was studying... It was on fire! Apollo: The orb... was on fire? Sarge: Mm-hm. It's still kind of fuzzy...  ...but yes, the \"orb\" was burning right in front of Papa. And there... in the flames was... ...Mama? Yes! Now I remember... I saw Mama appear amid the dancing flames! Apollo: Wait... WHAAAAAAAAAT?! NOISE LEVEL30% Apollo: Wh-What's going on here? Athena: Maybe it's a memory from the fire that killed his mother. Hmm... He might be confusing it with what really happened when his father died. Apollo: So let me guess... More therapy? Athena: Yep. But this time, it seems there's an inconsistency in his statements. And I think we should be able to prove that with the evidence at hand. Apollo: (I hope this inconsistency is the key... ...to proving that the relic is really the Founder's Orb!) Sarge: Datz was still hanging around after he got kicked out when... Sarge: ...I heard more fighting, and I got worried about Papa. Sarge: So I left my room, but suddenly, I got dizzy and passed out. Sarge: I remember a flame lighting up the room, and Papa grinning with delight. Sarge: The relic was on fire, and I saw Mama's face inside. Sarge: That's when he must have been killed. If only I hadn't passed out! Present Founder's Orb Apollo: Leads to: \"Don't blame yourself, Sarge.\" Athena: I believe Sarge's fear of fire is triggering a past memory. As a result, the memory of what he really saw is being suppressed. When he tries to remember, the past memory is being overlaid onto the more recent one. Apollo: Wow, the mind sure is a tricky beast. So, I'll just have to find an inconsistency? Athena: Right. Once you find an inconsistent statement... ...present the evidence that proves it. Apollo: (The main issue here is when the doctor was murdered. Was he really killed while Datz was there?) Apollo: Don't blame yourself, Sarge. After all, even if you hadn't passed out... ...the outcome would've been the same. Sarge: What do you mean? Apollo: I'm talking about the time of death. Your father wasn't killed right after you left your room. Sarge: Wh-What?! Explain yourself at once, Private Justice! Apollo: You said you saw your father burning the orb, right? But that night, he went out to hide it in a cave. So, what you saw, Sarge... ...was something that happened before your father left to hide the orb. Sarge: Ah! Apollo: So you see, you didn't pass out right before he was killed. You passed out right before he left for the cave, to hide the orb in the ruins within. Sarge: S-So, even if I hadn't passed out... Apollo: That's right. The outcome would've been exactly the same. That's because your father, Dr. Buff, was killed after he returned from the ruins. And therefore, Sarge, there's no need to blame yourself. Sarge: Oh... I see... .............. ................................ Private Justice... Can... Can you really say I bear no blame in this? Apollo: ...Why do you ask? Sarge: .........Because... the truth is... ...if I hadn't engaged in my siege defense, Papa would still be alive. Apollo: Sarge... Sarge: Papa wished nothing more than for me to lead a happy, healthy life. That's why he quit his job and moved us out, away from the big city. But even then, I didn't have the courage to set foot into the outside world. And in the end... ...I failed to make Papa's wish come true. Sarge: ..................... ???: ...Um, Sarge? Athena: If you want to make your father's wish come true... If that's what you really want... ...then who's to say it's too late? Why don't you take the first step now? Sarge: ...My first step? Athena: That's right. You can cast off all your regret. You can stop standing still and start moving forward. You have the power within you. I know from experience. I know what's it like to feel like you do. But only you... only you can decide to take the first step! Sarge: ................................ Apollo: If you don't change your tactics now, Sarge... ...the victory you seek in the war you're waging will always lie beyond your grasp. Sarge: ................................................ Hmm... I think I understand now. I've... I've made up my mind! Apollo: ! Sarge: As of this moment... ...I will suspend my siege defense indefinitely! Apollo: ...............Huh? ???: S-Sergeant Buff, r-reporting for duty. Apollo: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! I-I-I thought you were a guy! Athena: You're DEFINTELY not the gruff drill sergeant I envisioned! ???: W-Well, my mama was in the Russian army. Phoenix: I was just as shocked, but it certainly explained a few things when I found out, too. May I introduce to you Miss Armie Buff, age twelve. (Changed from [May I introduce to you Miss Armie Buff, age 12.] in the original release) Apollo: N-No way... Armie: Careful, soldier! Don't forget I could blow you away at a moment's notice! Athena: S-She's just too cute... Apollo: So... Have you always been in a wheelchair, Sarge? Armie: Negative. Only since I was injured... in the fire. Judge: Umm... Your voice sounds awfully different from before. Armie: My drone features a voice modulation device. It's just one of my army's many technological marvels. Judge: Well, you fooled me. I thought some twenty-something military fanatic was at the controls. Armie: I-If it's all the same to you, troops, I'd like to continue my testimony! I've just remembered something! And it's as crisp and clear as a trumpet at roll call. Apollo: What did you remember? Armie: It wasn't my mother who appeared in the burning orb. It was some lady Papa had shown me a picture of a long time ago. He said it was the Holy Mother, the founder of Khura'inism. She appeared right there, right in the burning orb! Apollo: Huh...?! Phoenix: What did you just say?! NOISE LEVEL0%BYE BYE Athena: The Holy Mother of Khura'inism was in the burning orb? Wh-What does that even mean? Phoenix: ...I have a bad feeling about this. Apollo: Could it be...? Could this explain what Sarge means by the Holy Mother appearing in the burning orb? Present Research Notes Apollo: Leads to: \"Dr. Buff's research notes? What do they have to do with this?\" Present anything else Apollo: Armie: What's that? Apollo: A piece of related evidence. Wouldn't you agree? Although, to be honest, I'd have to plead the fifth if you asked me how certain I was. Sarge: Private! Did you really think such a cockamamie plan would rout out the enemy?! Apollo: Yiiiiiikes! {I'd better be more careful!) Athena: If the orb was burning, maybe the evidence you're looking for has to do with fire. Apollo: Yeah, I know. Leads back to: \"Could this explain what Sarge means by the Holy Mother appearing in the burning orb?\" Athena: Dr. Buff's research notes? What do they have to do with this? Apollo: Look at this! The burning orb, the appearance of the founder -- this part points to both! Present third stanza of Song of Ceremony Apollo: Leads to: \"There's a legend about the orb involving a mysterious riddle.\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: It's all... right here! Athena: Umm.. I'm not seeing it. Apollo: Well, it's... Maybe you can explain it, Athena. Athena: I'M not the one who's supposed to explain things when YOU'RE the one presenting! Apollo: (Yikes, she's really mad. I'd better come up with something before her anger burns me to a crisp.) Leads back to: \"Look at this! The burning orb, the appearance of the founder -- this part points to both!\" Apollo: There's a legend about the orb involving a mysterious riddle. And this song, in turn, is said to contain the key to solving it. If the legend is true, then I believe the answer lies in this part of the song: \"Offer thy prayers as fervent as fire Only then shall the Holy Mother return.\" ...Well? Anyone see where I'm going with this? Phoenix: Prayers as fervent as fire... ...Ah! You're supposed to... set the orb on fire? Apollo: The whole stanza seems to suggest that the founder will appear if the orb is set on fire. Athena: ...Wait! S-So the doctor! He...! Apollo: ...Yes, Athena. He had solved the ancient riddle of the Founder's Orb! Judge: Oh, my! Armie: Papa was a great archeologist. So I believe in him... and I want to believe... I want to believe he achieved his long-time dream of solving that riddle before he died. Apollo: Well, we won't know for sure... until we try it for ourselves. Armie: Yes, do it, Private Justice. Please! I want to see what Papa was searching for with my own eyes! Phoenix: Phoenix: The, uh... The plaintiff must object to this! Apollo: Apollo: The plaintiff will stand down and be quiet! Phoenix: Phoenix: Y-You don't have the right to set a precious relic like that on fire! Apollo: Apollo: Oh, but I do. All I needed was Sarge's permission. Since we still don't know if this treasure if the Founder's Orb or the Crystal of Ami Fey... ...any ownership rights the doctor had now belong to his daughter. Therefore, you have absolutely no right to stop us! Phoenix ...Gnrk! Judge: Very well, Mr. Justice. I never thought I'd be saying this, but you may burn the evidence. Apollo: All right, here we go! Apollo: Look! Athena: A-Apollo! The inside of the orb... It's melting! Apollo: There's something in there... Ahhhhhhhhhh! Dh-Dhurke! Isn't she...? Dhurke: Her garb leaves no room for doubt. It's the founder herself! Face and all... Dhurke: I-I don't understand. The greatest of taboos in Khura'inism... ...is the depiction of the founder's face. Yet here it is, hidden within this orb! Founder's Orb updated in the Court Record. Apollo: Sorry, Mr. Wright, but as you can see, the issue is \"crystal\" clear. This figure is the Holy Mother, founder of Khura'inism. And based on that, this must be none other than the Founder's Orb! Phoenix: Phoenix: B-Be that as it may, Mr. Are'bal still may have killed the doctor! If so, it would render the Orb Transfer Agreement null and void! Apollo: Don't play dumb, Mr. Wright. The truth of the matter has already been proven! Dr. Buff wasn't killed right after Sarge saw Mr. Are'bal. It happened after the doctor came back from hiding the orb. And you've no proof that Mr. Are'bal was still around at the time! Phoenix: ...Urrrrrrrgh. Apollo: Your claim that the Defiant Dragons were behind the crime doesn't hold water. And that means the Orb Transfer Agreement is still perfectly valid. Phoenix: ...Arrrrrrrgh. Apollo: Admit it, Mr. Wright. I just burned your whole case to the ground! Phoenix: Ooh... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Apollo: (I won? I actually won?) Judge: M-Mr. Wright! Would you care to respond? Phoenix: .........R-Respond? ...Um... Apollo: (I didn't think so!) Athena: Wait, did we just win? Did we actually beat the Turnabout Terror?! You're amazing, Apollo! Atishon: Don't just stand there, Wright! Do something! Phoenix: ...Umm, well... I don't think there's any digging out of this hole. Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, I think it's time for your concession speech. I have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that this is the Founder's Orb. The facts don't lie, but you obviously do. How's that for a campaign slogan? Atishon: Wh-Why you contemptuous peasant...! Judge: ...Hmmm. I think this is a good time to wrap up this trial. If both parties have no further objections, I will render my verdict. Apollo: No objections here, Your Honor. Phoenix: Err... Um... No ob-- Atishon: Atishon: You can't do this. The crystal is mine! I'll lose the election if I lose that crystal! Phoenix: I'm sorry, but there's really nothing more I can do. Atishon: ...You haven't forgotten about our little chat... have you? Phoenix: ! .......... Apollo: (What's going on here?) Phoenix: Phoenix: ...Y-Your Honor. I...I object to the defense's last claim! Apollo: What?! Phoenix: I don't believe they have truly proven that the relic is indeed the Founder's Orb. Apollo: Apollo: Mr. Wright. I don't think even you could bluff your way out of this one! What possible argument could you have to claim that this isn't the Founder's Orb? Phoenix .........Um, about that... ...................Oh, of course! Apollo: .......... (H-He can't possibly have hit on something...) Phoenix The defense's assertion is incomplete, and here's why. Their claim that this relic is the Founder's Orb is based on a legend. (Changed from [The defense is basing their claim that this relic is the Founder's Orb on a legend.] in the original release) And that legend claims that the founder will return when the riddle is solved at last. Apollo: Right. And that's what happened. The founder was revealed for all to see. Phoenix: But Mr. Justice, what about the rest of the legend? Apollo: Huh? Phoenix: According to the legend, once the founder returned... ...she would bestow spiritual power onto the person who solved the riddle. Apollo: ..........Y-You're kidding, right? Phoenix: Well, Mr. Justice? Do you feel great spiritual power coursing through your veins? Apollo: Um.......... no. B-But receiving spiritual powers and stuff... It's all just mystic mumbo-jumbo, right? Phoenix: Maybe so, but you're the one basing your claim on said legend. And what we saw here does not fully fulfill it, does it? Apollo: N-No, but... Phoenix: Consequently... You cannot rightfully claim that this is the Founder's Orb! Judge: .......... Atishon: .......... Apollo: .......... .......... Apollo: (What's gotten into him? Why is Mr. Wright doing this?) Judge: Hmm... It would appear that Mr. Wright has lost a few of his marbles. Phoenix: ...Th-That couldn't be further from the truth, Your Honor. Judge: In any case... I believe this a good time for a recess. Both sides will have twenty minutes to prepare. (Changed from [I believe this a good time for a recess. Both sides will have 20 minutes to prepare.] in the original release) I ask that all arguments be ready by then. Oh, and Mr. Wright? You'd do well to wash up and find your missing marbles by then, too. Phoenix: .................... May 17District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Athena: Mr. Wright is sure acting funny. I mean, he's famous for going out on a limb, but that last assertion was just plain crazy. Apollo: It's either a bluff or a Hail Mary. Either way, it doesn't make much sense. Trucy: ...Maybe there's something we're missing here. Although, he seemed perfectly normal when we spoke earlier. Athena: ...Apollo, I have a bad feeling about this. I'm going to go check up on him. Apollo: (What's going on with you, Mr. Wright...?) ???: Hey. Private Justice. Apollo: ...Oh, Sarge. Armie: I forgot to mention something. O-On the night of Papa's murder, a strange thing happened. Apollo: Oh? But why are you only telling me about it now? Armie: Well... I didn't say anything before because I thought Papa's death was an accident. But now that we know otherwise, I figured it might be important. Apollo: (There's still more to this case?) Armie: When I left my room and lost consciousness, I passed out right here. Apollo: That's right above the coffee bar. Armie: Mm-hm. But when I came to... ...someone was pushing my wheelchair. Apollo: What?! Armie: I was so scared, I beat a hasty retreat -- as fast as my wheels could take me! Apollo: Do you know who it was? Armie: No. It was pitch black. Plus, I fled to my room so fast, I didn't even have a chance to turn on the lights. Apollo: Maybe it was your father. Armie: No, he would have said something to me. Besides, I'd have known if it was him. Apollo: So then, it could've been... ...your father's real killer? Armie: My thoughts exactly. Apollo: But you didn't report this to the police? Armie: ...I-It didn't even occur to me. Apollo: It's okay. You were obviously still upset, so don't bear yourself up over it. Dhurke: Apollo, this could be really important information. I think the act of pushing Sarge's wheelchair could be part of some bigger scheme. It's hard to see why else the killer would do such a thing. Apollo: (Guess I should take her statement down as evidence.) Armie's Statement added to the Court Record. Apollo: Oh, welcome back, Athena. ...Hm? (What's with the long face?) Athena: .......... Apollo: How'd it go with Mr. Wright? Athena: .......... What should I...? Apollo: Athena? Athena: Oops, sorry! Zoned out there for a sec. The recess is almost over, so let's go! Ha, a-ha ha. Apollo: ........ (What was that all about?) May 17District Court - Courtroom No. 6 Judge: All right. Court is, once again, back in session. Now, umm... Mr. Wright. About that last objection you raised... Phoenix: We, the plaintiffs, still believe that the defense has yet to sufficiently prove its case. They claim that, according to legend, the Founder's Orb would bestow spiritual power... ...yet the relic in question has failed to do so. Therefore, it has failed its own test. Judge: I-I see... Apollo: (He's sticking with that ridiculous argument?) Phoenix: Furthermore... ...even if is the Founder's Orb, it can't be awarded to the Defiant Dragons. After all, they were the ones who killed Dr. Buff. Apollo: Apollo: What are you talking about? That was already proven to be false. There are no grounds for asserting that the Defiant Dragons murdered the doctor! Phoenix: Oh, but I'm afraid there are, Mr. Justice. ...Your Honor. I would like to present new testimony to this court. Testimony that will show that Datz Are'bal did, in fact, kill Dr. Buff! Apollo: What?! Judge: Very well. You may call your witness. Athena: I guess Mr. Wright found another new angle. Apollo: What new testimony could there be this late in the game? Atishon: Fellow citizens! It is I, Paul Atishon, the once and future representative of the people! Apollo: (Jeez, not him again.) Phoenix: My client divulged new information to me during the recess. He remembered something he saw, you see -- something crucial to this case. Apollo: (How very convenient...) Witness Testimony -- Datz's Crime -- Atishon: It was around 11 at night, and I was out on a mobile meet-and-greet around the village. That's when I saw Dr. Buff being murdered from outside his study window! Mr. Are'bal snuck up from behind and struck him on the head. His weapon of choice: a suitcase. A big, strong man like him could easily swing a heavy suitcase into someone's head. Apollo: You saw the murder as it happened?! And you're just telling us now because...? Atishon: Heh heh heh. I saved the best for last. It's a tactic known to all the political greats. Phoenix: The murder weapon was a complete mystery... ...but my client's eyewitness account has finally brought it to light. Judge: According to the autopsy report... ...Dr. Buff was struck in the head by the corner of some object. I suppose that could very well be the corner of a suitcase. Apollo: Apollo: But eyewitness testimony isn't the same as hard evidence! Phoenix: Oh, I wouldn't worry about that if I were you. Apollo: What's that supposed to mean? Phoenix: We have physical evidence, too. A luminol test revealed... ...the doctor's blood on Mr. Are'bal's suitcase. Apollo: R-Really?! But how does that prove that Mr. Are'bal used it as a weapon? Phoenix: Phoenix: You should know the answer to that, Mr. Justice. Since you know was well as I that the suitcase is covered in his fingerprints. Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! (I forgot we'd dusted it right in front of Ema!) Athena: The Turnabout Terror strikes again. Judge: Hmm... This is quite convincing testimony and evidence. Nevertheless, you may proceed with your cross-examination, Mr. Justice. Cross Examination -- Datz's Crime -- Atishon: It was around 11 at night, and I was out on a mobile meet-and-greet around the village. Press Apollo: Apollo: You were on a so-called \"mobile-meet-and-greet\" at 11 at night? Atishon: That's right. It's the perfect time because everyone is at home. You should have seen how the villagers' eyes teared up when they heard what I had to say. Apollo: (With tears of frustration, no doubt.) You weren't riding around in your palanquin? Atishon: That's right. Some village idiot reported me to the police. I've been banned from using it after dark. Athena: No wonder, what with all the noise he makes. Apollo: So, what exactly did you see, then? Atishon: That's when I saw Dr. Buff being murdered from outside his study window! Press Apollo: Apollo: Sounds like you witnessed something rather shocking. Atishon: Indeed. I didn't even believe it at first. I mean, a vicious murder, in Kurain? Apollo: There haven't been many murders there, I take it? Atishon: If I'm elected, I promise you that such a terrible tragedy will never happen again! A vote for me is a vote to banish murder forever from our beloved Kurain Village! Apollo: (Yeah, good luck with that.) Judge: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, please tell the court what you saw at the scene of the crime. Atishon: Mr. Are'bal snuck up from behind and struck him on the head. Press Apollo: Apollo: He snuck up from behind? So you're saying the doctor never even realized Mr. Are'bal was there? Atishon: That's right. He was utterly absorbed in a book. Apollo: ...I see. What did you see Mr. Are'bal do next? Atishon: He climbed up the bookshelf ladder and dumped a bunch of books down on the body. I believe he was trying to make it look like an accident. But that idiot didn't realize I could see everything from outside the window. Apollo: (One of those statements doesn't feel right.) Your Honor, I believe the witness made an important statement just now about how... The crime was clearly visible Apollo: If the crime was visible through the window, that's earth-shattering testimony! Judge: ...Is it? Because to my ears, it sounds like a rather obvious fact. Apollo: ...Oh, sorry. I'm good, then. Judge: Hmmm... Very well. Will the witness please continue with his testimony? Leads back to cross-examination The doctor was reading a book Apollo: The doctor was reading a book at the time of the murder...? That's vital testimony! Judge: Very well. The witness will please add that statement to his testimony. Adds statement \"The doctor was standing in front of the bookshelves, absorbed in a book.\" if not already added Datz is an idiot Apollo: The witness said Mr. Are'bal is an idiot. That's a key piece of information! Datz: Don't you jump on the bandwagon, AJ! I'm no idiot, you hear! Judge: Hmm... I fail to see how that is a key piece of information. Apollo: ...Yeah, I guess it's not, is it? Judge: Then it seems there is no need to add it into the witness's testimony. So let's get on with it, shall we? Leads back to cross-examination Atishon: The doctor was standing in front of the bookshelves, absorbed in a book. Press Apollo: Apollo: You watched a murderer commit his crime and did nothing to stop it? That doesn't sound like a good way to score points with the voting public. Atishon: I'm a politician, not a superhero! I'm under no obligation to risk life and limb. Athena: He's sure quick to deny his obligations when there's nothing in it for him. Apollo: I'm getting tired of listening to his endless campaigning and flimsy rationalizations. Phoenix: About your testimony, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson... You said Mr. Are'bal struck the doctor from behind when he was absorbed in a book. Atishon: Yes, that's exactly what happened. Present Doctor's Reading Glasses Apollo: Leads to: \"The doctor was standing in front of the bookshelves, absorbed in a book, you say?\" Atishon: His weapon of choice: a suitcase. Press Apollo: Apollo: Are you sure? Atishon: Positive. I saw it with my own two eyes. Apollo: Yet, despite your certainty, you kept quiet about it until now? Atishon: No, I was waiting. I knew there would be a perfect chance to talk about it later. Information must always be disclosed in a strategic manner. That is one of the lessons of kingcraft, as taught by the Atishon clan. Apollo: (Is there a lesson, by chance, in the Atishon Kingcraft Guidebook on being honest?) Atishon: Anyway, I saw Mr. Are'bal commit that heinous crime. Atishon: A big, strong man like him could easily swing a heavy suitcase into someone's head. Press Apollo: Apollo: I would have to agree, that suitcase is really heavy. ...Wait a second. How did you know it was so heavy? For all you knew, it could've been empty. Atishon: Gnrk! Phoenix: Phoenix: My client witnessed the crime in progress. So naturally, he saw Mr. Are'bal straining to lift what was obviously a heavy suitcase. I can't say I'm a fan of you trying to discredit my client by tripping him up, Mr. Justice. Apollo: (But I'm just doing what you always do, Mr. Wright!) Before adding statement Athena: Talk about new testimony. He's totally changed his story. Apollo: If he had really seen the murder taking place, you'd think he'd have said so from the start. Athena: Maybe he had some reason to hide what he really saw? Apollo: (If so, that might be our only opening.) After adding statement Athena: Dr. Buff was struck from behind while he was absorbed in a book? He must've been really into it. Apollo: Hmm... It doesn't add up. Athena: What doesn't? Apollo: (That Paul Atishon is lying. I'm sure of it.) Apollo: The doctor was standing in front of the bookshelves, absorbed in a book, you say? I'm sorry, but it seems your testimony is completely unreliable. Atishon: That's quite a bold statement. Well, let's hear you back it up. I challenge you to prove that I am anything but one hundred percent reliable. (Changed from [I challenge you to prove that I am anything but 100% reliable.] in the original release) Apollo: It would be my pleasure. Lately, it seems that the doctor's eyes had gotten so bad, he needed reading glasses. However, his reading glasses were over on his desk. So you see, there's no way he could've been reading a book in front of the bookshelves! Atishon: Hrrrrrrngh! Apollo: I'm sorry, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, but... ...I'm going to have to ask you to explain this discrepancy to the voting public! Atishon: Ngah, gah gah gah! I-I-I... Apollo: You what? Atishon: I-I'll explain it, you lowly cur! I simply made a mistake, you see. The doctor was actually sitting at his desk when Mr. Are'bal hit him over the head! Apollo: But then the doctor would have been facing him. Surely he would've seen him and tried to run? Atishon: D-Dr. Buff was nodding off! I could tell because he his eyes were closed, and he wasn't moving! Apollo: (Sounds more like what you would do.) Then how do you explain the back that he was struck in the back of the head? Isn't that something that should be impossible from the front of the desk? Atishon: ...Oh, um... About that... H-He... He bowed his head when he nodded off. That's when he was clobbered. Judge: Hmm... So that's what you saw. Well, Mr. Justice, that sounds like a perfectly reasonable explanation to me. Do you have a problem with the proposal that the doctor was struck while nodding off? No problem Apollo: No problem here, Your Honor. The doctor was probably dozing, just as the witness said. Athena: N-No, Apollo! Wait! If you accept that, then you might as well admit Datz killed the doctor. Apollo: ...Your Honor! I, uh, actually do have a problem with that statement... Judge: Very well. But let's avoid careless answers like that, or I will have a problem with you! Apollo: (Guess I blew that one.) Judge: Now, as you were saying, Mr. Justice? Leads to: \"There is a problem. A very big problem.\" A big problem Leads to: \"There is a problem. A very big problem.\" Apollo: There is a problem. A very big problem. The witness's statement doesn't hold up under the slightest bit of scrutiny! Judge: Is that so? Then will you please show this court what evidence you have to justify this? Apollo: Gladly, Your Honor. This shows the problem with the witness's claim that he saw the doctor nodding off! Present Study Diagram Apollo: Leads to: \"...A diagram of the study?\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: This shows the glaring problem with the witness's statement! Atishon: ...............Zzz... Apollo: See? The witness has passed out from the overwhelming power of my evidence! Phoenix: No, Mr. Justice. Your lackadaisical attempt to refute him put my client to sleep. That's all. Judge: I feel a yawn coming on myself. Perhaps giving you this penalty will wake me up. Apollo: Surely there are better ways to stay awake, Your Honor? Athena: Apollo, think about the relative positions of the witness and doctor again. Apollo: Right. That's where we'll find the contradiction. Judge: Now then, Mr. Justice. See that you avoid these snooze-incusing answers in the future. Leads back to: \"This shows the problem with the witness's claim that he saw the doctor nodding off!\" Judge: ...A diagram of the study? Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson allegedly viewed the murder from... ...here. And the doctor was allegedly nodding off... ...here. But from his vantage point, the bookcase would've blocked the witness's line of sight. Judge: Why, yes, I believe you're right! Atishon: B-B-But...! Arrrgh! Phoenix: Phoenix: The fact remains, my client knew that the suitcase was the murder weapon. So he definitely had first-hand knowledge of the crime scene! Apollo: I'm afraid I have to agree with you there, Mr. Wright. But then we have to ask ourselves, from what vantage point did he see the murder? Phoenix: What are you insinuating, Mr. Justice? Apollo: From what vantage point could Mr. Atishon-Wimperson have seen the dozing doctor? Once we determine that, I believe we'll finally see the truth behind this incident. The witness saw the murder from... right here! Present area between Bookshelf and Coffee Bar Apollo: Leads to: \"You've got to be kidding!\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Phoenix: How could he have seen it from there? Apollo: Oh, umm... He just did somehow? I mean, I just feel like it must've been from there. Athena: Um, Apollo? for some reason, I feel like you're wrong. Judge: Hmm... And for some reason, I feel like giving you a penalty. Apollo: (So much for that spot.) Athena: Hmm... Looking at it in another way... ...where must Mr. Atishon-Wimperson have been standing to see the doctor nodding off? Apollo: Someplace where the bookcase wasn't blocking his view, I guess. Judge: Now then. Will the defense please indicate where the witness saw the murder from? Leads back to: \"The witness saw the murder from... right here!\" Phoenix: You've got to be kidding! Judge: B-But that's--! Apollo: It is indeed. But everything only makes sense if the witness was there in the study. Athena: I-Inside the study? But that's the scene of the crime! Apollo: I know. Mr. Atishon-Wimperson -- the man who claims to be a witness to the murder... ...was most certainly in that very room. Athena: A-Apollo, are you suggesting...? Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson! Weren't YOU the one who actually swung that suitcase? Atishon: Gaaaaaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Phoenix: What you're proposing is ludicrous! My client is a small, thin man, whereas Mr. Are'bal had the musculature to pull it off. Apollo: ......... (He has a point... I gave up trying to lift that thing after one go.) Atishon: That's right. He's the only one who could've lifted such a heavy object. Now do you understand? The rebel Datz Are'bal is the doctor's killer! Athena: As long as the suitcase is the murder weapon, the suspicion falls entirely on Datz. You'll have to poke a hole in Mr. Wright's argument somehow, Apollo. Apollo: Oh, I will. And with his own technique, no less. If Mr. Atishon-Wimperson couldn't swing the suitcase around... ...we'll just have to consider another way he could've used it as a murder weapon instead. I'm going to turn this case on its head, Mr. Wright, just like you taught me. Phoenix: ...You talk big, Mr. Justice, but do you have what it takes? Judge: Well, this should be interesting... Apollo:: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson's testimony has been filled with one inaccuracy after another. First he stated Dr. Buff was in front of the bookshelves. Now he claims that the doctor was sitting at his desk. So where was the victim REALLY when he was killed? Also, where was his killer, and how was the murder weapon REALLY used? Judge: So the important thing here is the position of the victim and killer related to each other? Apollo: Yes, Your Honor. If they were positioned a certain way... ...it would be possible to use the suitcase as a weapon without lifting a finger. Phoenix: You can't mean...! Apollo: I would ask the court to recall the study's layout. It's quite distinctive, as you can see. Now, if Dr. Buff were sitting in a certain spot, and his killer was at a certain other spot... ...the suitcase would become a weapon ANYONE could use! Judge: Hmm... Very well, Mr. Justice. Where was Dr. Buff's killer at the time of the crime? Present balcony west of Coffee Bar Apollo: Leads to: \"Th-There...?!\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Judge: How could the murder have been committed from there? Phoenix: Yes, I would love to see a demonstration. Apollo: ...Um, well... I can't from here. Judge: Well, I have a demonstration for you from here... on how to give a penalty. Apollo: (So much for that spot.) Athena: If the killer didn't swing the suit case, there aren't many other ways to use it as a weapon. Apollo: I know. And there aren't that many places to use it from, either. Judge: Now then. I hope the defense is ready to try again. Leads back to: \"Where was Dr. Buff's killer at the time of the crime?\" Judge: Th-There...?! Phoenix: Oh... That's... Apollo: This should wrap things up nice and pretty for you, Mr. Wright. I would ask the court to recall the study's layout. But this time, instead of thinking in two dimensions... ...let's think in three. Only then can we clearly see the killer's method at work. The killer didn't have to swing the suitcase. ...If he used gravity to his advantage, that is. That's right. It was the plaintiff -- one Paul Atishon-Wimperson -- who used the suitcase. He pushed it from the second floor... ...and sent it hurtling down onto Dr. Buff, who was sitting at the coffee bar! Atishon: Yaaaaaaargh! Apollo: That psychology book had been at the coffee bar, no doubt. The doctor must have set it down there after he'd finished reading it, or the like. But his blood got on it, which is why the killer thought to hide it in that mountain of books! Phoenix: Phoenix: That's quite an entertaining theory you have there, Mr. Justice. But there's no evidence that the murder took place at the coffee bar. Apollo: ......... (I'm not so sure about that, Mr. Wright. I'd say that evidence of the murder occurring at the coffee bar...) Exists Leads to: \"The evidence does exist, and I'm going to show you.\" Does not exist Apollo: Obviously, there is none! Phoenix: Just as I thought. So, if the coffee bar isn't where the doctor was killed... ...the defense's little theory fails to bear fruit Judge: Hmm... Mr. Wright is correct, of course. Apollo: Urk! ...Umm... Athena: Don't just stand there, Apollo! If you don't do something quick, we're going to lose both the orb AND the creep, together! Apollo: I'm thinking... I'm thinking... Oh! (Wait a second... There IS a piece of evidence that proves the doctor was killed at the coffee bar!) Phoenix: So, such evidence never existed in the first place, did it? Leads to: \"The evidence does exist, and I'm going to show you.\" Apollo: The evidence does exist, and I'm going to show you. Phoenix: Y-You are? Apollo: This, right here, is proof that the murder took place at the coffee bar. Present stained book Apollo: Leads to: \"This brown stain was determined to be coffee.\" Present anything else Apollo: Judge: Hmm... I don't understand how that could be proof of anything. Apollo: You don't, Your Honor? Well, I believe Mr. Wright understands perfectly. Phoenix: All I know is, it's perfectly clear you don't understand what you're talking about. Judge: Now that is something I can understand. Apollo: (Me too... Oww.) Athena: Apollo, let's take another look at that crime scene photo. Maybe there's something in it related to the coffee bar. Apollo: I've got it this time! Leads back to: \"This, right here, is proof that the murder took place at the coffee bar.\" Apollo: This brown stain was determined to be coffee. What's more, it was still a bit damp when we saw it yesterday morning. Phoenix: Ah! Apollo: One look at this book speaks volumes, I'm afraid, Mr. Wright. It tells us the doctor was having a cup of coffee at the coffee bar. That's when the suitcase came hurtling down, striking him on the head... ...causing both his blood and his coffee to spatter onto it! Phoenix: Ack! Atishon: Aaaaaaagh! Apollo: Well, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson?! Atishon: .........Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh... What motive could I have possibly had to kill Dr. Buff?! Apollo: (And there it is. That final excuse cornered killers are so fond of.) Well, the doctor never returned your \"crystal\" to you, did he? Instead, he hid it in the cave ruins. Atishon: Nngh... Apollo: Telling him that the Defiant Dragons were a dangerous bunch was a huge blunder. All it did was make him hide the orb. Your lie came back to bite you in the end. Atishon: Uhhh... Apollo: Even worse, the doctor saw the news reports, so he knew the relic was the Founder's Orb. Being the conscientious researcher he was, he knew he had to return it to its rightful place... ...and that meant keeping it out of your hands. Atishon: Aaaaaaaaaaaaah... Apollo: You were so angry that he refused to return the relic to you... ...that you killed him with your own hands. Isn't that right, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Atishon: Arrrrrraaaaaagh! .........I-I-I... Th-That is... Phoenix: Phoenix: ...A-Apollo! Don't! Please don't accuse my client of murder! Apollo: .........Huh? What do you mean, \"don't accuse him\"? Why would you even say that, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: ...Er, what I meant was, um... He's a promising politician with a bright future ahead of him. It's in our nation's best interests to avoid burdening him with the taint of scandal. Apollo: Say what? Atishon: Wright! You'd better do something to change the current courtroom climate... ...or I'll be charged with murder! And you know what will happen to her if that happens. Phoenix: ...Arngh! Apollo: (What's he talking about? Well, I can ponder that later. For now...) Mr. Wright, you can't possibly believe that Mr. Are'bal is the killer. Are you really going to send an innocent man to prison? I thought you were better than that. Phoenix: Uhhh... Ummm... Apollo: Well, Mr. Wright? Answer me! Phoenix: Errr... Ummm... UUHWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH! Apollo: M-M-Mr. Wright? ...What in the world's going on here? Athena: ......... Apollo: ...If you won't say anything, then...! Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, the defense hereby accuses you of-- Athena: Athena: A-Apollo! Wait! Apollo: Not you, too, Athena! Athena: Umm... It's just, uhhh... I wasn't sure whether I should say anything, but... ...during that last recess, when I went to check on Mr. Wright... ...I overheard something I shouldn't have. Phoenix: I trust Maya is unharmed. Atishon: I can't really say. But just remember... If I'm arrested or fail to obtain the treasure... ...there will be consequences. Consequences of the worst kind, if you catch my drift. Phoenix: Augh! Atishon: Relax. All you have to do is ensure I get my hands on that relic. I must deliver it to my benefactor at all costs. Phoenix: What do they want that relic for anyway? Atishon: Heh heh heh. It's something to do with an old legend. My patron seeks the great power said to be granted to whoever solves its secret. Apollo: ....Maya? As in Maya Fey? Athena: Yes, the boss's legendary former assistant. Apollo: Ms. Fey's being held hostage? Athena: So it seems. Apollo: Why didn't you tell me as soon as you heard this? Athena: Sorry. It's just, Mr. Wright spotted me before I could slip away... ...and made me promise not to tell you. He said it would make things more difficult if you found out. Apollo: Arngh! As if things weren't already hard enough! (So that's why Mr. Wright was acting so strange. I had no idea. This must've been excruciating for him. Think, Justice... There's got to be something you can do!) Judge: Mr. Justice, about that last statement of yours... I believe you were in the middle of accusing the plaintiff of murdering Dr. Buff... Would you care to continue? Apollo: Ack! I-I... Phoenix: Nngh... I'm sorry, Apollo... I'm really, really sorry. Judge: What's gotten into you two? Apollo: ......... (If I accuse that slimebag, I put Ms. Fey's life in jeopardy.) Atishon: Heh heh heh. It seems you've finally caught on. I'm far too important to be accused of murder. After all, our nation's future rests squarely on my shoulders. Apollo: (Nnrgh... Either I give up, or...) Atishon: Once I present the crystal to my patron, my victory is assured! Then one day, I'll become president -- and then, king! I'll have every politician at my command! Now, retract your accusation! Apollo: Arrrrrrnnngh! (I can't kowtow to him, but... but...) The defense would... It would like to retract... the previous accusati-- ???: Dhurke: ...Apollo. Apollo: Dh-Dhurke? Dhurke: I don't know what's going on here... ...but a lawyer should never look the way you do right now... ... with \"defeat\" and \"resignation\" written all over your face. Apollo: ! .........A dragon never yields. Dhurke: Even when wounded, a dragon bites down hard, and never lets go till its dying breath. It glares, it roars, and it latches its jaws firmly onto its prey till the bitter end. That's what lawyers do to get to the truth! Apollo: ...Dhurke. (A dragon never yields... ...He's right. It's all over if I give up now! If Mr. Wright's hands are tied, it's up to me to do what must be done! He's saved my neck so many times. Now... it's my turn to save his!) ...Dhurke, thanks for that wake up call. Dhurke: Heh, now that's the face of a lawyer you've got there, son. Apollo: (Where there's a will, there's a way. And I'm going to find the way to save Ms. Fey AND see that justice is served!) Apollo: That scumbag is holding Ms. Fey hostage to ensure he gets the orb for his patron. And it seems said patron believes in the orb's legend. Thing is, the founder DID appear when the orb was exposed to fire, as the legend said. If the legend is true, then we've already solved the riddle, right? Yes, we have Apollo: Yes, we've definitely solved the riddle! ...And yet... ...we still don't understand what the part about \"bestowing power\" is talking about. I need to rethink this! Leads back to: \"If the legend is true, then we've already solved the riddle, right?\" No, not yet Leads to: \"We have not solved the riddle yet\" We have not solved the riddle yet Apollo: The legend says that the founder will bestow great spiritual power when she returns. But if that's true, it means we haven't solved the whole riddle yet. But how can that be? Are we missing something? ...Wait, maybe... Maybe the part about the founder returning should be taken literally. But how would it be possible for a dead person to return to the world of the living? Cloning Apollo: Oh, I know! Cloning technology! I bet some of the founder's DNA is hidden somewhere in the orb. ...Argh, what am I talking about? They didn't know about DNA and cloning back then. I'd better think of something else. Leads back to: \"But how would it be possible for a dead person to return to the world of the living?\" Channeling Leads to: \"The founder can return though channeling\" Time travel Apollo: Oh, I know! Time travel! We could go back to the past and bring the founder here to the present. ...Wait, what am I saying? Maybe I should cut back on the sci-fi movies. I'd better think of something else. Leads back to: \"But how would it be possible for a dead person to return to the world of the living?\" The founder can return though channeling Apollo: Oh, I know! here IS a way for the dead to return -- spirit channeling! Of course, you'd have to know what he founder looks like first... ...but the orb has revealed her face to us, so what if it's a sign that we should channel her? Given the facts, in order to solve the riddle and receive the founder's power, I'd need... A spirit medium Leads to: \"A MEDIUM IS NEEDED TO OBTAIN THE POWER\" To practice channeling Apollo: All I have to do is train as a spirit medium, so I can channel spirits myself! ...Wait, it can't be that easy. And if I ever did become a medium, I wouldn't need the founder's power anymore anyway. Leads back to: \"Given the facts, in order to solve the riddle and receive the founder's power, I'd need...\" A MEDIUM IS NEEDED TO OBTAIN THE POWER Apollo: The ability of a medium to channel spirits is the final key to unlocking the orb's secret. That means Mr. Atishon-Wimperson's patron will need one, too. And once that slimy politician realizes that, he won't be able to lay a finger on Ms. Fey! Apollo: Everything is going to be okay, Mr. Wright. Because Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson can't afford to harm a hair on Ms. Fey's head. Phoenix: ............Huh? Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson! It seems you've chosen the wrong person to take hostage. Atishon: Wh-What do you mean? Apollo: Your patron seeks to solve the orb's riddle... ...and thereby receive great spiritual power. However, only Maya Fey can truly give them what they really want. Phoenix: She can? Atishon: What do you mean, \"only Maya Fey\"? Apollo: Think about what the return of the founder really means. We should have considered it more literally. After all, the orb was made in the Kingdom of Khura'in -- the birthplace of spirit mediums. Phoenix: ...Ahh, I think I see now. You need to know what the deceased looks like in order to channel them. But in Khura'inism, depicting the face of the founder is taboo. However, her true face was hidden in the orb. So maybe the orb is telling us... to try channeling the founder. Apollo: Exactly. Through a spirit medium, the founder can quite literally return. And if the legend is true... ...the founder just might bestow spiritual power on someone when she does. Phoenix: It's like when Pearls imbued my magatama with spiritual power. If a human could be imbued with such power in a similar manner... Dhurke: It is said the founder possesses immense spiritual power. Such a great feat would not necessarily be beyond her-- W-Wait a second! Th-Then the legend is true?! Apollo: Do you understand now, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? You are holding hostage the final key to unlocking the orb's secret. And if anything were to happen to her, the riddle would remain unsolved, forever! Atishon: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Atishon: Atishon: Th-Th-There's always Pearl Fey! I could simply ask her to help! If she wants money, I have plenty to offer! Apollo: She's not the kind of person to be tempted by material gain. And she certainly wouldn't help you if anything were to happen to her cousin. Atishon: Urhgk. Apollo: Or maybe you'd like to go ask the queen of Khura'in to channel the founder for you. Phoenix: He could, but he'd probably get executed for requesting such a thing. Apollo: ...It's over. Now, confess! You killed Dr. Buff, didn't you? Atishon: Ack! Hrrrrrrrrrrrrrngh! It wasn't supposed to end this way! Judge: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. Are you admitting to committing the crime? Atishon: Errr... Um, I-I-I... You're my lawyer, Wright! Do something! Phoenix: It's true that I'm your lawyer. And as such, it's my job to defend you. ...However, defending my client isn't the only job a lawyer has. There's something else that's equally as important. And that is finding the truth. Atishon: Wh-What? Phoenix Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, you have sought to twist the truth in the dirtiest of ways. I was complicit in your hostage-taking, but in a way, I was being held hostage, too. Even so, there's still time for me to make things right. And I owe it all to you, Apollo. Apollo: ! (Mr. Wright...) Phoenix: I can't allow a murderer to walk away scot-free! Therefore, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, I must resign as your attorney. Atishon: No no no no noooo! D-Does this mean... I'm under arrest? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! ........................ ............... .................................... ........................ Apollo: ...Well? Atishon: ...I've nothing to confess. Apollo: What?! Atishon: I said, I've nothing to confess! I don't and I won't, especially not to a plebeian like you! Apollo: (This guy doesn't know when to give up.) Atishon: Besides, there's no truth to these allegations! I mean, look at the suitcase. You won't find a single print of mine on it! Apollo: All that means is that you wiped them off, taking care to only leave Mr. Are'bal's. Atishon: Heh heh heh. As many a great politician has said before me: no comment. Phoenix: In that case, try switching things up, Apollo. Look at the situation from a different angle. Is there really nothing that points to the suitcase being dropped from up above? Apollo: Hmmm... Evidence that points to the suitcase being dropped from the second floor... Athena: Hmm... If the killer pushed the suitcase from the second floor hallway over the coffee bar... ...that would place him right around here. Apollo: Ah! Maybe... Just maybe...! Phoenix: Thought of something, Apollo? Apollo: I believe this piece of evidence to be connected to the dropping of the suitcase. Present Armie's Statement Apollo: Leads to: \"That... appears to be a statement. But how is that related to this case?\" Present anything else Apollo: Atishon: Wh-What is that?! Phoenix: Apollo, I don't see how that could possibly be related. Atishon: ...Oh, it's not? Tsk, I just wasted a perfectly good reaction! Your Honor! Penalize this pernicious peon! Judge: Hmm.. Yes, well, we all must be held accountable for our words and actions. Apollo: (What do you think I'm trying to do with Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, Your Honor?!) Athena: So the killer dropped the suitcase from above the coffee bar. Apollo: Right. Let's look again to see if we have any evidence related to that event. Phoenix: Come on, Apollo. I'm counting on you. Leads back to: \"I believe this piece of evidence to be connected to the dropping of the suitcase.\" Judge: That... appears to be a statement. But how is that related to this case? Apollo: On the night of the murder, Your Honor, Miss Armie Buff physically left her room. That's when she saw the doctor burning the orb, and subsequently passed out. ...Right above the coffee bar. But with her there in her wheelchair... ...the killer wouldn't have been able to drop the suitcase down onto the doctor. Phoenix: Good point! Apollo: However, according to Sarge... ...she woke up just as someone was trying to move her in her wheelchair. Phoenix: Ah! Armie: ...someone was pushing my wheelchair. Apollo: What?! Armie: I was so scared, I beat a hasty retreat -- as fast as my wheels could take me! Apollo: She must've been in the killer's way and had to be moved. Isn't that right, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Atishon: ...Agrk! Phoenix: And if the killer had pushed the wheelchair with his bare hands... ...we may yet find the conclusive evidence we need. Apollo: Exactly. Fortunately for us, that evidence slipped right through the killer's fingers. If only he'd been able to hold on to it just a little tighter. But now, he is neither able to discard nor alter it. Phoenix: Honestly, that piece of evidence wasn't even supposed to be here in this courtroom today. And yet... it looks like sometimes, things DO get better. Atishon: Unngh! B-B-B-B-But...! Th-This... This wasn't supposed to happen! Apollo: No? Well, too bad. Because the evidence that sped away from you that night... ...has come back to haunt you! Right here at this very trial! Atishon: ARGH! UHWAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! Apollo: Your Honor! The defense's final piece of evidence is on this person! Present Armie Buff profile Apollo: Leads to: \"Th-That's...!\" Present anyone else Apollo: Phoenix: ...Apollo? Apollo: Yes, Mr. Wright? Athena: Umm, I think he's saying that that doesn't jive with anything you've said so far. Judge: It seems Ms. Cykes is the more sensible of you two. Apollo: (Ugh... No need to compare the two of us...) Phoenix: What did the killer have to move in order to drop the suitcase? Consider that, and the rest should follow. Apollo: Okay, I'll get it for sure this time! Leads back to: \"Your Honor! The defense's final piece of evidence is on this person!\" Atishon: Th-That's...! Apollo: On the night of the murder, Sarge passed out... ...only to come to and find that someone was pushing her wheelchair. That's when she fled back into her room. Phoenix: She didn't physically see a single soul after that... Not until Athena drew her out through that therapy session, that is. Apollo: While the killer was able to wipe the prints on the suitcase off... (Changed from [While the killer was able to wipe the prints on the suitcase...] in the original release) ...the same can't be said for the prints that got away. Atishon: Ah. Ah. M-My fellow Kurainians... Apollo: Well, Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson? Try to explain your way out of this one! The podium is all yours! Atishon: Ah. Ah. P-Paul Atishon, savior of Kurain... I-I... I am not a crook... I... My political career...! It can't end like this! I-I'm destined for great things! Something's wrong... This isn't real! It's a dream! No, a nightmare! Ooooooooooooh. Huh? What? ...Wait? ...Really? Ah! Election ResultsWINNER Atishon: Ahhhhhh! Whoa, no waaaaaaaaay!!! BANZAI! BANZAI! BANZAI! BANZAI!!! Breaking NewsPaul Atishon arrested on murder charges and stripped of his electoral win. Atishon: ...Wait, what? ...............No, please. Wait. Don't go! No... No... Please...Whoa! Grandpaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! ........................ Judge: M-Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Are you all right? ...B-Bailiff! Get him to the first-aid station, on the double! Judge: Well, this was yet another unexpected turn of events. In light of everything that's been revealed, it seems that this relic is indeed the Founder's Orb. And it seems Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson can be considered a suspect in Dr. Buff's murder. Phoenix: Apollo, I want to thank you for everything. Apollo: ! Phoenix: Thanks to you, I didn't have to keep bending the truth. I don't know what I would've done without you. Apollo: Er, don't mention it, ha ha ha... Athena: You were amazing today, Apollo! Apollo: (Well, I couldn't have done it without Dhurke.) .........A dragon never yields. Dhurke: Even when wounded, a dragon bites down hard, and never lets go till its dying breath. It glares, it roars, and it latches its jaws firmly onto its prey till the bitter end. That's what lawyers do to get the truth! Apollo: (A dragon never yields... Every lawyer should take that to heart.) Judge: As it seems both sides have no further objections... ...would Dhurke Sahdmadhi please take the stand? Dhurke: .......... Judge: This court awards the orb to the Defiant Dragons per the stated transfer agreement. Should the Kingdom of Khura'in claim ownership... ...the matter may have to be deliberated in court all over again. I just hope, or shall I say pray, that I'm not the judge presiding over that one! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Indeed! A trial like that might spark an international incident. Still, there are bigger and more momentous things astir in the air! Apollo: (The revolution... Dhurke's really serious about this.) Judge: This court is adjourned! May 17District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Dhurke: Nice work, son! We've finally broken through the last obstacle on the road to revolution! Apollo: Revolution... It just doesn't seem real. Dhurke: Yes, well, to think you actually defeated the Fighting Phoenix... All I can say is, that's my boy! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (Well, Mr. Wright did have his hands tied. Who knows if I'd have won if he'd been able to fight me head-on.) Athena: I see it more like you saved Mr. Wright. Apollo: ...Saved him? Athena: Yeah, remember what he said? He didn't have to bend the truth anymore, and it was all thanks to you! Apollo: I don't know about that. (Still, I guess it IS kinda nice to be appreciated.) Trucy: ...Um, Mr. Dhurke? Now that the Holy Mother's face has been revealed... ...are you going to have a spirit medium try channeling her? I, for one, would love to see the return of the legendary founder! Apollo: Yeah, just think about it. Being able to speak to someone right out of the history books... Dhurke: Unfortunately, it's not that easy. Apollo: What? Why? Dhurke: A face isn't enough. You also need the true name of the one you're attempting to channel. Apollo: Oh, right. Pearl mentioned something like that. Dhurke: And the founder's name is only known to the priestess who's been crowned queen. In short, the only living person who knows it is the current queen of Khura'in, Ga'ran. Apollo: Oh, so without her help, we won't be seeing the founder anytime soon? Trucy: Tsk, that's no fun. Founder's Orb updated in the Court Record. Apollo: So, Dhurke, what will you do now? Dhurke: First, I'll start by tracing the route by which the orb came into Dr. Buff's hands. Apollo: Since we now know it was Paul Atishon that asked the doctor to study it... ...isn't he the one who stole it? Dhurke: No, a political nobody like him couldn't get anywhere near the orb, let alone steal it. He must've had inside help. My money is on someone connected to the royal family. Apollo: Oh, right. You said something to that effect back in the cave. Dhurke: Whoever it may be, we need to expose their dirty scheme to the light of day. Apollo: Well, I'm sure Mr. Wright has plenty of information, courtesy of his dirty client. He might be able to shed some light on this. ???: Private Justice! Sarge: That was fine work you did at the trial today! You did your sergeant proud! Apollo: Back at you, Sarge! It took real courage to leave your room like that. Armie: It's all thanks to you and Corpswoman Cykes. With my siege defense over, I can finally sally forth. Sarge: But the battle's only just begun! One for me, and me alone, to fight! Athena: To lose your mother, and then your father... What a terrible thing to endure. Apollo: Yeah... (And being wheelchair-bound doesn't help.) Armie: ...Private Justice! I've been thinking... It's about time I stood on my own two feet. After all, I no longer have Papa to coddle me! Apollo: Huh? I'm afraid I don't follow. Armie: ...Take a good look, soldier. This is one small step for man... ...and one giant leap for me! ......... Hold my drone for me, would you, Private Justice? Apollo: Y-Yes, sir. (What she is up to?) Armie: .........Hrgh! Wh-Whoa... Apollo: Sh-Sh-She's... standing?! Dhurke: Wh-What's this?! Sarge! You mean your legs... They're...?! Armie: The doctor told me that I was ready to walk again months ago. But if I admitted I could walk, I knew I would have to leave the house. So I... I faked it. Apollo: (Makes sense, but...) Armie: I kept pretending I couldn't walk. But I know Papa is watching over me now, and I'd hate to disappoint him. So, from this day forth, I'm going to march forward on my own two feet! Apollo: (What a brave kid, trying to move forward like this. But it must be so hard this soon after her father's death.) Dhurke: Don't you ever stop. You just keep on walking... comrade. Stay brave, because there will be days when you want to stop... ...but I have faith you'll find a way to muster the strength to push through them. Apollo: Yeah, you can do it. Trucy: Hey, Daddy's back! Phoenix: .................. Apollo: Mr. Wright! (What's that look on his face for?) Phoenix: Oh, Apollo! Apollo: Um, is everything all right with Ms. Fey? Phoenix: She's safe... for now. Athena: Well then, we'd better go save her, quick! Where is she, anyway? Phoenix: ...I'm afraid I have some bad news. Apollo: Huh? Phoenix: Maya's... not here in the States. She's still in Khura'in. And she's still being held hostage by the mastermind behind this whole thing. Apollo: The mastermind? Phoenix: ...That's right. Paul Atishon-Wimperson was nothing more than a pawn. Maya's true abductor is in the Kingdom of Khura'in. Apollo: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaat?! I-I don't understand, Mr. Wright! What in the world's going on over there?! Apollo: But as shocking as that news was... ...it was only the beginning. The beginning of something big -- big enough to shake Khura'in to its very core. ...Revolution. I was being swept up in a mighty wave that nothing could stop. Of course, at the time... I had no idea what the days ahead had in store for us... To be continued Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: Please take a look at this piece of evidence. Judge: I'm looking... But what am I supposed to see? Apollo: Oh, um... Uhhh... Phoenix: As your boss and mentor, here's a bit of advice: Never present evidence before you have a good grasp of the situation at hand. Apollo: R-Right... Sorry... Judge: And as the presiding judge, here's a penalty. Apollo: (Ouch. Double-teamed for doing what Mr. Wright always does anyway.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: That statement contradicts with this piece of evidence! Judge: Hmmm... And just how does it contradict with the evidence, Mr. Justice? Apollo: Um... Could I have about five minutes to figure out the answer to that? Judge: The defense will figure it out before he presents his evidence next time! Apollo: (Sounds like a plan...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: There's... something off about that statement... Judge: Hmm... It seemed perfectly reasonable to me. Apollo: No, something's definitely not right if you listen really carefully! Phoenix: A gambler once sang, you've got to know when to hold 'em, when to fold 'em... Judge: Oh, I love this one! ...Know when to walk away, know when to run! Apollo: (I don't know which penalty hurts more: the judge's or their singing.) Consult (when evidence must be presented) Athena: Is it just me, or does that statement sound a bit dubious? Apollo: You know what... you're right. Thanks, Athena! Athena: Anytime! Apollo: (Now to take another look at the evidence...) Consult (when statements must be pressed) Athena: You look like you've hit a brick wall, Apollo. Apollo: Yeah. It feels like I have, too. Athena: Maybe you just haven't brought all the facts to light. Why don't you try pressing a little more? Apollo: Good idea. (Okay, time to turn up the pressure!) Pinpoint wrong emotion (during Mood Matrix segment in the chapter \"Cross-Examining Sarge\") Apollo: Athena: Hmm... This emotion isn't that out of place, given this statement... Apollo, are you just looking at his emotions as they relate to only a single statement? It's really important to look for emotional fluctuation between different statements, too. Apollo: Oh, right. Thanks for the reminder, Athena. (All right, let's try that again.) Probe wrong area (during Mood Matrix segment in the chapter \"Cross-Examining Sarge\") Apollo: Athena: That doesn't seem to be the cause of his current emotional state. Apollo: I could sure use a clue or two right about now. Athena: A person's personality and past shapes their emotional responses. Consider everything you know about Sarge. That's where you'll find the clues you need. Apollo: (Everything I know about Sarge...) Presenting wrong evidence during the Mood Matrix Apollo: Apollo: There's an inconsistency in Sarge's testimony! Judge: Is that so? Would you be so kind as to point it out to the court? Apollo: ...Well if you're going to put me on the spot like that, I admit my confidence is waning. Judge: ...I could say the same about my confidence in you, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Ugh. (I wish you wouldn't, Your Honor.) Athena: Say, Apollo... Sarge is saying that his father was burning the orb when he was killed... ...but doesn't that seem funny to you? Considering what the doctor was up that night, it doesn't add up. Apollo: Well, now that you mention it... (All right, I'd better look through the evidence one more time.) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The Defiant Dragons have failed to sufficiently show their right to the item in question. Therefore, ownership is hereby awarded to... ...the plaintiff, Mr. Paul Atishon. Apollo: That creep Paul Atishon stole the Founder's Orb right out of our hands. The dream of revolution in the Kingdom of Khura'in died that day. And we returned to our daily lives. As for my relationship with Mr. Wright... The word awkward comes to mind. Let's just say it was never really the same. Turnabout Revolution Image Gallery Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 May 17District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Apollo: What do you mean Ms. Fey is still being held hostage? And who's this \"mastermind\"? Phoenix: ...Paul Atishon-Wimperson was nothing more than a puppet. His benefactor was the one pulling the strings. But I have no idea who they are. Apollo: So all we know is it's the person he was trying to give the orb to? Phoenix: Right. He was just following orders. Whoever it is, it seems they really want to get their hands on the orb. Apollo: So then, Ms. Fey's abduction is the work of this so-called \"benefactor,\" too? Phoenix: Right again. Whoever they are, they're in Khura'in... ...along with Maya. Apollo: I wonder who they could be. Dhurke: Wright, this Maya -- the spirit medium you've been talking about... She wouldn't happen to be that bun-haired young lady you defended back in Khura'in? Phoenix: That's her. Why do you ask? Dhurke: I see... I think I know what's going on here.  I've got good news for you, Wright. Maya is somewhere safe. That much I'm sure of. Phoenix: ...I'm afraid you've lost me. Dhurke: Heh heh heh. So that's who the little snot's patron is. It's all starting to make sense. That fool has no idea I'm here in the States with you all. Apollo: Dhurke, you mind filling us in? Phone: .......................................... Phoenix: ...! ...No caller ID. I wonder who's calling? Phone: *beep* Phoenix: Hello? Phone: Mr. Phoenix Wright, yes? Let me start by thanking you... ...for taking such good care of my subordinate. Phoenix: Wh-Who is this? Phone: I believe you know me as Mr. Atishon's... \"benefactor.\" Phoenix: Ah! Apollo: (Sounds like they're using a voice changer or something to disguise themself.) Phoenix: Where's Maya?! Is she safe?! Phone: ...I had my ears on today's proceedings. What a shock it was to hear that the key to solving the orb's riddle is a spirit medium. I admit, I did not see that coming. Apollo: (Wait, did they plant a listening device in here somehow?) Phone: Nevertheless, don't think for a minute that it will guarantee Maya Fey's safety. She is not the only medium within my reach, you see. Phoenix: You harm a hair on Maya's head and you'll have to answer to me! Dhurke: ...Wright, give it here a sec. Phoenix: Wait! Dhurke: Hey, there. How's it going, stranger? Phone: ...Who is this? Dhurke: Why, it's your friendly neighborhood dragon. I just happen to be in the U.S. on a little trip. ...Minister of Justice Inga Karkhuul Khura'in. Phoenix: I-Inga?! Apollo: What?! Phoenix: Maya's kidnapper... Apollo: ...Is Khura'in's... Minister of Justice? Inga: Dh-Dhurke?! Is that you, ya dirty turncoat?! How in the--! What in blazes is going on here?! Dhurke: Oh, you know, just popped over to the States for a little R&R. But enough about me, Inga. That was a poor excuse for a bluff you pulled just now. We both know your threats are as empty as your head. You can't lay a hand on Maya Fey, and I do mean that literally. Inga: Ugh! Apollo: (What is he talking about?) Dhurke: You can kiss your chances of getting the orb goodbye. Inga: ...Heh heh heh. Maya Fey ain't my only... how shall I say... insurance, you know, Dhurke. Dhurke: What? Inga: I've got someone dear to you right in the palm of my hand, see? Now that one, well... You can imagine what kinds of things I could do, right? Dhurke: ! ............ Inga: Heh heh. Glad you're seeing things my way. Meet me at Amara's Tomb tomorrow, 3 PM sharp. And you better come alone, got it? If all goes well, the orb is all you'll need to get Maya Fey back. Dhurke: ......... Apollo: Dh-Dhurke, what's going on? Dhurke: You heard him. I have to get back to Khura'in at once. Apollo: What?! Why?! Dhurke: No time to explain. Apollo: But are you even going to make it? What if there are no seats left on the next flight? Plus, you're a wanted man. They're not just going to let you get on a plane. ???: Let me worry about that, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Ch-Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth? What are you doing here? Edgeworth: Taking care of the hostage situation. Apollo: Oh, now that you mention it... ...Pearl did say that she saw you around in Kurain Village. Phoenix: I had him look into a few things while I was on my way back from Khura'in. ...Including Maya's situation, of course. Edgeworth: I was astonished to hear she was still in Khura'in earlier... ...but it explained why I found no connection between her and Mr. Atishon. Apollo: Sorry to interrupt, but going back to the plane situation... Edgeworth: I've taken the liberty of chartering one for us. It's ready to take off at any time. And I will do what's necessary to hide the fact that Dhurke Sahdmadhi is onboard. Apollo: ...Wow. (Must be nice to be chief prosecutor...) Edgeworth: Wright, we have no time to lose. We must head for Khura'in at once. Phoenix: ...Right. Athena: I'm going, too! After all, you're bound to need my help! Trucy: No fair! I wanna go, too! Phoenix: This isn't a vacation, Trucy. Besides, I'll need you to hold down the fort. Trucy: But Daddy! Apollo: (Guess I should also only bring what's necessary.) ...Sorry Trucy, but would you mind holding on to this stuff for me? Unnecessary evidence foisted onto Trucy. Trucy: Fine. But you'd better bring me back something besides just more evidence. Dhurke: Excellent. Now, let us make haste... to Khura'in! Apollo: And that's how our sudden trip to the Kingdom of Khura'in began. I never imagined I'd return to the country of my youth under such circumstances, though... May 18, 2:30 PMTehm'pul Temple Apollo: That was a long flight. It's already 2:30 in the afternoon. Talk about cutting it close. ........... (The Kingdom of Khura'in... This is no time to reminisce, but... ...I gotta say, this place sure brings back memories.) Phoenix: Hurry up, Apollo! Apollo: Right behind you! Dhurke: Amara's Tomb is located in the courtyard of Ga'ran Palace. We should have just enough time to get there. Athena: Then let's sprint there! Think you can keep up, Apollo? Apollo: S-Sure, no sweat! Edgeworth: I'll contact the royal family and the local police, and inform them of our arrival. Phoenix: Thanks, Edgeworth. Examine Athena: Apollo. I'm sure this place brings back memories, but could you reminisce later? Time's running out! Apollo: You're right. We have to find Ms. Fey before it's too late. Talk Any ideas? Athena: I know you probably want to reminisce and all, but there's no time for that right now! Apollo: You're right. We've got to get to Amara's Tomb with Ms. Fey is being held captive! Present Anything Athena: Apollo! Don't go showing me stuff for no reason! We have to find Ms. Fey before it's too late! May 18, 2:45 PMGa'ran Palace - Royal Residence Apollo: *huff, puff* *huff, puff* I wasn't made for all the running and climbing and near-drowning I've done this week. Phoenix: It's 2:45... Only fifteen minutes left. (Changed from [It's 2:45... Only 15 minutes left.] in the original release) Dhurke: See that cylindrical building rising in the distance? That's Amara's Tomb. Phoenix: Amara... Wasn't that the previous queen? The one who was assassinated? Dhurke: Yes. And I'm the one they pinned it on. Apollo: It will take a few minutes to get to the tomb from here. ???: So, you have returned... Barbed Head. Phoenix: Ah...! Apollo: (I've seen her before on the news. If I remember correctly, this is the crown princess Rayfa Padma Khura'in.) Rayfa: What are you people doing here? This is the Royal Residence! Commoners are not allowed entry without permission. Phoenix: A prosecutor from the States... ...should've already called and requested permission for us to enter. As to why we're here, Your Benevolence... Have you seen Minister Inga? Rayfa: If you seek my father, I just saw him heading toward Amara's Tomb. Phoenix: Was he with anyone? You know, like some shady-looking underlings or something? Rayfa: No, he was alone. Why do you ask? Apollo: (Looks like she has no idea about Ms. Fey's abduction.) Athena: You hear that? I think we have company. *stomp, stomp, stomp* Royal Guard: Bow down before her glooooooory!!! Her Eminence Queen Ga'ran, grand priestess of Khura'in approooooooooaches!!! Apollo: Huh? ...Ga'ran? Ahhh! I-It's--! Phoenix: ...Q-Queen Ga'ran! Ga'ran: ............... Guards... Surround Amara's Tomb at once! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence! Ur di'hara Ga'ran! Apollo: (What's she doing? Is she going to help us?) Phoenix: Excuse me, Your Eminence... Ga'ran: So, our \"Barbed Head\" lawyer returns. May we presume you are here for Maya Fey, the spirit medium who has been abducted? Phoenix: Y-Yes, you may! Ga'ran: Allow us to apologize for the criminal actions of our husband. Phoenix: Oh, um... no need to apologize for him! Ga'ran: Honestly, Inga... Abducting a guest in our country? How could you? Rayfa: Father... abducted someone? Phoenix: Your Eminence, what about those soldiers over there? Ga'ran: They are the Ga'ran Royal Guard, soldiers who serve the crown and no other. Apollo: Royal guard? Ga'ran: They are an elite force selected from only the most loyal and outstanding of our subjects. Apollo: And why have you ordered them to surround the tomb? Ga'ran: The police will not come if it is my husband who is committing the crime. We shall have to storm the tomb and take Minister Inga into custody ourselves! Apollo: Whaaat?! Y-You mean...? Dhurke: Ga'ran! No! His hostage is in there! Ga'ran: Dhurke! How dare you set foot in the palace! Have you come to turn yourself in?! Dhurke: Listen, we need to call a truce for now! Ga'ran: Ga'ran Royal Guard! Seize this traitor of the crown! Royal Guard: As you wiiiiiiish, Your Eminence! Resist and you diiiiiie! Apollo: W-Wait a second! Dhurke: Dhurke: Slow down there, Ga'ran. I'm here to conduct a hostage exchange. But if you take me in now, Maya Fey is as good as dead. Ga'ran: ...A hostage exchange? And why would he choose to do such a thing with you? Dhurke: We can talk about that later. Right now, I need to get in there before it's too late. If I can't resolve this in twenty minutes, you can storm the palace. Now then... if you'll excuse me... Ga'ran: Dhurke, wait! ... *sigh* Guards, allow the insurgent Dhurke Sahdmadhi to pass. Rayfa: Barbed Head, you have some explaining to do! Phoenix: Right... Well, while we're waiting here... ...Apollo, why don't you explain the situation? Apollo: Whaaat?! M-Me? Rayfa: Leave nothing out, Horn Head, or I'll dehorn you where you stand! Apollo: (Horn Head? She doesn't waste any time coming up with nicknames. And what's with the attitude? Her father is the one who abducted Ms. Fey!) Examine Amara's Tomb Apollo: (Dhurke's in there right now.) Guards Athena: The Ga'ran Royal Guard has the tomb surrounded. Apollo: Yeah, and it looks like they might storm the place at any moment. Phoenix: If Her Eminence gives the order, they'll have no choice but to follow through. And I have the feeling she's about ready to do so. Apollo: All we can do is wait and hope for the best, huh... (I hope Dhurke and Ms. Fey both come out of this in one piece.) Any other point of interest Apollo: (This is no time to be looking around. Not until Dhurke gets back.) Move Rayfa: Where do you think you are going?! Apollo: (Oh, right. We're supposed to wait for Dhurke to return.) Talk Hostage taking by Inga Rayfa: Do my ears deceive me, or did I hear talk about my father abducting someone? Apollo: Oh, um, you heard right. He abducted Maya Fey, and... Rayfa: I-Insolent fool! Apollo: P-Pardon my rudeness! Rayfa: A gentle soul such as my father could not possibly have committed such a crime! Phoenix: \"Gentle\"? You think he's gentle? Apollo: I'm afraid it's true, Your Benevolence. He's holed up in that tomb as we speak. Rayfa: Really? I find this difficult to believe. Why would he do such a thing? Inga Karkhuul Khura'in Apollo: Umm, Your Benevolence? You saw your father heading toward the tomb? Rayfa: I did. I was over on that veranda, deep in thought... ...when I saw him hurrying toward the tomb. I'd say it was about ten minutes ago. (Changed from [...when I saw him hurrying toward the tomb. I'd say it was about 10 minutes ago.] in the original release) Apollo: (Why was he rushing? Maybe he was worried he'd be late?) Did you see anyone else heading for the tomb? Rayfa: I saw no one else after he entered. Apollo: So Minister Inga and Ms. Fey are the only ones in there besides Dhurke? Phoenix: Who knows? But I wouldn't be surprised if he had a minion or two with him. Apollo: Dhurke... I sure hope he's all right. Present Anything Rayfa: Horn Head! Stop wasting time and explain what's going on here! And make it quick, or I'll yank those horns right off your head. Apollo: Nngh... How about we keep our hands to ourselves and I'll explain everything...? (Guess I'd better start talking...) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: ...It's only been five minutes? (Argh, it feels like an eternity.) Phoenix: Patience, Apollo, patience. Ga'ran: ................. May 18, 3:20 PMGa'ran Palace - Royal Residence Apollo: It's been almost twenty minutes. What's taking Dhurke so long? Ga'ran: ...The appointed time has come. Our royal guard shall now storm in. Apollo: Umm, can't you wait just a little longer? Ga'ran: No, we cannot. Every second we wait puts the hostage's life in even more danger. Therefore, we see no alternative but to order our guards to storm in. Apollo: (But that'll put Ms. Fey's life in danger, too!) Ga'ran: Guards! Storm the tomb and seize Minister Inga, along with the insurgent Dhurke Sahdmadhi! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence! Apollo: What?! Dhurke's under arrest, too? Ga'ran: Naturally. That traitorous snake assassinated my predecessor, Queen Amara. Now go! Seize them both! Royal Guard: Raaaaaaaaah! We're going in! Follow me, men! For Her Eminence! Ur dihara Ga'raaaaaaaan! Apollo: ............ (I hope no one gets hurt.) Royal Guard: Ah! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Your Eminineeeeeeeence! Apollo: What the--? Why are they running back out?! Ga'ran: What is the meaning of this? Royal Guard: S-Something terrible has happened! Dhurke...! Th-Th-The minister...! H-H-He's dead! Ga'ran: What's this?! Apollo: WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Phoenix: Apollo, quick! Apollo: I'm right behind you! Ga'ran: No one enters without our--! ...Hmph! Come, let us see what has transpired! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence! May 18Ga'ran Palace - Amara's Tomb Apollo: Wh-Where's Dhurke?! Phoenix: Apollo, over there! Apollo: .........Dhurke? Dhurke: ................ Apollo: Dhurke! Wh-Wh-What... What have you done? Dhurke: ..........Apollo? Phoenix: L-Look! Ga'ran: So it is... Minister Inga who has fallen? ...! Guards! Seize this murderous man at once! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence! Surrender or peeeeeeerish, rebel scum! Dhurke: N-No, wait! Aaaaaaaaargh! .............................. ............................................................ Apollo: Dhurke! (They're taking him away...) *thud* Apollo: Oww! (Dhurke just threw something at me.) Wait, this is the... (Is he telling me to keep it safe?) ???: ......Nick? ...Is that you? Phoenix: M-Maya! Are you all right?! Maya: Dh-Dhurke, he... he saved me. ...I feel... exhausted. I can't keep my eyes... open... Phoenix: Maya! Apollo: (Minister Inga -- the man behind Ms. Fey's abduction -- had been killed. And Dhurke was arrested for his murder. So it was that the abduction of Maya Fey came to a sudden and unexpected resolution. With this, the curtain fell on the minister, but things were far from over.) May 18Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence Athena: Apollo! What happened?! Apollo: ......I can't say for sure. But from what I can tell, it seems Dhurke has killed Minister Inga. Athena: Whaaaaaaaaaaat?! You think he did it to save Ms. Fey? Apollo: Most likely... But who knows? I'm really confused right now... Rayfa: M-My father... He's...? This cannot be! I must see for myself! Royal Guard: Your Benevolence! We cannot allow you to pass! Rayfa: Fools! Stand aside! Royal Guard: Forgive us! But we have direct orders from Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran! Rayfa: Uuuuuuuuuuuh! Father... Oh, Father...! Dhuuuuuurke! You will pay for this! Phoenix: ...Apollo, let's go regroup somewhere. Apollo: Y-Yeah... (Dhurke... It wasn't really you that did it... right?) May 18Tehm'pul Temple Apollo: ......... Athena: Are you okay, Apollo? Apollo: ...Y-Yeah. Phoenix: Edgeworth's speaking with the local police... ...so let's sit tight until he returns. Apollo: ...O-Okay. ............... Phoenix: ...I know you must be in a state of shock right now, but I need you to stay with us, Apollo. Apollo: (He's right. I can't go to pieces now!) Thanks, Mr. Wright. I'll be fine! May 18Tehm'pul Temple Edgeworth: Wright, Mr. Justice... I'm afraid I have some bad news. It looks like things will only get more complicated from here. Apollo: Prosecutor Edgeworth... What's happening with Dhurke? Edgeworth: As I understand it, he has been officially charged with the murder of Minister Inga. Apollo: H-He has? Edgeworth: However, I did manage to get us permission to investigate the crime scene. And I expect we'll be allowed to visit Mr. Sahdmadhi shortly. Apollo: ...Thank you. (I'm sure glad Prosecutor Edgeworth is here with us.) Edgeworth: Also, it just so happens that Detective Skye is here in Khura'in... ...so I have asked her to assist us with our investigation. Apollo: What?! What's she doing here? Edgeworth: It seems Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has grown quite fond of her. He's been ferrying her around all over the place. A few days here, a few days there... They've almost become a team of sorts. Apollo: (Despite what Nahyuta says... ...it seems he thinks highly of Ema's skills.) Athena: So what now, Apollo? Apollo: I think I'll go pay Dhurke a visit at the Detention Center. Phoenix: I... want to go check in on Maya at the hospital. What about you, Athena? Athena: Well... If there's footwork to be done, I'd better stick with Apollo and give him a hand. Edgeworth: Very well. Then I will accompany Wright. Apollo: Okay, we'll go our separate ways for now. Phoenix: All right. If anything comes up, you have my cell number. Athena: Do you know your way around here, Apollo? Apollo: It's been over ten years since I left... but I'll try not to get us hopelessly lost. Examine Temple Athena: Mr. Wright stayed there the entire time he was here, apparently. Apollo: Why would he stay at a temple instead of a hotel? Athena: He says it helped to cut costs. Long stays at a hotel really add up, you know. But he had to sleep on the floor with a load of strangers. There weren't any showers, either. Apollo: Wow, that's worse than staying at a youth hostel for backpackers. Spring Apollo: (This is said to be a sacred spring, and a pathway for souls to follow. The people of Khura'in believe the spring draws souls to the temple... ...and by the truth gained in the Hall of Justice beyond, they are memorialized. It seems that legal trials and funeral rites are inseparable in this country.) Background temples Apollo: (There sure are a lot of temples around here. In fact, it looks like most of the buildings around here are related to Khura'inism.) Talk Any ideas? Athena: Queen Ga'ran sure has a lot of personal attendants. Apollo: Yeah. The Ga'ran Royal Guard... They're like her own private army. Athena: More like an elite fan club made up of carefully selected soldiers who adore her. That's how I see it anyway. Apollo: That's... a pretty blunt way of putting it. What to do Athena: Dhurke Sahdmadhi -- the charismatic leader of the Defiant Dragons -- arrested. This is going to deal a major blow to the rebels. Apollo: Yeah. I can already see Datz having a heart attack when he finds out. Athena: Speaking of Datz, he was on the plane with us... ...but I haven't seen him since we landed. Apollo: Dhurke said he wanted Datz to go to him before he caused any more trouble. Athena: ...Yeah, he strikes me as a troublemaker. Apollo: ...I just hope he doesn't do anything crazy, like trying to break Dhurke out of jail. Present Attorney's Badge Athena: I thought that attorney badges were the same around the world. But I just realized this type is only used back home. Apollo: You've had your badge for a while now, and you're JUST noticing that? Athena: Hey, I'm still getting used to things after all the time I spent in Europe. But as they say, when in Rome! Apollo: Wait, what are we even talking about anymore? Founder's Orb Athena: The orb... It was a real surprise to find out that it's hollow on the inside, wasn't it? Apollo: Yeah, and an even bigger surprise to find that the founder's face was hidden within. Athena: But now that the orb's secret has been revealed... ...how are you supposed to restore it to its original state? Apollo: ...Well, it was probably wax or something that melted to reveal the figure inside, so... ...if we turned it upside down and heated it up again, it should go back to the way it was. Athena: Ohhh, I get it! That's one clever little contraption. Photo of My Father Athena: I've been thinking about that photo. Your father was quite the manly man, Apollo. Apollo: Ha ha ha. I sense a compliment in there somewhere. Athena: Huh? Where'd you get that idea? Apollo: Oh, um... N-Never mind. Athena: Never mind what? Apollo: ......... Er, nice weather we're having today. Athena: ......... Aww... Is there something you wanted to hear me say, Apollo? Apollo: L-Look! Just forget I said anything, okay?! Royal Residence Examine Inga's residence Apollo: (Somebody got a little carried away decorating this place. There's a golden lion keeping watch at the entrance.) ...That frog looks like it's cowering under the lion's glare. Athena: Really? 'Cause to me, it looks like the frog is glaring at the lion. Apollo: Come on, Athena. How does that make any sense? Athena: Huh? I just call 'em as I see 'em. Apollo: (I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.) Ga'ran's palace Apollo: The palace of Queen Ga'ran is built to impress. Its white walls and gold ornamentation lend it an imposing air. Athena: It makes Minister Inga's residence look downright humble by comparison. Apollo: Yeah. It shows the difference in their tastes... and which one wears the pants, so to speak Amara's tomb Apollo: The previous queen, Amara, was laid to rest in her own private tomb. Pretty impressive. Athena: They say it cost $800 million to build, and took 400 workers five years to complete. Special memorial rites were also conducted at various points of its construction. Apollo: That's quite an undertaking. Athena: It was built with donations from her devoted subjects and royalty of neighboring countries. It ended up giving a huge boost to the national economy. Apollo: Wow, Queen Amara must've been one charismatic lady... Rayfa's residence Athena: Ooh, look at those flowers! They give the whole house such a cute vibe! I wonder if this is where Princess Rayfa lives. Apollo: ...I doubt it. She doesn't look like the type to decorate with cute flowers. I mean, I may not know her well, but she seems awfully serious and snobby. I bet she uses nothing but roses and peonies - stuffy old people flowers, you know? Athena: ......Apollo. I guess it's too much to ask that you not judge a book by its cover, huh. Apollo: What's that supposed to mean? Footprints Apollo: Are these... Inga's footprints? They appear to be heading toward the tomb. Athena: Didn't Princess Rayfa mention something about that? You know, something about him rushing over to the tomb before we arrived? Apollo: I wonder if he had accidentally dozed off before the exchange or something. Pond or bridge Apollo: Vibrant lotus flowers floating on still waters... Butterflies dancing about... It's almost supernatural in its beauty. Athena: And at the center of it all rises the tomb where Amara's soul slumbers.  It makes you wonder if that bridge there is a getaway to the hereafter. Apollo: Yeah... Especially after both Dhurke and Inga crossed that bridge earlier. Urns Apollo: This overturned urn has spilled water everywhere. Everything around it is soaking wet. Athena: D-Don't look at me! Apollo: (Rightly or wrongly, I'm guessing Athena's the type who gets blamed for a lot of things. And the more people accuse her, the more defensive she becomes. Even to the point of preemptively denying any wrongdoing.) Athena: I said, it wasn't me! Apollo: I never said it was. Amara's Tomb Examine Athena: Apollo, I know you can't help but want to start investigating, but... Apollo: I know. We should pay Dhurke a visit over at the Detention Center. May 18Detention Center - Visitor's Room Dhurke: Apollo! Here to see your old man, are you? Apollo: Dhurke. Are they done interrogating you? Dhurke: Nope, the fun hasn't even started. I imagine they'll really take me over the coals though. Athena: I don't even want to think about how harsh their interrogation method will be. Apollo: ...Yeah, but that's nothing compared to what they'll do if they find him guilty. Dhurke: They've branded me a terrorist who killed the previous queen, and now the justice minister. If found guilty of these crimes, I'll be facing a very public execution. Apollo: P-Public execution...?! (This is worse than I thought!) Dhurke: Come on, son. Turn that frown upside down! You'll jinx us. As soon as I get out of here, I'll take you to this tasty hash house I know. Apollo: .........I'd like that. (I really need to find out what happened. Time to switch to work mode.) Dhurke, can you tell me what happened? ...Oh, and there's also something I want you to take a look at. Examine Bell Athena: .................. Apollo: ...Don't do it, Athena. Don't ring that bell. Athena: Ack! Wh-Who, me...?! Perish the thought. I mean, would I ever do something so childish? Apollo: .................. Athena: All right, all right! Put your bracelet away already. Talk about unfair! Guard Apollo: That guard's standing so still, and with such great posture... I wonder if he spends his days just watching the dust dance in the sunlight. Wait a second. Don't you do that in court sometimes, Athena? Athena: Eep! You mean you noticed? Apollo: Don't think you can take it easy just because I'm the lead lawyer on this one. Talk The incident Apollo: Dhurke, what happened in there? You didn't really kill Minister Inga, did you? Dhurke: Well, the thing is... ...I really don't know. Apollo: Huh? Dhurke: I remember seeing the mural of the founder right as I entered the tomb... ...but I got all dizzy immediately after that. The next thing I knew, I was standing there with a bloody knife in my hand... ...and covered in Inga's blood. Apollo: So you don't remember meeting with him? Dhurke: No. The last thing I remember after entering the tomb is feeling really dizzy. Athena: There's no way he can explain what happened if he can't remember anything. Apollo: Y-Yeah... Dhurke: .........Hmm. I suppose there's no getting out of this one. Apollo: But we can't give up yet! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! I was just messing with you, son. Apollo: Well, stop. It's not funny. Dhurke: S-Sorry. Apollo: (Sheesh. Nothing seems to faze him. Not even being arrested for murder.) Dhurke: This is going to be one tough case, Apollo. Not only have I been charged with Inga's murder... ...but I've also been charged with Amara's assassination from twenty-three years ago. Apollo: You're on trial for two charges? Dhurke: Ga'ran is practically licking her chops just thinking about my public execution. Guess it means we can't afford to lose our heads, huh. Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: I... I don't know how you can laugh at a time like this. Dhurke: ...So, son, I take it you'll be defending me at my trial? Apollo: ...Of course. You can count on me. Dhurke: That's my boy! Looks like your nerves are as steely as those vocal chords of yours! After all, you've got the Defense Culpability Ace to contend with, too. Apollo: ...Oh, right... So if you're found guilty... ...then I'll be charged with the same double homicide, huh. Dhurke: Don't tell me you forgot about that...! Apollo: I'll-- I'll be fine. I-I just have to make sure we win this one. Dhurke: You sure? Because you don't sound very fine. Athena: ...Um, Apollo? What was that about an assassination twenty-three years ago? 23 years ago (appears after \"The incident\") Apollo: About that incident twenty-three years ago... That was when the previous queen, Amara, was assassinated, wasn't it? Dhurke: Yes. Someone set her private residence on fire. She lost her life in the ensuing blaze. Apollo: And you were arrested for the crime? Athena: Why would they arrest you, Mr. Sahdmadhi? Weren't you just a lawyer back then? What relation could you have had with the queen? Dhurke: Um, about that... Amara was... well... she was my wife. I may not look the part, but I was once husband to a queen. In short, I was royalty. Athena: What? No waaaaaay! Are you saying you won the heart of the reigning queen? Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! C'mon, you're talking to a guy who hones his prowess against witnesses on the stand. Even a queen is no match for this dragon's glare! Athena: W-Wow, you're really something else. Apollo: So was a verdict ever reached, Dhurke? Dhurke: I acted as my own attorney and won. ...Until I was accused of fabricating evidence, that is. Then it all went south. Apollo: (...Now where have I heard a story like that before?) Athena: What happened after that? Dhurke: I, uh... I made a run for it. Athena: You ran?! But why? Dhurke: I didn't kill Amara, and I didn't fabricate any evidence. But if I had stuck around for a retrial, I'd have been found guilty for sure. I couldn't allow that to happen; Amara's true killer would never face justice if I did. So I left my law practice behind and went underground. Apollo: But that was twenty-three years ago. ...Are you telling me that after all these years... ...you still haven't discovered the truth? Dhurke: Yeah... The fact that it was arson means that the crime scene was reduced to ashes. There is little in the way of evidence left. It's just been brick wall after brick wall. Apollo: (I guess that means it's all up to me to figure it out, huh. Along with Minister Inga's murder, of course. ...I think I'm going to be sick.) Dhurke: Come on, son. Don't look so down. With you on the case, it'll work out somehow. Apollo: (I hope he's right.) Dhurke: Say, son, do you remember my office? Apollo: ...Sure. (I remember that messy, dimly lit room.) Dhurke: The file I've amassed on Amara's assassination is kept there. I think it might help you on this case. Do you remember how to get there? Apollo: (Let me think... I recall going in through a manhole...) How can I not, Dhurke. I hated how I always got so dirty getting there. And that stench... (That old case is important, too, but I should probably focus on the minister's murder first.) Present Attorney's Badge Dhurke: I'm proud of you, son. You've really become a fine lawyer. Apollo: Well, at least it means I'm qualified to defend you. Dhurke: ...To think the day would come where you'd come to my defense. I'm one lucky man. Now I can die in peace. Apollo: Whoa, slow down! I'm going to prove you innocent, so...! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Just pulling your leg, son! Apollo: (...Even when he's in the slammer, Dhurke is Dhurke.) Founder's Orb Dhurke: I see you got it safely out of the tomb! Apollo: Why did you throw it at me like that? Dhurke: I want you to listen carefully, son. The orb must not fall into Ga'ran's hands... Not ever. Apollo: I thought Minister Inga was the one who was after it. He was the one who lent it to Professor Buff to study, after all. So haven't you exposed his crime now? Dhurke: I have, but... ...there's more connected to this relic than meets the eye... Much more. And whatever it is, I can't help feeling that it could turn this entire kingdom upside down. Apollo: You said something like that before. (Looks like Dhurke's intuition is at it again.) Dhurke: Ga'ran will do anything to retrieve this... ...so guard it well, son -- at least until tomorrow's trial. Photo of My Father Dhurke: That's the only remaining photo of your father. Take good care of it. Apollo: I will. ...I'm just surprised to see it after all these years. Dhurke: I had a tough time tracking it down and retrieving it. It was taken by some European tourists who just happened to be watching your father. I had one of my men go to Europe to look them up and ask whether we could have it. Apollo: Y-You went through all that trouble? Dhurke: ...I did. So don't go losing it or anything. Apollo: I said I'd take good care of it, didn't I? After clearing \"23 years ago\" Talk option and presenting Founder's Orb: ???: I'm afraid your time is up. Apollo: ! N-Nahyuta. Nahyuta: It's time for the prisoner's interrogation. So begone, you putrid-headed, criminal-abetting lawyer. Apollo: Wait! Don't tell me... you're the prosecuting attorney? Athena: What?! But that would mean... Nahyuta: ...Is there a problem here? Apollo: You bet there is. He's your father! Nahyuta: ...And your point is...? My relation to the accused is irrelevant. The fact remains, I am a prosecutor. Apollo: N-No, that's not what I... (I don't think I'm getting through to him.) Dhurke: .........Nahyuta. Long time no see, son. How've you been? Nahyuta: ......... Dhurke: Look... I hear you've been serving Ga'ran -- rather faithfully, in fact. Whatever happened to our dream of taking her down and changing this country, son? Nahyuta: .........The past is the past. Dhurke: What do you mean? Why are you doing this? Nahyuta: .........It's simple. People change. The Nahyuta you knew exists no more. Dhurke: Listen, son, I don't know what made you change like this... ...but you're still my boy, even if you prosecute my case. The rest of the Defiant Dragons and I eagerly await your return. Whenever you're ready, we'll welcome you back with open arms. Nahyuta: ........Ngh! .........As I said, I've moved on. Now, let us waste no more time; for flowers do not blossom simply from talk of the past. Apollo: ......... (Nahyuta... Why do I get the feeling there's something he wants to say, but can't?) Nahyuta: ...Guard, move the accused to the interrogation room. Guard: Yes, sir! This way, you rebel scum! Dhurke: Ow! Watch it! Not so rough, will you! Apollo: (...Nahyuta. Is he seriously going to prosecute his own father?) May 18Ga'ran Palace - Amara's Tomb Apollo: So, this is the tomb of Amara, the previous queen of Khura'in. It's really lavish. I guess you could say it's fit for a queen. Athena: Is the faceless woman in that mural over there Amara? Apollo: No, that's the Holy Mother. She's the one who brought spirit channeling to Khura'in. Athena: Oh, right. The woman in the orb. ???: Oh, it's you two. Getting right down to business, I see. Apollo: Hi, Ema. We heard you'd give us a hand if we needed it. Ema: Yep. Mr. Edgeworth asked me to help where I could. So, it's been quite a while since you've been back in Khura'in, I hear. Apollo: Yeah, more than ten years, in fact. Ema: Well, you sure didn't waste any time. I mean, you're already mixed up in a murder. You're as big a trouble magnet as Mr. Wright. Apollo: P-Please don't say that. My luck's already bad enough as it is. Athena: Ema, I hear Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has requested your services again. He seems to have really taken a liking to you. Ema: You mean His Ephemeral Holiness? MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. I don't mind that he approves of me and my abilities. It's just, his people skills need some serious work. But when he manages a smile and compliments my work, it's hard to say no. Plus, working on investigations overseas is a priceless experience. But flying back and forth between here and home every few days with no days off... That's been tough, and the lack of sleep has been brutal on my skin. To make matters worse, the defendant in this case is someone I know. I mean, how could this get any worse?! MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. Apollo: (Sounds like they've got one complicated prosecutor-detective relationship going on.) Examine Apollo: (We better get Ema's okay before we start snooping around.) Talk The incident Apollo: Ema, have you determined the cause of death? Ema: Blood loss from a stab wound. A single stab in the back was enough to cause the victim to bleed to death. The estimated time of death is 3 PM, which is when Dhurke came onto the scene. Inga's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Apollo: Any suspects besides Dhurke? Ema: No. He, Maya, and the minister were the only ones here. And Maya had been tied up until she was freed by the queen's royal guard. Apollo: Could someone have been hiding somewhere in here? Ema: Not likely. I was told this tomb was searched from top to bottom right after the murder. And during that time, the royal guard set up a perimeter to prevent anyone from escaping. Athena: In other words, the crime scene was completely sealed off? Ema: It would appear so. Apollo: Hmm... No way for a third party to escape without being spotted, so... (Great. It's another one of those convoluted locked-room mysteries.) The incident (subsequent times) Apollo: Ema, have you determined the cause of death? Ema: Blood loss from a stab wound. A single stab in the back was enough to cause the victim to bleed to death. The estimated time of death is 3 PM, which is when Dhurke came onto the scene. Apollo: Any suspects besides Dhurke? Ema: No. He, Maya, and the minister were the only ones here. And Maya had been tied up until she was freed by the queen's royal guard. Apollo: Could someone have been hiding somewhere in here? Ema: Not likely. I was told this tomb was searched from top to bottom right after the murder. And during that time, the royal guard set up a perimeter to prevent anyone from escaping. Athena: In other words, the crime scene was completely sealed off? Ema: It would appear so. Apollo: Hmm... No way for a third party to escape without being spotted, so... (Great. It's another one of those convoluted locked-room mysteries.) The victim Apollo: About the victim, Minister Inga... He was the kingdom's Minister of Justice, correct? Ema: Yes. Inga Karkhuul Khura'in was the second most powerful figure in Khura'in. Plus, he was married to the queen. Apollo: Seems strange that someone of his status would abduct someone. Ema: Apparently, he only told a few of his most loyal subordinates about his plan. That way, there was little chance of the police or even the queen finding out. Apollo: What was Inga hoping to gain by getting his hands on the orb? Ema: That I don't know. But I'm working on it. Apollo: (...I wonder if it really was for what Paul Atishon-Wimperson said...?) Atishon: I must deliver it to my benefactor at all costs. Phoenix: What do they want that relic for anyway? Atishon: Heh heh heh. It's something to do with an old legend. My patron seeks the great power said to be granted to whoever solves its secret. Apollo: (A great power that is said to be bestowed on whoever solves the orb's secret. In Khura'in, only those who can channel spirits are said to be fit to rule. Was that why Inga wanted such power? Did he want to be king?) Amara's tomb Apollo: So this is the tomb of the previous queen? Ema: Yes, Queen Amara was laid to rest here. She lost her life in an arsonist's blaze. What a tragic end. I heard this tomb sits on the actual site of her residence before it was burned down. They built it on the same spot so her soul could rest in peace. Apollo: (So this is where the fire happened, huh.) Athena: Why do you think Minister Inga was holding Ms. Fey captive here? Ema: It's the perfect spot, if you think about it. It's close to his private quarters, which made it easy to keep an eye on his prisoner. And the courtyard is only open to the royal family, so he had little fear of prying eyes. Plus, the tomb is normally locked, and only the royal family is allowed access. Athena: So that's why he picked this place. Apollo: How long had Ms. Fey been held captive? Ema: About six days. Apollo: Really?! That long?! Ema: It appears that she was severely weakened by her prolonged confinement. She passed out as soon as she was freed, and is now on an IV drip at the hospital. She's been asleep ever since. Athena: Poor Ms. Fey. I hope she gets better soon. Present Attorney's Badge Ema: Your attorney's badge? Huh... Apollo: What, that normally gets a better reaction from you. Ema: I'm tired of collecting your fingerprints. It's kind of lost its luster. Apollo: Yeah, but who knows? There could be other people's prints on it. Ema: Ooh, that's true! Hand it over, buddy! Apollo: Ah! Ema: ............Hmph. The only prints I found were yours. Apollo: (Argh, it's all dusty now.) Anything else Ema: Oh, you must need my forensic expertise! Just leave it to me! Apollo: Oh, um... Actually, I was wondering if you see anything strange about this. Ema: ...Oh. .................................... Apollo: (Why isn't she saying anything?) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: Ema, do you mind if we start looking around? Ema: Sure, I've already got the okay. Knock yourselves out. Oh, and here. It's a diagram the police drew of the tomb. I thought I'd give you a copy to help your investigation along. Apollo: Thank you. Tomb Diagram added to the Court Record. Ema: Oh, and let me know if you need my forensic expertise. Don't you dare keep all the fun to yourselves, you hear?! Apollo: You don't need to worry about that. (Besides, I'd hardly classify this as \"fun\".) Examine Front of Amara's sarcophagus Apollo: So this is Amara's sarcophagus. Let's take a closer look. Sarcophagus curtains Athena: Hey, these curtains open, Apollo. Sarcophagus keyhole Apollo: ...That's one big sarcophagus. Ema: They say the mummy of Amara, the former queen, rests inside. Apollo: A mummy, huh? ...Rats, it's locked. Ema: Hey, don't touch that! Apollo: You mean we can't search inside it? Ema: Not a chance. Besides, it's not something anyone'd try opening, anyway. Apollo: What if the real killer's hiding inside? Athena: Hey! Anyone in there? Ema: D-Don't do that! You're going to get us cursed! Athena: C-C-Cursed? Ema: The queen likely bears a grudge toward the living after such a violent, painful death. So no one dares touch the sarcophagus for fear of incurring her wrath. Athena: .........Oh no, Apollo. What am I going to do? Apollo: Don't look at me. Ema: ...In any case, the sarcophagus is temperature controlled. It's kept really cold to preserve the mummy. So even if someone did decide to hide inside it, they would eventually freeze to death. Apollo: I see... (Still, if they bundled up, I bet a person could hide in there for a little while.) Sides of Amara's sarcophagus Apollo: The sarcophagus is surrounded by a curtain. I bet someone could've hidden behind it. Ema: True, but that's one of the many places the royal guard checked after storming in. Athena: Wow, they were really thorough. Ema: Yes, well, apparently, one of their members loves mystery novels. He peered into every nook and cranny with an almost frightening amount of gusto. And when he was done, he said: \"Very interesting. It's like one of those locked-room mysteries.\" Apollo: Sounds like he's in the wrong line of work. Bloodstain on Amara's sarcophagus Athena: Wow, it's covered in blood. Apollo: With a blood spatter this large, it must've gotten all over the killer, too. Come to think of it... There was blood on Dhurke's clothes. Athena: The circumstantial evidence points to Dhurke being the killer. Apollo: That's what I'd conclude if I were a cop, too. (Why are things always so bleak for me...?) Holy Mother mural Apollo: It looks like the Holy Mother was painted here to watch over Amara's sarcophagus. Athena: So it's like, this tomb is protected by the founder? That must be so reassuring to those she left behind. Apollo: Only one problem: they didn't paint the eyes she needs to do said watching. Athena: Come to think of it, she doesn't have a mouth to smile down on the tomb with, either. It's actually kind of creepy. I wonder if being watched over by something like that gives the queen nightmares. Apollo: ...Hey, hey. Keep that up, and the founder just might come and \"watch over\" you, too. Broken statue (while facing Holy Mother painting) Apollo: Look, one of the statues is broken. Athena: Yeah, but it's kind of hard to see from here. Apollo: Let's check it out when we get a little closer. Front of broken statue Apollo: One of the statues is broken. Let's take a closer look. Broken statue Apollo: This thing's more splinter than statue now. Ema: The bullet from the victim's gun did a real number on it. Athena: It seems like something you'd get cursed for, you know? Apollo: In Minister Inga's case, I'd say getting your ticket punched is curse enough. Athena: Yeah, but don't curses extend to the afterlife? Apollo: You need to stop taking what Nahyuta says so seriously. Athena: I-I'm perfectly capable of thinking for myself! Brown magatamas Apollo: It's a magatama... I think. Did it come from the broken statue? Athena: Look, Apollo, there's another one. But the other statues only have one each. Apollo: Hey, you're right. Maybe this statue was special or something. Bullet Apollo: Look, there's a bullet here. Ema: It's from the pistol the victim was carrying. My guess is he tried to shoot his attacker, but missed, and the bullet ended up here. We've already determined the rifling marks to be a match to his gun. Athena: Rifling marks? Aren't those...? Ema: Oh ho! Shall I explain? The science behind it is absolutely fascinating. Apollo: No, no, we're good. Ema: Hmph, lawyers... Think they're so smart. Apollo: You do realize we can hear you. Sparkling object Apollo: Hm? There's something shiny down there. It's a pendant... Athena: There's blood on it. I wonder who it belongs to. Ema: All we know is it's not the victims. No one in the royal family recognized it. Apollo: ...Ema, did you lift any fingerprints from it? Ema: I did, but... ...I wasn't able to get a clean one. Apollo: That's too bad. Ema: But the blood turned out to be the victim's. Apollo: That means it must have fallen here in the course of the murder. (It might be Dhurke's. I should ask him about it later.) Pink Butterfly Pendant added to the Court Record. Body outline Apollo: Guess this is where Inga collapsed when he died. Better take a closer look. Body outline Apollo: They've already taken the body away. It's kind of sad how familiar I've become with body outlines. Ema: I have a photo of the body if you're interested. He was stabbed right in the back; the poor guy was practically skewered. Athena: What's he wearing on his arms? Ema: Those are the Cuffs of Justice. Seems to be a tradition here for the Minister of Justice to wear those forearm cuffs. Apollo: They look like they're made of a thick fabric, so I guess they aren't for protection. Athena: Maybe they're for keeping his sleeves out of the way when handling documents. Apollo: Yeah, that's probably their original purpose. But over the years, the reason for wearing them was probably forgotten. So now, they're just one of many traditional things that people do without knowing why. Athena: ...Oh, I get it. Kind of like the way you roll up your sleeves, huh? Apollo: ...Or your psychology, if we're going there. Athena: I happen to know why I started, thank you very much! Tomb Crime Photo added to the Court Record. Body outline (subsequent times) Apollo: These white lines indicate where the minister's body fell. Athena: Hey, didn't Ema give us a photo of the crime scene before they took the body away? Apollo: Looks like he was stabbed in the back. Athena: Those things on his arms... They're called the \"Cuffs of Justice,\" right? Apollo: Yeah, they're supposedly a traditional part of the minister's outfit. Knife Apollo: So, this is the murder weapon. Ema, did you find any prints on it? Ema: Yep, and they were super clear. They belong to one Dhurke Sahdmadhi. Apollo: That's not good. Were there any others? Ema: There was one more print from another individual... ...but it was too smudged to identify. It's probably an old print from someone else who had handled the knife. Apollo: Oh... (Yet another piece of unhelpful info to add to our ever-growing pile... *sigh*) Knife (subsequent times) Apollo: The murder weapon... Athena: Apparently, Dhurke's prints were found on it. Apollo: That's not very helpful, is it. Cell phone Apollo: I wonder if this is Inga's cell phone. Ema: It should be. His fingerprints are all over it. Apollo: Do you know if he talked with anyone recently? Ema: There were a few calls logged between him and his underlings. They're all members of the secret police, who were directly under the minister's control. Athena: You mean like spies? Apollo: I don't think that's quite it. Pistol Apollo: So the minister was armed, huh. Ema: Mm-hm. That's a four-shot pistol. He had it for self-defense, apparently. But it won't be firing anything any time soon. Apollo: Huh? Athena: He was carrying a broken gun around for show? Ema: No, we recovered a bullet here. Which means the gun probably broke as the minister fired its last round. Thing is... the gun's chambers are all empty. Yet, that one bullet is the only bullet we could find. Apollo: That is strange. Where did the other three go? Athena: ...Maybe Dhurke ate them. Apollo: We can ask the next time we see him. Just be ready for his predictably \"shocking\" answer. Pistol (subsequent times) Apollo: Inga's pistol... He used to carry it for self-defense. Athena: Apparently, he fired all four rounds. Apollo: Yeah, but only one slug was recovered in this tomb. Rows of statues Apollo: It's like a small army of monks, all neatly lined up. It looks like they're facing the sarcophagus in prayer. Athena: If you look carefully, each one has a slightly different expression. Apollo: I wonder if they used real people as models. Athena: Some are frowning, some are smiling... Hm? There's one that looks like he's trying his hardest not to burst out laughing. Apollo: ...Really? Hmm, I wonder why. Athena: Maybe it's like those times when things are so intense, you can't help but laugh. You know, like at funerals and stuff. Apollo: They went through all the trouble of depicting that? Talk about going overboard... Right incense burner Apollo: It's full of ash. My guess would be this is an incense burner. Athena: Hey, look, Apollo. There's something in the ashes. Apollo: ...Let's see what it is. Ash Apollo: It's full of ash. They must burn incense in here. Athena: So, I was wondering, Apollo... Did the ash come from the incense sticks that were burned in this? Or do people put their incense in after there was already she in here to hold them up? Apollo: Don't be silly, Athena. The answer's simple. The ash is the product of prayers from countless visitors who came here. It's not a chicken-or-the-egg kind of thing. Apollo: Oh, that's an interesting take on it. It's so much more poetic than mine! Gemstone Apollo: Is that... a gemstone? Wonder what it's doing here. Athena: Heh heh heh, I've got this one covered, Apollo. Would you like to hear my brilliant theory? Apollo: Well, I guess it wouldn't do any harm. Athena: You know how people make wishes by throwing coins into a fountain, right? Well-- Apollo: You know, on second thought, I'm good. Athena: Whaaat?! Y-You sure you don't need to hear my theory? I was just about to get to the good part! Apollo: Let's just ask Ema. That'll be much quicker. Excuse me, Ema? What's this gemstone doing here? Ema: Oh, that... It's not a gem, it's a button -- albeit a very expensive one -- from the victim's jacket. Must've fallen off and gotten in there somehow. Apollo: See? Every puzzle has an answer, Athena. Athena: Well, I thought my idea was pretty good... Wait... What's with this soot? See here, on the gemstone. Apollo: ...Hey, you're right. Gemstone added to the Court Record. Right incense burner (after examining gemstone) Apollo: It's full of ash. My guess would be this is an incense burner. Grape juice Apollo: This is the grape juice Inga was drinking. He was probably nervous before his meeting with Dhurke. Athena: So he drank grape juice? I'm not seeing the logic here. Apollo: Mr. Wright told me all about it when he was hospitalized a few years ago. He said grape juice has something in it that helps you relax. Athena: Really? ...Um, are you sure he was talking about regular, plain old grape juice? Because it sounds like he was talking about the fermented variety. Apollo: No, he couldn't have meant that. I mean, we're talking about a medical facility. They wouldn't have allowed something like that in. Athena: R-Right... Let's just leave it at that. Side paintings (while facing Holy Mother mural) Apollo: There's a painting up there, but I can't see it very well from here. Paintings right of Holy Mother mural Apollo: A baby on a lotus blossom? That's one strange painting. Ema: Apparently, that's part of a mural depicting the life and times of Queen Amara. You know, like a storyboard or something. Apollo: So that baby's supposed to be Amara? Athena: This one depicts Amara preaching to the faithful. Apollo: It's hard to put into words, but I've never seen anything like it. Let's see, the next one is... I-Is that... Dhurke? Why does he have horns? Athena: My best guess is... ...it depicts the first time Amara and Dhurke met. Apollo: So he's supposed to be some kind of demon who's seducing her? Athena: Well, he WAS successful since they got married after that. Apollo: ...The mural continues on the opposite wall. Paintings left of Holy Mother mural Athena Is this supposed to be Amara channeling a spirit? Apollo: It looks like the spirit of some country's sultan or something. And she seems to be conveying something to his retainers. Athena: ...Sh-She's on fire. Apollo: This must be Amara's assassination as allegedly carried out by Dhurke. They really made him look evil. Athena: ...This is the weirdest one of all. Apollo: Is that supposed to be Dhurke facing his punishment in the afterlife? Anyway... Hm? I guess that's the last one. Athena: I guess we're supposed to see this as a happy ending. Apollo: Yeah, except nobody came out of this story happy. Chair Apollo: Ms. Fey was apparently tied to this chair. Let's take a closer look. We should try to cover every angle possible here. Let's use [left analog stick / WASD] to change our perspective and take a careful look around. (Changed from [Slide the Touch Screen...] in the original release) * (Line [...or use the Circle Pad ([Circle Pad]) to look around carefully in this area.] removed in the Trilogy release) Seat, rails, or legs of chair Apollo: (...Poor Ms. Fey. She must've been tied up to this chair.) Athena: I can just imagine how much her backside must've hurt after sitting here for so long. Apollo: It would've been torture for you, I bet. I mean, you don't know how to sit still. Athena: If by that you mean I like to stay active, then I have to agree with you. Rope Athena: I bet you didn't know, but I happen to be a bit of an escape artist myself. Trucy showed me how to do her rope escape trick. Apollo: Uh-huh. And why would you bother learning something like that? Athena: Because we're always getting into trouble when working cases with Mr. Wright. So I thought it might come in handy someday. Apollo: Well, I guess you're right about that. Ms. Fey could've definitely used that knowledge. Athena: That's right! So now, you just sit right here and we'll get started. Apollo: What in the world gave you the idea I wanted to learn?! Bloodstain on chair leg Apollo: Look, there's a bloodstain on one of the chair legs. Ema: Really?! Hey, you're right. I completely missed that. Apollo: Let's move the chair so we can check under it. ...There's more blood under the chair leg. Ema: Hmm... I wonder what it's doing there. I have some luminol here. Why don't you do some testing around it? Spray floor near rope Leads to: \"Look!\" Apollo: Look! The bloodstain leads all the way to the sarcophagus! Athena: Ema, is this Minister Inga's blood? Ema: Hold on one second... .........Huh? That's strange. I didn't get a match. Apollo: So then... whose blood is it? Dhurke and Ms. Fey weren't wounded as far as we know. Athena: And the blood's been wiped up by someone for some reason. Apollo: Yeah, that's strange, too. Mysterious Bloodstain added to the Court Record. Bloodstain on floor (after examining bloodstain on chair leg) Apollo: There's a bloodstain on the floor. Athena: It's already been mostly wiped up, but the stain leads all the way to the sarcophagus. Apollo: I wonder whose blood it is. Wall curtains Apollo: Someone could have hid behind these curtains. Athena: Here, I'll go give it a try! Well, can you tell I'm hiding here? Apollo: No, I can't tell at all. That's it! That's the perfect hiding place! Athena: We did it, Apollo! We solved the case! Ema: Sorry to burst your bubble, but... ...the royal guard searched the tomb high and low right after they stormed in. And they said no one else was in here besides Minister Inga, Dhurke, and Ms. Fey. Apollo: ...Well. Back to the drawing board, I guess. Athena: My brilliant deduction -- destroyed in three sentences. After examining sarcophagus keyhole, sides of Amara's sarcophagus, bloodstain on Amara's sarcophagus, Holy Mother mural, broken statue (zoomed in), brown magatamas, sparkling object, body outline (zoomed in), knife, cell phone, pistol, gemstone, bloodstain on chair leg, and wall curtains: Apollo: I think we've covered just about everything. Maybe we should go over what we've learned so far. Athena: Umm... For starters, we're dealing with a locked-room murder. But instead of the tomb being locked, it was being cordoned off by the royal guard. And after the murder, no one was found to be hiding inside. Apollo: Right. In addition... ...we also know that Dhurke's fingerprints are all over the murder weapon. Athena: The curtain around the sarcophagus was drenched in the victim's blood on one side. The blood must've also gotten on the killer when they stabbed the minister from behind. Apollo: Dhurke had blood on him when the crime was first discovered. Unfortunately, he doesn't remember what happened. .................. Athena: ............ Apollo: (This is not good.) Athena: So, what we know so far is... ...things couldn't be worse for our case. And that's still and understatement somehow. Apollo: Yeah, it's looking pretty grim. Ema: Oh, uh! If you two are done here, I'll have to ask you to leave. Go on, scoot! Apollo: Something wrong, Ema? Why are you trying to give us the boot? Ema: ...It's just easier if you're not here when His Ephemeral Holiness arrives. ...Ah! Apollo: (Speak of the devil.) Ema: P-Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... Nahyuta: Detective Skye... It seems you've spoken at length with these two lawyers. I do hope you've also kept an eye on them. Ema: Y-Yes, of course! Like a hawk! They didn't touch a single thing! Ha, a-ha ha ha! Nahyuta: ...Give a lawyer an inch, and they'll take a mile. Never forget that. Apollo: (There's that look of distrust again.) ...Hey, Nahyuta. Do you really believe that Dhurke's guilty? Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: And are you seriously going to prosecute this case? I mean, he's your father. You were once part of the Defiant Dragons, weren't you? Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: Hey! Nahyuta! Wait! I said wait! Come on, Athena, after him! Athena: Huh? ...Oh, uh, right behind you! May 18Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence Apollo: Nahyuta, would you stop already?! Nahyuta: .........What do you want? Apollo: It's about Dhurke. Would you please hear me out? Nahyuta: ...I fail to see why I should. Now, if you'll excuse me... Apollo: Apollo: Nahyuta! ...Are you afraid of what I might have to say? If not, there's no harm in listening, right? Nahyuta: .........Very well. Speak. But make it quick. There is much I must do. Apollo: (Why does everything have to be so difficult with you?) Talk Prosecuting Dhurke Apollo: So, I know you'll be prosecuting Dhurke's case, but... ...aren't there any other prosecutors in this country? Why does it have to be you? Nahyuta: ...Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran, personally requested that I serve as prosecutor. Apollo: Sh-She did? That WOULD make it hard to say no. Nahyuta: Her Eminence thinks highly of my prosecutorial skills. Apollo: Still, she didn't have to ask you to handle a case against your own father. Be honest. You really don't want to do this, do you? Nahyuta: ...Ahh. You speak of love and sentiment. Apollo: Er, I guess so. Nahyuta: I do not deny such human emotions. But... the law is the law. And placing personal feelings above it is beyond reprieve. ...Do you disagree? Apollo: W-Well... No, I don't disagree, but... Nahyuta: Civilizations only exist due to the confines of the law. Without them, love and sentiment would lack the fertile they need to flourish. Do you disagree? Apollo: No, but... Nahyuta: The law must be obeyed. This truth sits above all else, including personal feelings. Therefore, whether or not I am the son of the accused is of no consequence. It is that simple, or would you say otherwise? Apollo: Nnnngh... B-But... Athena: Come on, Apollo! Tell him how wrong he is! Apollo: B...But don't you... you know... wish it wasn't that way...? Nahyuta: ............... Athena: ......... Nahyuta: It appears I've wasted my breath on you. Athena: And the winner is... Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! Nahyuta: ...Hmph. Still spewing empty words devoid of meaning or consequence, I see... ...you putrid red pepper. Apollo: Argh! ........ (I know I'm right... But did he have to be so eloquent about his point? It's like he's trying to cover something up with his pretty words.) Athena: Apollo, I'd cut back on the debates with him if I were you. Just stick to questions, like the one you wanted to ask. Who Dhurke cares about (appears after \"Prosecuting Dhurke\") Leads to: \"Nahyuta, I wanted to ask you about that hostage situation.\" Present Attorney's Badge Nahyuta: Why is that badge before me? Apollo: Remember how we used to talk about what we wanted to be back when we were kids? I wanted to be a lawyer, and you, a prosecutor. You said you wanted to prosecute bad guys to make sure they got punished. Nahyuta: Yes, passing judgment upon evil... That is my calling. And it is why I have taken this case. Apollo: Are you saying Dhurke is evil? Nahyuta: He who goes against what is righteous and holy... ...I shall reap his soul with all my power, whoever he may be, for that is my role. Apollo: (Then I'll just have to defend his soul with all MY power, Nahyuta.) Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Nahyuta: Alas... Another soul has departed this world, and must now be guided to the Twilight Realm. Apollo: You would even hold last rites for a kidnapper like Minister Inga? Nahyuta: Criminals, too, must be given funerary rites. Deny that, and their soul will turn malevolent, bringing woe upon the living. That is why all who pass on must receive a proper requiem. Apollo: Makes sense. I mean, if I were murdered, I'd probably be pretty keen on revenge, too. Anything else Nahyuta: The putrid-minded lawyer seeks information from me? Apollo: Come on, throw me a bone here. Nahyuta: I think not. Apollo: Well, aren't we stingy? Apollo: Nahyuta, I wanted to ask you about that hostage situation. Inga said he had someone dear to Dhurke in the palm of his hand. And he was using that person, along with his hostage, as leverage in obtaining the orb. Nahyuta: ...! That's news to me. Apollo: Well, that's what Inga said. Dhurke: You can kiss your chances of getting the orb goodbye. Inga: ...Heh heh heh. Maya Fey ain't my only... how shall I say... insurance, you know, Dhurke. Dhurke: What? Inga: I've got someone dear to you right in the palm of my hand, see? Now that one, well... You can imagine what kinds of things I could do, right? Dhurke: What? Inga: I've got someone dear to you right in the palm of my hand, see? Now that one, well... You can imagine what kinds of things I could do, right? Dhurke: ! ............ Inga: Heh heh. Glad you're seeing things my way. Apollo: I got the impression Dhurke had no choice but to follow Inga's demands after he heard that. So who do you suppose this special person is? Nahyuta: .........I wouldn't know. BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: ! (My bracelet's reacting!) Hey, Nahyuta, about what you just said-- Nahyuta: Apollo: Ack! Ow-ow-ouch! M-My bracelet is crushing my wrist! Youch! That really hurts! Wh-What the heck's going on?! Nahyuta: ...I'm wise to your tricks, you putrid pepper. That bracelet reacts to the anxieties around you by squeezing your wrist. But now that I know how it works, I can make it tighten around your wrist any time I wish. Consider this a warning. Apollo: Argh... (I don't know how he did it, but this renders my bracelet useless.) Nahyuta: Such devilry is powerless in the face of the Holy Mother's blessings. Athena: Looks like your special power won't work against Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, Apollo. We'll have to try something else. Apollo: Argh, you're right. We'll just have to ask Dhurke about this. Nahyuta: .........It appears... Apollo: ? Nahyuta: ...You intend to go through with a trial you have no hope of winning. Grow up, Mr. Justice. We are no longer children, you and I. Apollo: I'm not the one who needs to grow up, Nahyuta. In case you didn't hear, I won my last case against none other than Mr. Wright. Nahyuta: ! Athena: You tell him, Apollo! Nahyuta: ............... Apollo: (Is he mad? I can never tell with him.) Nahyuta: ...This trial is different. Your foolishness will only earn you a death sentence for aiding and abetting a criminal. And those who die as criminals... ...are doomed to be reborn in the next life as something lower than a bug or vegetable. You would be lucky to return to this realm as a patch of mold. Apollo: M-Mold? That's pretty harsh. Nahyuta: If you wish to avert such a fate, abandon this folly before it is too late. Apollo: ...I don't care if I end up as a dollop of blue cheese dressing in my next life! I'm going to defend Dhurke in court! Nahyuta: .........You fool. Know this... I intend to prosecute the accused with all my might -- no matter what you say or do. Consider yourself forewarned. ...Now, if you will excuse me. Athena: Prosecutor Sahdmadhi knows his father will be publicly executed if he's found guilty. Yet he won't show even an ounce of mercy. Apollo: ............... (...Nahyuta. Is this the real you? Have you really changed? Do you really plan on sending Dhurke to his death? Do you even hear me? Don't Dhurke and I matter to you anymore?) To be continued May 18Tem'phul Temple Phoenix: (Maya passed out right after we found her in the tomb.) Maya: ...I feel... exhausted. I can't keep my eyes... open... Phoenix: (She's been out cold ever since. We haven't been able to get a word out of her. The doctor says it's just exhaustion, but I can't help but worry...) Edgeworth: What is it, Wright? Are you all right? Phoenix: ...Yeah. Just thinking is all. I'm glad you're here, Edgeworth. We wouldn't have gotten the permissions we have without you. Edgeworth: ...Well, I didn't come all the way to Khura'in to be useless. Speaking of the investigation, I received a few things from Detective Skye. These should prove to be useful to us as well. Inga's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Tomb Diagram added to the Court Record. Tomb Crime Photo added to the Court Record. Phoenix: I can't thank you enough, Edgeworth. (Honestly, I'd have been so lost without him these past few days.) ???: You there! The \"Barbed Head\" lawyer, Phoenix Wriiiiiight! Phoenix: Huh? .........You're... from the Ga'ran Royal Guard, right...? Royal Guard: I am Lah'kee, royal guard member and Her Eminence's shoooooulder rubber!!! Phoenix: That's... very specific... And what does the royal shoulder rubber want with me? Wait, come to think of it, my shoulders ARE a bit stiff-- Royal Guard: Don't be absuuurd!!! I am here for one purpose ooonly!!! I am to bring you before Her Eminence... ...Queen Ga'ran, grand priestess of Khura'in!! Will you complyyy?!!! Phoenix: The queen? What could she want with me? (And why does he have to shout like that?) Edgeworth: Hmm... I can't fathom why Queen Ga'ran would summon you... ...but I advise you to accept Her Eminence's gracious invitation. .........Royal shoulder rubber Lahkee, was it? May I join Mr. Wright in his audience with the queen? Royal Guard: The name's Lah'kee! L-A-H apostrophe K-E-E!!! And...! All praise the omnipotent Queen Ga'raaan!!! For she has already foreseen and approved your request, Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth!!! You are both to come with meeeee!!! Edgeworth: You mean to say that Queen Ga'ran sees our every move? Royal Guard: Yes indeeeed! Her Eminence's spiritual power is immeeeeeeense!!! She can even see what's going on thoooousands of miiiiiiiiles away!!! Edgeworth: .........Wright. I fear I'll lose my hearing next if we don't hurry. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Me, too... Why would the queen herself summon me personally? What could she possibly be up to? Examine Temple Phoenix: There weren't any hotels available, so this is our home for tonight. It's a bed to sleep in and a roof over our heads. Phoenix: Sorry to disappoint, but... there aren't any beds here. We'll have to sleep on the floor next to a bunch of strangers. Edgeworth: Wh-What? ...Tell me there's a shower at the very least. Phoenix: The kitchen sink works just fine, I hear. Edgeworth: Of all the-- Wright, you will work to bring this case to a swift resolution. The sooner the better. Edgeworth: .........I suppose it will do. Spring Phoenix: The water's so clear, it's like a window into the soul. Edgeworth: I wouldn't stare too hard into it, Wright. Or you may find all your bluffs staring right back at you. Phoenix: No pool-gazing in front of a client. Got it. Temples in background Edgeworth: There appears to be many temples in this area. Phoenix: Yeah, there are always a lot of monks and worshippers praying around here. And then there's tourists like us. Edgeworth: It's unfortunate that we have more pressing matters to attend to. Then again, sightseeing with you of all people isn't exactly at the top of my list. Phoenix: (As if you have the luxury to be so picky, Edgeworth.) Talk Any Ideas? Edgeworth: So you'd been here all this time. I wondered where you had gone. Phoenix: ...Don't tell me you missed me, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: As if. The courts have been so peaceful without you around. Phoenix: You make it sound like I leave legal devastation in my wake. Edgeworth: Heh... Well, don't you? What to do Edgeworth: Well, Wright, what do you intend to do now? Phoenix: I was thinking... I want to help Apollo win this case. So why don't we try to gather whatever information we can? Edgeworth: You're quite the considerate boss. Phoenix: Well, I kinda forced him to take care of the office in my absence, so... ...it's the least I can do. Present Attorney's Badge or Tomb Diagram Edgeworth: Still at it, I see. I guess borders mean little in the face of your incurable habit. Phoenix: Well, I heard you used to present evidence left and right during your investigations, too. Edgeworth: That was a long time ago. ...Besides, who did you hear that from? Phoenix: Oh, I have my sources. Edgeworth: Oh? Well, tell your \"source\" that I look forward to his next salary review. Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Edgeworth: It's ironic that the man tasked with upholding the law should end up breaking it. Phoenix: Well, it's not like we don't have our fair share of that back home. Edgeworth: Hmph, that is a thing of the past. The worst offenders have already been removed. Phoenix: Now that you mention it, wasn't Gaspen Payne expelled from the prosecutor's office? Edgeworth: Yes, he was a particularly troublesome individual. I was shocked to see him resurface here in Khura'in, and with considerable sway, no less. I just hope he doesn't end up making a mess of things here as well. Royal Residence Examine Ga'ran Palace Phoenix: Ga'ran Palace, the heart of the kingdom's government and religion. Edgeworth: Yes, the two are inseparably intertwined here in Khura'in. The religious beliefs of its people touch every aspect of their lives, including legal affairs. Phoenix: Right. Like how they commune with spirits in court. I suppose Khura'inism is the glue that binds their faith, law, and politics together. It may seem strange to foreigners like us, but for them, it's perfectly natural. Landscape Phoenix: What a beautiful place this is. But I'd be enjoying this a whole lot more if we weren't investigating a murder. Edgeworth: Commoners aren't normally allowed access to the royal residence, you know. Under ordinary circumstances, it would be impossible to take in such a spectacular view. Though murder is certainly a unique reason to be offered such a rare opportunity. Rayfa's residence Phoenix: This place is decorated with all sorts of colorful flowers. And that view from the veranda looks like it would be amazing. If I had to guess, I'd say Rayfa must live here. Amara's Tomb Phoenix: Amara's Tomb -- the scene of Inga's murder. Poor Maya was held captive in there. Edgeworth: To think she was actually being held here in Khura'in. If only we had found out sooner. Phoenix: ...No point dwelling on that now. All we can do is to keep moving forward. Edgeworth: Yes, of course. Footprints Edgeworth: There are footprints coming from this residence. Phoenix: Too bad they just kinda end. I wonder who made them and where they went. Urns Phoenix: This overturned urn spilled its water all over the place. It was already knocked over when we got here earlier this afternoon, so... ...we can rule out Athena at least. Edgeworth: .........Wright. What does it say about you if your first suspect is your own subordinate? Inga's residence Phoenix: ...What a gaudy building. Looks like something you'd appreciate, Edgworth. Edgeworth: ...For the record, Wright, I have absolutely no interest in such ostentatious things. Phoenix: (Says the man who rides around in a red sports car, wearing that frilly cravat thing.) Amara's Tomb Examine Anywhere Phoenix: Apollo and Athena are already working this area. Edgeworth and I should try someplace else. Detention Center Examine Bell Edgeworth: This bell must be for summoning the guard. Phoenix: I bet one of your detectives would come running if you rang it. Edgeworth: Let's find out, shall we? Phoenix: Th-They're not seriously going to show up, are they? Guard Phoenix: Oh, the guard's asleep. And here I thought he was stoically doing his duty. Impressive. May 18Ga'ran Palace - Audience Chamber Ga'ran: Ah, the \"Barbed Head\" lawyer has arrived. We bid you welcome. And you, as well, Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth. Phoenix: Th-Thank you. (This place is still as magnificent as last time.) Ga'ran: We have heard much about you, Barbed One. It seems your bluffs and tomfoolery tend to leave our court devastated in their wake. Phoenix: Uh... Is that what people have been saying about me? Edgworth: ...Wright! Where are your manners?! Your Eminence. I am both humbled and delighted to be in your presence. Phoenix: Oh, umm... Your Eminence... Um, glad to be here. Looks like you're doing well. Ga'ran: ...Heh. It is all right. There is no need to keep your head bowed all day. Edgeworth: Yes, Your Eminence. Rayfa: ............ Phoenix: (Rayfa's not looking too good. I guess even she can't just bounce back from her father's murder...) ...So what can I do for you, Your Eminence? Ga'ran: We wish to question you about something related to the case at hand. Phoenix: (Perfect. Because I have a few questions of my own.) Examine Throne Phoenix: That's one swanky throne. I wouldn't mind taking a seat there myself. Edgeworth: The jester and the crown. I imagine it'd make quite the interesting picture. Phoenix: You know Edgeworth... I hate to say this, but you're absolutely right. Guards Phoenix: It's the Ga'ran Royal Guard. The one who came for us earlier said that he's the royal shoulder rubber. ...Um, excuse me. But are each of you charged with your own specific task? Royal Guard: I'm the royal teeeeeaaaa server! Royal Guard: I'm the royal taaaaaaster! Royal Guard: I'm the royal bed maaaaaaaker! Royal Guard: I'm the royal fitness traaaaiiiiine-- Phoenix: All right, all right... I'm sorry I asked. Edgeworth: At this rate, one has to wonder if there is no task left unassigned by Her Eminence. Talk Inga's crime Ga'ran: We fear we do not fully comprehend what has transpired. So it is that we summoned you here to further elucidate the situation. Is it true that our husband Inga had been seeking the Founder's Orb? Phoenix: That's right. He wanted to trade a hostage for it. That's why he abducted Maya Fey. Rayfa: Insolent fool! *ka-tonk!* Phoenix: Oww! Rayfa: That is a lie! A lie, I say! Father would have never done such a thing! Phoenix: B-But he did abduct Maya. That much is-- Rayfa: I will not stand here and listen to this nonsense! You will pay for this, you... you...! *ka-tonk!* *ka-tonk!* *ka-tonk!* Phoenix: Ow-Ow-Oww! P-Please, Your Benevolence! Ga'ran: That is quite enough, Rayfa. We understand your feelings, but we fear he speaks the truth. For we believe we know why your father would do such a thing. Rayfa: Huh? Ga'ran: We believe he was seeking the orb as a means of obtaining spiritual power. And with it, he intended to usurp the throne. Rayfa: .........M-Mother... Phoenix: What do you mean, Your Eminence? Ga'ran: Inga was planning a coup, for he was dissatisfied with the current administration... ...and his secret police was the primary instrument of his treason. Phoenix: The secret police... They came up during the high priest's murder trial, too. An elite force under the direct command of the Minister of Justice -- in this case, Inga. The man who was hunting down rebels as Lady Kee'ra was a member of that group. Ga'ran: Indeed. Inga turned that once proud force into his own private army. And he intended on using them to launch a coup and assassinate us. Edgeworth: So Your Eminence had no control over them? Ga'ran: As much as it shames us to admit it, Khura'in is not the unified realm it would appear to be. We are truly sorry you have had to witness the dirty underbelly of our kingdom. Rayfa: H...How could Father...? Ga'ran: But know that Inga could not have become king simply through our assassination. For in Khura'in, only those who possess spiritual power may sit on the throne. Edgeworth: I see... That explains why Minister Inga was seeking the Founder's Orb. Ga'ran: Barbed One, do you recall the man known as Pees'lubn Andistan'dhin? Phoenix: ...What about him? Ga'ran: He, too, was involved in Inga's machinations. Inga had bought his loyalty, ordered the man to steal the orb, and covered up the theft. Phoenix: And then, he sent the orb to the U.S. for Dr. Buff to study... It's all coming together... Dhurke the criminal Ga'ran: The capture of the infamous villain Dhurke Sahdmadhi... It may prove to be the crowning achievement of our reign. Now, perhaps, the kingdom may return to the peace it once knew. Oh, what a joyous day. Royal Guard: Hail to Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran, Grand Priestess of Khura'in! Her Eminence's spiritual power invoked a blessing straight from the Holy Mother! Phoenix: (I could see how her cronies would be elated at the prospect. But the queen herself seems almost giddy for someone whose husband was just murdered.) Rayfa: Father... Phoenix: (Rayfa, on the other hand, doesn't appear to be taking it so well.) About that incident that occurred twenty-three years ago... The one in which Dhurke was accused of assassinating Queen Amara. Ga'ran: Yes, he set fire to her private residence, burning my dear sister alive. Phoenix: Murder by arson... Ga'ran: ONly a demon would be capable of such a heinous crime. Phoenix: (But that event also set the stage for you to become queen...) What did you do before you were crowned queen, Your Eminence? Ga'ran: As part of our training to be queen, we served in many different governmental positions. The longest of which was as the previous Minister of Justice. It was in that position that we were best able to support our elder sister, Queen Amara. Phoenix: (Interesting... That's her husband's position, or at least it was.) And when you ascended to the throne, you passed the Defense Culpability Act. Defense Culpability Act (appears after \"Dhurke the criminal\") Phoenix: \"...those who would support criminals will be deemed just as guilty.\" What prompted you to pass something like the Defense Culpability Act, Your Eminence? Ga'ran: ...The assassination of our dear sister Amara. When the infamous villain Dhurke Sahdmadhi was apprehended... ...he announced that he would act as his own lawyer. Phoenix: (That's right... Dhurke used to be a lawyer.) Ga'ran: Dhurke had been an extraordinarily talented lawyer, and highly esteemed by the people. But he falsified evidence in an attempt to win his own case. Phoenix: I see... Ga'ran: But when the truth of his fabrications and the assassination of the queen came to light... ...the people were devastated. And trust in the legal system plummeted. Edgeworth: .........Now why does that sound so familiar? Phoenix: Yeah, I wonder, aha-hah-hah... Ga'ran: In Khura'in, the Hall of Justice is a sacred space where victims receive their last rites. Should the people lose their faith in it, the kingdom would be shaken to its very core. That is why the Defense Culpability Act had to be passed. It was the only way to keep our legal system from tumbling into the abyss. Phoenix: So that's how you sought to eliminate the use of perjury and phony evidence, huh. But that law is what made lawyers go extinct in your kingdom. Now there's no one left to defend those who have been accused. Ga'ran: .........We see how you could take issue with such a reality. However, we have not banned the act of lawyering itself. Those who are confident that they can prove their client's innocence... ...are always welcome to mount a vigorous defense, as you yourself have shown. Phoenix: W-Well, I guess so, but... Without lawyers, there's the possibility of false charges being filed and prosecuted. Ga'ran: So long as our prosecutors continue to run nothing but perfect trials... ...there needn't be fear of such nefarious dealings. Do you disagree? Phoenix: (Perfect prosecutors and their perfect trials, huh...) Edgeworth: Let's not get started down THIS path... Ga'ran: Furthermore, here in Khura'in, we have the Divination Séance. And so it is we no longer need lawyers, for the dead do not lie. Phoenix: Well, in the short time I've been here, I've beaten back false charges twice. And I've found that cases built on the memories of the dead are less than perfect. So yes, I do take issue with the Defense Culpability Act, to say the least. Ga'ran: ...Ho ho ho. Such relentless rhetoric. Your reputation precedes you, Barbed One. It feels as if we ourselves were being cross-examined. Phoenix: O-Oh, no, that wasn't my intention. Ga'ran: ...It is true that some feel that the Defense Culpability Act is a necessary evil at best. But it is a small sacrifice upon which the peace of our kingdom has been forged. Phoenix: (If you consider executing innocent lawyers a small sacrifice, then sure.) Ga'ran: The fact is that following its passage... ...the crime rate here in Khura'in dropped markedly. Therefore, we have no regrets concerning the enactment of the Defense Culpability Act. Phoenix: (Really? None at all?) Edgeworth: Wright, why don't we leave it at that? This isn't a court of law, after all. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Present Anything Phoenix: Um, please take a look at this... Ga'ran: ...That reminds us of when Dhurke was still practicing law. So, we see that lawyers in your country also present evidence... ...simply to gauge the other party's reaction when all else has failed. Do not presume to use such simplistic methods upon us. Phoenix: S-Sorry. After clearing all Talk options: Ga'ran: About the Founder's Orb that was to be exchanged for the hostage... It went missing after the murder. Would you happen to know anything about that? Phoenix: It's missing? I'm sure Dhurke had it when he went into the tomb. If it wasn't there, I have no idea where it could be, Your Eminence. Ga'ran: ...In that case, then perhaps Dhurke has hidden it somewhere. ...Incidentally... there is the matter of that horned youth you were with. Phoenix: Oh, you must mean Apollo. Ga'ran: From his odd hairstyle, may we assume him to be a relative? Perhaps, your younger brother? Phoenix: N-No, no! You've got it all wrong. He's Dhurke's son. Well, more like foster son -- they're not actually related by blood. Ga'ran: Dhurke's...? .........Royal guard! Royal Guard: Your Eminence! Phoenix: Hm? (What's she whispering in that one guy's ear?) Ga'ran: .........Thank you for your time. The two of you may go now. Edgeworth: Yes, Your Eminence. We'll be on our way. Phoenix: (Okay, now what? Apollo and Athena have the murder scene investigation covered, so... ...maybe we should go speak with the locals over at the bazaar.) May 18Khura'in - Bazaar RAWWWRRR! Edgeworth: Wh-What... Was that a lion? Phoenix: Oh, that? Caught me by surprise, too, when I first heard it. It's the cry of a local bird known as a warbaa'd. Edgeworth: A bird? That sounds like that? Warbaa'd: RAWWWRRR! Edgeworth: Sounds more like a beast than a bird, if you ask me. Phoenix: It's a form of mimicry. You know, to help protect them against predators and stuff. Edgeworth: Yes, well... Can't say I've heard one quite like that before. Phoenix: Oh, it's more than unusual -- it's endangered. It's extremely rare to encounter one in the wild these days. Edgeworth: ...If it's so rare, then what's one doing out here in the middle of the bazaar? Phoenix: You got me. Maybe it's got something to do with it being their national bird. *BANG* Phoenix: Aaahh! (Was that a gunshot?!) ???: Har har har har har! Startle ya, PW? Phoenix: Wh-What was that, Datz?! Datz: The Defiant Dragons' newest weapon. I call these puppies... Dragon Snot Snaps! Phoenix: Uh, huh... And you need those... why? Datz: Because our hard work is starting to pay off! Thanks to our TV signal hijacking and stuff, more and more people are joining our cause. But on account o' that, the regime's been cracking down on us real tough-like. Phoenix: Yeah, there's been a lot going on lately. Datz: You can say that again. I mean, what with the high priest's fake-murder-slash-suicide. People are calling it the \"DCA Tragedy,\" and it's causing a real public uproar. Phoenix: (Hopefully this means Tahrust's death won't be in vain after all.) ...So how exactly is a handful of firecrackers going to be of help to you guys anyway? Datz: Simple. First, I supply 'em to our fellow rebels. Then we use 'em as a diversion when we need to shake Ga'ran's goons. Phoenix: Huh? Datz: Like this! *BANG!* Phoenix: Whoa! W-Will you cut that out?! I'm not with the regime, and I'm not chasing you! Datz: Har har har har har har! Haaaar har har har har! Your reaction! That was priceless, PW! Warbaa'd: RAWWWRRR! Datz: Har har har har har har! Guess I startled that warbaa'd, too! Phoenix: (It's a miracle no one's trying to arrest him while he's too busy laughing.) ???: You there. Datz: ! Rayfa: You are one of those insurgents, are you not? Datz: Yikes! ...Take that! *BANG!* Rayfa: Eek! Phoenix: Aaand he's gone. Those firecrackers are more useful than I thought. Rayfa: Barbed Head! Phoenix: Your Benevolence. What can I do for you? Rayfa: I... I wanted to speak with you. .........About what my mother said... I do not believe a word of it. My father could not have been planning a coup. Phoenix: Well, I can understand why you'd feel like that, but... Rayfa: It was a setup! Someone must have been plotting against him. Phoenix: Um, and how do you know that? Rayfa: I just do. Because the Holy Mother guides me. And as the royal priestess, I must uncover the truth for all to see. Phoenix: (Hmm... Maybe this is just how Rayfa expresses her sense of duty.) Rayfa: You're investigating this matter, are you not? Then rejoice, for I shall accompany you, and bestow upon you the royal priestess's wisdom. Phoenix: Ha, a-ha ha. That's the best news I've heard all day, Your Benevolence. (No one would dare get in our way with Rayfa by our side.) We humbly accept your offer, don't we, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: As you wish, Wright. Rayfa: Excellent. Then let us begin with my father's private quarters. We should be able to find some clues there. I shall expose this false charge for what it is, if it is the last thing I do! Phoenix: (Could it be? Is the reason she's so defensive about Inga because she's a daddy's girl?) Rayfa: Barbed Head! Let us not waste any time! My father's private quarters are located within the royal residence. Now, follow me! Phoenix: Wait! She's sure in a hurry. Edgeworth: Wright, the minister's private quarters may hold evidence related to his murder as well. Phoenix: Yeah, maybe we can kill two birds with one stone. (Rayfa's awfully fired up. I just hope she'll be ready for the truth we find. After all, it's hard to believe that Inga was not in full control of the whole affair.) Examine Any point of interest Edgeworth: I never thought the day would come when we'd be investigating a case side by side. Phoenix: Oh? 'Cause I never thought the day would come when you'd get sentimental on me. Edgeworth: Nghrk! Come on, Wright! Time's a wasting! Phoenix: Wait, exactly which one of us was wasting time here? May 18Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence Phoenix: Now, if we could figure out which of these buildings houses Inga's private quarters... That's where we'll find Rayfa. Examine Inga's residence Phoenix: Now that's what I call an extravagant exterior. Is this where Inga's private quarters are? Edgeworth: Watch your step, Wright. That urn's been knocked over, spilling water everywhere. Phoenix: Yeah, the ground's soaked. I wonder who did this? ???: .........*sob* Phoenix: Hm? ...I think someone's in there. ???: *sob* Father... *sniffle* Phoenix: Is that... Princess Rayfa? Rayfa: There were still so many things I wished to tell you... Phoenix: (...She always puts on such a brave face. But hearing her crying all alone... I... I can't help but think of Trucy.) Rayfa: *sob* Father... ............... Phoenix: ...Um, Princess Rayfa? Are you in there? Rayfa: Ah! J-Just a moment! I'll be right out! .........I see you are finally here. Well, let us commence our investigation, shall we? Phoenix: ...Um, Your Benevolence? Maybe you should rest for a minute first. Rayfa: ...! You were eavesdropping on me! Weren't you?! Phoenix: Um, no! I mean, yes... Sorry. I couldn't help overhearing... Rayfa: .........Grrrr. Phoenix: I-It wasn't like I was spying on you or anything! Rayfa: ...You stupid... stupid... Barbed Head! *ka-tonk!* Phoenix: Yeowch! Edgeworth: ...You could've feigned ignorance. It's as if your brain-to-mouth filter shuts off the moment you step out of the courtroom. Phoenix: Ugh... I'm not THAT bad, Edgeworth. Rayfa: ...Anyway, what took you so long? I thought you would never get here. You have a lot of nerve, keeping the crown princess waiting. Phoenix: Oh, um... sorry? Rayfa: This was my father's residence. I have already unlocked it, so you can go right in. Oh, and... Be careful. Some dingbat dog in the courtyard and spilled water over there. Phoenix: A dingbat dog? Rayfa: That's right. The yappy mutt spilled a whole urn's worth. Phoenix: I wonder how it got into this area. Do you know what it looked like? Rayfa: Hmph. I have better things to do than to memorize what some stray dog looks like. Anyway, it is not worth talking about. Let's search my father's room, shall we? Phoenix: (...I really hope she's all right.) Inga's residence (subsequent times) Edgeworth: The Minister of Justice used to live here. Phoenix: Yeah, the decor looks like something he'd choose. After examining Inga's residence in Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence: May 18Ga'ran Palace - Inga's Private Quarters Phoenix: (What a mess. You can definitely tell a guy used to live in this room. I guess Inga and I had at least that much in common.) Rayfa: ...Bah, this staff keeps getting in the way. Nayna! .................. ...Oh. Phoenix: (Huh? Where's Nayna? Normally... ...she comes running whenever Rayfa calls.) Rayfa: ...That's right. Nayna is... Phoenix: (Nayna is... what?) Rayfa: Oh, well. You, Barbed Head! Come, hold this staff for me. Phoenix: Wh-Why me? Rayfa: Just take it! It's too heavy, and I am tired of holding it! Phoenix: (*sigh* How does Nayna put up with this day in and day out?) Um... I'll just set it over here for now. Examine Shoeprints Phoenix: There are some muddy shoeprints here. (Come to think of it... There was some spilled water by the entrance. Somebody must've stepped in it before coming in here.) Edgeworth: They're already dry. That means they're at least several hours old. Rayfa: Then someone must have been in here today in the early afternoon... ...for our servants clean this room each day. Here in Khura'in we have a saying: \"Leave not today's untidiness to the morrow.\" Phoenix: (Mine is: \"Why clean up today what you can leave for tomorrow?\") Hair dye bottle Phoenix: What's this? ...\"Je suis L'Belle!\"? Never thought I'd see THIS brand again... Edgeworth: It appears to be a sample of some sort of spray-on hair color. Phoenix: \"Color: Jet Black\"... I wonder if Inga was going grey. Here, Edgeworth. Maybe you can use it. Edgeworth: I like my natural hair color just fine, thank you very much! Desk Phoenix: His desk is crammed full of documents! Edgeworth: Hmm... They appear to be paperwork for executions. Phoenix: B-But for this many cases?! Edgeworth: Indeed. Something is rotten in the Kingdom of Khura'in. Hm? This one dates back to five years ago. Phoenix: Something tells me he simply kept putting them off because he hated doing paperwork. Bed Phoenix: That's one luxurious and comfy-looking bed. I've slept on nothing but hard floors since coming to Khura'in. Can't wait to sleep in a nice, soft bed again. Rayfa: Then take it. It's yours, if you wish. ......We'll have to clean this room out, anyway, now that my father's gone. Phoenix: But don't you want to keep these things as a memento of your father? Besides... I don't need his spirit haunting me late at night. Rayfa: .........Do you suppose if I slept on it, I could see my father once more? Phoenix: P-Princess Rayfa... (I honestly don't know how to answer that...) Bust Phoenix: Wow... That's one gaudy sculpture. Rayfa: My father sculpted it himself from a block of solid gold. Phoenix: (Why does it not surprise me that he was also a narcissist?) Ha ha ha. It's pretty detailed. He even included that personal stamp of his. Hey, the stamp's a little loose. Ah! Edgeworth: Look. There's a secret safe inside! Rayfa: Oh, my! To think such a thing was here all this time! Phoenix: Rats. Looks like we'll need the combination to get in. Bust (subsequent times) Edgeworth: To have a secret safe in his own bedroom... It seems the minister was a rather cagey man. Phoenix: Let's take a look inside. Who knows what we might find. Safe (after examining bust) Phoenix: We can't open this without the combination, but I doubt Princess Rayfa would know it... Edgeworth: Well, if we can't open it, we can't open it. For now, let's continue our investigation, and come back to this dilemma later. Syringe Phoenix: It's a syringe and a vial... Rayfa: Those were for my father's back pain. He said it really helped when the pain was particularly unbearable. Phoenix: It was that bad, huh. Edgeworth: He must've been injecting some sort of painkiller directly into his back, then. Rayfa: Yes, my father said his back pain could knock him off his feet. Phoenix: I know the feeling. I've experienced some pretty severe back pain of my own... Rayfa: Well, we can't have you throwing your back out in court, so why don't you take a vial? Phoenix: Oh, uh, no thanks. I hear your body builds up a tolerance to that sort of thing. Painkiller Shots ninja'd into pocket. Rayfa: I thought you didn't want them. Phoenix: (I'm going straight to a chiropractor as soon as I get home.) Syringe (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's a syringe and a vial... Rayfa: Those were for my father's back pain. He said it really helped when the pain was particularly unbearable. Phoenix: It was that bad, huh. Edgeworth: He must've been injecting some sort of painkiller directly into his back, then. Rayfa: Yes, my father said his back pain could knock him off his feet. Phoenix: I know the feeling. I've experienced some pretty severe back pain of my own... Backrest of chair Phoenix: This chair looks like it was modeled after Inga's suit jacket. Edgeworth: Hmm... The backrest even has those fancy buttons of his. I imagine they make the chair awfully uncomfortable to sit on. Rayfa: Actually, they served to massage the pressure points on his back. My father suffered from terrible back pain, you see. Phoenix: ...I wonder if it really works. Notepad Phoenix: This notepad must've belonged to Inga. Let's see... That's strange. Edgeworth: These appear to be notes detailing people's most prominent characteristics. Phoenix: Hey, there's even some stuff about me in here. Why would he bother doing this? Rayfa: Hmm... I am afraid even I can't answer that. Phoenix: (Whatever the reason, it's giving me a case of the heebie-jeebies.) Edgeworth: Hmm... It's as though he was taking down descriptions of people over the phone... That's what it reminds me of, anyway. Rayfa: What a brilliant deduction! One fitting of a chief prosecutor such as yourself. I commend you. Edgeworth: ...Heh, that's high praise coming from you, Your Benevolence. Phoenix: (Edgeworth's right. They do look like dictation notes, but... I don't know... I mean, why bother describing Nayna, who he must've seen every day?) Inga's Notepad added to the Court Record. Notepad (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's the notepad with those descriptions of various people in it. I wonder what Inga was using it for. Move Rayfa: Barbed Head. First you make me wait, and now you're simply going to leave?! Phoenix: (Guess I should stay put for a while.) Talk The kidnapping Rayfa: Barbed Head... I, the Royal Priestess of Khura'in, shall share my thoughts on the abduction. Phoenix: You will? Rayfa: ......Listen carefully, for such opportunities do not come often. Phoenix: Y-Yes, of course. We'd be grateful to hear anything you'd like to share. Rayfa: ...My father was very likely seeking to obtain the Founder's Orb. But it was not for the purposes of a coup d'état. It was all... for my sake! Phoenix: For your sake? Rayfa: The Founder's Orb is capable of bestowing great spiritual power. My father truly believed that. And he wanted that power to be mine. I haven't finished my training, and I still can't channel spirits! He was doing it for me! Phoenix: ......Right, I see. Rayfa: Well? Do you understand why he did it now? Phoenix: ............I do, but... ...it doesn't change the fact that Minister Inga was a kidnapper. Rayfa: Ah! Phoenix: But I guess you don't believe he is, do you? Rayfa: Ooooooh! New information is sure to surface upon further investigation. S-Suffice to say, he did this all for me. End of story! Phoenix: (Was he really trying to obtain the orb for Rayfa? Somehow, I doubt it. Speaking of powers... ...I wonder if Rayfa will be performing the Divination Séance tomorrow. I should probably ask her about that. Nayna Phoenix: Your Benevolence, I noticed Nayna isn't with you today. Rayfa: .........I know not where she has gone. I have not spoken with her since this morning. I assume she must be quite busy today. I did catch a glimpse of her a little after two o'clock. I tried calling out to her... ...but she went off somewhere again. Phoenix: A little after two? That's about an hour before the murder. Rayfa: ...Indeed. Of all the times for this to happen... She normally comes to me the moment I call her name. Phoenix: (I know it's hard to believe, but even nannies have lives, you know...) Edgeworth: Your inability to find her after the murder is slightly alarming. I wonder if her absence is related to today's incidents somehow. Rayfa: Do you think she was unwittingly caught up in them? Phoenix: Who knows... At the very least I don't think she was at the scene of the crime. Rayfa: Nayna... I hope she is all right. Phoenix: (Rayfa seems really worried for Nayna.) Tomorrow's Séance (appears after \"The kidnapping\") Phoenix: I take it you'll be conducting tomorrow's Divination Séance? Rayfa: Who else, if not I? Phoenix: Good point. (The thing is... ...Divination Séances are all about what victims experienced in their final moments. So, tomorrow... ...Rayfa will experience her own father's death, exactly as it happened. That's more than anyone should ever have to deal with.) ...Do you really have to go through with the Séance tomorrow? There's really no one else? What about just calling the whole thing off? Rayfa: ............It's not as if... ...It's not as if I'm doing this because I want to. Phoenix: No? Rayfa: Ah! N-Never mind. I misspoke! The Divination Séance is a very important duty of the royal priestess. And it is one I intend to fulfill. Phoenix: (There's that word: duty.) Maya: ...Your Benevolence. As crown princess, you are destined to rule this kingdom one day. That means there will be many things that you alone must determine. Things like how to keep your people happy, and what is true and what is false... And most importantly, what role you must play therein. Rayfa: .................. I wonder if I am even up to the task. Phoenix: (Performing the Divination Séance IS very important for a priestess... ...but duty or not, it's a heavy burden for someone so young. Even worse, she'll be forced to watch her father's murder. Will it be a weight too heavy for her to bear?) Nayna and Rayfa (appears after \"Nayna\") Phoenix: Your Benevolence, has Nayna served you long? Rayfa: Yes, she has been at my beck and call for as long as I can remember. I have heard she even cared for me as an infant, right down to changing my diapers. Phoenix: Your diapers? It almost sounds like she could be your mother. Rayfa: Indeed. But that is a simple fact of life when your mother is busy being queen. Nayna takes care of my every need. She is my teacher in all things, as well. Phoenix: (Rayfa's pool of knowledge seems rather lopsided in some respects. Could that be the result of Nayna's teachings?) Rayfa: Nayna... Could it be that my trusted attendant has come to dislike me? Now that I think about it, perhaps I've been acting rather spoiled as of late. Phoenix: Oh, I'm sure she'll be back. Rayfa: ...Yes, I suppose Nayna would never truly abandon me. Upon her return, I will do something nice for her. Perhaps she'd like a shoulder massage. Phoenix: (And yet, I can't shake the feeling that Nayna's connected to this case in some way.) Present Attorney's Badge Rayfa: Remove that vile badge from my sight! If you insist on tormenting me, I will take matters into my own hands! Phoenix: Hey, don't bite it! Rayfa: ............ Hmm, it's much harder than I thought. Phoenix: ...What did you think it's made of? Tomb Crime Photo Rayfa: ...! ............ Phoenix: Um, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: .........Father. Phoenix: Whoops, s-sorry! Didn't mean to hurt you like that. Rayfa: Hmph! Do not underestimate me! I am the royal priestess, and as such I will experience my father's death tomorrow. So hand it over! A photo of a corpse... will not... phase... Phoenix: Your Benevolence! Edgeworth: Wright, you fool! Put that picture away! Rayfa: ...Nngh. There is no need to worry. I simply lost my footing, that's all. Phoenix: (Now I'm REALLY worried about tomorrow.) Painkiller Shots Rayfa: My father's back used to cause him considerable pain. I would give him massages from time to time. He seemed to truly enjoy them. Phoenix: Hmm, I didn't peg you as the dutiful daughter type. Rayfa: But never again... will I... Phoenix: Your Benevolence... Um... I could stand in for your father if you'd like-- Rayfa: ............Rrgh! *WHAM* Phoenix: Youch! M-My back! I think you broke something! Rayfa: Hmph. That's what I call the royal treatment. Inga's Notepad Rayfa: These are notes my father took on the characteristics of those around him. I wonder what he wrote about me. Phoenix: Let's see... Pink raiment... Tattoos on face... Ch-Childishly cute?! Rayfa: Huh?! Phoenix: That last one's rather subjective, isn't it... Anything else Phoenix: Your Benevolence, I wanted to ask you about this. Rayfa: Nayna! Nayna! Where are you?! Phoenix: Um, I thought you said she wasn't around... Rayfa: ...Oh, yes, of course......... Well, you're sadly mistaken if you think questioning Nayna will clear things up. Phoenix: (But I'm trying to question you, not Nayna.) After clearing all Talk options and examining shoeprints, hair dye bottle, bust, syringe, and notepad: Phoenix: I'm really beginning to wonder what's inside that safe. Any idea what the combination might be, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: None whatsoever. Phoenix: (It looks like a four-digit combo lock, so maybe it's a date. But it's probably not anything that would be easy to guess.) Well, let's try some dates and see what happens. I wonder what date Inga would use as a combination? Date the DC Act was enacted Phoenix: How about the date the Defense Culpability Act was enacted? Do you know when that was, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: Nayna! Nayna! Edgeworth: Your Benevolence... *whisper, whisper*... Rayfa: Yes, of course... I believe the date would be: June 14! Phoenix: (Really, Edgeworth? Is whispering in the ears of elites the secret to your success?) All right, let's give 0-6-1-4 a try. Nope, that's not it. Time to try something else. Leads back to: \"I wonder what date Inga would use as a combination?\" Parents' anniversary Phoenix: How about your parents' anniversary? Rayfa: Hmm... I have not the faintest idea of when it is. Phoenix: Yeah, I guess you wouldn't, huh. Edgeworth: ...It's December 11. Phoenix: H-How in the world do you know THAT fact, Edgeworth?! Edgeworth: Hmph, I don't. I simply deduced it using elementary school-level logic. Though I doubt you'd grasp how I arrived at my conclusion, so I'll save my breath. Phoenix: (There's no way you didn't use some kind of superpower to come up with that...) Anyway, here goes... 1-2-1-1. ...No good. It won't open. Let's try another number, shall we? Leads back to: \"I wonder what date Inga would use as a combination?\" Rayfa's birthday Leads to: \"When's your birthday, Your Benevolence?\" Phoenix: When's your birthday, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: Hmph, you are wasting your time. It could not possibly be my birthday. Phoenix: Aw, come on. It's worth a shot. Rayfa: ...Fine. It's December 24. Phoenix: Christmas Eve? Well, let's give it a try. 1-2-2-4... Ahhh! ...I-It... It opened! Rayfa: It did?! Phoenix: Yep. And it looks like the bottom safe was a fake. Edgeworth: Something meant to mislead would-be thieves, no doubt. Still, it was rendered quite ineffective by his use of such an easily-guessed combination. Rayfa: Wh-Why, Father...? Why my birthdate...? Examine Open safe Phoenix: Okay, let's see what's in here. Hm? This looks like a letter or something. Let's see... \"Dear Father... I wanted to wish you a happy birthday. You're always so kind, and I love you very much. I hope you live to be a hundred years old! Love, Rayfa.\" ............... Rayfa: I-I wrote this to my father when I was eight years old. F-Father... Why would you hold on to... something so childish and stupid...? Phoenix: .........There are some other papers in here. Hmm... Ah! This... This is the plan for his coup d'état! Rayfa: Wh-What?! Give me that! .........I... I don't understand. Edgeworth: It seems Justice Minister Inga was plotting the assassination of the queen. Rayfa: This... This can't be true. Father would never harm Mother. Phoenix: (Poor Rayfa. This has to come as a terrible shock.) ...What's this? There's a photo in here, too. Hmm... It's of a woman and a baby. I wonder who they are. ...On the far left, there's a law book with the mark of the Defiant Dragons branded on it. Rayfa: .........Wait! Th-Th-That's...! Phoenix: Your Benevolence? Rayfa: ...How... How can this be? *thud* Phoenix: P-Princess Rayfa! Rayfa: ............... Phoenix: (She's looking incredibly pale.) Your Benevolence. Are you all right? Rayfa: .........All right? How can I be all right? Phoenix: Huh? Rayfa: .........All that I have believed... It was all lies. Phoenix: I'm afraid I don't follow. (What the heck's she talking about?) Um... Can I ask who the woman is in this picture? Rayfa: ...H-How should I know?! .........It seems I didn't know ANYTHING that was going on! Phoenix: (...Doesn't look like I'm going to get much more out of her while she's like this.) Woman's Photo added to the Court Record. Rayfa: .........Mother. Phoenix: Huh? Rayfa: I must ask my mother... about the secret she is hiding. Phoenix: Um, what secret...? Rayfa: ...I must go. Goodbye. Phoenix: Wait! ...What was that all about? It's like her mind was off somewhere else. Edgeworth: It appears this photo really upset her. Phoenix: (I wonder who the lady in this picture is.) ???: Stop! Shah'do! Come back here! ???: Ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff! Phoenix: Wait, that sounds like... Ahlbi and Shah'do. Edgeworth: That's odd. Commoners aren't normally allowed in this area. I wonder what's afoot. Any point of interest (after examining open safe) Phoenix: I better not touch anything without Rayfa's permission. Who knows what she might say... or do if she finds out. After examining open safe in Ga'ran Palace - Inga's Private Quarters: May 18Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence Shah'do: Ruff ruff ruff! Edgeworth: Nghoooooooooh! Phoenix: Ahhh! Edgewooooorth! Edgeworth: .........I hope one of you has a good explanation for this. Ahlbi: Ahhhhhh! I'm SO sorry! Phoenix: Hi, Ahlbi... Ahlbi: No, Shah'do! Bad dog! Leave the man's frilly thingamajig alone! Shah'do: Grrrrrrrrr... Edgeworth: If you would kindly detach your dog from my cravat. Ahlbi: R-Right away, sir! Just hold still, and... Edgeworth: And...? Shah'do: Grrrrrr... Ahlbi: Hrrrrrgh! Hrrrrrrrrrrrgh! Edgeworth: Nghoooh! Stop pulling like that! You'll only stretch the fabric! Ahlbi: Come on, Shah'do...! Let go of his... carava-chamacallit! Shah'do: Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! Ahlbi: Hmm... This isn't working. I'll just have to pull harder, then... One, two... Edgeworth: Wait! What are you--?! Ahlbi: THREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! RRRRRRRNNNNNNNNGH! .........Come OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON! Edgeworth: NNNNGHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH! AAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! I NEED AAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRRRRR! *huff... huff... huff...* Were you trying to kill me?! Ahlbi: I'm really sorry, mister. My dog has a habit of attacking frilly things like that. Phoenix: (Maybe for his sake, he should stick to more traditional targets, like cars, or his tail...) Ahlbi: What's worse, he snuck in here again today and stole some weird-looking hat. I don't know what to do anymore. Bad dog! You're a very bad dog! Shah'da: *whine* Phoenix: (Wait a second... I've seen that hat before.) Examine Urns (after clearing \"Ahlbi in the courtyard\" Talk option) Leads to: \"Ahlbi, you wouldn't happen to know how this urn got knocked over, would you?\" Talk The frilly hat Phoenix: Ahlbi, could I see that hat again? Ahlbi: Sure! Phoenix: (Wait... Isn't this... Isn't this Nayna's hat? But I thought she'd disappeared.) Ahlbi: Shah'do swiped it from someone. Phoenix: Um, Ahlbi? How exactly did Shah'do get this? Ahlbi: Allow me to explain! It all started while we were on a walk through the bazaar today. When, suddenly, Datz popped out of a manhole! Datz: Hah! Ahlbi: Whoa! Datz: The fangs of the Defiant Dragons... ...Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaah... ...Datz Are'bal is here! .........Say, you wanna join our cause, kid? Ahlbi: (Misattributed to Datz Are'bal in the original release) Huh? Ahlbi: Naturally, I was super startled by that weirdo's sudden appearance. Warbaa'd: RAWWWWWWRRRRRR! Shah'do: Ruff ruff! Datz: Back! Dog of the Ga'ran regime! Ahlbi: (Misattributed to Datz Are'bal in the original release) Huh? But this is my dog, Shah'do... Datz: Defiant Dragon secret weapon: Dragon Snot Snaps! ACHOOOO! *BANG* Ahlbi: WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOA! Oof! Datz: Har har har har har! Aw man, the look on your face! That was classic! Ahlbi: The sudden bang of the firecracker spooked Shah'do, and he ran off into the crowds. Shah'do: Ruff ruff ruff ruff! Ahlbi: Ahhhhhh! Shah'do, come back here! Datz: Har har har har har! That'll teach ya, Ga'ran's lapdog! Policeman: You there! What do you think you're doing?! Datz: ...Ack! Not good! Ahlbi: That's when a policeman came running over and hauled Datz away. That happened right around 2 PM, if I remember correctly. Phoenix: (...I'm not even going to pretend I know what Datz was trying to do.) Ahlbi: I chased right after Shah'do, and... ...when I finally caught up to him here in the palace courtyard, he had this in his mouth. Edgeworth: 2 PM, hmm? That's about an hour before the minister's death. Phoenix: Nayna supposedly went missing after the murder... ...but this would place her here at the palace at around two. (Changed from [...but this would place her here at the palace at around 2.] in the original release) Ahlbi's Statement added to the Court Record. Ahlbi: Actually! I just remembered I saw something pretty amazing around that time, too! Phoenix: Something amazing? The frilly hat (subsequent times) Phoenix: Ahlbi, could I see that hat again? Ahlbi: Sure! Phoenix: (Wait... Isn't this... Isn't this Nayna's hat? But I thought she'd disappeared.) Ahlbi: Shah'do swiped it from someone. Phoenix: Um, Ahlbi? How exactly did Shah'do get this? Ahlbi: Allow me to explain! It all started while we were on a walk through the bazaar today. When, suddenly, Datz popped out of a manhole! Datz: Hah! Ahlbi: Whoa! Datz: The fangs of the Defiant Dragons... ...Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaah... ...Datz Are'bal is here! .........Say, you wanna join our cause, kid? Ahlbi: (Misattributed to Datz Are'bal in the original release) Huh? Ahlbi: Naturally, I was super startled by that weirdo's sudden appearance. Warbaa'd: RAWWWWWWRRRRRR! Shah'do: Ruff ruff! Datz: Back! Dog of the Ga'ran regime! Ahlbi: (Misattributed to Datz Are'bal in the original release) Huh? But this is my dog, Shah'do... Datz: Defiant Dragon secret weapon: Dragon Snot Snaps! ACHOOOO! *BANG* Ahlbi: WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOA! Oof! Datz: Har har har har har! Aw man, the look on your face! That was classic! Ahlbi: The sudden bang of the firecracker spooked Shah'do, and he ran off into the crowds. Shah'do: Ruff ruff ruff ruff! Ahlbi: Ahhhhhh! Shah'do, come back here! Datz: Har har har har har! That'll teach ya, Ga'ran's lapdog! Policeman: You there! What do you think you're doing?! Datz: ...Ack! Not good! Ahlbi: That's when a policeman came running over and hauled Datz away. That happened right around 2 PM, if I remember correctly. Phoenix: (...I'm not even going to pretend I know what Datz was trying to do.) Ahlbi: I chased right after Shah'do, and... ...when I finally caught up to him here in the palace courtyard, he had this in his mouth. Edgeworth: 2 PM, hmm? That's about an hour before the minister's death. Phoenix: Nayna supposedly went missing after the murder... ...but this would place her here at the palace at around two. (Changed from [...but this would place her here at the palace at around 2.] in the original release) Ahlbi: Actually! I just remembered I saw something pretty amazing around that time, too! Phoenix: Something amazing? Something amazing (appears after \"The frilly hat\") Phoenix: So, Ahlbi, what was it you saw that was so amazing? Ahlbi: I saw Her Eminence Queen Ga'ran channeling a spirit! Phoenix: Is it really that big of a deal to see her channeling someone? Ahlbi: You bet it is! Commoners are never allowed to behold the sacred rite. Phoenix: Oh? Can you tell me more? Ahlbi: Of course! I'm always happy to explain! Um... I believe it was around 2:10 PM today. I got lost on the palace grounds while looking for Shah'do. Ahlbi: Ooh... What is this place? It gives me the creeps. Where could Shah'do have gone? Ahlbi: In my search, I took a peek into a small room and... ...that's when I saw Queen Ga'ran! She was channeling a spirit for a neighboring kingdom's king! I saw her transform right before my eyes! I was so excited, I had to take a picture of it! Phoenix: You... You took a picture? Ahlbi: I know I shouldn't have... ...but I just couldn't help myself! Phoenix: (Between this and the treasure room, Ahlbi's not exactly the picture of self-restraint...) Ahlbi: Her channeling rite ended right after that, so I ran off before anyone could spot me. Phoenix: You could've been arrested again, you know. Ahlbi: ...Yeah, I know... ........................ Anyway, here's a copy of the picture. Just don't tell anyone I was the one who took it. Phoenix: (...I worry about his future sometimes.) Channeling Photo added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Come to think of it... ...how did you and Shah'do get into the royal residence anyway? It's not open to commoners, after all. Ahlbi: Allow me to explain! Something amazing (subsequent times) Phoenix: So, Ahlbi, what was it you saw that was so amazing? Ahlbi: I saw Her Eminence Queen Ga'ran channeling a spirit! Phoenix: Is it really that big of a deal to see her channeling someone? Ahlbi: You bet it is! Commoners are never allowed to behold the sacred rite. Phoenix: Oh? Can you tell me more? Ahlbi: Of course! I'm always happy to explain! Um... I believe it was around 2:10 PM today. I got lost on the palace grounds while looking for Shah'do. Ahlbi: Ooh... What is this place? It gives me the creeps. Where could Shah'do have gone? Ahlbi: In my search, I took a peek into a small room and... ...that's when I saw Queen Ga'ran! She was channeling a spirit for a neighboring kingdom's king! I saw her transform right before my eyes! I was so excited, I had to take a picture of it! Phoenix: You... You took a picture? Ahlbi: I know I shouldn't have... ...but I just couldn't help myself! Phoenix: (Between this and the treasure room, Ahlbi's not exactly the picture of self-restraint...) Ahlbi: Her channeling rite ended right after that, so I ran off before anyone could spot me. Phoenix: You could've been arrested again, you know. Ahlbi: ...Yeah, I know... ........................ Anyway, here's a copy of the picture. Just don't tell anyone I was the one who took it. Phoenix: (...I worry about his future sometimes.) Come to think of it... ...how did you and Shah'do get into the royal residence anyway? It's not open to commoners, after all. Ahlbi: Allow me to explain! Ahlbi in the courtyard (appears after \"Something amazing\") Ahlbi: There's a way to get into the palace from the bazaar. It's a bit of a tight squeeze, though. Shah'do can easily fit, but anyone bigger than me is out of luck. Phoenix: You don't say... Ahlbi: Yeah, part of the palace wall is damaged, and there's a hole I can just make it through. Phoenix: Go on. Ahlbi: Heh heh heh. Betcha didn't know they have some really tasty food here! Phoenix: Oh? Then this isn't your first time in here, huh. ...Trespassing is illegal, you know. Ahlbi: N-No, it's not like that! I didn't mean any harm. It's just... I want to help change this kingdom. Phoenix: What do you mean? Ahlbi: Well, after Ms. Fey's trial, I started thinking. Like maybe... Maybe there was something I could do to help the revolution, too. Phoenix: (...Maya's trial, huh. That tragedy only happened because of how twisted Khura'in's legal system has become.) Nahyuta: How utterly foolish to cast away one's life for such a reason! There must have been other ways to cover up the crime! Tahrust: Yet, had I done so, my wife would rush to my defense. And when the case went to trial... ...she would suffer the same fate as I under the Defense Culpability Act. I could not have lived with myself had she been convicted because of that fiendish man! Rayfa: Th-This... This cannot be... All I have done under the laws of our kingdom... It has all been... Phoenix: (The DC Act led to the false charges against Maya and the high priest's suicide. But that trial also caused the public to start questioning the current state of things. And it seems even Ahlbi has some pretty strong feelings on the matter.) Ahlbi: I knew there had to be something I could do to help! That's when I remembered the hole in the palace wall, and started thinking... ...maybe I could sneak in and take a picture of one of the royals up to no good. I just want to do my part! Edgeworth: The spirit of revolution seems to be catching on, even with one so young. Wright, the momentum is steadily building, and the tipping point is fast approaching. It's just a matter of when. Phoenix: I agree. And the public's perception of the Defiant Dragons seems to be changing, too. But Ahlbi... You can't go trespassing like that. Even if it's for a good cause, it's not right. Ahlbi: Okay. I won't do it again. Phoenix: Ahlbi, is that really all you have to confess? You haven't been up to any other mischief? And when I say \"you,\" I mean Shah'do. Ahlbi: Huh?! Oh, um... I-I... I don't know what you're talking about. Aheh... heh heh heh... Phoenix: (Nice try, Ahlbi, but the proof is literally right in front of us.) Present Attorney's Badge Ahlbi: Oh, that's an attorney's badge from your homeland, right?! I've studied all about it. Allow me to explain! There's a reason why the badge is shaped like a sunflower. You know how sunflowers always turn to face the sun -- the source of their well-being? Well, lawyers are like that -- they will chase after anything that will make them money! Phoenix: Whaaat?! Ahlbi: ...I guess people hate lawyers in your country, too, huh. Phoenix: Umm... Where did you get your information from again? Ahlbi: A proud sermon Chief Prosecutor Payne gave in the middle of the bazaar the other day. Phoenix: Nngh... Lawyers already have a bad enough time here without his lies. Channeling Photo Ahlbi: I know I shouldn't have taken that picture... But it was the first time I'd ever seen a spirit medium at work! I couldn't help myself. Phoenix: (At least he knows what he did was wrong.) Ahlbi: .........100-- no, 400 dahmas per copy sounds about right. Phoenix: Ahlbi... You're not planning to sell this photo to tourists, are you? Ahlbi: ...! Ah-ha ha ha! Come on, Mr. Wright, You don't really think I'd do that, do you? Phoenix: (Now I REALLY fear for his future.) Anything else Phoenix: What do you know about this, Ahlbi? Ahlbi: .........S-Sorry. I don't know anything about that. I'm the worst tour guide ever. Phoenix: N-No, no, it's my fault for randomly whipping it out and asking you about it. Ahlbi: Don't worry. I'll study hard, so I'll be ready to answer all your questions next time! Phoenix: (Argh, now I feel like a jerk.) Phoenix: Ahlbi, you wouldn't happen to know how this urn got knocked over, would you? Ahlbi: Ah! Phoenix: Because Her Benevolence told me something rather interesting. Rayfa: Be careful. Some dingbat dog got in the courtyard and spilled water over there. Phoenix: A dingbat dog? Rayfa: That's right. The yappy mutt spilled a whole urn's worth. Phoenix: The \"dingbat dog\" she mentioned wouldn't happen to be Shah'do, would it? Ahlbi: ...Ooh...! ......... I guess the dog's out of the bag. Sorry I lied. But I was worried I'd get in trouble. I know I shouldn't lie to a lawyer like that. Phoenix: No, it's not good to lie to anyone like that. So let's try to only tell the truth. Okay, Ahlbi? Ahlbi: Oh, Mr. Wright! I almost forgot. I saw a couple of Americans a moment ago. They had really weird haircuts, so I thought they might be friends of yours. Phoenix: ...R-Really, now... Um... Edgeworth: It seems your little friend thinks all us Americans have strange hairstyles. I suppose we have you to thank for that, Wright? Phoenix: ......... So, what exactly did their hair look like? Ahlbi: There was a guy with two crops of hair sticking out of his forehead like antennae. Then there was this lady with a long bunch of hair that looked like a big, orange spider leg. Phoenix: Oh, that sounds like Apollo and Athena. What were they doing? Ahlbi: They were racing through the bazaar... ... with the Ga'ran Royal Guard in hot pursuit! Phoenix: Wait, whaaaaaat?! Edgeworth: Why were they being pursued...? Phoenix: I'm not sure, but I have my suspicions. I just hope they're all right. Ahlbi: S-Sorry for not mentioning it before. It just kind of slipped my mind, heh heh... To be continued May 18Khura'in - Bazaar Apollo: *huff, puff, huff, puff* Those... Those guys... sure are... persistent! Athena: *huff, puff, huff, puff* Yeah. They even wore ME out, and that doesn't happen often. Apollo: Why are they after us, anyway?! Athena: Ah, Apollo! It's the royal guards again! Apollo: Argh! Q-Quick, hide! Royal Guard: Hey! Where'd Horn Head and Spidey Hair gooooooo?!! Athena: ...Spidey Hair? They're not talking about me, are they? Apollo: I-Is that a trick question...? Royal Guard: We know you're hiding somewhere around heeeeeeeeeeere!!! RAWWWRRR! Athena: A-Apollo, that weird-looking bird over there... Did it just...?! Apollo: ...Yeah, it did. It's called a warbaa'd and... You know what? I'll tell you all about it later when we're not being chased by masked men! Royal Guard: Come out, come out, wherever you aaaaare!!! ...Hand over the Founder's Orb, if you know what's good for yooooouuuuuu!!! Apollo: (It figures they're after the orb.) Athena: I don't want to know what they'll do to us if we were captured. If they grill us in those obnoxious, loud voices... ...I'd cave after the first hour and confess to whatever they wanted, truth or no! Royal Guard: Come out now, you foreign deeeeevils!!! This has gone faaaaaar enough!!! You must not keep Her Eminence waiting any looooooonger!!! RAWWWRRR! Apollo: W-We've gotta get out of here! There must be a safe place to hide somewhere! Examine Manhole cover Leads to: \"Look, a manhole.\" Any other point of interest Apollo: Maybe we could hide here. Athena: No way! They'd find us in no time! Royal Guard: Stay where you aaaare!!! Athena: Th-They're closing in on us! Apollo: We've gotta find a place to hide! Talk Any ideas? Athena: Apollo! We shouldn't be standing around talking like this! Who knows what they'll do to us if they catch us! Apollo: You're right. Let's find somewhere safe to hide! Present Anything Athena: Apollo! Do you really HAVE to show that to me right this second?! Apollo: S-Sorry. It's just... something I do now when I'm stuck... Anyway, your shouting isn't helping, either. Royal Guard: That voice! It's Spidey Hair!!! Athena: Eeeeek! ...Hiii-yaaaaaa!!! Royal Guard: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!! Apollo: (Sh-She sent him flying!) Athena: L-Let's find somewhere else to hide before the other guards get here! Apollo: Look, a manhole. ...Ahhh! That's right! Dhurke: Say, son, do you remember my office? Apollo: ...Sure. (I remember that messy, dimly lit room.) Dhurke: The file I've amassed on Amara's assassination is kept there. I think it might help you on this case. Do you remember how to get there? Apollo: Athena! I know where we can hide! Follow me! Athena: Oh?! Where are we going?! Apollo: Hrrrrrrrnngh! Athena: W-Wait. You're not seriously thinking about going down there? It smells like rotten eggs. And are those rats I hear?! Apollo: We've got no choice! I can get us somewhere safe, but this is the only way in. Quick, before it's too late! Athena: Ugh. It's going to take forever to get this stench out of my hair. May 18Former Sahdmadhi Law Offices Apollo: .........Looks like we lost them. That was close. .................. (Dhurke's office... How long has it been since I last set foot in here?) At least we're safe now, but... (Why is Athena all huddled over in the corner like that?) Datz: Ah! Apollo: Datz? Datz: AJ! What the heck are ya doing here? Apollo: Ga'ran's royal guards are after us. Datz: Har har har! Once a rebel, always a rebel. Don't worry. The regime doesn't know about this place, so ya can relax now. Apollo: Good. But since when am I part of the rebellion? I don't recall signing up. ???: Apollo! Apollo: Mr. Wright? What are you doing here? Phoenix: We saw you two go into that manhole. Edgeworth: You narrowly escaped the guards' notice. Phoenix: It was like watching a pair of ostriches burying their heads in the sand. Apollo: (I guess that was a closer shave than I had thought...) Phoenix: Anyway, you're safe and sound now, and that's what really counts. Oh, I also have some evidence for you. Apollo: Thanks, Mr. Wright. Case evidence received from the boss. Edgeworth: So, what is this dubious hovel we've found ourselves in, anyway? Apollo: It's the Defiant Dragons' safe house... also known as the former Sahdmadhi Law Offices. Edgeworth: I see... Well. Though it might just be happenstance... ...here I am -- a chief prosecutor -- hiding out in a rebel base. Apollo: Um, please don't report this place to the local police, Prosecutor Edgeworth... (Might as well take a look around while we're waiting for the heat to die down out there.) Come on, Athena. Stop moping over there and help me check this place out. Athena: *shudder* Please tell me there's a shower here. Apollo: There's a sink in the kitchen. And if you're lucky, maybe even some soap. Athena: .........I'm sorry I even asked. Examine Picture of Ga'ran Apollo: There's a scary-looking knife sticking out of the queen's picture. If anyone saw this, they'd think the Defiant Dragons were a violent group. Datz: Oh, that? That was actually me trying to kill a fly. I threw that knife at it and whiffed, and the thing ended up stuck right between her eyes. Apollo: You mean this wasn't on purpose?! White flowers Apollo: Datz, what's with the altar? Datz: It's where we pay our respects to the victims of the Defense Culpability Act. The DC Act is a heinous law that puts innocent people to death! Apollo: (A law that's supposed to protect the people sends them to their graves instead... Talk about insane.) Ladder Athena: Wait... Don't tell me we have to go back through the manhole to get out of here... Apollo: The only reason this safe house is still safe is because the front door's been boarded up. Athena: Fine, then I'll just have to live here till the revolution begins! Apollo: ...What if I told you rats come out at night? Athena; Then we'll just have to start the revolution before sundown! Apollo: (I bet the revolution never thought it'd get a new ally this way.) Photos Athena: Hm? Who's the kid... Wait a second! That's YOU, Apollo! I'd recognize those horns anywhere! Apollo: Is that really the only way ANYBODY recognizes me?! Athena: Hee hee hee. You were so cute! ...And who's THAT fine-looking young man? Apollo: That's Nahyuta, back when he used to smile. Athena: ...Wow. His smile is absolutely angelic. Datz: Sure brings back memories! That was taken the day we all went out fishing. Athena: What was Prosecutor Sahdmadhi like when he was younger? Datz: He was kinda quiet, but passionate when it came to his convictions. When he finally made prosecutor, he was all fired up to change Khura'in for the better. But now he's nothing more than Ga'ran's lackey! Apollo: (Seems like Datz has a lot to say about Nahyuta. I'll ask him about his thoughts later. Photos (subsequent times) Apollo: These pictures sure bring back memories. Nahyuta is cheerfully smiling in this one. That quiet smile he gives in court now seems almost fake by comparison. Lizards Athena: Eeewww... Is that a newt? Apollo: Come on, Athena. Can't you tell a gecko when you see one? Athena: What's the difference? Apollo: Geckos like to live in houses, while newts prefer to be outside near water. They're totally different creatures. Athena: Well, how do you know this one wasn't caught outside near some water? It could very well be a gecko. Apollo: No, I'm pretty sure it's a newt. Athena: Oh, so then you agree it's a newt, Apollo? Apollo: Ack! (I fell right into her trap!) Phoenix: You're both wrong. It's just a plain old lizard. TV Apollo: I'm surprised to see so many appliances here. There's even a TV. Datz: Speaking of which, we gave the people of Khura'in quite a shock... ...when \"The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm\" was last on TV. Apollo: You mean that show where actors play the parts of Dhurke and Rayfa? You hijacked that in the middle of its broadcast, right? Datz: Yep. All their writers do each week is try to ruin the Defiant Dragons' good name. So we decided to hit 'em where it hurts! Har har har har har har! Apollo: That must've been real shocking, especially for the kids who'd waited all week to see it. I mean, the show's main villain was actually hijacking the very show he's in! Coat Athena: Dhurke's jacket... You should try it on, Apollo. It might actually suit you. Apollo: R-Really? Datz: There's also a spare eye patch here. Why not try that on, too? Athena: ...Pffft. ...*snicker* Hee hee hee! S-Sorry, sorry. Just picturing you in all that... Ha ha ha ha! It's just too funny! Apollo: (Oww... My pride...) Sign Apollo: Sahdmadhi Law Offices... That's the sign Dhurke used to display out front. Hey, Datz. I heard the office used [sic]do quite a bit of business. Datz: That it did. Dhurke was a famous lawyer with countless courtroom victories, after all. He was the Dauntless Dragon who turned trials upside down... ...snatching victory from the jaws of defeat! His fame as a lawyer spread far and wide across Khura'in back in the day. Apollo: ...I hope the day comes when he can proudly display this sign again. Spider Apollo: What's with all the spider webs, Datz? Don't you ever clean the place? Datz: Not the webs! We have what ya call a symbiotic relationship. They catch the bugs that get in here, and I don't clean 'em up! Apollo: You know... that actually makes a lot of sense. Law book Apollo: This is Dhurke's old law book. Athena: Look, there's a mark on the cover. It looks like it was branded with a hot iron. Apollo: Yeah, I think it was done in protest against the Defense Culpability Act. There's an entry on the DC Act right here. See? Athena: Oh, so this is the infamous anti-lawyer law you guys are always talking about... Dhurke's Law Book added to the Court Record. Law book (subsequent times) Apollo: This is Dhurke's old law book. Athena: Look, there's a mark on the cover. It looks like it was branded with a hot iron. Apollo: Yeah, I think it was done in protest against the Defense Culpability Act. There's an entry on the DC Act right here. See? Athena: Oh, so this is the infamous anti-lawyer law you guys are always talking about... File Athena: I wonder what's in this file. Oh, it's full of newspaper clippings. Apollo: It seems to be a collection of documents and information on Amara's assassination. (So this is what Dhurke was talking about.) Athena: We already know most of the stuff here on top. Let's see what else there is. Wow, where did he get all this? Umm... Anything important here...? Hmm, what about this... \"Apollo's roving musician father got caught up in this incident and lost his life.\" ...Whaaat?! Th-This is about your father, Apollo! Apollo: Looks like it. But I was never told much more than what's written here. Athena: Really? How come? Apollo: Dhurke always skated around the subject. Maybe he thought I was still too young. Plus, I always thought of Dhurke as my dad, so I never really brought it up. Athena: ...Oh, I see. Still... I feel kind of sorry for your real dad. Apollo: (My real dad... I was never really interested in learning about him. But after seeing his picture, I can't help but feel a little curious. I wonder if Datz could tell me anything about him.) Amara's Assassination File added to the Court Record. Athena: ...Apollo, this file looks like it might be useful. But there are so many pages, I can't tell what's important. Apollo: We need someone to help organize all of this. (And I think I know just the person to ask.) File (subsequent times) Apollo: This file has a ton of information on Amara's assassination. We should go over the important parts later. Talk Sahdmadhi Law Offices Apollo: So, Datz, you guys are still using this office, I see. Datz: Yep. 'Cept now it's the official HQ of the Defiant Dragons. But as Dhurke said, and I quote... \"We must keep it for the day when Khura'in needs lawyers once more.\" Phoenix: Restoring the legal system to its rightful form through popular uprising... You can tell how much Dhurke believes in his cause. Datz: Oh, and AJ. Dhurke said something else that might interest ya. He said he hopes you'll come back and take over this office someday. Apollo: T-Take over?! Me? Datz: Those were his words. He may've been half joking though. Datz: Dhurke! Guess what I heard from PW! AJ's become a lawyer! Dhurke: ...Yeah, I've been meaning to tell you. Datz: Must've been because of you, Dhurke! Dhurke: I'm not so sure about that. I imagine he's already forgotten about me. Datz: Whaddaya talking about? I bet he can't wait to follow in your footsteps. Dhurke: Hah, ha ha ha. Nothing would make me happier. Maybe one day he'll return to Khura'in and take over this office. ...Heh. It's just a pipe dream, though. Apollo: .........Dhurke really said that? Datz: Dhurke was never a hands-on kinda dad... ...but not a day went by that he wasn't thinking of ya. That much I'm sure of. Athena: Doesn't get more paternal than that. Apollo: (Dhurke... And to think, I really did spend my days trying to forget you. I'm looking forward to a nice, long talk once you're free.) Nahyuta (appears after examining photos) Apollo: Datz, wasn't Nahyuta once part of the Defiant Dragons? Datz: Yep. Yuty was a rising star in the resistance! He vowed to fight for the cause through the legal system. Said he'd become a prosecutor, and give Inga and Ga'ran the smackdown they deserved! Apollo: But now he's... Datz: Yeah... a puppet of the Ga'ran regime. Not only that, but now he's gonna prosecute his own dad. It doesn't add up! Athena: I wonder what happened to him. Datz: Me, too. But if I had to guess... ...I'd say Ga'ran has some serious leverage over him. Apollo: Leverage? Like what? Datz: Wish I knew. But it seems like Dhurke knows. I tried to press him about it, but he wouldn't say. Apollo: (Come to think of it, Dhurke did say...) Apollo: Nahyuta... is suffering...? Dhurke: Yes. He knows the rightful state of Khura'in's legal system... ...but something forces him to bend to Ga'ran's will, and it's tearing him apart. Apollo: (If that's the case... ...I bet Nahyuta doesn't really want to go through with Dhurke's prosecution.) My father (appears after presenting Photo of My Father) Apollo: Do you know what my biological father was like? Datz: Dhurke once told me about him. He was a modern minstrel, walking the world and making music in his travels. Athena: This file also has some information on your real dad. It says he died in the blaze at Queen Amara's residence twenty-three years ago. Datz: That's right. Dhurke had invited him over. Dhurke's the kinda guy who can become fast friends with just about anyone. And it seems your pops was like that, too, AJ. They hit it off at a bar... ...and the next thing ya know, Dhurke's asked him over to play some tunes. Apollo: And then the place went up in flames... Datz: Yeah. Dhurke had just stepped out for a sec when the fire broke out. .........Apollo. You were there, too, but you were still just a baby. Apollo: ...I remember hearing about that when I was little. Datz: Yeah, it was a crying shame. Your pops just happened to take you along that day. So you were there with him when the fire broke out. But Dhurke risked his life to save you! Apollo: (It's like Dhurke's done nothing but save me all my life...) Datz: All your pops's stuff got burned up. Including anything that could've helped us identify him. All we knew about him at first was his stage name, \"Jangly Justice\" or something like that. Dhurke did everything he could just to dig up what little we know now. Apollo: ...Um, what about my mother? Do you know anything about her? Datz: All we know is she was traveling with your pops. But that day, she was off doing something on her own. Apollo: So then, she probably didn't even know my father had been with Dhurke, huh. Athena: But she must've been desperate to find you and your father once you'd gone missing. Datz: No doubt. But the queen's assassination threw the kingdom into chaos. The police were so overwhelmed, they were probably hardly of any help to her. We searched and searched till our legs gave out, too, but we never found her. And with your father's stuff all burned up, we had zero leads -- not even a photo. Apollo: So that's how I became an orphan... Datz: Yeah... Who knows? Maybe your mom read about the details of the fire in the newspaper. And maybe she figured you'd died along with your pops. Athena: Wow, I had no idea you'd been through all that, Apollo. Present Photo of My Father Apollo: Datz, I wanted to ask you about this picture. Datz: That's the picture of your pops that Dhurke found. And he had a heck of a time tracking it down. He said he searched all over for it! Apollo: Why...? Why would he go through all that trouble? Athena: Datz, please tell us everything you know about Apollo's dad! Dhurke's Law Book Datz: The Mark of the Dragon... That's the symbol of our group, the Defiant Dragons. Apollo: Dhurke has the same mark tattooed on the palm of his hand, right? Datz: Yep. And I've got one, too. Apollo: Really? Where? Datz: On my heart! Apollo: ...Oh, you mean metaphorically. Like you're ready to die at any time for the cause or something like that? Datz: You got that right. Dead or alive, I'll always be a Defiant Dragon! Amara's Assassination File Apollo: Datz, about this file... Can you help me figure out whihc pages are the most relevant? Datz: Yup, sure can. I got the whole thing memorized. See this page? It's definitely worth a look. Athena: Oh, that's right! Prosecutor Sahdmadhi was part of the royal family, wasn't he! Datz: Yep. But he was expelled after that whole thing with Dhurke happened. He must've gone through hell once he entered the legal world though. Apollo: Because of the whole \"the sins of the father are visited upon his children\" thing? Datz: Yep. In the eyes of the people, Dhurke is not only a traitor to his kingdom... ...he's also the terrorist who assassinated the previous queen. So, as his son, Yuty no doubt got the cold shoulder at every turn. Apollo: That must've been really hard on him. Datz: Yeah, the ties between father and son aren't something you could break, even if you tried. No matter where he went, he was probably labeled the son of a criminal. But despite it all, he made a name for himself through blood, sweat, and tears. I mean, just look at him now. He's a star prosecutor working cases around the globe. He's become a hero! The pride and joy of Khura'in! Apollo: (Now that's the Nahyuta I know -- super smart and never willing to give in. He must've studied and fought like his life depended on it to get to where he is today.) Amaras Assassination File updated in the Court Record. Anything else Datz: Ahhhhhh! Apollo: What? Do you know something about this? Datz: Nope. Just felt like shouting is all. Apollo: (He had me going there for a sec...) After clearing all Talk options, examining law book, and presenting Amara's Assassination File: Old Man: So then you believe me? You believe in my son's innocence?! Beh'leeb: Your poor son -- imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit... Let's petition the government for his release and a declaration of innocence! Old Man: Oh, thank you, thank you! I'm forever in your debt! Apollo: Hm? Who's that? Datz: Hey there, Mrs. Inmee. Hard at work, I see. Beh'leeb: Yes, I have my own battle that I must wage. After all, there are many who suffer under the Defense Culpability Act. Rebel: Mrs. Inmee! Please don't forget about our case, too! Beh'leeb: I won't! I will look into it as soon as I am able. Phoenix: Um, Datz? What's Mrs. Inmee doing here? Datz: She's lending an ear to all those suffering under the regime's wrongful accusations. A lady whose husband's been imprisoned, parents whose son's been falsely charged... She's helping all those types of people. Phoenix: So she's trying to help the revolution along... ...in her own special way. Datz: Yep. And thanks to her, more and more folks are coming over to our side! All the people who've been unhappy with the regime have been waiting for just this chance! And they're starting to speak out in support of us! Apollo: (The people are responding... and a grassroots movement is growing... Dhurke's dream of revolution may finally come true.) Athena: What should we do about the Founder's Orb? We'll probably run into the royal guards again the moment we leave this place. Phoenix: Well, we can't stay here forever, so we'll have to think of something. Apollo: ...I've got it. Why don't you hold on to it, Datz? It should be safe here, right? Datz: You can count on me! I'll get it back to you in time for tomorrow's trial at the Hall of Justice. Founder's Orb left with Datz. Athena: What now, Apollo? Apollo: Well, we've got a handle on what happened twenty-three years ago. Maybe we should pay Dhurke a visit. There's something I want to show him. Phoenix: I'll join you. I want to talk to him before tomorrow's trial. Edgeworth: Maybe I should wait here, then. We'll attract undue attention if we go in too large of a group. Bazaar Examine Yak Apollo: It's a yak. They used to serve as a beast of burden here. Athena: They're actually kind of cute up-close. Hello there, big fella! Or are you a girl...? Apollo: Umm, if you stick your face that close to it, it's liable to-- *sluuuuurp* Athena: Eeewwww, gross! .................. Apollo: ...Need some tissues? Athena: I-I could use a handful of wet naps, if you've got 'em... Bird Athena: What's this bird doing here? Apollo: I wouldn't get too close to it if I were you. ???: RAWWWWWWRRRRRR! Athena: Eeeeeeeeek! Apollo: ...Athena, meet the warbaa'd. Its cry resembles a lion's roar to scare off predators. Athena: Wow... that's one gutsy little bird. But I bet it's not really all that tough. Apollo: How about we just leave the bird alone? Cart Apollo: (So many street stalls... And they all have stuff you can't find back home.) Athena: We should spend some time shopping here when this case is over. I'd like to buy Trucy a souvenir or something. Poster Apollo: There's a poster here... \"The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm\"...? Phoenix: It's a special-effects-driven action-here show that's become a huge hit here in Khura'in. Apollo: (Maybe it's a cultural thing, but she totally looks like a villain to me.) Steaming buns Phoenix: Khura'in's national delicacy, magatah'man -- or \"soul buns,\" if that makes it easier. Apparently, they're so delicious, they'll send your soul straight to the Twilight Realm. Apollo: \"Delicious\"? More like \"deadly.\" Phoenix: Actually, in one of the commercials, an old man literally drops dead after taking a bite. And at the very end, there's a warning that goes, \"Enjoy at your own risk.\" Apollo: Like I said: deadly. Manhole cover Apollo: (This is the manhole that leads to Dhurke's office-turned-safe house. It's the only way in or out. And for obvious reasons, there's no doorbell or welcome mat.) Souvenir stands Apollo: (The souvenir stands sure are popular with the tourists. I should check them out later.) Tehm'pul Temple Apollo: Tehm'pul Temple is just up ahead. When I was a kid, I used to race Nahyuta and my friends to the top. Present Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Athena: The victim was the Minister of Justice, the second most powerful person here in Khura'in. In Wright Anything Agency terms... ...I guess that would be you, Apollo. Apollo: Ha ha ha. Thanks, but... ...everyone knows it's Trucy. Athena: ...Yeah, you're probably right. On second thought, she might actually be number one. I mean, even Mr. Wright is no match for her. Apollo: .........Remind me not to forget to buy her a souvenir. Dhurke's Law Book Athena: I can't believe Dhurke's been fighting the good fight for over twenty years. Fighting for the truth and the repeal of the Defense Culpability Act... Apollo: Yeah. And being branded a traitor for it. That's got to be extremely hard on him. Athena: Whatever happens, we can't let them find him guilty! We have to help him achieve his life's dream! Anything else Athena: .........What? Are you just going to show that to me without a word? Apollo: (I guess she doesn't have anything to say about it.) Athena: W-Well?! Are you going to at least say SOMETHING?! Inga's Private Quarters Examine Phoenix: Edgeworth and I already searched this room. Apollo: Oh, okay. (I wonder if anything interesting turned up?) Hair dye bottle Athena: \"Je suis L'Belle! SAMPLE\"... Now THERE'S a brand I know well... Apollo: .........Yeah... Me, too. Athena: Let's see what it says on the back. \"The hair care sensation celebrities have been RAVING about! Guaranteed to make you WANT to proclaim, 'Je suis L'Belle!' to the world! This product is NOT FOR SALE. EVER. Even if you come to really like it, PEASANT.\" Apollo: I REALLY still don't get his sales strategy... Any other point of interest Phoenix: We already investigated that, Apollo. May 18Detention Center - Visitor's Room Dhurke: Hey there, son. Came to see your old man again? Apollo: Hi, Dhurke. Guess they're done questioning you? Dhurke: Yeah... You'd think Nahyuta might've cut his old man a little slack, but no. He really laid into me. Seems they're really keen on recovering the Founder's Orb. When I wouldn't tell them where it was, he confiscated what few possessions I had left. Apollo: (...Wait, Dhurke's not wearing his attorney's badge. They even took THAT from him? *sigh*) Talk Nahyuta Dhurke: He confiscated all my prized jailbreaking tools. Apollo: What did you expect? I mean, no prosecutor in their right mind would let a prisoner keep stuff like that. Athena: Did he take your attorney's badge, too? Dhurke: No. I thought it strange, but... ...just when it looked like he was going to take it from me, he changed his mind. Apollo: I wonder why. Dhurke: Indeed. I find it hard to understand anything he does these days. Your attorney's badge (appears after \"Nahyuta\") Apollo: Your Khura'inese attorney's badge... You've worn it all these years -- even though all the lawyers are gone. Dhurke: Yes, because the Dragon's Eye is the embodiment of my creed. Apollo: (To show the world that \"a dragon never yields,\" huh.) Apollo: Hey, Dhurke? Why do you still wear your badge? You're not a lawyer anymore, right? Dhurke: This badge is my heart and soul, son. I'll never stop trying to realize my dream -- not until my very last breath. Nahyuta: \"A dragon never yields,\" right?! Dhurke: Exactly. ...Nahyuta, Apollo, I vow to restore Khura'in's legal system to its rightful state one day. I want to pass on to you a world where you can live free from the fear of tyranny. Apollo: (He was always saying stuff like that to the two of us. Nahyuta... Is the reason why you didn't take Dhurke's badge... ...because you still remember those talks, too? I really hope that's what it is.) Dhurke: ...Son, would you keep my badge for me? Apollo: Are you sure?! I can't take something so important to you. Dhurke: That's exactly why I want you to hold on to it, Apollo. I'm placing my fate in your hands. Apollo: .........All right. I'll make sure it stays safe. Dhurke's Badge added to the Court Record. Your attorney's badge (subsequent times) Apollo: Your Khura'inese attorney's badge... You've worn it all these years -- even though all the lawyers are gone. Dhurke: Yes, because the Dragon's Eye is the embodiment of my creed. Apollo: (To show the world that \"a dragon never yields,\" huh.) Apollo: Hey, Dhurke? Why do you still wear your badge? You're not a lawyer anymore, right? Dhurke: This badge is my heart and soul, son. I'll never stop trying to realize my dream -- not until my very last breath. Nahyuta: \"A dragon never yields,\" right?! Dhurke: Exactly. ...Nahyuta, Apollo, I vow to restore Khura'in's legal system to its rightful state one day. I want to pass on to you a world where you can live free from the fear of tyranny. Apollo: (He was always saying stuff like that to the two of us. Nahyuta... Is the reason why you didn't take Dhurke's badge... ...because you still remember those talks, too? I really hope that's what it is.) Present Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Dhurke: Inga Karkhuul Khura'in... He was an entirely insufferable, unlikable fellow, but I never thought he'd wind up dead. Apollo: Why didn't you like him? Dhurke: He was the most hawkish one in the Ga'ran regime. He established the secret police to arrest us rebels without due process. Those they managed to capture were immediately executed. My compatriots in the Defiant Dragons came to call him \"The Executioner.\" Apollo: \"The Executioner\"? Pretty ironic, considering how he ended up. Dhurke: He's probably in Hell now, being tormented by those he wrongfully put to death. Pink Butterfly Pendant Apollo: I found this in the tomb. Look familiar? Dhurke: ...Ah! Th-That's... Apollo: Dhurke? Dhurke: Where did you find it? Apollo: Down between the monk statues in the tomb. Is it yours, Dhurke? Dhurke: .........Oh, um, it's... it's something I bought. Apollo: ? (Why's he suddenly acting all awkward?) Dhurke: Hmm... I wonder when I lost it. Let's have it. It's very important to me. Apollo: O-Of course... (I'll just make a note about it for future reference.) Pink Butterfly Pendant returned to Dhurke, but a record of it remains in the Court Record. Dhurke's Law Book Dhurke: Careful with that. Don't go showing it around town. You'll be branded a rebel. Apollo: But I'm not a rebel. Dhurke: Don't be ridiculous. You're a member of the Defiant Dragons simply by being my son. Or did you think that dragon tattoo on your rear end was just for show? Athena: Whaaat?! You have a tattoo on your butt, Apollo?! Let me see! Apollo: Relax, Athena. He's just jerking our chains again. Amara's Assassination File Dhurke: I prepared that myself. Use it well. Apollo: I'm surprised you were able to gather this much information. Dhurke: It wasn't easy. After all, all of the evidence from the assassination was lost in the fire. And the newly-installed Ga'ran regime was in full control of the media. Every lead I tried to follow led to a dead end. Apollo: So then how am I supposed to solve this case? Dhurke: ...You'll figure something out once tomorrow's trial is underway. After all, no one's looked into this assassination since my last trial. Apolo: (I hope I can turn things around enough to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.) Dhurke's Badge Dhurke: Ah, my attorney's badge. You don't see those around here anymore. Apollo: It's not exactly something you can wear publicly, is it? Dhurke: Yeah... And if you did, people would jeer and throw things at you. I've had tomatoes, cabbages -- even eggs thrown at me. Apollo: That sounds awful. But at least they didn't throw rocks. Dhurke: ...True. Plus, if you were good at catching things, you'd have the start of a good meal. Apollo: What?! Dhurke: It's true. An hour's walk can yield all you need for a nice, big hot pot! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (Dhurke... I'm sorry I never knew how bad things were when you were raising us.) Anything else Dhurke: Is that for me, son? Apollo: No, I was just wondering if you knew anything about it. Dhurke: What? You came to visit me and you didn't even bring a present? Apollo: (I'll take that as a \"no.\") After clearing \"Your attorney's badge\" Talk option and presenting Pink Butterfly Pendant: Phoenix: Apollo, remember how Inga said he had \"someone dear to Dhurke\"? Why don't you ask about that? Apollo: Oh, right. I'll give it a try. Talk Someone dear to Dhurke Apollo: What did the minister mean when he said... ...he had someone dear to you in the palm of his hand? Who was he talking about? Dhurke: Hm? Apollo: Nahyuta seemed to know, but he wouldn't tell me anything. Dhurke: W-Well, I've no idea, so... Phoenix: Well, you obediently followed his every word after he said that... ...so it seems to me the minister was in close proximity to someone you really care about. Dhurke: Oh, um... Apollo: Someone you really care about that isn't Nahyuta...? Wait, don't tell me--! Is there a new lady in your life, Dhurke?! Dhurke: Wh-What?! No! Don't be ridiculous, son! Apollo: .................. Dhurke: .................. The love of my life was Amara. But she's gone now and there will never be another. BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: (Ah! My bracelet! Wait, does this mean...? Dhurke... Have you REALLY not met somebody new?) Present Bracelet Dhurke: The love of my life was Amara. But she's gone now and there will never be another. Perceive twitching left forearm on \"But she's gone now\" Apollo: Apollo: ...Dhurke. You can't fool me. You tensed up when you said, \"But she's gone now.\" And you unconsciously moved your arm... ...causing something to press up against your jacket. Dhurke: Ahhhhh! ...H-How did you do that?! Apollo: ...Oh, so that's it! You're hiding a woman's photo up your sleeve. You don't have to keep secrets like that from me, Dhurke. You're an eligible bachelor now. But you'll... introduce her to me at some point, right? Dhurke: I keep telling you, there's no other woman! Apollo: Fine, then let's see it. What are you hiding up your sleeve? Dhurke: ...It's just this. Satisfied? Apollo: Huh? But that's the pendant we found in Amara's Tomb... Dhurke: See? I wasn't trying to hide anything. Apollo: (...Then why did he tense up?) Dhurke, let me take a look at that. Dhurke: Ah! Apollo: .........Hey, what's this button for? *click* Apollo: Whoa! I-It's...! Athena: It's a picture of Dhurke and some lady! And she's really young-looking, too! Mon Dieu! Are you into younger women, Dhurke?! Apollo: Heh heh. Dhurke, you old dog, you. You got yourself a younger lover. Dhurke: Will you stop with this nonsense! This is Amara before she died. If you look closer, you'll see that I was younger, too. Apollo: Hey, you're right. Athena: Aww. That's no fun. Apollo: ...Wait a second. Haven't we seen this woman before? Athena: .........Now that you mention it...! Apollo: Isn't this woman the same as the one in the pendant's photo? Present Woman's Photo Apollo: Leads to: \"The woman in the pendant is also the one in this photo.\" Present anything else Apollo: Athena: Apollo... I don't see how that has anything to do with the woman in the pendant's photo. Dhurke: Have you had your eyes checked lately, son? Apollo: (I'm wrong, not blind! Maybe I should compare the pendant's photo against the evidence again.) Dhurke, I know I've seen the woman in the pendant's photo before. Leads back to: Isn't this woman the same as the one in the pendant's photo? Apollo: The woman in the pendant is also the one in this photo. Dhurke: ! A-Apollo, where did you get this? Apollo: From the safe in Inga's room. Phoenix: ...Apollo. If this is Queen Amara, it had to have been taken at least twenty-three years ago. But that's just not possible. Dhurke: ! Apollo: Yeah, I just noticed the same thing. Here's why this photo couldn't be twenty-three years old! Present law book Apollo: Leads to: \"Take a look at the law book. It has the mark of the Defiant Dragons branded on it.\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Dhurke: I don't see how that proves anything. Apollo: Look closer. Doesn't that part look, you know, kinda modern? Athena: Hmm... I don't know about that. Maybe you just don't know what's considered new and hip these days, Apollo. Apollo: Nngh... Dhurke: This photo is at least twenty-three years old. I don't know how you could say otherwise. Apollo: That's where you're wrong, Dhurke. (There's something in this photo that couldn't have existed back then.) Leads back to: \"Here's why this photo couldn't be twenty-three years old!\" Apollo: Take a look at the law book. It has the mark of the Defiant Dragons branded on it. But that mark didn't exist until after you started your revolutionary activities, Dhurke. So, this photo must've been taken AFTER Ga'ran came into power. ...And that didn't happen until AFTER Amara was assassinated. Dhurke: Gnrk! Apollo: ...So then, how could Amara even be in this photo? ...............Wait a second. That would mean that Amara is... ...still alive? Dhurke: Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh! ............Looks like you found me out, son. Apollo: Wait... So it's actually true?! Leads back to Talk options Perceive wrong area Apollo: Apollo: You seem uneasy, Dhurke. Wait... Don't tell me you're ashamed because she's much younger than you?! Dhurke: D-Don't be ridiculous! I'm just getting tense because of your intrusive questions! Anyone would react the same way! Apollo: (Hmm, I guess that's not it... Still, my bracelet reacted... ...so I know he must be hiding something!) Leads back to Talk options Someone dear to Dhurke (after perceiving) Apollo: Dhurke! What do you mean, Amara's still alive?! I thought she'd been assassinated. Dhurke: .........So did I. But it seems she made it out alive, only to be held captive by the Ga'ran regime. Apollo: Why would they do that? Dhurke: When I fled from the law and went underground twenty-three years ago... ...I heard some shocking news from a Defiant Dragons spy. There were rumors of Queen Amara being sighted in the palace. Apollo: And those rumors turned out to be true? Dhurke: Yes. I snuck into the palace to see for myself. She was confined within the grounds, but otherwise, she was as fit as a fiddle. Phoenix: S-So then, the sarcophagus in the tomb... It's empty? Dhurke: Yes. That entire tomb is one big charade. Ga'ran had it built to stage Amara's death. Athena: So we're not going to be cursed by her vengeful spirit? That's a relief. Dhurke: She was being held under virtual house arrest. So I freed her, and we made a run for it. This photo was taken back then. Apollo: (Look at how they're both grinning from ear to ear.) .........Hm? (There's a fingerprint on the metal part. I guess Dhurke must've left it by accident.) Athena: Ooh, Mr. Sahdmadhi! I wanna hear ALL about how you ran away with Queen Amara! Pink Butterfly Pendant updated in the Court Record. On the run with Amara (appears after \"Someone dear to Dhurke\") Apollo: I'm surprised Amara agreed to run away with you. I mean, Ga'ran must've told her that you tried to kill her. Dhurke: I tried to convince her that I wasn't the one who set the blaze. Apollo: And she believed you? Dhurke: She said, and I quote, \"I shall accompany you so I may ascertain the truth myself.\" Heh, she always was a tough one to read. Athena: I bet she was thrilled you came to her rescue, Mr. Sahdmadhi. To be set free by your beloved... It's like something out of a fairy tale. Dhurke: Yeah, well... There was no \"happily ever after\" once Ga'ran's people caught up with us. They took Amara away to who-knows-where. I snuck back into the palace and searched high and low for her, but to no avail. They probably moved her to some remote mountain prison or the like. Apollo: Dhurke, does Nahyuta know about this? Dhurke: He knows she's his true mother. I told him as much. Apollo: Wait... Is that why Nahyuta is following Ga'ran's orders? Dhurke: .........Most likely. Athena: So then, do you think that deep down, he doesn't really want to prosecute you? Dhurke: Well, he's not one to show his feelings. And lately, I've had no idea what he's thinking. Phoenix: Apollo. We need to grill the queen about Amara when we have the chance. Athena: ...Um. I was wondering about something. The little baby the lady's holding... Is that Prosecutor Sahdmadhi? Apollo: Not necessarily. It could just as well be me. After all, we're only one year apart. Athena: I don't know. I mean, the kid in the picture is too cute to be you. Apollo: (...Let's settle this by asking Dhurke himself.) Something important (appears after \"On the run with Amara\", then presenting Woman's Photo) Apollo: So what's this \"something important\" you have to tell me? Dhurke: ........................ Listen son. Even if you manage to prove me innocent tomorrow... ............... ...I... I don't have long to live. Apollo: Huh? ............... Wh-What are you talking about? Dhurke: What I mean is, I can already hear the Twilight Realm calling my name. There is no escaping death now that it has its sights set on me. Apollo: What?! ............I-Is this another one of your jokes? Dhurke: I wish it was. Apollo: Ha... Ha ha ha. You can't fool me, Dhurke. (Hm? That's strange. Why isn't my bracelet reacting?) Dhurke: ............ Phoenix: ...Are you sick? Dhurke: I-It's something like that. Apollo: So you're not joking? Dhurke: .........I'm afraid not, son. Sorry. Apollo: I-Isn't there a cure? Or at least some sort of treatment? Dhurke: Unfortunately not. Not for what I've got. Apollo: If you need some kind of surgery, I'll work hard until I can pay for it! So... Please...! Dhurke: .........It's too late. There's nothing more to be done now. Apollo: B-But you always say, \"A dragon never yields.\" So why are you giving up now? Dhurke: ...Apollo, I'm sorry. I really am. Apollo: ............I don't understand. Why is this happening, Dhurke? Why? Dhurke: ..................Listen, Apollo. I've got a favor to ask of you. Would you keep quiet about this? I don't want my fellow Dragons to find out. They'd lose all hope if they knew I was dying. Would you do that for me? Apollo: ............Of course. (Why is this happening now? Just when I was finally starting to feel like you really are my... I thought that this time, we'd finally... But now...) ...Damn it... Why...? Athena: Apollo... Dhurke: Listen, son. I don't have much longer to live... ...but I'll never let them execute me. Not before I finish what I need to do. Apollo: ...I know, Dhurke. There's no way I'm going to let them prove you guilty. (Before he goes, I'm going to turn back time by righting the wrongs that have been done. I'm going to restore Dhurke's freedom... ...and return a real smile to Nahyuta's face! I'm going to win this case. I just have to!) Dhurke: ...Son. I have one more... big secret. Apollo: What? There's something else you've been hiding from me? Dhurke: I'm afraid I can't tell you what it is. I'd be betraying a certain someone if I did. Apollo: Huh? What's that supposed to mean? Dhurke: .........Forgive me. You'll just have to find out for yourself. That's the only way. Apollo: I don't understand, Dhurke. Dhurke: ..................... Apollo. In court tomorrow... ...you may find yourself faced with a truth that is difficult to accept. But I know you. And I know you can handle the truth, no matter what it turns out to be. I know that because I believe in you. You're my son, after all! Apollo: ...Dhurke. (What is he talking about? Wait... He's not going to reveal that he actually IS the killer, is he?) Phoenix: Looks like we've run out of things to discuss. Apollo? ...Are you okay? Apollo: ...I'm fine. ???: FREE HIM NOW...!!! RELEASE DHURKE...!!! Apollo: What's going on out there? Dhurke: Sounds like the party's getting started without me. Apollo: Huh? Athena: It's coming from the temple. Let's go, Apollo, and take a look! Something important (subsequent times) Apollo: So what's this \"something important\" you have to tell me? Dhurke: ........................ Listen son. Even if you manage to prove me innocent tomorrow... ............... ...I... I don't have long to live. Apollo: Huh? ............... Wh-What are you talking about? Dhurke: What I mean is, I can already hear the Twilight Realm calling my name. There is no escaping death now that it has its sights set on me.

Present Pink Butterfly Pendant or Woman's Photo (after clearing \"Someone dear to Dhurke\" Talk option) Dhurke: Amara... I hope she's doing well. Apollo: I've been wondering, Dhurke... How could a commoner win the heart of a queen anyway? Dhurke: ...Hm? Wait, don't tell me... Have you fallen for Princess Rayfa, son? Apollo: Wait, what?! Athena: ...Apollo. I had no idea you liked your women so young. Apollo: No! I don't! Phoenix: She's barely in her teens. That's just not right, Apollo. Apollo: Listen to me! I never said anything about her! Dhurke: Aww, it's all right son. In a few more years, the age difference won't matter so much. Apollo: Would you guys just stop already?! Woman's Photo (after clearing \"On the run with Amara\" Talk option) Apollo: Dhurke, about the cute little kid in this photo... Is that me? Dhurke: ...Huh? What are you talking about? Apollo: .................. Athena: See? I told you it was Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. Dhurke: Hm? .........Oh, I see. Well, either way, it's not you, son. Apollo: So then... ...if it's Nahyuta, it was taken when he was about a year old, right? And that would mean... ...you ran away with Amara around twenty-two or twenty-three years ago? (Changed from [...you ran away with Amara around 22 or 23 years ago?] in the original release) Dhurke: Hm? .........You're pretty good with numbers, son! Impressive. Apollo: Huh? (What kind of answer is that?) Woman's Photo updated in the Court Record. Dhurke: .........Before you go, son, there is something else I need to tell you. Something important. Apollo: What is it, Dhurke? I've never seen you act so serious before. After clearing \"Something important\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: May 18Tehm'pul Temple Apollo: Wh-Whoa! What IS all this?! Anime cutscene Datz: Ow-ow-oww! Let go, will ya?! Policeman: W-What are they-- Datz: Huh? Well, look at that! The people are coming to take their courts back! Policeman: Don't hold back, men! Arrest them all! Rebel: Dhurke belongs to the people! Give him back! Rebel: Yeaaaaah! Where are you holding him?! Policeman: Quiet down, you! Child: Th-They have my big sister, too! But she didn't do anything wrong! Policeman: Ouch! YOUCH! Stop pulling my hair! Old Man: Release my son! Release him now...!!! Policeman: Aaaagh! Stop that! No biting! Apollo: This... is really something. Phoenix: And it looks like Datz and Mrs. Inmee are leading the charge. ???: ...You unenlightened fools. Do you honestly think this will change anything? Datz: Yuty! ...Why do you keep serving that witch Ga'ran?! Apollo: Ah! (It's...) Hey, Nahyuta! Nahyuta: ! You again? Apollo: What's going on here? Nahyuta: It would appear that the insurgents are fanning the flames of the rebellion. ...But I never thought it would grow so large. However, they will all be under arrest shortly. Reinforcements are almost here. Apollo: They'll be arrested? Just for protesting? Nahyuta: They are aiding and abetting a criminal by seeking his release. Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran, has ordered they be arrested and judged en masse. Apollo: B-But weren't you once a member of the Defiant Dragons, too? How can you go along with this? Nahyuta: ...I am simply following the orders that Her Eminence has handed down. Apollo: No, it can't be as simple as that. Listen, Nahyuta. There's something I want to talk to you about. Hey! You're not getting away this time! We need to talk. Nahyuta: .........*sigh* I see there is no reasoning with you. Very well, then. Speak. Examine Protesters Athena: Look at all these people! They've got the whole temple surrounded. Phoenix: And it looks like Datz is fanning the flames. The police are going to really have their hands full with this many protesters. Apollo: This whole thing is like a powder keg waiting to go off. We should keep our distance for now. Talk Dhurke Apollo: Nahyuta, do you really have to serve as prosecutor on Dhurke's case? I mean, prosecuting your own flesh and blood... It's just not right. Nahyuta: Again with this drivel? Your ethical standards are not the be-all, end-all of the world around you. Apollo: (I'm not getting into another debate with him.) .........Nahyuta, did you know that Dhurke is sick? Nahyuta: What? Apollo: He apparently doesn't have that much longer to live. If found guilty, he probably wouldn't even make it until his execution day. Nahyuta: What are you talking about? Apollo: Knowing this, are you still prepared to send an already dying man to his grave? Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: Well? Nahyuta: ...I... Apollo: Enough with the zen monk act, Nahyuta. Tell me how you really feel. Nahyuta: .........Mr. Justice. Each person is born with a role to fulfill. And I... must fulfill mine. Apollo; Well, I'm not convinced that taking Dhurke to trial is a part of your lot in life. Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: As for why you've been at Ga'ran's every beck and call... ...I think I might have the answer. Amara (appears after \"Dhurke\") Leads to: \"Nahyuta. You know the truth about your mother, don't you?\" Present Dhurke's Law Book Nahyuta: That's... Apollo: The rebels' \"Mark of the Dragon.\" It symbolizes a person's opposition to the Defense Culpability Act. Nahyuta: You seek to argue with me about the legal system? ...If so, you're wasting your breath. Lawyers and prosecutors do not lay down the law; they merely follow it. The laws decreed by our sovereign are absolute. There is no room for debate. Apollo: So \"let it go, and move on,\" right? Why is that your only answer to everything? Apollo: Nahyuta. You know the truth about your mother, don't you? About how the former queen is still alive and being held somewhere. Nahyuta: So Dhurke told you, did he... Yes, it's true. My mother was spirited away to some remote corner of this kingdom... ...to keep her safe from harm. Apollo: Safe from harm? But Dhurke said the Ga'ran regime is holding her captive. Nahyuta: No, they are keeping her safe. Apollo: So you don't know where Amara is being held? Nahyuta: I only know that it is some secluded hideaway where visitors are not allowed. I have heard she leads a simple life, akin to that of monastic disciples. Apollo: (Sure sounds like she's being held captive to me.) Listen, Nahyuta... Aren't you really doing the queen's bidding... ...because she's holding Amara captive? Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: And this whole thing with Dhurke... You know he didn't really kill Inga, don't you? Nahyuta: .................. Apollo: Dhurke doesn't have much longer to live, so I want to help him however I can. This time, it's our turn... Apollo: *sniffle* *hiccup* *hiccup* Nahyuta: You... You could've been killed... But you risked your life... to save us... Why...? Dhurke: What a silly question. What father wouldn't risk his life to save his own children? Nahyuta, Apollo... Don't you ever hesitate to call when you need me. Understand? Apollo: It's our turn to help Dhurke however we can. Nahyuta: .................. .................. .........What you speak of... is futile. Apollo: ! Nahyuta: .........Let it go, and move on. The guilty verdict... The hopelessness... You must resign yourself to it all. Clinging to false hope now will only serve to magnify your future despair. So let it go... and move on... Apollo: ...Nahyuta. (Are you really going to just roll over on this?) Nahyuta: ...I've no more time for idle chatter. I must prepare for tomorrow's trial. Now, if you'll excuse me... Apollo: ......... Athena: Apollo. I sensed a whirlpool of emotions coming from within Prosecutor Sahdmadhi just now. Anger, shock, bewilderment... ...and an icy sorrow, as deep and dark as an abyss. Apollo: Yeah, I picked up on that, too. Looks like Dhurke really won't be the only one who will need my help tomorrow. Phoenix: ...I think it's about time to pay Queen Ga'ran another visit... ...and ask her about her sister Amara. Talk Any ideas? Athena: I didn't know Dhurke was sick. What's wrong with him? I mean, he looked fine to me. Apollo: ...I really don't know. The Dhurke I remember would go out hunting in the middle of winter... ...while everyone around him was dropping like flies with the flu and whatnot. Athena: ............... Apollo: .................. Phoenix: ........................ Apollo: .........Come on everyone, cheer up! The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles, right? Phoenix: ...Apollo, you don't have to put on a brave face for-- Apollo: No! I'm fine! Besides, Dhurke will have his day in court. I won't let this get me down. What to do Athena: So you don't know Queen Amara at all, Apollo? I thought that since you used to live with Dhurke, that maybe you had met her. Apollo: Dhurke escaped with Amara twenty-three or so years ago, so I was still just an infant. Even if I had met her, I wouldn't have remembered it. Athena: I guess not. But that means you may have been cared for by a queen. And if you had been, then... Apollo: Th-Then what? Athena: You would've turned out... I don't know... better? Apollo: Wh-What's that supposed to mean? May 18Ga'ran Palace - Audience Chamber Phoenix: Hm? The royal guard isn't around. ???: That is utter... utter... hooey! You cannot continue to deceive the people like that! ???: ...Rayfa. Justice is much more than simply speaking the truth. Apollo: Is that Princess Rayfa and Queen Ga'ran over there? Rayfa: Y-You deceived me, too, Mother! How can I ever believe a word you say again?! You... You... nincompoop! .........Ah. Phoenix: Your Benevolence... ...I, uh, couldn't help but overhear... Rayfa: Nnnnnnnnnnnngh... You impudent--!! *ka-tonk!* Phoenix: Oww!!! Apollo: Are you okay, Mr. Wright? I can't believe she actually punched you... Phoenix: ...Yeah, I'm used to it by now. Athena: What's the matter with the princess? Apollo: It sounded like she was arguing with her mother. Phoenix: .........Maybe it has something to do with this picture. Rayfa said she had to ask her mother about some secret or another as soon as she saw it. Apollo: So then... ...does that mean that Princess Rayfa knows what really happened? That Amara wasn't assassinated, and is still very much alive? Phoenix: It would seem so. And she doesn't seem to be taking Ga'ran's lies very well. But that's no surprise, considering how much Rayfa reveres her mother. Athena: That would definitely cause her a great deal of anguish and sadness. ???: Eavesdropping, are we? How very rude. Ga'ran: Hm? You there. Are you not Dhurke's son? Apollo: Oh, um, nice to meet you, Your Eminence. We're actually here to speak with you, if you could spare a moment. Examine Throne Apollo: ............ Phoenix: Apollo? What are you doing? This is the queen's audience chamber. You can't snoop around in here. Apollo: Oh, right. Sorry! (I wonder what it'd be like to sit there with Athena and Mr. Wright groveling at my feet... No! Stop! I can't let myself think about that sort of thing!) Talk Amara's alive? Apollo: Your Eminence, Dhurke told me about Amara. About how she's still alive, that is. Ga'ran: ...We know not of what you speak. Apollo: After Dhurke learned Amara was still alive, he rescued her, and they ran off together. But she was captured and remains captive in a secret location to this day. As for Nahyuta doing your bidding, it's only because Amara's life's in your hands. Ga'ran: Ho ho ho. What an active imagination you have. Royal Guard: Ha ha ha ha ha ha! A lawyer AND a comedian! How droll! Apollo: (Wh-Whoa. Where'd THEY come from? Anyway! If she's going to play dumb, I'll just have to jog her memory with some evidence!) Amara's alive? (subsequent times) Apollo: Your Eminence, Dhurke told me about Amara. About how she's still alive, that is. Ga'ran: ...We know not of what you speak. Apollo: After Dhurke learned Amara was still alive, he rescued her, and they ran off together. But she was captured and remains captive in a secret location to this day. As for Nahyuta doing your bidding, it's only because Amara's life's in your hands. Ga'ran: Ho ho ho. What an active imagination you have. Royal Guard: Ha ha ha ha ha ha! A lawyer AND a comedian! How droll! Apollo: (Argh! If she's going to play dumb, I'll just have to jog her memory with some evidence!) Amara's alive! (appears after \"Amara's alive?\", then presenting Woman's Photo) Apollo: So then, you admit that Amara's still alive? Ga'ran: .........Yes. She is under our protection in a safe location. Apollo: (I think you mean \"being held prisoner.\") ...And where is she being kept? Ga'ran: Ho ho ho. Now why would we tell the son of a traitor that? Apollo: (Guess she has a point there.) Ga'ran: Now, heed our warning, Horned Devil. It would not be wise to inform the people that Amara yet lives. It would only serve to plunge public order into chaos. Apollo: I have no intention of doing that. (Besides, there are real terrorists out there who might try to kill her.) Ga'ran: ...Good. Now, there was something we have been meaning to ask you. Do you know what has become of the Founder's Orb? The Founder's Orb (appears after \"Amara's alive!\") Leads to: \"The Founder's Orb went missing after Dhurke took it into the tomb.\" Present Attorney's Badge Ga'ran: What have we here? Apollo: It's the attorney's badge used by lawyers like me back home. Ga'ran: Well, in this country, lawyers are a loathsome breed. And we would advise you not to needlessly advertise your place among their ranks. For even now, the bad karma Dhurke has engendered brings woe to your kind. It is a simple matter of cause and effect. Apollo: (Yeah, an effect you caused by enacting the Defense Culpability Act.) Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Ga'ran: His own ill will was visited upon him. So it is within the cycle of karma. Others might call it divine retribution -- the punishment of the gods. Apollo: You don't seem particularly sad, even though it was your own husband. Ga'ran: We were betrayed by the man we had called husband. Moreover, we are the Grand Priestess, summoner of spirits from the Twilight Realm. For us, death is not the end, for we can still speak with those who have passed. Apollo: (I guess being a spirit-channeling queen gives you a different take on life and death.) Woman's Photo (after clearing \"Amara's alive?\" Talk option) Apollo: Your Eminence, I ask that you take a look at this photo. Ga'ran: Why, that's--! Apollo: It's a photo of Amara. And here you can see a law book bearing the mark of the Defiant Dragons. I believe you know what that means. Ga'ran: .................. ..........Very well. Royal guard, stand down. Royal Guard: Yes, Your Eminence! Your wish is our command! Ga'ran: It seems there is no need to perpetuate this charade any longer. We shall speak... of all we know. Dhurke's Law Book Ga'ran: To burn such a mark upon a sacred text of the law... He will surely be visited by what he has wrought. And to think he once called himself a man of the law. Apollo: I think it's just his way of objecting to the DC Act. Ga'ran: Yet that act is but an objection to his falsified evidence. How appalling that even now he recognizes no responsibility and knows no shame. Anything else Apollo: So, I was wondering if... Ga'ran: We have no intention of bestowing any information upon you or any other lawyer. Apollo: (Guess someone doesn't like to play nice with others.) Ga'ran: The Founder's Orb went missing after Dhurke took it into the tomb. As his son, we thought you might know something of its current whereabouts. Apollo: I knew it. I suppose I should thank you for that free running tour of Khura'in. Ga'ran: ...That was the royal guards' own doing. Apollo: (Nice try, lady. But now you're definitely not getting the orb, ever.) Why do you want the orb so badly, anyway? Ga'ran: Because... it would be most dangerous in the wrong hands. It must be recovered. Phoenix: Is the legend true? Can the orb really impart spiritual power? Are you worried that someone could overthrow you with it? Ga'ran: The Holy Mother's power is without equal. Should Her Holiness once again return to our world... ...she could conceivably bestow great power upon the one who unlocked the orb's secret. Phoenix: I guess it makes sense, considering spirit channeling is a fact of life here. Ga'ran: ...So we ask you, Horned Devil. Did you receive the Founder's Orb from Dhurke? Apollo: ...Does it look like I did? Ga'ran: ...So you like to play games, do you? ...Royal guard! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Eminence! Ga'ran: Search this devil, and his belongings! Apollo: What? Royal Guard: At once, Your Eminence! Don't move!!! You're only making this haaaaaarder on yourseeelf!!! Apollo: Yikes! Hey, cut it out! Argh! What the--?! Athena: Eeeeeek! Apollo! Don't strip here! Royal Guard: Stop resisting!!! Just submit to our strip search alreeeeeady!!! Apollo: N-No, wait! Hey! Cut it out! Aaaaaaaaaaaaagh! .................. (Rest in pieces, my poor, tattered dignity.) Royal Guard: There's no sign of the Founder's Orb, Your Eminence! Ga'ran: .........So, you have hidden it somewhere. Heh. No matter. We shall recover it one way or another once you are found guilty of abetting the accused. Apollo: (Dhurke was right. She really is bent on getting the orb.) ???: Mother! Apollo: Looks like the princess is back. Rayfa: I took a stroll to try to calm myself, but... I still find this situation unacceptable. The people must be informed about Queen Amara! Apollo: ! (So she DOES know about that!) Ga'ran: Rayfa, you do not yet possess a clear grasp of how a government and its people interact. There will always be secrets that must be kept from the ignorant masses. Rayfa: You have little faith in our people, Mother. But it is the Royal Priestess's duty to always speak the truth. And as such I cannot remain silent! I will not! Ga'ran: Hah. The truth, you say? Your mind has been poisoned by the Barbed One. Phoenix: It was an honor and a pleasure, Your Eminence. Ga'ran: ...We must speak with our child. It is a mother's duty to discipline her child, after all. Now, if you would excuse us. Apollo: (Discipline? Coming from her, I don't like the sound of that at all...) Phoenix: Well, Apollo, let's head back to the safe house for now. Apollo: Good idea. We need to go over what we've found and collect our thoughts. May 18Former Sahdmadhi Law Offices Edgeworth: ...Ah, you're back. Athena: Thank you for holding down the fort, Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth. Sorry it took so long. Hope you weren't too bored. Edgeworth: ...I watched \"The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm\" while you were gone. And my verdict is... it's an outrage! Especially its theme song. Even worse, the people here believe it's an original, Khura'inese show. Can you believe it! I've already spoke about it at length with Mr. Are'bal here, and he... Apollo: (I'm not sure what he's babbling about, but at least it seems he wasn't bored.) Phoenix: Moving along to things that actually matter... We've gathered about all the information and evidence we can concerning this case. I think it's time we go over everything we've learned so far. Examine Any point of interest Phoenix: ...Apollo. We probably shouldn't search the place while Datz is gone. Besides, we need to go over the case for tomorrow. Athena: What's with you recently? It's like you want to spend every free minute we have snooping. Apollo: (But don't you get the urge to look at everything you can sometimes, too?) Talk About Inga's murder Phoenix: The orb trial... Maya's abduction... And the murder of the mastermind behind it all, Justice Minister Inga... It's a lot to consider. Think you have all the facts straight in your head? Apollo: Yep, I've got it covered, Mr. Wright. It's the truth about what really went down that's going to be the problem. Athena: Yeah, it's like the more we learn about this case, the less we understand. Phoenix: I agree. There's a deep darkness enveloping this case. I'm almost afraid of what we will find once we lift that black veil. Suffice to say, the real killer is certainly waiting underneath. Apollo: (The real killer, huh... Now that's the million dollar question.) Phoenix: Who killed Inga, and why? Think, Apollo. Who would you say had a motive to commit this crime? Apollo: Umm... Athena: I, for one, am drawing a complete blank. Phoenix: I want to know how the killer slipped into the tomb, killed Inga, and slipped back out... ...without ever being seen. That's a bona fide locked-room mystery right there. Apollo: Well, we've collected plenty of evidence and statements. I just hope the rest comes out in court. It'll be a thinner tightrope than usual, that's for sure. Amara's assassination Phoenix: This case has one big fly in the ointment. In order to prove Dhurke completely innocent... ...we'll also have to exonerate him of the crime committed twenty-three years ago. Apollo: Amara's supposed assassination... Athena: Right. We know Amara's still alive... ...but Dhurke could still be charged with plotting to kill her. Apollo: He couldn't discover the truth -- even after over two decades of investigating. So our biggest hurdle is going to be the complete lack of evidence. The fire made sure of that. Athena: Mr. Wright, have you ever won a case without any evidence? Phoenix: No, that's one thing I've never done before. Apollo: A trial unprecedented even in the decorated annals of the Wright Anything Agency... (Still, I can't help but wonder... Was there really no evidence left behind?) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: You flash that badge like a pro now. And with such confidence, too. I can really feel it. Apollo: R-Really? Phoenix: ...Sure. Take Trucy's case, or that civil trial yesterday. You really came into your own during both of them. Apollo: Eheh... Heh heh heh. (I can feel my cheeks betraying me...) Athena: You'd better not be thinking of starting your own firm, Apollo. Apollo: What? No, of course not. (I'm probably not ready for that, anyway.) Pink Butterfly Pendant, Woman's Photo, or Amara's Assassination File Phoenix: Amara... She's still alive. Apollo: But she's basically being held prisoner somewhere. Phoenix: This puts Dhurke at a distinct disadvantage. ...Not to mention us, too. Apollo: And Nahyuta is under Ga'ran's thumb because of all this as well. Phoenix: Yep. It's a problem all right, and it's not like we can just go and rescue Amara. There must be something we can do... Athena: We'll just have to pin our hopes on Dhurke's revolution! Apollo: So, basically, the fates of Amara and Nahyuta... ...depend entirely on our ability to beat the charges against Dhruke tomorrow. Dhurke's Law Book or Dhurke's Badge Phoenix: What would you do if the Defense Culpability Act was established back home? Apollo: What would I do? That's a good question. Athena: What are you worried about, Apollo? You'd always have a job as Trucy's assistant. Apollo: Uh-huh... And what about you, Athena? Couldn't you become a therapist? Athena: Hmm... I don't know if I could do it for a living... Phoenix: I'd probably go back to playing piano. Apollo: ..................... Athena: ............... Phoenix: Hey! What are those looks for?! Anything else Phoenix: Just because you don't know something, doesn't mean that I do, Apollo. That's an important lesson for you to learn. Apollo: (In other words, this didn't ring any bells.) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ...Oh, and we can't forget about the Defense Culpability Act. \"...those who would support criminals will be deemed just as guilty.\" In short, if Dhurke is found guilty, and is sentenced to death... ...we'll likely join him in a very public execution. Apollo: Y-Yeah... Athena: Beat the charges or die... What kind of crazy, upside-down legal system is this, anyway?! Phoenix: ...Don't worry. I can't ask someone as young as you to risk your life, Athena. So tomorrow, it'll just be me and Apollo on the courtroom floor. But you can support us by watching from the gallery. Athena: What?! No... I wanna help! I'm part of the agency, too, after all! Phoenix: ...Sorry, but this is a direct order from your boss. Plus, there's Prosecutor Blackquill to think of. He said he'd use me for sword practice if I put you in harm's way. Athena: Nrrgh... Simon... Well, at least promise me this, you two. Promise me you'll make it back alive! Apollo: Ha... Ha ha... Make it back alive... huh... Phoenix: What's with that face, Apollo? You'll never inspire confidence in your client like that. And it'll play right into the prosecution's hands. Remember, \"the worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles.\" Apollo: You're right! Even when it seems hopeless, or when there's not a shred of evidence to be found... ... we can never let it show on our faces... right? (But will I actually be able to do that tomorrow? When push comes to shove, will I be able to force my biggest smile?)

The victim's final memories will become a matter for deliberation.Apollo: I've heard about that. But they haven't stopped you from winning your cases here in Khura'in.Phoenix: True, but it wasn't easy. Still, the memories of the dead are simply another piece of evidence. There's always a way to deal with them if your client is truly innocent.Apollo: (Well, I know Dhurke is innocent, but...)Dhurke: I have one more... big secret.Dhurke: Apollo. In court tomorrow... ...you may find yourself faced with a truth that is difficult to accept. But I know you. And I know you can handle the truth, no matter what it turns out to be. I know that because I believe in you. You're my son, after all!Apollo: (Dhurke... What is that secret you're keeping?)???: Heya, AJ.Datz: Here ya go, just like I promised.Founder's Orb added to the Court Record.Apollo: Thanks, Datz. Wait... Weren't you arrested by the police yesterday?Datz: Yep. And I spent the night in the slammer. I had a fine meal, a shower -- even a bed! What more could I ask for? Har har har har!Athena: That actually sounds way better than where we're staying...Datz: Just remember, AJ, if Dhurke's found guilty today... ...we'll all probably be found guilty under the Defense Culpability Act, too.Apollo: (Yeah, Nahyuta said something to that effect.)Datz: That witch Ga'ran wants to take advantage of today to crush our revolution once and for all! The fate of the revolution -- and every Khura'inese person -- rests on this trial! We're counting on ya, AJ!Apollo: We'll be fine! I'm going to win this one.

Well, don't expect me to hold anything back, Nahyuta!)Judge: This trial will examine both the murder of Justice Minister Inga Karkhuul Khura'in... ...and the assassination of the former queen, Amara Sigatar Khura'in. First, I believe we should address the murder of Minister Inga. Would that be acceptable, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?Nahyuta: ........................Judge: Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?Nahyuta: ! Y-Yes, of course. Please proceed.Apollo: (What's with him?)Judge: How very unlike you, prosecutor. Is your mind elsewhere this day?Nahyuta: ...N-Not at all, Your Magistry.Apollo: (Are you really going to be able to go through with this, Nahyuta...?)Judge: ...Well, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, I would be remiss if I failed to voice a concern of mine. I have heard mention that you are son to the accused, Dhurke Sahdmadhi.Nahyuta: .........You have heard true. Does that fact pose some sort of a problem, Your Magistry?Judge: A father being prosecuted by his own son? Could one possibly deliberate such a case without having personal feelings intervene?Nahyuta: .........Yes, without question.Gallery:Can he really handle this?Even if it IS Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, going against his own father is just...How can the son of a criminal even BE a prosecutor in the first place?Dhurke:Apollo: (Dhurke...?)Dhurke: ...Fellow citizens, you would do well not to underestimate my son. He's not one to allow personal feelings to interfere with the execution of his duty. Isn't that right, Nahyuta?Nahyuta: ...! ...I will not stop until my work here is done.Dhurke: See? So all you doubters just sit back down before you trip over your own stupidity! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha!Judge: The accused will not take the stand without first being summoned! In any case, if Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has no issue with this arrangement... ...then let us commence the deliberations.???:Ga'ran: One moment, if you would.Judge: Y-Your Eminence?Nahyuta: Your Eminence! What brings you here?Ga'ran: Your Magistry. It would appear that Prosecutor Shadmadhi does indeed have some reservations.Nahyuta: No! That's not true!Ga'ran: Did you truly believe you could deceive me... Nahyuta Sahdmadhi? One should hold no reservations if one is to stand on these hallowed funerary grounds.Nahyuta: I-I... I have none, Your Emine--Ga'ran: No, it is clear we cannot leave this matter to you.Nahyuta: ...Nngh!Ga'ran: We shall handle the prosecution of Enemy of the Crown Dhurke Sahdmadhi personally. But remain by our side, and bear witness to how a true prosecutor enforces the law.Apollo: Um... Excuse me... but is the queen going to prosecute the case? Is that you know... um... kosher?Ga'ran: ...There is no need for concern. Before we were crowned queen, we served as a prosecutor.Apollo: Really?!Judge: As a foreigner, your ignorance can be excused, but know this... The prosecutor in charge of the Queen Amara assassination case twenty-three years ago... ... was none other than Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran Sigatar Khura'in.Apollo: (First, \"Your Magistry,\" and now this... Why doesn't anyone ever tell me these things...?)Phoenix: I'd heard she'd served as the minister of justice, but she was also a prosecutor?Apollo: I'm guessing she probably moved up the ladder from prosecutor to justice minister.Ga'ran: We prosecuted that case twenty-three years ago, but no verdict was ever rendered. We had won guilty verdicts in every case until then, for no lawyer could stand up to us.Judge: Ahh, I am at a loss for words. To think I would once more bear witness to Her Eminence at work in the Hall of Justice.Ga'ran: ......... Our first trial in twenty-three years... No quarter shall be given to criminals. We shall prosecute them with all our might!Gallery:...Ohhh!What a magnificent sight!The queen's attire from her prosecutor days! To think we would get to see it once more!Apollo: What the--?! TH-THAT'S Queen Ga'ran?!Phoenix: Talk about an extreme makeover.Ga'ran: Heh heh heh. It's all coming back now. The feel of my blood pumping through my veins. Woe to you, O enemies of Khura'in, for I shall personally slice, dice... ...and grind you up into hog feed!Apollo: (I don't suppose I can ask her to roll back to her polite, pre-makeover personality...)Ga'ran: ...Know this, lawyer.Apollo: Y-Yes?Ga'ran: Now that I stand as prosecutor, consider your defense's bench a headsman's scaffold. If you wish to leave any last words, I advise you to start thinking of them now. ...While you still have a head with which to think, that is.Apollo: ...Meep. (Sh-She's dead serious.)Ga'ran: Now, it is time for the Divination Séance. Rayfa, come forth.Judge: Your Benevolence, thank you for gracing us with your presence.Rayfa: ........................Judge: ...Your Benevolence? I understand it may be difficult for you, but... ...may we proceed with the Divination Séance?Rayfa: ............Yes, let us proceed.Judge: ...Forgive me for asking, but are you feeling physically unwell? If so, I would advise you to avoid any undue exertion.Rayfa: .........Um-hmm.Judge: ...Your Benevolence?Apollo: (What's wrong? It's like her mind's anywhere but here.)Phoenix: A lot's happened since yesterday. On top of the murder of her beloved father, she found out that he'd been planning a coup. And today she'll have to experience his death through his own eyes.Apollo: Yeah... That would be enough to shake anyone up.Phoenix: Still, it seems like she's worse off today than she was yesterday.Rayfa: ...............Apollo: (Yeah... I don't remember her being this depressed...)Ga'ran: ...We must speak with our child. It is a mother's duty to discipline her child, after all. Now, if you would excuse us.Apollo: (Discipline? Coming from her, I don't like the sound of that at all...)Apollo: (Wait... Ga'ran didn't do something to her, did she?)Judge: Your Eminence, about today's Divination Séance... As I understand it, the prosecution has yet to review its content. Is this deviation from protocol a part of your plan?Ga'ran: ...Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. Would you care to explain your actions?Nahyuta: Your Eminence... The accused was caught at the scene of the crime. Therefore, I deemed no Séance would be necessary for such a clear-cut case.Ga'ran: ...You and your bleeding heart. You seek to spare Rayfa the trauma of witnessing her father's death... Is that why you have done this?Nahyuta: ...N-Not at all.Rayfa: .........You were concerned for me, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?Apollo: (That's oddly compassionate of him, all things considered.)Nahyuta: ...Your Eminence, Your Magistry. Regardless of what is best for Her Benevolence... ...this case is blessed with a bounty of incontrovertible evidence. So I believed we can reach a swift verdict without devoting precious time to a Séance.Judge: Hmm... You have a point. Personally, I would like to spare Her Benevolence any undue misery. Experiencing the murder of a loved one is a burden no one should have to bear.Rayfa: .........Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, Your Magistry. Can this trial truly proceed without a Divination Séance?Apollo: (I can't blame her for not wanting to experience her father's murder firsthand...)Judge: Your Eminence? What are your feelings on the matter? Shall we have Her Benevolence return home for some much-needed rest?Ga'ran: .........We shall not. You fools spoil her with your feckless words of compassion.Nahyuta: !Judge: !Rayfa: Ngh...Ga'ran: ...Listen well, Rayfa. You have spoken time and time again about how grown up you are now.Rayfa: Y-Yes, but...Ga'ran: So, let us see if the royal priestess has truly come into her own. Are you prepared to fulfill your duty and perform the Divination Séance as you should?Rayfa: .....................Yes.Ga'ran: That's better. See. Problem solved.Nahyuta: .........Apollo: Poor Rayfa. Is this really a good idea?Phoenix: I guess we'll see...Rayfa: ...Very well. Let us begin... the Divination Séance. Nayna, my robe... .........Oh.Phoenix: Looks like Nayna's still missing.Apollo: (It's been a whole day already.)Rayfa: .........Barbed Head.Phoenix: Y-Yes?Rayfa: You remove my robe.Phoenix: What?! Why me?Judge: ...Don't keep Her Benevolence waiting now, Mr. Wright. Can't you see she's ready to begin?Phoenix: ...Great. I've been reduced to \"royal robe remover.\"Apollo: (It's like she's grooming Mr. Wright to be Nayna's replacement...)Judge: Very well, Your Benevolence. Please start when you are ready.Rayfa: .........Ngh...Ga'ran: ...Come, Rayfa. You know what must be done. There is no turning back now.Rayfa: ..................I know.Apollo: (The final memories of the deceased... This should be interesting.)Rayfa: O Holy Mother! We hold this Divination Séance in your name! Let the eyes of everyone here be clear, and our ears be unstopped! O Dance of Devotion! Guide the victim's soul to me! So that we may receive their final memories in the Pool of Souls!Rayfa: Haggh! I. I... I... Ah... Auunngh!Apollo: !Nahyuta: !Ga'ran: !Rayfa: .................. *huff, puff* *huff, puff* .........*gasp!*Judge: Y-Y-Your Benevolence! Wh-What's wrong?!Ga'ran: Th-This is... unacceptable!Judge: B-Bailiff! Take Her Benevolence to the first-aid station at once!Apollo: This is not good...Judge: ....Your Eminence, do you have any idea why Her Benevolence collapsed so suddenly?Ga'ran: ...It seems she was not ready for what the deceased was to reveal. It overwhelmed her. Her inexperience and immaturity left her ill-prepared to face her father's death. Hmph. And she said she could go through with it. How very disappointing.Apollo: (I know someone who's not winning \"Mother of the Year,\" ever. I mean, of course Rayfa's going to be overwhelmed. She's still just a child!)Ga'ran: ...It seems we have no choice but to move on to witness testimony. Your Magistry?Judge: Oh, yes. Let us proceed. Bailiff, summon the first witness, if you would.Judge: Is this not the accused?Ga'ran: It is indeed. I thought I would give him the opportunity to plead his case. For true justice is more than a unilateral presentation of the facts by the prosecution.Apollo: (That seems uncharacteristically fair of her.)Ga'ran: However, should the accused fail to produce convincing testimony... ...he, along with his cabal of traitorous lawyers, shall immediately be found guilty... ...and their heads will roll from their shoulders.Apollo: WHAAAAAAT?! I should've known there was a catch!Dhurke: Your court, your rules -- same as it always was, I see, Ga'ran.Judge: Now, then, Mr. Dhurke Sahdmadhi. If you could enlighten us as to what happened?Dhurke: Um, well... I would... if I could...Witness Testimony-- Dhurke Explains Himself --Dhurke: I was struck by a sudden dizziness the moment I entered the tomb. The next thing I knew, I was standing there with a bloody knife in my hand. And lying right in front of me was Inga, dead as a doornail. I've no recollection of what happened in the interim. But I didn't kill him. At least, I don't think I did. It'd go against everything I believe in.Apollo: ............ (That didn't explain squat.)Ga'ran: For the record, let it be known... ... that the accused's fingerprints were all over the murder weapon. And since he was caught in the act, there was no chance for a third party to tamper with it.Judge: Well, that certainly seems to point the finger at you, Mr. Sahdmadhi.Dhurke: Even as a lawyer, I have to agree with you there, Your Magistry. Hah-ha ha ha ha ha!Apollo: (Seriously, Dhurke? This is no laughing matter.)Phoenix: This is exactly what Ga'ran wanted. To have Dhurke try to plead his case, only to fail miserably.Apollo: How low can she go...?Ga'ran: ...Prosecutor, behold this most unpleasant of spectacles and let it be etched into your soul. See how instead of accepting the inevitable... ...those fish-brained lawyers flounder and flop themselves straight into the abyss of despair.Nahyuta: Yes, Your Eminence! Show me the way!Judge: Now, then, would the defense please begin their cross-examination?Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Dhurke Explains Himself --Dhurke: I was struck by a sudden dizziness the moment I entered the tomb.Press Apollo: Apollo: You were struck by a sudden dizziness? (Was it because of his illness?) Is that something that has ever happened to you before? Dhurke: Can't say that it has. Maybe age is catching up with me. I'm no spring chicken, after all! Apollo: (That's not the issue here.) Ga'ran: Hmph. A most cunning excuse. One befitting an insidious insurgent. Dhurke: Oh? Ga'ran: A killer who does not recall his crime... How very convenient. Next, I imagine you will plead insanity. You aim to seek a lesser sentence through excuses and subterfuge, do you not? Dhurke: Dhurke: Don't make me laugh, Your Malevolence. Ga'ran: How dare you! Dhurke: I'm merely stating my innocence. I've no intention of offering excuses. It's your baseless speculation I would decry as foolish... ...you deceitful witch. Ga'ran: .........Is it your wish that I should claim your head right now, in this very hall? Dhurke: Well, that would certainly speed things along, hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: Apollo: Um, Dhurke? Why don't you let me handle it from here? And if there's anything you need to say, you can say it through me, okay? (Anything to stop you from needling the queen.) Ga'ran: Hmph. Next time you have an objection, you'd better have some proof to go with it, Dhurke. Judge: The accused will continue with what he DOES recall of the crime.Dhurke: The next thing I knew, I was standing there with a bloody knife in my hand.Press Apollo: Apollo: Hmm... Do you recall anyone putting the knife in your hand, Dhurke? Dhurke: Wish I could say I did, but I don't remember a thing from before I came to. You think there might have been a third party in the tomb, son? Apollo: Yeah, because if you didn't do it, then the real killer must've been there with you. Ga'ran: Ga'ran: ..................  Royal Guard: You called, Your Eminence?! Apollo: (Does she go anywhere without those goons?) Ga'ran: Was there a third party in the tomb when you were securing it? Royal Guard: No, Your Eminence. We searched hiiiiigh and low, but found no one of the sooooooort! Ga'ran: ...And there you have it. Phoenix: Oh, right. They did search the place. Ga'ran: Furthermore... ...my guards had the entire tomb surrounded, so there was no way for anyone to escape. Royal Guard: That's right! No one got in or out without our knowledge! Her Eminence's on-site directives were absolutely flaaawless! Ur dihara Ga'ran! Apollo: ...Argh. Ga'ran: Do you see now? The presence of a third party is beyond the realm of possibility. The tomb was, for all intents and purposes... ...completely sealed off from the rest of the world. Gallery: What a waste of time.How can it be any more obvious? Dhurke must be the killer. Apollo: (Thanks for nothing, gallery guy. As if our graves weren't already deep enough.) Ga'ran: Accused. What do you believe about the possible presence of a third party? Dhurke: Hmm... Well, based on the situation you presented... ...I'd say the chances are slim to none. Apollo: ......... (You didn't have to agree with her, Dhurke...) Ga'ran: Heh heh heh. Let the accused's statement be added to his testimony. Judge: Very well. Mr. Sahdmadhi, if you would... Apollo: It's like, the more we press, the thinner our case gets. Phoenix: Well, let's keep pressing, and maybe we'll work out the wrinkles in it, too. Adds statement \"The possibility of a third party being there in the tomb is probably nonexistent.\" if not already addedDhurke: The possibility of a third party being there in the tomb is probably nonexistent.Press Apollo: Apollo: We can't prove you innocent without at least the possibility that a third party was there. Dhurke: Find the possible in the impossible, son. That's just what a lawyer's got to do sometimes. Isn't that right... Wright? Phoenix: Who, me? ...Yeah, you could say that. I've seen more than my fair share of trials like that... They'd start with no viable evidence, useful testimony, or any hope of winning... But through cold sweat, desperation and a little luck, I always managed to pull them off. Dhurke: ...Wright. I can see we are kindred spirits, you and I! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: Jeez, taking cases like that must shave years off your life. Phoenix: Ha ha ha. If that were true, I'd be long dead. Apollo: (Find the possible in the impossible? Can I prove that it was at least possible that there was a third party there?) Dhurke, what did you see at the scene of the crime? Dhurke: Let's see, I came to...Present Mysterious Bloodstain Apollo: Leads to: \"Your Eminence, I'm afraid this trial will not go exactly as you anticipated.\"Dhurke: And lying right in front of me was Inga, dead as a doornail.Press Apollo: Apollo: YOu stated that he was as dead as a doornail. How can you be so sure? Dhurke: It's pretty easy to spot the difference between a soulless man and the soulless shell of a man. His complexion and the amount of blood at the scene made it obvious which it was. Ga'ran: Hmph. Watch your words, or you shall join Minister Inga much sooner than expected. You can bow your head before him and seek his forgiveness there in the Twilight Realm. ...If you still have a head to bow, that is. Dhurke: You bloodthirsty spider. What happened to you? There was still a little love in your heart twenty-three years ago. You even used to think of me as a brother. Ga'ran: ........It seems you truly do have a death wish. Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Is that really all you've got? Apollo: Dhurke, I'm begging you... Enough of the lip -- just deliver your testimony. Please. Dhurke: All right, all right. I'll try, but I can't promise anything.Dhurke: I've no recollection of what happened in the interim.Press Apollo: Apollo: A day's passed since the murder. Haven't you remembered anything in that time? Dhurke: My memory is a complete blank. It's as if that part of my brain has been scooped right out. Ga'ran: How very convenient. But even if you've no memory of the event, your guilt is without question. There is nothing more to debate. Dhurke: You're forgetting one thing, Ga'ran. I have no motive. Ga'ran: You lead a band of insurgents that seeks to overthrow the government. I would say that alone is motive enough to slay our kingdom's minister of justice. Dhurke: Dhurke: I've declared countless times that I lead a bloodless revolution. I forbid violence and murder, even if some younger members may have a thirst for blood. Apollo: (A bloodless revolution... He wouldn't really have a motive, in that case. Is that an important statement?) Yes, it is Apollo: That was an important statement. I'd like my client to add it to his testimony. Judge: Very well, then. The accused will please do as the defense has requested. Adds statement \"I don't have a motive for killing Inga. After all, me and my ilk seek a bloodless revolution.\" No, it isn't (No, it's not all that important.) Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement \"I don't have a motive for killing Inga. After all, me and my ilk seek a bloodless revolution.\") Apollo: Apollo: A day's passed since the murder. Haven't you remembered anything in that time? Dhurke: My memory is a complete blank. It's as if that part of my brain has been scooped right out. Ga'ran: How very convenient. But even if you've no memory of the event, your guilt is without question. There is nothing more to debate. Dhurke: You're forgetting one thing, Ga'ran. I have no motive. Ga'ran: You lead a band of insurgents that seeks to overthrow the government. I would say that alone is motive enough to slay our kingdom's minister of justice. Dhurke: Dhurke: I've declared countless times that I lead a bloodless revolution. I forbid violence and murder, even if some younger members may have a thirst for blood. Apollo: (A bloodless revolution... He wouldn't really have a motive, in that case.)Dhurke: I don't have a motive for killing Inga. After all, me and my ilk seek a bloodless revolution.Press Apollo: Apollo: A bloodless revolution? Could you be more specific? Dhurke: I'm talking about dragging this pompous prosecutor here off her bloody throne. So go ahead, Ga'ran, act all high and mighty now, because it's the last chance you'll get. Ga'ran: You still speak of rebellion despite the charges against you? You truly are a fool. I will prove your guilt soon enough, and display your head for all of Khura'in to see. People will forever speak of you -- not as a revolutionary, but as the terrorist you are.  Dhurke: You're mistaken, Your Maleficence. It will be YOU the people will speak of... ...as the tyrant who was overthrown by her own people. Ga'ran: .........I wonder if you will still be spewing such nonsense before the headsman's axe? Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! I'm afraid I'll still be like this in the afterlife, despot! Apollo: (I know that self-restraint is as foreign as apple pie to Dhurke, but... ...I'd really rather go home than to the Twilight Realm after this.)Dhurke: But I didn't kill him. At least, I don't think I did. It'd go against everything I believe in.Press Apollo: Apollo: Can you state that you didn't kill him more definitively? Dhurke: How can I, when I have no memory of what happened? Apollo: Well, can you at least state whether or not you are a murderer? Dhurke: That, I can do. I am not a murderer. And I would never kill anyone, no matter the circumstances. Ga'ran: Ga'ran: And do you have any evidence to support your claim that you did not kill the minister? Dhurke: Evidence? No. Can't say I do... Ga'ran: In that case, you will strike the statement \"I didn't kill him\" from your testimony. Apollo: Wait. You can't just discard testimony like that. I mean... I'm the one cross-examining the defendant and all... Ga'ran: Hold your prattling tongue, foreign devil! I am the queen of this kingdom. And the queen IS the law. As such, I need not follow the laws that are in place. I can make and break them at will!  Judge: Henceforth, the accused will refrain from stating \"I didn't kill him.\" Apollo: Whaaaaaat?! Dhurke: Sure. Whatever. It's \"The Ga'ran Show,\" after all. Same as always. Changes statement from \"But I didn't kill him. At least, I don't think I did. It'd go against everything I believe in.\" to \"Though, I guess there's no evidence that proves I didn't kill him either...\"Dhurke: Though, I guess there's no evidence that proves I didn't kill him either...Press Apollo: Apollo: Dhurke, leave the evidence-finding to me. Now please, will you stop agreeing with everything the prosecution says? Dhurke: All right. I'll stick to the facts from now on. But remember, son, if you truly believe in me, you should be able to prove my innocence. I know you can do it. Apollo: (He believes I'll prove him innocent. Even with all these inconvenient truths? Is that what he's saying?) Phoenix: I think Dhurke might be on to something. Even the most disadvantageous facts may point the way to the truth. So don't ignore them. Think of them as food for thought. Apollo: Don't worry, I know. (The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles. I need to remember that, no matter how difficult the facts may be to deal with.)Before adding any statement Apollo: His testimony didn't exactly explain anything, did it? Phoenix: Nope. In fact, he basically just testified to the effect of he CAN'T explain himself. But that's undoubtedly what Ga'ran wanted. Apollo: Just great... Phoenix: Apollo. We need to turn Dhurke's non-explanation into an explanation about something. Fast.After adding statement \"The possibility of a third party being there in the tomb is probably nonexistent.\" Phoenix: If only we could establish the possibility of a third party... Apollo: But does the possibility itself even exist? Phoenix: We don't have a choice. Proving it exists is the only way to start a real dialogue here.After adding statement \"I don't have a motive for killing Inga. After all, me and my ilk seek a bloodless revolution.\" Phoenix: Dhurke says he has no motive... but what do you think, Apollo? Apollo: Well... I, for one, am glad he doesn't, because it would just make matters worse.

It'd go against everything I believe in.\nPerson: Dhurke\nTestimony 7\nTestimony: Though, I guess there's no evidence that proves I didn't kill him either...\nPerson: Dhurke\n\nWhich evidence and testimony contradict each other? You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "cot": "The testimony \"But I didn't kill him. At least, I don't think I did. It'd go against everything I believe in.\" (Testimony 6) by Dhurke asserts that he did not kill Inga. However, the evidence 28 \"Dhurke's Badge\" is described as \"The symbol of Dhurke's creed: 'A dragon never yields.' Nahyuta never confiscated it.\" implying that Nahyuta, who confiscated Dhurke's other jailbreaking tools, deliberately left the badge with Dhurke.\n\nThis suggests a contradiction in the confidence and stance taken by Dhurke in his testimony and the practical actions taken by Nahyuta indicating some trust or expectation regarding Dhurke's guilt or innocence. But this is quite subtle and indirect, so let's look for a more direct contradiction.\n\nBetter contradiction:\n\nTestimony 2: \"The possibility of a third party being there in the tomb is probably nonexistent.\" — Dhurke testifies that there was probably no third party in the tomb.\n\nEvidence 20 \"Mysterious Bloodstain\": \"A bloodstain from Amara's Tomb. This bloodstain found had been wiped up by someone. Analysis reveals that it's Dhurke's blood.\" This evidence suggests there was another person present to wipe up Dhurke's blood, implying a possible third party.\n\nThus, the evidence of blood wiped up (Evidence 20) contradicts Dhurke's testimony that it was unlikely there was a third party present.\n",

Rayfa actor: Aaah! Why me?! Dhurke actor: Mwahahahaha! It's time for a revolution! Rayfa actor: No! Let go of me! Plumed Punisher actor: That's far enough! Dhurke actor: Who's there?! Plumed Punisher actor: It is I-- The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm! Dhurke: Good people of Khura'in, we can't allow things to go on like this. The Defense Culpability Act has done nothing but produce countless victims of wrongful convictions. The time to act is now. For we, the Defiant Dragons, have obtained the ultimate weapon: the Founder's Orb! And to the Ga'ran regime: Make no mistake about it-- I will personally dethrone you! A dragon never yields. Nor will he rest until his revolution is complete. May 16, 11:00 AMWright Anything Agency TV: ...And this concludes our report on the recent television hijacking in Khura'in. But really, who could have anticipated a surprising turn of events? Trucy: Did you hear that, Polly? Someone hijacked the airwaves over there! It's like something out of a movie! Apollo: ......... Trucy: Apollo? Apollo: ......Um, yeah. Dhurke... What are you up to this time? Trucy: Wait a second... Do you know the TV hijacker or something, Apollo? Apollo: ......You could say that... but it was a long time ago. Trucy: ...And WHY do you know someone like that? I mean, they're calling him an \"insurgent.\" Apollo: Y-Yeah, about that... ???: Hey now. Is that any way to talk about the man who raised you? Apollo: Huh? Dhurke: Hey there, Apollo! Long time no see! How've you been, son? Apollo: I-I-It's-- Trucy: It's that guy that was on TV! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Guilty as charged! Surprised to see me, Apollo? I just beamed in from Khura'in, and boy are my arms tired! Apollo: Th-Th-This can't be happening! ...I must be dreaming... or hallucinating... or both... Trucy: No, you're not, Apollo! It's that TV hijacker-slash-insurgent in the flesh! Apollo: ........ (I'm so confused.) Trucy: Um! Mr. Hijacker! Sir! I have SO many questions, I don't even know where to begin! But let's start with that bit about \"the man who raised you.\" Dhurke: Wait, don't tell me you haven't told anyone about me, son? It's okay to brag about it. Tell everyone your old man's me, the rebel Dhurke! I mean, my face is all over TV these days! I'm practically a celebrity, hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: .........Trucy, what do you say we close up early today? Trucy: What?! Why?! Dhurke: ...Aw, come on, son. No need for the cold shoulder! Apollo: ......... (*sigh* I know I'm going to regret this, but...) What do you want, Dhurke? You just show up here without warning after all this time... What gives? Dhurke: I came all this way to see you, son! Come, rejoice! Apollo: Riiight... Why don't you tell me the real reason you're here. Dhurke: W-Well... Okay, so maybe there's a little something I need your help with, too, but... The fact is I came here to see you. That's the honest truth. Apollo: Yes, I think we've established that. (It figures... I haven't seen him in ten plus years and he's already asking for a favor. He really is a rebel in the purest sense -- he just does whatever he pleases.) Trucy: C'mon, Polly! I need details. Inquiring minds want to know! Apollo: Okay, okay. Hold your horses. First, I've got a few questions of my own. Examine Bookshelf Dhurke: Hm? Why, this is Apollo's journal. Apollo: Huh?! What's it doing at the office? Trucy: It's magic! Dhurke: Let's see what he wrote... Apollo: N-No, don't! Dhurke: Huh... There's nothing in here. Apollo: What? Trucy: This calls for a special spell! Presto diario! Dhurke: Why, there's writing appearing right before my very eyes! Trucy: Like I said, it's magic! Now go ahead, read to your heart's content! Apollo: Wow! ...Er, I mean, give me that! Charley the plant Apollo: That's Charley the houseplant. Dhurke: You know, my hideout used to have a houseplant, too. We called it \"Apollo.\" Trucy: I bet it was a cactus! Dhurke: How'd you guess? Trucy: Because Polly's hair's just as spiny! Apollo: Hey, leave my hair out of this. Trucy: And he has a prickly attitude, to boot! Apollo: (I better quit while I'm ahead.) Hula hoop Dhurke: More magic props... Oh! I've seen a ring like this before! I used to be quite good with these. Apollo: Really? Why don't you show us? Dhurke: Well, if you insist! I'll show you the act of daring-do I used to perform to supplement my income. First, I have to light the ring on fire, then I'll jump through it... Apollo: That's a fire hoop, this is a kid's toy, Dhurke... Magic props Dhurke: This is one seriously cluttered office. I mean, do you really need a piano here? Trucy: Well, it has sentimental value for Daddy, you see... Apollo: Yeah, but this office could use a little help with its bottom line. What if we sold it? Trucy: Apollo! ...You'd better give me a cut of the proceeds when you do. Dhurke: Money before memories, eh? This office's finances really must be in dire straits then. Magic split box Dhurke: This is one of those contraptions for cutting people into pieces! Trucy: How did you know that, Mr. Dhurke? Dhurke: Well, it just so happens I've been in one of these myself. Apollo: Really? Trucy: You have? Dhurke: Yes. Once, when I was being held prisoner by Minister Inga's secret police... ...they tried to torture me into revealing one of my compatriot's hideouts. Apollo: That's a torture device, this is a magic prop, Dhurke... Dhurke: Man, I barely escaped that thing alive! Trucy: Well, you have my respect as a magician for your death-defying spirit! Table Dhurke: What's with this bright red jacket? Who would wear such a garish thing? Trucy: Maybe one of our clients forgot it here. Dhurke: I'd love to get a look at the man who'd dare wear something like this! Trucy: Me, too! Apollo: (I know I don't wear it much, but... she has to know it's mine, right?) Talk Dhurke Dhurke: Pleased to meet you, little lady. My name is Dhurke Sahdmadhi. I'm a... well... a rebel by trade. Trucy: A rebel? But on TV, they were calling you an insurgent. So which is it? Personally, I vote for a rebel with a cause -- a real \"head\"-ache for anyone in your way! Apollo: Trucy...! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! You got me there. I'm the head of a resistance group. The Defiant Dragons. We're like the good, the bad, and the ugly... but without the good part. In Khura'in, I'm like the bogeyman -- a tall tale parents use to spook their kids straight! Trucy: That's too bad. You seem like you'd be a fun, cool guy to hang with! Dhurke: ...This little lady's a real catch, son. I'm talking bride material, if you get my drift. Apollo: Wait, what? Trucy: Oh! Stop it! You're embarrassing me... Dad. Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha. She's a plucky one, all right! Apollo: Someone pluck me out of my misery... Trucy: Now, about that \"man who raised you\" business... Foster father (appears after \"Dhurke\") Trucy: What did Mr. Dhurke mean when he said that he's \"the man who raised you,\" Apollo? Apollo: The truth is, I grew up in the Kingdom of Khura'in. Did I, uh... never mention that? Trucy: Oh, so you grew up in... Khura'in?! Wait, are you saying... ...you're not from around here, Polly? Apollo: No, it's just I was raised in Khura'in when I was really little. Trucy: Still, that's a shocker. It's like I hardly know anything about you! How come you never told me?! Dhurke: ...Apollo. You really haven't said a word about your past, have you? Apollo: What, that I was raised by a wanted criminal? It's like a bad joke. Trucy: It does sound rather melodramatic. I doubt anyone would even believe you. So you two haven't seen each other in a while, huh? Apollo: You could say that. I'd wager it's been at least ten years. Trucy: Wow... That's a really long time. Apollo: Yeah, well, I figured he'd forgotten about me. Dhurke: Not a chance! It's just, well... Starting a revolution takes time, and keeping it going even more so... And being a wanted man, I couldn't just hop a plane to come say hello. Apollo: ...I get it. It's fine. (Though, truth be told... ...it's weird having Dhurke suddenly show up acting all paternal. I'd even almost forgotten about Khura'in... No, that's not true. I probably tried to forget about it on purpose.) Trucy: Now then, Mr. Dhurke, what is it we can help you with? Request (appears after \"Foster father\") Dhurke: I need to get my hand on the Founder's Orb, the most sacred treasure of Khura'in. That's where you come in. Apollo: The Founder's Orb? Trucy: Wait, but didn't you say you already have it in that broadcast of yours? Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Don't go believing everything you see on TV, little lady. No one's seen hide nor hair of the Founder's Orb for some time. Trucy: No way! Apollo: S-So that was just a bluff...? What are you going to do if you DON'T find it? Dhurke: I don't know. Guess that just means we HAVE to find it, son. 'Cause I can't really back down now, can I? Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (*sigh* Different year, same old Dhurke. It's all coming back to me now.) Hold on. I think I read something about this in the newspaper a while back. Something about you stealing a sacred treasure from a temple's treasure room. Dhurke: That's a load of crock. We didn't lay a finger on the orb. Apollo: Really? Dhurke: Yes, Baseless allegations, all of it. Our enemy has really found a way to keep us all on our toes. Trucy: Ooh! So it's like a setup! Dhurke: That's the long and short of it. However, my compatriot has been hot on the orb's trail. And just the other day, his hard work finally paid off. We now know the Founder's Orb is in... Kurain Village. Apollo: Kurain Village? Dhurke: Yes. I hear there are spirit mediums there. They even have direct relations with Khura'in. Apollo: Spirit mediums... Right... Dhurke: Some doctor of archeology there supposedly has the orb. His name is Archie Buff. My Defiant Dragon compatriot has already made contact with him. Apparently, someone asked the doctor to study the orb. Apollo: So whoever asked him to do that is the real thief? Dhurke: Most likely. Apollo: And you think this guy will just hand the orb over to you? Dhurke: My compatriot, Datz, says Dr. Buff has already promised to do so. It seems he knew it was stolen, and wanted to do the right thing. Apollo: (Datz... I remember running around him when I was a kid.) (So he's here, too, huh.) Dhurke: Apollo, I want you to be present as my lawyer when I take possession of the orb. Would you do that for me? Fine Leads to: \".........Fine, but I'll charge my standard fee.\" Nope Apollo: I haven't seen you in years, and you waltz in here asking for a favor? You have a lot of nerve, you know-- Trucy: Of course we'll help! Right, Apollo?! Apollo: W-Wait, Trucy...! Trucy: Oh, come on. It's not like you have any work anyway. Besides, we're talking about rebels and legendary treasure here. It'll be fun! Apollo: (*sigh* Why is she always into the things I'm not?) Leads to: \".........Fine, but I'll charge my standard fee.\" Apollo: .........Fine, but I'll charge my standard fee. Now tell me about the Founder's Orb. The Founder's Orb (appears after \"Request\") Apollo: If I remember correctly, the founder is always depicted as a faceless spirit medium. Trucy: What do you mean \"faceless\"? Dhurke: Images of the founder, the Holy Mother of Khura'in, never show her face. To depict it is to commit the greatest taboo in Khura'inism. Apollo: The greatest taboo, huh? (I wonder why? I mean, what could she have looked like to make them hide her face like that? Dhurke: As for the Founder's Orb, it was discovered during an excavation eight years ago... ...and has an interesting legend that goes along with it. It's said that there's a riddle to the orb, and that any who can solve it... ...will receive immense spiritual power from the founder herself. Apollo: Sounds like one big fairy tale to me. Dhurke: In any case... ...it's just what us Defiant Dragons need to get our revolution started. With it, we can gain the spiritual power, and thus, the legal authority to rule Khura'in! Apollo: Wait, suppose I believe this legend. Then, anyone could become king or queen? And THAT'S why you think it'll help you overthrow the Gar'an regime? Dhurke: Only the rulers of Khura'in have ever laid eyes on the orb, Apollo. A legendary treasure that bestows immense spiritual power... Doesn't that sound like something you'd want to see with your own two eyes? Apollo: (...That does sound just a tiny bit intriguing.) Founder's Orb added to the Court Record. Dhurke: That should just about cover everything. Any other questions? Apollo: Not right now. Dhurke: Ah, I almost forgot. I brought you a present. Eat up, son! Apollo: ...Sushi? Dhurke: I figured you probably couldn't afford three square meals a day, so... Trucy: Yay! I was just thinking it was time for lunch! Dhurke: You dig in, too, little lady. After all, we're practically family, right?! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Trucy: Thanks, Dad! Ooh, that tuna looks good! *chomp* *nom nom nom* Dhurke: This salmon sushi's got my name on it! *chomp* *chew chew chew* Aren't you hungry, son? This is some of the best sushi you'll ever have! Apollo: .........I'm... I'm good. Dhurke: O-Oh, well... Okay then. ...Actually, I have one more present for you. Here. Apollo: What's this? Dhurke: A picture of your father. It's been twenty-three years since he passed away. Apollo: Huh?! This... This is my father? Dhurke: His name was Jove Justice. Apollo: Jove... Dhurke: I haven't talked to you about your real father in some time, but as you know... ...he was a musician -- a wandering minstrel, if you will -- and a talented one at that. Apollo: ............ Why... Why are you giving this to me now? Dhurke: I thought it was sad you didn't know what your old man looked like. I searched high and low to find that one picture. Apollo: ............ Trucy: What's wrong, Apollo? Don't you want it? Apollo: (I don't know. I mean, it's not like I ever met the guy.) Dhurke: Well, I went through all the trouble of finding it, so go on, take it! And don't ever let it go, you hear? Photo of My Father added to the Court Record. Dhurke: Well, now that our bellies are full, what do you say we hit the road? Apollo: One second. Hey, Trucy, any idea where Athena is? Trucy: She left early this morning to pick up Daddy from the airport. Apollo: Oh, I almost forgot. Mr. Wright is coming back today. Trucy: Yeah... but I wonder why he cut his trip short like that. Anyway, shouldn't they have been back by now? Apollo: Knowing Athena, she probably got lost. Well, there's no point sitting around here waiting. Let's get going. Trucy: I can't wait to see that super mysterious treasure! Dhurke: To Kurain Village, then! The Founder's Orb awaits! The Founder's Orb (subsequent times) Apollo: If I remember correctly, the founder is always depicted as a faceless spirit medium. Trucy: What do you mean \"faceless\"? Dhurke: Images of the founder, the Holy Mother of Khura'in, never show her face. To depict it is to commit the greatest taboo in Khura'inism. Apollo: The greatest taboo, huh? (I wonder why? I mean, what could she have looked like to make them hide her face like that? Dhurke: As for the Founder's Orb, it was discovered during an excavation eight years ago... ...and has an interesting legend that goes along with it. It's said that there's a riddle to the orb, and that any who can solve it... ...will receive immense spiritual power from the founder herself. Apollo: Sounds like one big fairy tale to me. Dhurke: In any case... ...it's just what us Defiant Dragons need to get our revolution started. With it, we can gain the spiritual power, and thus, the legal authority to rule Khura'in! Apollo: Wait, suppose I believe this legend. Then, anyone could become king or queen? And THAT'S why you think it'll help you overthrow the Gar'an regime? Dhurke: Only the rulers of Khura'in have ever laid eyes on the orb, Apollo. A legendary treasure that bestows immense spiritual power... Doesn't that sound like something you'd want to see with your own two eyes? Apollo: (...That does sound just a tiny bit intriguing.) Present Attorney's Badge Dhurke: What's that? Apollo: It's my attorney's badge. Dhurke: I can relate. I used to want to show mine off, too. But don't ever show it to anyone in Khura'in. They'll run you right out of town the moment they find out you're a lawyer. Apollo: I wonder how it went for Mr. Wright. Knowing him, he probably flashed his left and right... Founder's Orb Dhurke: The Founder's Orb... They say the Holy Mother will return when the riddle of the orb is solved. And she will bestow great spiritual power upon whoever accomplishes that feat. Apollo: (I wonder if I could channel spirits if I had such power.) Photo of My Father Dhurke: Brings back memories... He was a fine young man. So cheerful and fun to be around. His big, booming singing voice would captivate everyone in the tavern. But looks-wise, he was like a grownup version of you. Apollo: Um, that still doesn't give me a sense of what my real father was like. After clearing \"The Founder's Orb\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency: May 16Kurain Village Apollo: (So this is Kurain, the mystical village of spirit channeling... ... and where ancient traditions come alive. Looks like a really peaceful place.) Dhurke: Ahh, I love the air here! Nothing beats the mountains, huh, Apollo?! Apollo: (Come to think of it... We used to live way up in the mountains, too, just like this.) Dhurke: Sure brings back memories. Those were the days. The three of us living happily in peace. Trucy: ...I still can't wrap my mind around it all, you know. That Mr. Dhurke is not only Polly's daddy, but Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's as well. And the way you two talked about it like it was nothing the whole bus ride here! Apollo: (I guess it IS a lot to take in...) Trucy: So tell me, Mr. Dhurke, what was Apollo like as a kid? Dhurke: Oh, he was full of piss and vinegar, he was. A real rascal! He and Nahyuta used to run around in the open fields, naked as jaybirds. I've even got pictures of him posing in his birthday suit! Apollo: Whoa, whoa, Dhurke! Trucy: No way! Prosecutor Sahdmadhi used to be like that, too? Dhurke: The two of 'em would end up with leeches on their butts and cry like babies, hah-ha ha! Apollo: Dhurke! Don't you think you've said enough?! Dhurke: Aw, you're no fun. Trucy: Yeah! I wanted to hear more about the misadventures of Polly! ???: Hey, what are you people doing here? Apollo: Ema? Dhurke: You know this lady, son? Apollo: Yeah, this is Ema Skye. She's a detective. Ema: Technically speaking, I'm a forensics expert, but I'll let it slide. ...Anyway, I can't say I'm surprised to see you here. You always seem to pop up whenever there's trouble afoot. Still, what are the odds of running into you here in the boonies? Apollo: By \"trouble,\" you mean you're investigating a case? Ema: Does it look like I'm here to sightsee? .........Wait, don't tell me... You're not here to see Dr. Buff, are you? Apollo: Huh? How'd you know that? We're actually on our way to meet with him right now. Ema: Figures... Well, follow me. I'll show you the way. Apollo: ...Really? Dhurke: Don't look a gift horse in the mouth, son. Just follow the nice lady. Examine Phone booth Apollo: (A phone booth and a bus stop made of wood. They both look really old. You hardly ever see phone booths in the city anymore.) Dhurke: Apollo... what's this glass box for? Apollo: (I guess you hardly see them in Khura'in, too.) Kurain Boulder Apollo: There's a big boulder towering into the sky over there. According to the sign, it's called the \"Kurain Boulder.\" It also says that a spirit dwells within it. Hmm... A rock with a spirit in it? Dhurke: It's called animism -- the belief that spirits dwell within inanimate objects. They've probably enshrined this boulder as a sacred object. Their tradition of worshiping such objects is similar to our tradition in Khura'in. Apollo: I-Interesting... (Who knew Dhurke could make sense every once in a while?) Mountains Dhurke: Seeing those mountains really takes me back. I remember when we used to live high in the mountains to escape from the government. Apollo: So, you don't live there anymore? Dhurke: Nope. I needed a more convenient place to lead the revolution from. But that old mountain hut is still there. Apollo: (Man, I miss that hut...) Dhurke: What, are you getting homesick, Apollo? You can come on back to Khura'in anytime, you know? Apollo: N-No, no, I'm fine. Besides, I've got a lot on my plate here... Fey Manor Apollo: A thatched roof... First time I've ever seen one in real life. Dhurke: It looks just like the traditional thatched roofs they use in Japan. All we need now are some samurai with topknots, a few ninjas, and a cuddly mascot. Apollo: When was the last time you were in Japan? Talk Any ideas? Dhurke: Mass transit and electronic communications... This country's infrastructure is really advanced compared to Khura'in. Apollo: Why don't you see the sights once you have the orb? Dhurke: Well... I guess I could use a break. How about you show me around? Apollo: ...Oh, um, I'll probably be busy with work, so, uh... Dhurke: ...I-I see. Trucy: What are you talking about, Polly? Your only work right now is cleaning the office. What to do Dhurke: The Founder's Orb should be with the doctor right now. What do you say we go take a gander? Apollo: What if he doesn't have it? What if you came all the way from Khura'in for nothing? Dhurke: I'll cross that bridge if and when I come to it. Besides... even if I leave empty-handed, at least I got to see you, son. Apollo: ...Oh, ha ha. Thanks? Dhurke: N-No, no -- I really mean it. May 16Kurain Village - Doctor's Study Apollo: So this is Dr. Buff's study... Trucy: Wow, look at all those books! The shelves go from floor to ceiling! It's like a library in here! Dhurke: Yes, and lots of artifacts, too. A true archeologist's paradise. Look, son! There are so many relics, they're spilling onto the floor! What a delightfully amusing room! Apollo: All I see is a mess. (And what's with that white outline...?) ...Um, Ema, where's the doctor? Ema: Well the thing is... he died last night. Apollo: Wait, what? Ema: It seems an avalanche of books knocked him off his bookshelf ladder. We're labeling it an accidental death. Apollo: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Please tell me you're joking... Ema: As if I'd come all the way out here for a few laughs, Apollo. Apollo: ...Yeah, I guess not. Dhurke: A scholar killed by his own books... Apollo: Oh man. What do we do now? I mean, how can he transfer ownership of the orb to you if he's dead? Dhurke: Yes, that is a problem. Apollo: Ema, can you please tell us exactly what happened? Examine Ema: What do you think you're doing? You can't just poke around without my permission. Apollo: (Guess I should ask her what's going on first.) Talk The doctor's death Apollo: So the doctor died in an accident? Ema: I received a call this morning saying Dr. Buff had been found dead under a pile of books. Apollo: This morning? (Talk about bad timing...) You mentioned that he had fallen off a ladder. Ema: Right. We believe he fell from the top of that big ladder there. Apparently, he triggered an avalanche of books while fumbling to reach one. And that sent him headlong on a fatal fall onto the hard floor. Trucy: How sad... Killed by his own books. But at least he was doing something he loved. Dhurke: For a scholar, I suppose it's kind of like a soldier killed in the line of duty. You could say he died an honorable death. Apollo: Ema, who was the first one to discover the body? Ema: About that... Whoever it was, it seems they wanted to remain anonymous. Apollo: What? Ema: It happens now and then. Some people would rather not get involved with the police. Dhurke: I can relate to that. Apollo: (Yeah, being a wanted man and all.) What now, Dhurke? A dead man can't exactly hand over the orb. Dhurke: We'll just have to find it. It must be around here somewhere. Apollo: Just to fill you in, Ema, we're actually here to get something. The Founder's Orb (appears after \"The doctor's death\") Apollo: Pops here had an agreement with the doctor. The doctor was supposed to hand over a sacred relic known as the Founder's Orb. Dhurke: \"P-Pops\"...? Ema: Oh, I see. That could be a problem, considering he's dead. Do you have a plan B? Apollo: Umm... Dhurke: I have an agreement in writing. My compatriot Datz should have it. Ema: Well, there shouldn't be any problems, then. So, who IS this gentleman you're escorting? Dhurke (appears after \"The Founder's Orb\") Leads to: \"Oh, right, I haven't introduced you yet. This is Dhurke. He's from the Kingdom of Khura'in.\" Present Attorney's Badge Ema: Your attorney's badge? Huh... Apollo: What, that normally gets a better reaction from you. Ema: I'm tired of collecting your fingerprints. It's kind of lost its luster. Apollo: Yeah, but who knows? There could be other people's prints on it. Ema: Ooh, that's true! Hand it over, buddy! Apollo: Ah! Ema: ............Hmph. The only prints I found were yours. Apollo: (Argh, it's all dusty now.) Founder's Orb Ema: Scientifically speaking, ancient relics are highly fascinating. Apollo: Why's that? Ema: Because of all the tests I can run. CT scans, electron microscopy, chemical analysis... The list goes on and on! If you ever do find one, you'd better bring it to me straight away! Apollo: Can I count on getting it back intact? Ema: We'll see. Scientific advances don't come without sacrifices, you know. Apollo: (...I know someone who WON'T be seeing the orb anytime soon.) Anything else Ema: You sure like to shove things in people's faces, don't you? Apollo: What about you? You're always dusting around for prints. Ema: That's my job! Apollo: Well, it's not like I'm presenting evidence for the fun of it, either. Ema: Really? Because it sure seems like you enjoy it, Apollo. Apollo: Right back at you, Ema. Apollo: Oh, right, I haven't introduced you yet. This is Dhurke. He's from the Kingdom of Khura'in. Ema: All the way from Khura'in, huh? So, what do you do there? Dhurke: I used to practice law, but I'm taking a break from all that. I'm focused now on making Khura'in a better place through... volunteer work. Ema: Volunteer work, huh? How interesting... Apollo: (...Well, it's not technically a lie.) Ema: So, how do you two know each other? Apollo: Oh, um... He's sorta my foster father. Ema: Come again? Trucy: Yeah! And he's Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's real father, too! Ema: Whaaat?! You mean you... and Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... ............I'm so sorry. It seems you've had quite a life. Apollo: (...Guess she's put a few things together.) Ema: Actually, Dhurke, you look kind of... familiar. Have we met before? Dhurke: Um, not that I recall. Apollo: (Great... She must've seen that news report on TV. It will really complicate things if she figures out he's a wanted man.) There are lots of guys who look like him. Sure you're not mistaking him for someone else? Ema: Are there, really? I mean, a middle-aged man with long hair and an eye patch? You don't see that every day. Apollo: W-Well, I'm sure you're just imagining things. Ema: So what does that sacred relic you're searching for look like? I mean, there's lots of stuff in here that's old and relic-y. Dhurke: Indeed. Unfortunately, I've no idea what it actually looks like. Apollo: So then, how are we supposed to find it? Dhurke: That, I do not know, either. We'll just have to go through each candidate one by one. Apollo: Great plan of attack there, Dhurke. Well, Ema, do you mind if we give this room a once-over? Ema: ...I guess not. But in exchange, you're going to help me in my investigation. Apollo: Sure. It can't hurt. Trucy: Ooh, I can't wait to get started! It'll be like hunting for buried treasure! Examine Body outline or pile of books Apollo: So this is where Dr. Buff died. Ema: Poor man... He fell right on his head, and probably died almost instantly. Apollo: I see some blood on the book there, but what's that dark stain? Ema: It appears to be coffee. It's still damp, so it must have gotten on there recently, perhaps even last night. Dhurke: That's a mighty big window he's next to -- big enough for someone to see inside. Ema: Exactly. That's how the local resident who reported his death found him to begin with. The doctor's body was visible from outside the window. And a passerby called in earlier this morning to report what they'd found. Apollo: So you mean this case is still only a few hours old? Dhurke: That explains why your investigation is just getting underway. Study Photo added to the Court Record. Study Diagram added to the Court Record. Body outline or pile of books (subsequent times) Apollo: So this is where Dr. Buff died. Dhurke: Yeah, the police received a call this morning... ...so their investigation is still just getting started. Glasses Apollo: There's a pair of glasses on this little pyramid here. Ema: They belonged to the doctor. Scientifically speaking, they appear to be your ordinary run-of-the-mill glasses. Trucy: I guess they don't pique her interest, scientifically speaking. Computer Apollo: This PC is password protected. Trucy, you think your magic can do something about this? Trucy: Hmm... I don't think it can override a password. Now, a locked desk... That I can get into. Like yours back at the office, Polly! Apollo: (Yikes... I'd better watch what I put in there.) Trucy: What? Do you put weird stuff in your desk? Stuff you don't want anyone to see? Apollo: Jeez, are you a mind reader, too? Trucy: No, but unlocking your thoughts is a cinch! Ladder or bookshelves Apollo: The doctor fell from the top of that ladder. Dhurke: Hmm... From that height, a fall onto a hard surface would probably kill anyone. Apollo: I don't know why anyone would want to climb that high in the first place. Trucy: Guess you can say he climbed it all the way to heaven... Raincoat Apollo: It's a two-tone raincoat. Dhurke: It's still a bit damp. I think someone might've worn it recently. Shoe shelves Apollo: There are a few pairs of shoes here. I guess there must be an entrance on this floor, too. Ema: Yeah, there's a backdoor over that way. But it's usually locked from what I can tell. The visitor's entrance is up that spiral staircase. Apollo: (That's the way we came in.) Geoglyph Apollo: There are animal drawings on the floor. They look like those famous geoglyph things. Dhurke: They remind me of the chalk outlines detectives draw around bodies. And the doctor's has [sic] just joined them. Now that's what I call dedication to one's field. Apollo: I don't think it was on purpose. Window Apollo: What a huge window. I bet you could see the entire study from the outside. Dhurke: How could he concentrate in here? I'd feel so exposed. Apollo: Well... He does have a bookshelf positioned for some privacy around his desk. Mechanical statue Dhurke: There's some sort of machinery inside this clay figure. Apollo: Whoa, it's moving! EX-TER-MI-NATE. EX-TER-MI-NATE. DES-TROY ALL TAR-GETS. EX-T-T-TERRRrrr... *scrape* *grind* Apollo: D-Do I even want to know what that thing is for?! Notebook Apollo: Look, it's one of the doctor's notebooks. Dhurke: Maybe there's something about the orb in there. It's a photo of the treasure box! The one from Tehm'pul Temple's treasure room. These must be his research notes on the Founder's Orb. Apollo: What's that on the right page? It looks like a poem or something. Dhurke: Let's see... Oh, it's the song that's performed during the Dance of Devotion. It's been sung during Khura'inese rites of offering since ancient times. Apollo: Oh, I think I've heard of that. Dhurke: There's also a legend associated with the song. Some say the solution to the orb's riddle is contained therein. Apollo: It's a song everyone in Khura'in knows? Not much of a way to keep it secret. Trucy: It's called \"hiding secrets in plain sight,\" Polly. Us magicians know all about that. Dhurke: Huh. That's strange. Apollo: What is? Dhurke: Dr. Buff's notes contain the second half of the song. Only the first half is sung during the Dance of Devotion. Most people haven't even heard the second half. Apollo: The second half? As in the part that begins, \"Offer thy prayers\"? Dhurke: I'm impressed. That's some thorough research he was conducting. Research Notes added to the Court Record. Model plane Apollo: Is this a bird? Dhurke: It looks like an airplane to me. Apollo: No, there couldn't have been any planes back when this was made. Dhurke: Yes, but it has wings and both horizontal and vertical stabilizers. That makes it an airplane. Apollo: No, it's definitely a bird. Dhurke: Open your eyes, son... As a lawyer, your job is to see the true nature of things. Apollo: (I still say it's a bird.) Misty Fey scroll Apollo: There's a brown stain on this scroll. Hm? Why does it smell like... gravy? Dhurke: Why would there be a gravy stain on it? Apollo: Who knows? But it looks like it's meant to be there. Dhurke: Maybe the artist was trying to inspire a \"gravy\" new trend: food splatter art. Apollo: That pun wounded me \"gravy-ly,\" Dhurke. Coffee machine Apollo: A coffeemaker and a bunch of coffee cups... He must've taken his coffee breaks here. Oh, and there's a filter with old coffee grounds in here. *sigh* Guess I'd better clean this up. Dhurke: What are you doing there, son? Apollo: Ah! (What AM I doing, cleaning this office?!) Dhurke: Don't tell me they have you on coffee duty back at your office. Apollo: N-No, no... It's just, if I don't keep the place clean, no one will. Ami Fey statue Apollo: It's a golden statue. Looks pretty old, too. Dhurke: Hmm... I imagine it has great archeological value... Maybe too great for a private researcher of Dr. Buff's caliber. Apollo: I wonder how he got his hands on something like this. Sacred Urn Apollo: \"Ami\"... Hmm... Why's someone's name written on here? Trucy: Maybe it's so if it ever got lost, someone could return it to its owner. You know, like how school kids put their names on things. Apollo: Yeah, but this is just an urn. And the name is written so big. Trucy: Well, I wrote my name on my magic panties. It says W-R-I-G-H-T in super big letters! Apollo: (The less said about this, the better.) Spiral staircase Apollo: It's a spiral staircase... And it's connected to a hallway up there. Why'd they have to place the second floor so high up? Ema: Wait... You're not afraid of heights, are you? Apollo: Oh, um... Well... Trucy: Oh, Polly's hilarious around high places. He gets all wobbly, like a baby deer taking its first steps. And his face turns as green as a watermelon. Apollo: It's not nice to make fun of people's phobias, you know. Dhurke: Come to think of it, the visitor's entrance is on the second floor. What an odd layout for a house... Wall relief Apollo: What a huge wall relief. Hmm... It seems to depict a spirit channeling. Dhurke: Hey... this spirit medium looks like the Holy Mother of Khura'in. Apollo: Yeah, her face was left blank, but the rest is clearly detailed and well-crafted. Dhurke: Did you know some researchers claim that the Holy Mother had three eyes? And that her third eye was able to divine the truth, just like the gods above. It is said to be on her forehead. Apollo: Like you said, you shouldn't believe everything you hear. Suitcase Apollo: That's one big suitcase. Dhurke: It's locked. Is it the doctor's? Ema: No, someone left it here last night. Apollo: So the doctor might've had a visitor? But how can you tell? Ema: That sticker there. You only see those on airport luggage. Which means, its owner is likely from overseas. Dhurke: Is there any way to figure out who it belongs to? Apollo: Not unless we can open it to see what's inside. Dhurke: Guess not... ???: Heh heh heh. Ah-ha ha ha! Ema: That's because you're not me: Ema Skye, forensics expert extraordinaire! Try as you might, you won't find the word \"impossible\" in my forensics handbook! Dhurke: I-Is she okay, son? It's like she became an entirely different person. Apollo: Oh, that's just what happens when her forensics switch gets flipped. Ema: With this, identifying the suitcase's owner will be easy as pie! Apollo: Is that fingerprint powder? Ema: That's right. And there's no better time than the present to use it! Here we go! You remember how to do this, right? Apollo: I apply the powder to where I think some prints might be, and blow any excess off? Ema: Exactly. Well, have at it! Apollo: (Hmm... Now where would I expect to find prints on a suitcase?) Examine any fingerprint on stickers closest to keyhole Leads to: \"Hey Ema, I've got a pretty clear print here.\" Examine any fingerprint on handle Ema: This one isn't clear enough for a match. Apollo: Hmm... Where else could someone leave prints behind? Dhurke: Think, son. How might someone handle a suitcase? Start by considering what you do with them. Apollo: Well, besides being wheeled or carried, they can be opened and closed. So, I should look for prints that would be left at those times. Examine any incomplete fingerprint Ema: You'll need to use more powder than that to get a clear print. Examine excess powder Ema: There's still too much powder left. Try blowing some more off. Apollo: Hey Ema, I've got a pretty clear print here. Ema: Okay, now let me know who you think it could belong to. Apollo: (Hmm, who could it be? It would have to be someone who would've paid Dr. Buff a visit.) Compare Datz Are'bal profile Analyzing...Analysis CompleteMatch Found Leads to: \"We have a match!\" Compare anyone else Analyzing...No Match Found Ema: We didn't get a match. Trucy: Any other ideas, Apollo? Apollo: Hmm... Well, we can probably assume the print belongs to the suitcase's owner. (But who could that be? It would have to be someone who would've visited the doctor.) Leads back to profile selection Ema: We have a match! Apollo: Datz... Come to think of it, he did stop by to see the doctor, didn't he? To conclude the orb transfer agreement. Dhurke: So he's the one who forgot his suitcase here. Apollo: Where do you suppose he is now? Dhurke: Haven't heard from him in a while, and he's not answering his phone. Trucy: Wait, you don't think he left his phone inside his suitcase, do you? Dhurke: I wouldn't put it past that knucklehead. Ema: Actually, I think we may have run into him earlier. Apollo: Really? Ema: A suspicious man had been reported in the area, but when one of my officers approached to question him, he took off like a shot. Apollo: What?! Dhurke: Sorry about that. Khura'inese people aren't all like him... I swear. Ema: Well, he's probably still in the village somewhere. Apollo: Maybe he knows something about the orb. Suitcase (subsequent times) Apollo: So this suitcase belongs to Datz. Dhurke: How could he leave something so big behind? Apollo: Because, you know... it's Datz. Talk Dhurke Apollo: Oh, right, I haven't introduced you yet. This is Dhurke. He's from the Kingdom of Khura'in. Ema: All the way from Khura'in, huh? So, what do you do there? Dhurke: I used to practice law, but I'm taking a break from all that. I'm focused now on making Khura'in a better place through... volunteer work. Ema: Volunteer work, huh? How interesting... Apollo: (...Well, it's not technically a lie.) Ema: So, how do you two know each other? Apollo: Oh, um... He's sorta my foster father. Ema: Come again? Trucy: Yeah! And he's Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's real father, too! Ema: Whaaat?! You mean you... and Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... ............I'm so sorry. It seems you've had quite a life. Apollo: (...Guess she's put a few things together.) Ema: Actually, Dhurke, you look kind of... familiar. Have we met before? Dhurke: Um, not that I recall. Apollo: (Great... She must've seen that news report on TV. It will really complicate things if she figures out he's a wanted man.) There are lots of guys who look like him. Sure you're not mistaking him for someone else? Ema: Are there, really? I mean, a middle-aged man with long hair and an eye patch? You don't see that every day. Apollo: W-Well, I'm sure you're just imagining things. Present Study Photo Ema: Maybe it was Dr. Buff's wish to die under a pile of his beloved books. I know I could die happily under a big pile of forensic equipment. Apollo: Well, I'll pass on dying under a big pile of evidence from my past cases. It's all murder weapons and photos of dead bodies. Ema: So, what? Are you saying you don't love your job? Apollo: Being buried in the tools of one's trade is hardly a valid way to assess dedication, Ema. After examining body outline or pile of books, ladder or bookshelves, notebook, Sacred Urn, spiral staircase, and suitcase: Dhurke: It seems the orb isn't here. Apollo: That means Datz might be our only lead at this point. Dhurke: Detective Skye said he might still be here in the village. We should try to find him. May 16Kurain Village ???: Good day to you, citizens of Kurain Village! My name is Paul Atishon, and I want your vote! Apollo: Wow, that's REALLY loud. Trucy: Look, something's coming this way. ???: Paul Atishon, savior of Kurain, has come to-- Ahhh! It's you people! Dhurke: Apollo? What is that strange conveyance coming this way? Staff: Right, left, right, left, HALT! Apollo: (It's one of those... what-do-you-call-'ems? Palanquins...?) ???: So, you finally left Dr. Buff's house! What were you doing there?! ...What a bunch of shady-looking characters. Apollo: (And you aren't?) So I take it you knew the doctor? ???: Heh, what a foolish question. I've memorized the names and faces of the entire electorate here in Kurain. After all, I am the man who's destined to be king of this fine nation someday. Apollo: Um... who are you? (And what do you mean, \"king\"?) Atishon: Ignorant fools. I am THE Paul Atishon. I am a soon-to-be eminent politician -- a man whose name will go down in history. You should be ashamed that you've never heard of me before. Dhurke: Is he really that famous of a politician, Apollo? Apollo: Not that I know of. Atishon: I'm running for a seat on the local council right now. Apollo: (I guess even Jerk Q. Public has to start somewhere.) Atishon: But my election is a sure thing, I'm told. After all, my grandfather was a famous politician with untold influence. In short, I'm the chosen one, the golden boy, the powerhouse of politics! Trucy: ...And rider-of-his-grandfather's-coattails. Atishon: Heh heh heh. Are you blinded by my majesty? Go ahead! Bask in the resplendent glory that is me, the chosen one! Apollo: Um... Sure... Atishon: ...Ah! A pleasant day to you, good people of Kurain! I am Paul Atishon! It's time to reclaim the glory of Kurain, together! A convenience store on every corner, a karaoke bar in every home! A vote for Paul Atishon is a vote for a happier, hopey-er Kurain Village! Old Man: Turn off that infernal racket, you fool! You're a stain on your grandfather's good name! Atishon: Thank you, good sir! Your support is appreciated, as always! Trucy: I guess he's one of those people who only hears what they want to hear. Apollo: ...In other words, he's a model politician. Atishon: Now where was I? Oh right, you were in the doctor's house. Just what in the world were you doing in there? Hmm? Talk Paul Atishon Apollo: Is this what you ride around in when you're campaigning? Atishon: That's right. It's perfect for the narrow roads and steep hills here in this village. It has a top speed of five miles per hour, but it suffers from serious reliability issues. (Changed from [It has a top speed of 5 miles per hour, but it suffers from serious reliability issues.] in the original release) Namely, these imbeciles tire out too quickly. Staff: *cough* *huff, puff* We'll try harder next time, sir! Apollo: (Poor guys... They're exhausted and covered in sweat.) Atishon: The Atishon family has been in politics for generations, even back in the old country. Apollo: Really? Atishon: My grandfather, Abe Atishon, was a prominent member of Congress. And he was born right here in Kurain. There isn't a person here who hasn't heard of him. Apollo: (All I asked about was his palanquin.) Atishon: You must've heard of the Atishons. I'm even reviving our old country campaigning style. Apollo: ...Oh, um... politics aren't really my thing. Trucy? Trucy: I don't recall ever reading about them at school. Atishon: Feh... Young people today. You people really need to pay more attention to politics. The doctor's house Atishon: So, what business did you people have at Dr. Buff's house? Apollo: He was going to transfer ownership of the Founder's Orb to us. It's a sacred relic from the Kingdom of Khura'in. Atishon: The Founder's Orb? So you tried to get your hands on it, did you? Apollo: Wait, what do you know about the orb? Atishon: Heh. I know that it's mine, that's what. Apollo: How do you figure that? Atishon: Because I know it's not the Founder's Orb. Its real name is the Crystal of Ami Fey. Apollo: The Crystal of Ami Fey? Atishon: That's right. It's been passed down for generations in the Atishon family. Until it was stolen, that is. But just when I had zeroed in on the culprit... ...the doctor hid it away and then kicked the bucket. Apollo: So you're saying Dr. Buff stole your family heirloom? (That's not what Dhurke said. Strange...) But I've been told the doctor himself said that... ...he had the \"Founder's Orb.\" Atishon: It's all that weird foreigner's doing! He filled the doctor's head with nonsense! Nonsense like the Crystal of Ami Fey being the Founder's Orb. Apollo: \"Weird foreigner\"? (Could he mean...?) Is this the foreigner you're talking about? Present Datz Are'bal profile Apollo: Atishon: Yes, that's him! Apollo: I thought so. (Now we really have to find Datz.) Leads back to Talk options Present anyone else Apollo: Atishon: Who's that? Wait, I know everyone around here, so this must be a new eligible voter for me! Apollo: Yes, wouldn't that be nice. (Because I certainly wouldn't vote for you. It seems this isn't the person he's talking about. But I can't imagine the doctor had contact with that many foreigners way out here.) Leads back to Talk options Datz (appears after presenting Datz Are'bal profile upon selecting \"The doctor's house\" Talk option) Dhurke: Do you know where this man is now? Atishon: I imagine he's at the Detention Center by now. I called the authorities after I found him hiding in my dog's doghouse. Apollo: Whaaat?! Dhurke: That buffoon... Apollo: Well, at least we know where he is now. Dhurke: Let's head over to the Detention Center and see what he knows about the Founder's Orb. Atishon: So, you really are after my crystal. Apollo: No, we're looking for the Founder's Orb, and we have an agreement to prove it. Atishon: Well, just so you know, you're not going to lay a finger on it. It's mine. And I intend to give it to my benefactor. Apollo: Your... benefactor? Your benefactor (appears after \"Datz\") Athison: My benefactor is ready to support my rise to the pinnacle of the political world. They have immense influence here, you see, and I intend to harness that influence. Apollo: So you're just going to give your family heirloom away to this person? Atishon: That's right. It's a purely political decision. Apollo: And in exchange, your patron will get the people of Kurain to vote for you? Atishon: Heh heh heh. Eminent politicians are skilled at leveraging all of their connections. Apollo: ......... (Isn't it illegal to buy votes?) Well, good luck with that, I guess. Atishon: Heh, you just wait. Paul Atishon will reign supreme someday. Present Attorney's Badge Apollo: Actually, I'm a lawyer. Atishon: Heh heh heh. You're so shallow. Relying on your badge to impress people... What would you be without it? I petty men like you have no sense of self. Real men make their own mark in this world. Apollo: (Says the man who's riding on his grandfather's coattails.) Anything else Apollo: What do you think about this? Atishon: Paul Atishon is the \"squeaky-clean candidate.\" So if you're going to bribe me, try to be a little more subtle about it, would you? Apollo: Huh? I wasn't trying to bribe you. Atishon: \"Don't accept any bribes unless they come in unmarked bills.\" This is but a fraction of the political wisdom my grandfather shared with me. Better luck next time. Apollo: (After a spin cycle or two with those bills, I bet I'D be \"squeaky-clean,\" too.) Wright Anything Agency (after examining body outline or pile of books, ladder or bookshelves, notebook, Sacred Urn, spiral staircase, and suitcase in Kurain Village - Doctor's Study, then visiting Kurain Village) Talk Any ideas? Dhurke: About that Paul Atishon fellow... He's aiming to be a councilman and beyond, as his famous grandfather once was, right? No doubt some would vote for him on the merits of his grandfather's achievements. I see a grim future for Kurain Village if someone like that is able to climb the ranks. Apollo: I wouldn't worry about it. Who in their right mind would vote for him with the way he's campaigning? Dhurke: So the more aggressively he campaigns, the less people will want to vote for him? That makes me want to get out there and help him fail. What to do Apollo: We turned the doctor's study upside down, but never found the orb. Dhurke: Yeah, I didn't expect this to be so hard. Trucy: Well, I think it's fun. It's like a big old treasure hunt! Dhurke: That orb is the key to Khura'in's future, you know. Trucy: Yeah, and our office's future, too! Apollo: (She does realize it's not up for sale, right?) Present Anything else Dhurke: Ah, the old show-'em-and-see-what-they-say tactic. I used to try that whenever I had nothing else to say. Apollo: Who says I have nothing else to say? Dhurke: It's written all over your face. Apollo: Like you have anything to add right now. After clearing all Talk options with Paul Atishon in Kurain Village: May 16Detention Center - Visitor's Room Datz: ......... Dhurke: .........Hey. Datz: Yipes! Apollo: What's he doing under the desk...? Datz: Foul cogs of the corrupt regime! I've nothing to say to you! Dhurke: Datz, it's me, Dhurke. Datz: Oh! Dhurke! You're a sight for sore eyes! I knew you'd come save me! Dhurke: Well, this is another fine mess you've gotten yourself into. Datz: Har har har har har! My bad, my bad! 'Least the grub here's pretty good compared to that prison back home! Ya get three squares plus a place to sleep! Why don't ya join me, Dhurke?! Dhurke: No thanks. They'd just send me back to Khura'in where I'd face immediate execution. Datz: Yeah, I guess that wouldn't be such a good idea. Apollo: (Looks like he's still the same, too.) ...Long time no see, Datz. Datz: Huh? Hey, ya look... kinda familiar... A-A-A-Apollo?! Is it really you, m'boy?! A-to-the-J, all grown up and whatnot! How've ya been?! Apollo: Fine. And you, Datz? You look good, besides the incarceration and all. Datz: ...Pffffff! Haaaaar har har har har! Those horns, AJ! Apollo: Horns? Datz: They've grown up with ya, just like a stag's antlers! I can't take it! Apollo: *sigh* You really haven't changed a bit. Anyway, there's something we needed to talk to you about. Datz: Sure, pull up a chair. I've got all the time in the world. The slammer's like my second home. It's really not so bad once ya get used to it. Trucy: He's rather laid back for someone in police custody. Talk About the orb Apollo: Datz, was what the doctor had really the Founder's Orb? Datz: Absolutely positively! The doc was sure of it! Dhurke: Really? Because someone from the village is calling the Crystal of Ami Fey. He also claims you were filling the doctor's head with lies. Datz: That ain't true! The doc said he was sure it was the real deal. All his fancy research confirmed it was the Founder's Orb. Apollo: So then that Paul Atishon character was lying? Imagine that, a politician who lies... Datz: I bet he wants the orb all to himself! Trucy: Hmm... I wonder who's telling the truth? Datz: Well, take a look at this! It proves the doc believed he had the Founder's Orb! Dhurke: Let me see that. \"I agree to hand over the Founder's Orb to the Defiant Dragons... ...if I will come to no harm.\" Signed, Dr. Archie Buff. Datz: See, I got it all down in writing! Dhurke: But Datz... ...why does it say, \"if I will come to no harm\" at the end here? Trucy: Sounds like he was scared of you. Apollo: Datz, did you threaten the doctor in any way? Datz: No, ya got it all wrong! It was the doc's friend! HE told the old man us rebels were dangerous. It's his fault the doc thought I might hurt him! Apollo: Sounds like the work of that politician. He's really made a mess of things. Orb Transfer Agreement added to the Court Record. About the orb (subsequent times) Apollo: Datz, was what the doctor had really the Founder's Orb? Datz: Absolutely positively! The doc was sure of it! Dhurke: Really? Because someone from the village is calling the Crystal of Ami Fey. He also claims you were filling the doctor's head with lies. Datz: That ain't true! The doc said he was sure it was the real deal. All his fancy research confirmed it was the Founder's Orb. Apollo: So then that Paul Atishon character was lying?

Datz: No, ya got it all wrong! It was the doc's friend! HE told the old man us rebels were dangerous. It's his fault the doc thought I might hurt him! Apollo: Sounds like the work of that politician. He's really made a mess of things. Reason for arrest Dhurke: What have you done now, Datz? Datz: Nothing! I'm innocent, I tell ya! It all started when this dog-faced cop tried to question me! He looked so funny, I started laughing at him. That's when they came after me. But it was hilarious, I tell ya! I mean, a human police dog? How funny is that! Apollo: Right... So what happened after that? Datz: They caught me hiding in a doghouse. Dang pooch ratted me out! I guess that's what I get for laughing at one of his doggy comrades. Apollo: Sounds like the dogs got the last laugh. Dhurke: Datz, weren't you cleared of those jailbreak charges? And your capture by Lady Kee'ra deemed unlawful? Datz: Yeah, but... The cops here don't seem to like me anyway. Apollo: What are the charges this time? Datz: Unauthorized entry, or something like that. They think I'm an illegal alien! And I can't prove otherwise 'cause I lost my passport! Trucy: Is there any way they'd let you go? Datz: Not without my passport... If only I had it! Dhurke, AJ! You gotta find my passport! Apollo: ...All right, we'll find it. (One more thing to add to our to-do list. Now, where might Datz's passport be?) Examine Security camera Apollo: I hate the feeling of being constantly watched. Dhurke: Indeed. Considering my current situation, the less I'm seen, the better. Apollo: Well, it's not like there's an international arrest warrant out for you. Dhurke: True, but I seem to have made quite an international splash with that hijacking stunt. I had to sign a ton of autographs and take a load of selfies before I got to your office. Apollo: Wait, what? Dhurke: Maybe they thought the hijacking was part of some movie's promotion. Guard Apollo: He's completely uninterested in us. Dhurke: That suits me fine. It will only complicate things if I'm recognized. Apollo: Right... You're known as some sort of scary terrorist who fled from Khura'in. Though, in reality, no one would believe you're the real Dhurke of legend anyway. Microphone Apollo: Dhurke, why are you holding that mic? Dhurke: I get this strange urge to speak whenever there's a microphone before me. We, the Defiant Dragons, shall--! Apollo: No, stop! Stop...!!! Present Attorney's Badge Datz: Why, AJ! You've become a fine lawyer in your own right! Apollo: Nah, I still have a lot to learn. Datz: Aw, c'mon, don't be so hard on yourself. If I ever went to trial, I'd definitely want you on my side! Apollo: Knowing you, you'd probably skip town before the trial even started. Founder's Orb or Orb Transfer Agreement Datz: The doc agreed in writing to hand the orb over to me, but he kept stalling, like he didn't trust me or something. Dhurke: That scary mug of yours no doubt frightened him. Datz: Look who's talking! Trucy: Honestly, I think you're both about equally scary looking. Apollo: (Ouch... Both Dhurke and Datz look like they've been stabbed right in the ego.) Anything else Datz: Oh, is that for me!? Apollo: No, I was just showing it to you. Datz: Anything I could use here in the slammer is more than welcome! Apollo: Um, Datz, the guard is giving you some serious side eye. After clearing all Talk options: Datz: Oh! About the orb's whereabouts... Maybe the doc's kid knows something! Apollo: The doctor has a kid? Datz: Yeah... A bit of a shut-in, though. The poor thing's own bedroom has become like a self-imposed prison. Apollo: A shut-in? Sounds like it will be a challenge just to get a conversation going. Guard: Time for your questioning. Follow me. Datz: It must be lunchtime. Today is fried chicken, if I'm not mistaken! Guard: You'll get your lunch IF you behave yourself. Datz: Dhurke, AJ. I'll see ya guys around! Dhurke: Our only lead now is Dr. Buff's kid. But luring a shut-in out is... Apollo: ...Not going to be easy. I know. May 16Kurain Village - Doctor's Study ???: Oh, it's you again. Ema Looking for Mr. Wright? He was just here a second ago. Apollo: He was?! Trucy: What was Daddy doing here? Apollo: Good question. Ema: He said he was looking for something. Apollo: Did he say anything else? Ema: Let me think... Something about how his ride never showed up at the airport. Yes, that was it. Apollo: (I guess Athena really did get lost...) Trucy: But what's Daddy doing all the way out here in the first place? He can't be looking for us since no one told him we'd be here. Apollo: Hmm... Ema: Well, if you're here to take another look around, be my guest. I have other work to do, so if you'll excuse me. Apollo: Of course. Thanks, Ema. Dhurke: First and foremost, we'd better find Datz's passport. We should also have a word with Dr. Buff's child. Trucy: Hey, is it just me... or is there something new in here? Dhurke: ...Oh, you mean that thing? Yeah, we should take a closer look at it, too. Apollo: Let's not forget about Datz's passport. It should be around here somewhere. Examine Suitcase Apollo: Datz's suitcase... Maybe his passport's in there. Trucy: Annggh! It's no good. It's locked tight. Apollo: We should've asked him for the key. Drone Apollo: What's this? A model helicopter? Trucy: Don't you know anything, Apollo? It's a drone! They're all the rage right now. I bet it belongs to the doctor's kid. Dhurke: We need to ask them about the orb's whereabouts. Apollo: Yeah, but luring out a shut-in isn't going to be easy. Any other point of interest Apollo: Nothing new here. Let's go look somewhere else. After examining suitcase and drone: Apollo: What are we going to do about Datz's passport? It's probably right there inside his suitcase, but we can't get it open. Trucy: Why don't I take it over to Datz so he can unlock it? That way, you guys can continue looking for the orb. Apollo: Good thinking, Trucy! Trucy: Okay, here I go! ...Huh? What the...? Hrrgh...! This thing weighs a ton! Apollo: Let me try. ............Jeez, how can a suitcase be so heavy? Is it filled with bricks or something? Dhurke: Knowing Datz, he probably packed his dumbbells in there. It's certainly much too heavy to lug all the way to the detention center. Here, let me take a crack at that lock. Apollo: What, are you going to pick it? *click* *click, click* *click* *click* Dhurke: There you go. Apollo: That was fast. Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha! A lock like that is child's play to me. Especially after all the wrongly imprisoned compatriots I've busted out over the years. Apollo: You've sure seen a lot of action for an ex-lawyer. Dhurke: Aaand here we go. Datz's passport. Trucy: I'll take it over to him. Apollo: Thanks, Trucy. Trucy: No problem! Now you guys enjoy some quality father-son treasure hunting time, okay? See you later! Apollo: (There she goes. I wish she wouldn't make such a big deal out of our little \"family\" situation.) Dhurke: Father-son time, eh? Hmm... Been ages since we've had a father-son talk, huh, son? Apollo: Yeah, well over a decade. Dhurke: So, Apollo, um... how've you been? Apollo: Oh, uh... Fine. I'm fine, I guess. Dhurke: Is that so? Fine, you say? Well, fine is fine by me! Good to hear! Apollo: ...Um, okay. .................. Dhurke: ........................... Apollo: ............ (Umm... So what do we talk about now...?) Dhurke: ...Hm? Get down! Hit the dirt, son! Apollo: Huh? What the--? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! .........Unngh......Oof... ......... Dhurke: Speak to me, son! Say something! Apollo: ......Ooh... Th-that smarts... ???: Youuuu maggots! Whattaya think yer doin', invading Buff airspace?! It'll be a scorching day in Siberia before you get past me, ya yellow-bellied yahoos! Apollo: Whoa! ...It can talk?! What kind of drone is this, anyw... ...AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYY! ???: Drone, nothin'! That's Sergeant Buff to you, soldier! You got that, you lowly grunts?! Apollo: Oww... What the who now...?! Dhurke: Buff? Sounds like the doctor's son is behind the controls. Apollo: He's controlling this thing? Dhurke: Apollo, let's play along for now. At least until we can get the information we need out of him. Apollo: G-Got it. Um... Sergeant Buff? Sarge: Sergeant Buff, sir! You forgot to say, \"sir\"! Ain't you never seen a war movie before?! Apollo: Oh, right. Let me try that again. Sergeant Buff, sir! Sarge: Better. Much better. Now, state your name, unit, and rank, soldier! Apollo: Oh, um, I'm Apollo Justice. I serve at the Wright Anything Agency. And my rank is, um... fledgling lawyer? ...Sir! Sarge: Affirmative, Private Justice. Apollo: P-Private? Sarge: Listen up, diaper baby! Your commanding officer's orders are absolute! Disobedience means a one-way trip to the firing squad! Do I make myself clear?! Apollo: Oh, um... sir! Yes, sir! Sarge: Good, good, we might make a man out of you yet, private! Now for you, Cyclops! Dhurke: Huh? ...Oh, you want my name, unit, and rank, too? Um, I'm Dhurke Sahdmadhi. I command the rebel group the Defiant Dragons, and my rank is... um... leader, sir! Sarge: Excellent! Welcome aboard, Komandir Dhurke! Wait a second! What's with that ridiculous mop you call a head? Soldiers should be clean cut! Dhurke: S-Sorry, but this is my signature look. I'm not going to-- WHOOOOOOOOOA! Fine, fine! I'll get a haircut before we ship out! Sarge: Listen up, you! It's kill-or-be-killed out on that battlefield. No place for leave-in conditioners. All you've got is your life, and you're lucky to have that! Apollo: (He's oddly obsessed with field survival for someone who never goes outdoors...) Dhurke: This is going to be harder than I thought, son. Examine Anything Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Sarge: Don't let me catch you stepping out of line again. Apollo: (...Guess I'd better play along and ask what he wants.) Talk Sergeant Buff Apollo: Um, are you controlling that drone from your room, sir? Sarge: Affirmative! But I can see everything you do from here, so... Teeen-HUT, soldier! Wipe that stupid look off your face! I'm going to whip you sheltered peaceniks into shape! Apollo: (With what? Your \"charming\" personality?) Dhurke: Look, it's got a camera and speakers, too. Sarge: And that's not all, Komandir! With these arms, I can cook and clean, too! Speaking of which... Private Justice! You're on latrine duty! Snap to it, on the double! Apollo: ...*sigh*... As if I don't see enough of the toilet back at the office. Sarge's Drone added to the Court Record. Dhurke: That thing's pretty handy. Us Defiant Dragons could use one of those. Sarge: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Yes, it is a fine piece of hardware, isn't it? I modified it especially for siege defense! Apollo: Siege defense...? You mean how you won't leave your room? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! Sarge: Holing up in a stronghold to defend against an enemy is an age-old military tactic! A timeless strategy still applicable in modern warfare! I hope you're not trying to mock the wisdom of my forefathers! Apollo: I-I... I meant no offense. It was just an observation. Sarge: So the greenhorn who ain't even discharged a firearm's got something to say, does he?! Apollo: S-Sorry, sorry! It won't happen again, sir! Sarge: Darn tootin'. Now, state your intentions, soldier. Sergeant Buff (subsequent times) Apollo: Um, are you controlling that drone from your room, sir? Sarge: Affirmative! But I can see everything you do from here, so... Teeen-HUT, soldier! Wipe that stupid look off your face! I'm going to whip you sheltered peaceniks into shape! Apollo: (With what? Your \"charming\" personality?) Dhurke: Look, it's got a camera and speakers, too. Sarge: And that's not all, Komandir! With these arms, I can cook and clean, too! Speaking of which... Private Justice! You're on latrine duty! Snap to it, on the double! Apollo: ...*sigh*... As if I don't see enough of the toilet back at the office. Dhurke: That thing's pretty handy. Us Defiant Dragons could use one of those. Sarge: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Yes, it is a fine piece of hardware, isn't it? I modified it especially for siege defense! Apollo: Siege defense...? You mean how you won't leave your room? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! Sarge: Holing up in a stronghold to defend against an enemy is an age-old military tactic! A timeless strategy still applicable in modern warfare! I hope you're not trying to mock the wisdom of my forefathers! Apollo: I-I... I meant no offense. It was just an observation. Sarge: So the greenhorn who ain't even discharged a firearm's got something to say, does he?! Apollo: S-Sorry, sorry! It won't happen again, sir! Sarge: Darn tootin'. Now, state your intentions, soldier. Location of the orb (appears after \"Sergeant Buff\") Apollo: We had an agreement with your father. He had promised to hand over the Founder's Orb to us. Sarge: What?! Papa promised you that?! Dhurke: He did. But he died before he could tell us where it's hidden. Now we have no idea where it is. Sarge: .................. ...Oh. *sniffle* Apollo: Hm? Sarge: P-Papa... Why...? Why'd you have to die? Dhurke: It was an unfortunate accident. And I'm sorry for your loss. Apollo: If it helps at all, I know how you feel, Sergeant Bu-- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! What'd I do nowww?! Sarge: Y-You insignificant maggot! What would an unseasoned rookie like you know about how I feel?! First I lost Mama... and now I've lost Papa! Apollo: You lost your mother, too? Sarge: She's been gone for some time now. I'm... I'm all alone now. All alone... *sniffle* Dhurke: ...Sergeant Buff, would you tell us a little more about what happened to your mother? Your mother (appears after \"Location of the orb\") Sarge: Mama passed away about six months ago. We were still living in our apartment in the city. Back then, I had yet to engage in my siege defense strategy. Apollo: (In other words, something caused him to withdraw from the world.) Sarge: ...It was arson. It happened so suddenly... and before we knew it, our apartment was a sea of flames. Mama and I were trapped inside. But help never came. So Mama cradled me in her arms... ...kicked out a window... and jumped! Apollo: She did what?! Sarge: She was like a walkin', talkin' medal of valor, my mama was. She delivered me safely to terra firma with a perfectly executed PLF. It's a five-point landing technique used by paratroopers to land safely on the ground. Apollo: (She sounds like a superhero or something.) Sarge: But from that height, she suffered massive injuries in order to protect me. She... She died so that I could live! AHHHHHHHHHHHH! MAMAAAAAAAAAAAA!!! Apollo: I... I don't know what to say... Dhurke: And the person who started the fire? Sarge: He was immediately apprehended. They say he was standing outside laughing while the building burned. Dhurke: At least justice was served. I hope that brought you some solace. Sarge: I've lost both my parents now. You can't possibly know how I feel! *sniffle* *sob* Mama... Papa... Apollo: (Poor kid. It's hard losing both your parents at such a young age. He must really feel alone now.) Dhurke: Apollo... I imagine you know what he's going through. Apollo: I do? Dhurke: The road to recovery begins by talking to someone who's suffered the same hardship. I know you have something that shows you understand. Present Anything (before clearing \"Your mother\" Talk option) Sarge: What insubordination! Apollo: ARRRRRRAGH! Sarge: Petty trinkets have no place in Buff's army, soldier! Now drop and give me twenty! Apollo: (Sheesh... At least let me show the evidence before you shoot it down...) Photo of My Father (after clearing \"Your mother\" Talk option) Leads to: \"Um, sergeant, sir. Would you please take a look at this?\" Apollo: Um, sergeant, sir. Would you please take a look at this? Sarge: What do we have here? Apollo: It's a photo of my father. I wasn't even a year old when he died... in a fire. Sarge: What?! Dhurke: And like your mother, he died in an arsonist's blaze. But in his final moments, he managed to save his infant son. Sarge: P-Private Justice, you've suffered a loss just like mine. Apollo: I have... And that's why I know how you feel. Sarge: B-But... you still have your mother, don't you?! Apollo: No, I lost her, too. Sarge: What?! Apollo: She disappeared after the fire. I don't know if she's still alive or dead. Heck, I don't even know what she looks like. Sarge: Wow... Dhurke: Sergeant Buff, his experience is very much like your own. If anyone can understand the sadness in your heart, it's him. Sarge: Rrrr... Nnngh... .............................. ATTEEEEEENSHUN!!! I salute you, Comrade Justice! You are no longer a private in the Buff Army! Henceforth, you will be a corporal! Apollo: Corporal? Dhurke: Congratulations on your promotion, Corporal Justice! Apollo: ...I'm just glad that seemed to cheer him up a bit. Sarge: Now, comrade, let's toast to your new stripes! And call me Sarge! Don't be shy! We're a band of brothers now! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Dhurke: Now's our chance, corporal! Ask him about the Founder's Orb. Apollo: (Dhurke's getting waaaaay too much of a kick out of this.) Examine Ladder or bookshelves Apollo: Sarge, sir, do you ever read these books? Sarge: Why, of course! Soldiers must have extensive knowledge, as well as fighting prowess. I'm learning all I can each and every day in preparation for the big battle! Apollo: The big battle? Sarge: Um, you know... for when I go back to school. I'll need to be up to date on every subject. Stuff like... y'know, the latest comics and Hollywood gossip... Apollo: Oh, I see... (What about reading, writing and arithmetic?) Well, I'm rooting for you, Sarge! Sarge: Th-Thanks. I'll try my best. Computer Apollo: This computer could provide some useful information. Drat. It's password protected. Dhurke, you're good at getting into places you're not supposed to. Dhurke: Don't look at me. I don't know the first thing about computers. Sarge: Ha ha ha ha ha! Leave it to me! A modern day warrior must be well-versed in technology... and have a mean, mean pride! After all, he who controls information, controls the battlefield! *click clack click clack click clack* Sarge: Aaaaand I'm in! Apollo: Looks like modern day warriors have mean, mean keyboard skills, too. Dhurke: Okay, let's see what we can find. *click clack click clack click clack* Dhurke: Oh, what's this...? An e-mail message? Now this is interesting. It's a research report to whoever asked the doctor to study the orb. Sarge: Here, I put the data on this! Take it and use it well, soldier! E-Mail added to the Court Record. Computer (subsequent times) Apollo: The doctor's computer. It contains an e-mail detailing the progress of his research. Dhurke: I wonder who he prepared the report for. Glasses Apollo: Are these the doctor's? Sarge: Yes, those are Papa's reading glasses. He said he'd been having trouble reading lately. But those glasses seemed to help. Dhurke: Reading glasses, eh? I'll just hold on to these. Apollo: ...Dhurke. Don't tell me you're having trouble reading, too? Dhurke: Perish the thought! ...I-I just don't want to leave any stone unturned. Doctor's Reading Glasses added to the Court Record. Raincoat Apollo: It's a raincoat... Hm...? It's a bit wet, and there's fresh mud on it... That must mean someone wore it recently. Dhurke: Indeed. Maybe even as recently as last night. Apollo: Sarge, did it rain here last night? Sarge: Negative. There wasn't a cloud in the sky. Apollo: Hmm... Then how did this raincoat get all muddy and wet? Sarge: When I saw it last evening, it looked pretty clean and dry to me. Apollo: That means it got like this later at night. Dhurke: Good eye, son. This may very well turn out to be a vital clue. Raincoat added to the Court Record. Raincoat (subsquent times) Apollo: It's a raincoat... Hm...? It's a bit wet, and there's fresh mud on it... That must mean someone wore it recently. Dhurke: Indeed. Maybe even as recently as last night. Apollo: Sarge, did it rain here last night? Sarge: Negative. There wasn't a cloud in the sky. Apollo: Hmm... Then how did this raincoat get all muddy and wet? Sarge: When I saw it last evening, it looked pretty clean and dry to me. Apollo: That means it got like this later at night. Dhurke: Good eye, son. This may very well turn out to be a vital clue. Statue EX-TER-MI-NATE. EX-TER-MI-NATE. DES-TROY ALL HU-MANS. Apollo: What's this thing's problem...? Sarge: It's an OOPArt -- an our-of-place artifact. Papa won it in an online auction. Apollo: An online auction? Sarge: Yes, he said it's an alien weapon that destroyed an entire ancient civilization. Apollo: (...Where do I even start with an explanation like that?) Sacred Urn Apollo: This urn with \"Ami\" painted on it looks really old. But I don't think it's going to provide any info we need. Spiral staircase Apollo: Is your room upstairs, Sarge? Sarge: Yes, it's the one at the end of the hall. Dhurke: What do you say you come out, so we can enjoy a snack together? Sarge: B-But... Dhurke: I promise we won't bite! Sarge: ...............If you insist... ...then I'm not going to talk to you anymore! Dhurke: No, wait! Apollo: Dhurke, you'd better apologize quick. Dhurke: ...I'm sorry for pushing. Sarge: V-Very well. As long as you don't do it again, I'll let it slide this one time. Suitcase Apollo: It's Datz's suitcase. It's full of survival gear and questionable souvenirs. But we already got his passport, so we can leave it be for now. Shoe shelves Apollo: It's a shoe cubby. Hmm, these shoes look like they belong to Sarge and his dad. ...Ah, these boots here are a little damp! Dhurke: And it looks like there's something inside this one. Apollo: Maybe Doctor Buff wore them last night. Dhurke: They might lead us to where he hid the orb. Let's take a closer look. Examine outsole Apollo: There's a question mark on the bottom of this boot. Sarge: Papa had those custom-made for his archeological fieldwork. He had the soul of an adventurer. Dhurke: This boot had the \"sole\" of an adventurer, too. Examine residue on insole (before examining hook-and-loop fastener straps) Apollo: Something's giving off a soft glow inside this boot. But it's too dark in there to see what it is. Examine hook-and-loop fastener straps Apollo: We might get a better look inside if we undid these straps. Examine residue on insole (after examining hook-and-loop fastener straps) Leads to: \"It looks like some kind of glowing moss.\" Apollo: It looks like some kind of glowing moss. Dhurke: It could've come from wherever the doctor went last night. Must've gotten in with some of that mud. Apollo: It might be worth looking into... ...if it'll help us pinpoint where the doctor hid the orb. Glowing Moss added to the Court Record. Shoe shelves (subsequent times) Apollo: There's some glowing moss inside this boot. Dhurke: I'm willing to bet it got there from wherever the doctor went last night. Talk Location of the orb Apollo: Sarge, sir. Do you have any idea where the orb might be? Sarge: It was here in Papa's study until last night. But he said he was going to go hide it somewhere. He mentioned something about a shady character being after it. Apollo: Where do you think he could've hidden it? Sarge: Hmm... Somewhere in the village, I'd guess. He said he'd found a suitable hiding place for it. Apollo: So, it was here last night. That is, until he went out to hide it somewhere in the village. The only question is where? Dhurke: Maybe he left some clue here in his study. Let's search the place again. Apollo: (We should also find out more about Dr. Buff. It might steer us toward the hiding place.) Doctor Buff (appears after \"Location of the orb\") Apollo: So, Sarge, what was your father like? Sarge: Papa was as king as Mama was courageous. His whole reason for moving to the countryside was for me. Apollo: What do you mean? Sarge: I initiated my siege defense strategy after Mama died. Papa was so worried about me, he moved us here to the countryside. He thought the fresh air, blue skies, and natural surroundings might alter my tactics. Dhurke: What a fine father. Sarge: He even quit his position at the university to move here. Apollo: He did? Sarge: He did. He gave up his beloved research position just for me! \"A parent must be prepared to sacrifice everything for his child.\" That's what Papa said! Dhurke: ...Well, I'm feeling about two inches tall right now. Sarge: There's no one in the world I respected more than him. But that just makes his passing all the more devastating. *sniffle, sniffle* Papa, may you continue your beloved research up there with the angels! Present Attorney's Badge Sarge: What's that? Apollo: It's my attorney's badge, sir! Sarge: You mean like a medal?! What act of valor earned you such an honor? Apollo: I rescued my clients from those who would brand them as guilty, sir! Sarge: A heroic act, indeed! Apollo: Thank you for your kind words, sir! (This whole \"sir\" thing is getting real old, real quick.) Photo of My Father Sarge: Corporal Justice... you shoulder a bitter past. Apollo: You've been through quite a lot yourself, Sarge. Sarge: ...Corporal, if I may... um... Apollo: Yes? Sarge: ...Well... um... it doesn't have to be that often, but... W-W-Would you mind coming over from time to time? Apollo: You want me to visit you? Sarge: O-Only if you want to, of course! Apollo: ...Sure. I'll come by, and I'll even bring along my coworkers, Sarge. Sarge: R-Really?! Yaaaaaay! Our band of  brothers continues to grow in rank! Ha ha ha ha! Dhurke: ...Nice work, son. Glad to see you haven't changed one bit. Apollo: (What's that supposed to mean?) Study Photo or Research Notes Sarge: Why...? Why did Papa have to fall in battle? Apollo: (He's putting on a brave face, but he's still just a child.) Sarge: In honor of Papa's heroic sacrifice...  let us march on, comrade! To victory! Apollo: Huh?! I-I mean, sir! Yes, sir! Dhurke: Are you two seriously bent on waging war against that bookcase? Sarge's Drone Apollo: It looks like you can do everything by yourself. Sarge: Indeed! I can even cook and build things whenever I want! Apollo: So there's really no reason for you to leave your room, huh. Sarge: Yes, but there is still one gaping hole in my siege defense. ...Going to the bathroom. Apollo: When nature calls, it's best not to fight it. Sarge: Yes, all great tacticians will say never wage a battle you have no hope of winning. Anything else Apollo: Please take a look at this. Sarge: Let me ask you something, Corporal Justice! How does that aid you on the battlefield?! Apollo: Um, well, if you count the courtroom as a battlefield, it's a fairly useful weapon. Sarge: Good answer! A military man must know his weapons inside and out! Keep up the good work, corporal! Apollo: S-Sir, yes, sir! (I guess that's all he has to say about that.) After clearing \"Doctor Buff\" Talk option and examining computer, glasses, raincoat, and shoe shelves: Apollo: Okay, let's go over what we've learned so far. Wherever it was that Dr. Buff went, he needed a raincoat. And it was somewhere where this glowing moss grows. Any ideas where that might be, Sarge? Sarge: Negative, comrade. I hate to say my intel's a little thin on this one. I've been occupied with my siege defense strategy ever since we moved to the village. Dhurke: Well, son, it seems we have no other choice. We'll have to ask the locals if they know of a place like that. Wright Anything Agency Trucy: Ah! Apollo, Mr. Dhurke! Did you have some quality father-son time together? Talk Any ideas? Dhurke: That poor child... How is he going to survive all on his own? Apollo: Yeah, it's not like he can go out grocery shopping on his own. We should drop off some food later. Dhurke: No, that would only make it worse. We should be encouraging him to come out on his own. Once his food runs out, he'll have to leave the house if he wants to eat. Apollo: Talk about your old-school siege tactics. Sounds more like you want to starve him out... What to do Apollo: Um... Dhurke: Yes? What is it? Apollo: ............ Dhurke: ............ Apollo: (Talk about an awkward silence. I have no idea what to say.) ............ (Yeah... I've got nothing.) Dhurke: Aw, come on, son! Don't tell me you've got nothing! May 16Kurain Village Apollo: Ugh. It feels like somebody's watching me, and it's really creeping me out. Oh, it's just Paul Atishon's campaign posters. When did he put these up? (Whatever. I've got more important things to be paying attention to.) Dhurke: What great weather! It really lifts the spirits. I know! After our little treasure hunt, what do you say we go hunting, son? Apollo: Hunting? We used to do that a lot... didn't we? Dhurke: Just look at that mountain. I bet there are some feisty wild boars up there! Apollo: I... think I'll pass... but thanks. Dhurke: Oh, so hunting's a no-go. Um, well... I guess that wild boar stew will have to wait, then. .........Hm? Apollo, something seems different from the last time we were here. Apollo: Uh... You mean the posters? Dhurke: No, not those. Apollo: (What's he talking about...? Guess I should take a look around myself.) Examine Paul Atishon campaign posters Apollo: When did Paul Atishon have a chance to put up all these election posters? Old Man: That fool keeps stickin' 'em on our houses! He's a disgrace to his distinguished heritage! Apollo: He's doing this without permission? Fey Manor Apollo: A thatched roof... First time I've ever seen one in real life. Dhurke: It looks just like the traditional thatched roofs they use in Japan. All we need now are some samurai with topknots, a few ninjas, and a cuddly mascot. Apollo: When was the last time you were in Japan? Bus stop Apollo: (A phone booth and a bus stop made of wood. They both look really old. You hardly ever see phone booths in the city anymore.) Dhurke: Apollo... what's this glass box for? Apollo: (I guess you hardly see them in Khura'in, too.) Mountains Dhurke: Seeing those mountains really takes me back. I remember when we used to live high in the mountains to escape from the government. Apollo: So, you don't live there anymore? Dhurke: Nope. I needed a more convenient place to lead the revolution from. But that old mountain hut is still there. Apollo: (Man, I miss that hut...) Dhurke: What, are you getting homesick, Apollo? You can come on back to Khura'in anytime, you know? Apollo: N-No, no, I'm fine. Besides, I've got a lot on my plate here... Kurain Boulder Apollo: There's a big boulder towering into the sky over there. According to the sign, it's called the \"Kurain Boulder.\" It also says that a spirit dwells within it. Hmm... A rock with a spirit in it? Dhurke: It's called animism -- the belief that spirits dwell within inanimate objects. They've probably enshrined this boulder as a sacred object. Their tradition of worshipping such objects is similar to our tradition in Khura'in. Apollo: I-Interesting... (Who knew Dhurke could make sense every once in a while?) Canvas Leads to: \"What do we have here?\" Apollo: What do we have here? It looks like an unfinished picture... like something a little kid might paint. Dhurke: Hmm, you're right. But I can't quite tell what it's of. Apollo: I think it's supposed to be nighttime, but what's that thing on the left? Dhurke: Um... A monster, or some kind of alien, perhaps? In any case, it's a pretty poor excuse for a drawing. Apollo: Well, what did you expect from a little kid? ???: A... little kid...? Apollo: Huh? Oh, it's you, Pearl! Pearl: Why, Mr. Apollo, is that you? What a pleasant surprise! It's been quite some time. How have you been? Apollo: Fine, thanks. You're looking good, too, Pearl. Dhurke: Aren't you going to introduce me, son? Apollo: Of course. This is Pearl Fey. She's a spirit medium here in Kurain Village. Pearl, this is Dhurke, my umm... client. Pearl: Hello, sir. Pleased to meet you. If there is anything I can do to help, please let me know. Dhurke: Nice to meet you, too. And what a polite little girl you are! Pearl: ...Um, actually... I'm a high schooler. Dhurke: Whoops! Sorry about that! So, you're a spirit medium? Does that mean you can channel spirits, then? Pearl: Yes. I'm still in training, though. But I'm well-versed in the art of spirit channeling. Dhurke: Well now, isn't that something! I mean, back in my country, our little princess hasn't channeled a single spirit yet! Pretty impressive, young lady! Pearl: Oh, but compared to Mystic Maya, there is so much more I must learn! Apollo: Mystic Maya? Oh, right, Maya Fey... Mr. Wright's former courtroom assistant. He told me all about her. She's a spirit medium, too, if memory serves. Pearl: Yes, she's an amazing medium. And soon, she'll be the next lead of the Fey clan, too! Apollo: (Mediums and spirit channeling... I've heard all about it from Mr. Wright. He said that mediums will even physically become the person they're channeling. I wonder if even little Pearl would turn into a hulking giant if she hand to channel one...) Pearl: I hope you don't mind me asking, but what brings you all the way out here, Mr. Apollo? Apollo: Oh, just a small matter to take care of. Pearl: ...Wait, would it happen to be the matter Mr. Edgeworth is looking into? Apollo: Prosecutor Edgeworth? What's he doing here? Pearl: Oh, so it's a different matter, then? Because I just saw him a moment ago. He appeared to be searching for something. Apollo: Oh? Hmm... (Mr. Edgeworth is a friend of Mr. Wright's, and the district's chief prosecutor. Why would HE be here in Kurain? Well, no point obsessing over it.) Come to think of it, you live here in Kurain Village, don't you, Pearl? Pearl: Yes, I was born and raised here. Dhurke: This is perfect, Apollo. Let's ask the young lady if she knows where the doctor might have gone last night. Apollo: I was thinking the exact same thing. (Maybe I should show her what we found in the doctor's study.) Examine Paul Atishon campaign posters Pearl: Honestly! Why does he keep putting these up? And on people's houses, no less! Apollo: That's got to violate some campaigning law or something... Here, Pearl, I'll help you take them down. Apollo: Whew... Why did he have to put up so many... Pearl: Yeah... And it won't be long before he puts more up. It's really driving me crazy. Dhurke: Why don't you scribble something on them? You know, just some harmless graffiti? Pearl: ...Actually, that's just what I was thinking when I was sketching. Apollo: ...Why don't you join us for lunch at the office sometime? It'll get you away from all this. House Pearl: This is Fey Manor. Mystic Maya lives here. I hope she's doing well... Apollo: (Oh right. Ms. Fey's off studying and training in Khura'in.) Mountains Apollo: There's a lush, green mountain in the distance there. Pearl: It's home to a variety of animals. They sometimes come down to the village. I've seen foxes, badgers, and even bears. Apollo: B-Bears? Dhurke: Well, one would certainly never go hungry around here. Pearl: The poor animals! They are not for hunting or eating! Understand?! Dhurke: But badger and bear meat are so good... Canvas Dhurke: This picture looks like something you might've painted when you were little, son. Apollo: I think I would've done a little better than this. Pearl: ......... Canvas (after perceiving) Apollo: On closer inspection, there's more to this picture than meets the eye. Dhurke: Son, didn't you ever learn that honesty is the best policy? Apollo: Way to go, Dhurke! I was trying to get us out of the hole we dug ourselves into earlier! Talk Kurain Village Dhurke: What a peaceful place. Ahh... Nothing beats mountain air. Pearl: Many of the villagers have left for the city, but I just love it here. Blue skies, lush forests, star-filled skies at night, and fireflies in the summer. Plus, the big, beautiful, blue ocean is just beyond that mountain! Dhurke: The ocean?! What do you say we go for a swim, son? Apollo: ...Oh, um... I think I'll pass. (Besides, I can't swim.) ...Um, Pearl? Kurain Village is like, \"the home of spirit mediums,\" right? Pearl: Yes, and I'm a part of a long line of mediums. Apollo: I've never seen a channeling before, but... ...is it possible to channel the spirit of anyone who's passed away? Pearl: No, not just anyone. You must know their face and true name. Apollo: Really? You can channel a spirit just by knowing their face and name? That's an amazing ability. Pearl: It is, but it can only be learned by those with a gift occurring in certain bloodlines... ...and years of intense training. At present, Mystic Maya and I are the only ones in our village who can channel spirits. Dhurke: Looks like spirit mediums are highly valued here, much like they are back in Khura'in. Pearl: I heard there used to be many more of us a long time ago... ...but now, we are in very short supply. Most of the women nowadays don't want to stay; they want the thrill of the big city. Apollo: Yeah, well, you guys aren't exactly close to any shopping malls or nightclubs out here. But what about you? Are you NOT interested in things like that? Pearl: W-Who, me? Well, I... I wouldn't mind a new outfit or two, and, well... Oh, never mind. Apollo: It's okay, Pearl. You are at that age, after all. Paul Atishon (appears after \"Kurain Village\") Apollo: Oh! We met this weirdo earlier named Paul Atishon. Do you know anything about him? Pearl: Yes, he's been campaigning a lot around here lately. And the noise he's been making has become quite a problem. People are especially upset that he's campaigning at all hours of the night and day. Dhurke: Hmm, well... The local police should arrest him for disturbing the peace. Pearl: Unfortunately, there's little they can do because the Atishon family is so powerful. Apollo: (...Well, isn't HE the proverbial pampered provincial prince.) He seems pretty intent on winning here in Kurain. Is there some special reason why? Pearl: I'm not sure, but I have an idea. The spirit mediums of Kurain once held considerable sway in the political world. Judging by his slogan, maybe that's what he's after. Apollo: Great, so he's just another politician seeking powerful connections... Dhurke: The ability to commune with the dead gives comfort to those anxious about the future. Tiny Khura'in has preserved its independence by the queen's power of spirit channeling. It must play a similar role in this village. Pearl: Yes. Even today, many here revere those with spirit medium blood flowing in their veins. Apollo: So basically, as Paul Atishon's benefactor goes, so goes the whole village? (Who is this benefactor? Who could hold this much sway over Kurain Village?) Where the doctor went (appears after presenting Glowing Moss) Apollo: Pearl... Do you have any idea where Dr. Buff might've gone last night? Pearl: Umm... Well... Apollo: ......... Pearl: ...Uhh, about that... ...All I know is Dr. Buff was somewhere on Mt. Mitama. BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: ...! (My bracelet...! It's reacting! Which means Pearl is hiding something from me.) Present Bracelet Pearl: All I know is Dr. Buff was somewhere on Mt. Mitama. Percieve twitching left thumb on \"Mt. Mitama.\" Apollo: Apollo: Pearl, you seem anxious around the topic of Mt. Mitama. I could tell because you'd rub your thumb over a splotch of dried paint as you said it. Pearl: Oh! U-Um, well...! Apollo: That nighttime painting is yours, isn't it? Pearl: .........! ...This is so embarrassing. As you saw, I'm not a very good artist. But that picture has nothing to do with Dr. Buff! Apollo: I'm not so sure about that. In fact, I'm going to guess that while you were out here painting last night... ...you actually saw the good doctor heading out to Mt. Mitama from the bus stop. Pearl: N-No! I-I didn't see anything like that! I swear! Apollo: ...No, I'm positive you saw the doctor. After all, he's right here in your picture. Present human-like figure Apollo: Leads to: \"Y-You think that's the doctor?\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: See? Isn't the doctor right there? Pearl: Really? That doesn't look like him to me. Apollo: Well, I guess it IS pretty abstract. Pearl: Oh... Is it really that hard to make out? Er, what I mean is, it has nothing to do with Dr. Buff! After all, I never even saw him that night! Leads back to: \"...No, I'm positive you saw the doctor. After all, he's right here in your picture.\" Pearl: Y-You think that's the doctor? I may not be a very good artist, but at least I know how to draw a person! Apollo: Okay, if this isn't a person, then what is it? Pearl: Er... Th-That's a... a rain spirit! Apollo: ......... Pearl: .................. Apollo: ...Um, and what's a rain spirit doing at a bus stop? Pearl: Oh, umm, rain spirits have places to go, too! Apollo: ........ (This is getting ridiculous.) Sorry, Pearl, but you're not a very good liar. That is Dr. Buff, and this piece of evidence proves it! Present Raincoat Apollo: Leads to: \"This is the raincoat we found in the doctor's study.\" Present anything else Apollo: Pearl: The only thing I'm guilty of is being a terrible artist. But you're taking advantage of that to claim the picture is something it's not! Apollo: N-No no, it's... (...totally like that, but...) Pearl: That isn't a person! It's a rain spirit, I tell you! Apollo: No, Pearl, that isn't a rain spirit. Leads back to: \"That is Dr. Buff, and this piece of evidence proves it!\" Apollo: This is the raincoat we found in the doctor's study. It's still wet and muddy, so we know that someone wore it last night. Now, let's see how this pattern is the same as the \"rain spirit\" in your picture? Pearl: ...Ah! Apollo: You didn't see a rain spirit last night. You saw Dr. Buff wearing this raincoat! Pearl: Ah! ...I... I'm sorry. I know I'm not supposed to lie, but... Leads back to Talk options Percieve wrong area Apollo: Apollo: Pearl, you seem uneasy about something. Pearl: Anyone would feel uneasy being stared at like that! Apollo: Huh? But I...! Dhurke: I'd be unnerved, too. I mean, your eyes are practically popping out of your head. Apollo: I-I get it. I'll tone it down a little. (Guess I was wrong.) Leads back to Talk options Where the doctor went (after perceiving) Pearl: I'm sorry I didn't tell you before, Mr. Apollo, but I did see the doctor last night. Apollo: It's all right. Just, please, tell me everything you know. Pearl: ...Of course. I was painting out here last night... when the doctor came up to the bus stop. He was wearing a raincoat, even though it wasn't raining, and a helmet with a light on it. Apollo: Sounds like he was well-prepared for something. Pearl: I know. That's why I asked him if he was going off exploring again. He looked startled, like he hadn't noticed me there. And then, he suddenly said... \"Please don't tell anyone you saw me here.\" Apollo: Why would he want to silence you like that? Dhurke: Something must've happened to spook him. And he didn't want anyone to know where he was going to hide the orb. Apollo: But where could he have been going dressed like that? Pearl: My best guess is a cave somewhere on Mt. Mitama. I heard there's a cave there where mediums of the Kurain tradition went to train long ago. Legend has it, there are some sort of mystical ruins in there. Apollo: Mystical ruins? Sounds like the exact sort of place an archeologist might go. Present Attorney's Badge Pearl: Hee hee. Seeing you present your badge like that... ...reminds me of when I used to investigate cases alongside Mr. Nick. Apollo: You used to help Mr. Wright all the time, I hear. Pearl: That I did! Doing so helped me expand mu horizons beyond this tiny little village. So please, Mr. Apollo! If there's anything I can help you with, you just let me know! Apollo: I will. (What I'd really like is her help with cleaning the office again.) Glowing Moss Apollo: Pearl, do you have any idea where this moss might grow? Pearl: That looks like... Mitama Moss. It grows on Mt. Mitama, and gives off a soft glow in the dark. Apollo: Mt. Mitama? Pearl: See that mountain over there? That's Mt. Mitama. Dhurke: And how would one get there? Pearl: You can take a bus from that bus stop over there. ...Um, may I ask why you're so interested in that moss? Apollo: Well, Dr. Buff was supposed to give us something. But it seems he hid it somewhere last night. Pearl: H-He did? Maybe that's why he, um... Apollo: Pearl? Do you know something that might help us? Pearl: Um, well... Apollo: (Sounds like I'd better find out what she knows.) Anything else Pearl: Oh, um... Sorry, I wish I could help, but... Apollo: No, don't worry about it! I'm sorry I wasted your time like that. Pearl: Um... At least let me offer you some tea. I mean, you must be tired from all your investigating. Pearl: Oh, no, you don't have to do that. We'll be just fine, thank you. (She's so polite, it's hard NOT to feel rude around her.) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: Well, we should get going now, but thanks for all your help, Pearl. Pearl: You're welcome, Mr. Apollo. Please take care. Dhurke: What do you say we go find that cave, son? I sense that the orb might finally be within our grasp. Apollo: This treasure hunt is shaping up to be the real deal. Dhurke: Hah hah hah. Really gets the blood pumping, doesn't it?! Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go! May 16Mt. Mitama - Cave Entrance Apollo: Whew, I'm all out of breath. Dhurke: Aw, come on, that was nothing. And you're so much younger than me. Apollo: I, uh... *huff* *puff* ...don't normally get this much exercise... *cough* *sputter* Dhurke: Need a break? Apollo: N-No, I'm fine. *huff* *puff* Dhurke! Look! There's Mitama Moss growing in that cave over there. Dhurke: This must be where the doctor was last night. Let's take a look inside. May 16Mt. Mitama - Cave Apollo: ............ I can't see a thing. Dhurke: Relax. Your eyes will adjust eventually. Now, follow me. Apollo: I-I really think we need a flashlight, Dhurke. Dhurke: Should've brought one along then, son. ???: ...Here, use mine. Apollo: Thanks! Wait, were you holding out on me? Dhurke: Um... who are you talking to, Apollo? Apollo: ...You...? Whoa! (Someone just pushed me!) Dhurke: Apollo? What the--?! Apollo! Ah... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Apollo: Oww... Dhurke: Are you all right, son? Apollo: Y-Yeah... Looks like someone got the drop on us. Dhurke: Quite literally. Apollo: But who--? I mean, we could've died from that fall! Dhurke: I don't know... Hmm... But I don't think we'll be getting out the way we came in. Looks like we're in a pretty deep cave. Nothing to do but press on, son. Apollo: How can you even see in here? Dhurke: ...Come on, let's go. Apollo: H-Hey, wait! (One false step and we're dead... What in the world should we do...?) Wait here Apollo: How about we wait for help to come? Dhurke: And how are we to call for said help, hmm? Apollo: With my phone, obviously. I'll just-- Argh...! Of course we're in a dead zone... *sigh* Dhurke: Guess that's that. Apollo: (Just great...) Leads back to: \"What in the world should we do...?\" Go forward Leads to: \"I guess we keep going.\" Climb back up Apollo: Let's try climbing back up. Dhurke: Can you even see the wall in front of you? Apollo: ...No... Dhurke: Well, I can tell you it's far too steep. Apollo: You never know until you try! Here goes nothing! Hrrrgh... Annngh... Dhurke: Your loud voice may move mountains... ...but you've barely moved an inch, son. Apollo: (Argh!) Leads back to: \"What in the world should we do...?\" Apollo: I guess we keep going. There must've been some path for Dr. Buff to follow when he came to hide the orb. Dhurke: Right. By the way, it looks like our attacker left us with this useful parting gift. Apollo: From lawyer to spelunker... How do I always get myself into these situations...? We're never going to make it out alive, I hope you know. Dhurke: Don't tell me you're scared, son. We're just getting started. The greatest treasures are only ever found at the point of a blade, or the edge of a cliff. Apollo: Yeah, sure... If I'd known I'd wind up at the bottom of some dark, damp cave... ...I would've never taken your request, Dhurke. Dhurke: Save your breath, Apollo. Just keep putting one foot ahead of the other. Apollo: There'd really better be a way out of here. Dhurke: We'll find one before you know it. You'll see. .................................................................. May 16Mt. Mitama - Cave Apollo: *huff* *puff* We've been walking for over an hour. It's like a maze in here. I couldn't go back to where we started if I wanted to. Dhurke: Y-Yeah... This cave goes deeper than I thought. Apollo: Wait, don't tell me there really is no way out... Dhurke: ...Where there's a will, there's a way. Apollo: Ever the optimist, aren't you... (Maybe we should cut our losses while we still can...) Forge ahead Leads to: \"Even if we were to turn back, we wouldn't make it up that wall of solid rock.\" Turn back Apollo: I seriously think we're going to get completely turned around if we go any further, Dhurke. I mean, we don't even know if there's a way out up ahead. Dhurke: But we DO know we can't climb up that wall. Apollo: Yeah, but... Dhurke: I still know the way back from here. Don't worry, son. We can always go back there any time we want. Apollo: I-If you say so. (Famous last words if I've ever heard some...) Leads back to: \"Maybe we should cut our losses while we still can...\" Put my foot down Apollo: I'm not taking another step, Dhurke! Dhurke: Come on, now... Be reasonable... Apollo: No! I'm done, and that's final. Dhurke: I remember when you used to throw tantrums like this. Apollo: W-Well, I'm not a child anymore! Dhurke: There, there! It's okay. Daddy'll buy anything you want once we get home, son. Apollo: (...I'd better quit while I still have some manhood left to salvage... But it doesn't seem like Dhurke's about to quit any time soon. Even still...) Leads back to: \"Maybe we should cut our losses while we still can...\" Apollo: (Even if we were to turn back, we wouldn't make it up that wall of solid rock. So, I guess we keep going.) ............*sigh* How did I get stuck wandering around in a dark cave again? It's definitely not in my job description. Dhurke: Heh heh. Listen, son. Only the truly accomplished have the luxury of being so choosy. When I was just starting out, I did everything from street performing to yak milking. Apollo: And... that helped you become an accomplished attorney, how? Dhurke: It didn't. But when you need to make a living, you'll take on any job just to survive. ...Say, how IS your career going, by the way? Apollo: Well, it's been a harrowing adventure so far, to say the least. My first trial really put me through the wringer. And my next case had me investigating a pair of stolen panties. And just when I was hitting my stride, this one prosecutor branded me as \"Herr Forehead.\" Oh, and there's this other, ridiculous prosecutor who wields a samurai sword. Dhurke: ...Sounds like you've, um... seen quite a bit. Apollo: You're telling me. Dhurke: ...Listen, Apollo... I'm, uh, I'm sorry I didn't contact you for so long. Apollo: ............It's fine, Dhurke. What happened, happened. Dhurke: ...Hm? Careful, the ground doesn't feel as solid here. Apollo: What? Yikes! The cave floor's collapsing! Dhurke: Argh! Not agaaaain! Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH! May 16??? ???: Hey, Apollo. Can you hear me? Apollo: ...Unngh. (.........Dhurke?) Huh? Where are we? Whoa! What is this place?! Dhurke: I was shocked, too. These ruins look really old. Apollo: It's not exactly something you'd expect to find in the middle of a cave system, that's for sure. Maybe the doctor hid the orb here? I mean, those look like footprints over there. Dhurke: Son, I think our little adventure is about to pay dividends! Time to find that orb! Examine Plastic bottle Apollo: What's a plastic bottle doing here? Dhurke: There's seaweed stuck to it, which means it probably came from the ocean. Hmm... It's possible this cavern is connected to the sea somehow. Driftwood Apollo: Driftwood? How'd that get in here? Dhurke: By drifting on in, I'd assume. The only question is, from where? Cavern wall near stone altar Apollo: So that's the hole we fell through. Doesn't look like we'll be going back that way. We're lucky we survived the fall from way up there. Dhurke: Indeed. If that hole hadn't been above the lake, we'd be history. You passed out the moment you hit the water. Apollo: Yeah, well, water's not really my thing. Dhurke: Hmm, this cavern is solid rock all around. Looks like we either go back through that hole... ...or find some other way out. Apollo: Ugh. Why am I always between a rock and a hard place? Stone altar Apollo: It's a big stone altar. One false move, and some god might come and smite us. Dhurke: Oh, come on. It's not all doom and gloom. Apollo: ...I dare you to look at our surroundings and say that again, Dhurke. Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! You've got me there, son. Apollo: (Dear gods, please smite me now.) Water Apollo: This lake looks really deep. I can't even see the bottom. (A bottomless lake in the depths of a mountain cave system. My blood runs cold at the thought of falling in there.) Dhurke: The water... It's salty. This lake may very well lead to the ocean. Apollo: Didn't Pearl mention something about the ocean? ...Like how it's on the other side of the mountain? Can't imagine she meant it literally. Footprints Apollo: These have gotta be the doctor's footprints. They match the bottoms of the boots we saw in his study. Dhurke: So he made it all the way down here. Hmm... The water's washed and most of them away, but his footprints are everywhere. Apollo: Really? 'Cause these are the only sets I see. Dhurke: He must've been looking for something. ...Ah. Those prints... They're coming out of that lake. Apollo: Hey, you're right. But that would mean Dr. Buff came walking out of the water. Box on altar Apollo: This box looks pretty new. I'm guessing... the doctor's the one who brought it down here. Dhurke: It's no good. It's locked tight. Apollo: There's no way to open it? Dhurke: Doesn't look like it. There isn't even a keyhole. Which means... there must be a trick to opening it. We'll have to figure it out if we want to see what's inside. Talk Any ideas? Apollo: I wonder what this place was for before it was... well, ruins. Dhurke: I'm guessing it was a place for spirit mediums to perform their rites. But earthquakes and the changing landscape eventually buried it. Apollo: If you're right, that would mean that it hasn't been used in ages. After examining cavern wall near stone altar, water, footprints, and box on altar: Dhurke: Let's sum up what we know so far. The orb is almost definitely inside this box contraption that we can't open. As for this cave, there doesn't seem to be any way out. Apollo: Nnrgh... We're THIS close to the orb... Dhurke: Aww, come now, son. Don't be like that. It's just a bit of bad luck. That's all. Apollo: A bit? Murphy called. He wants his law back. Dhurke: What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger, right? Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (How can he laugh at a time like this?) Dhurke: We're stuck here for now, so we might as well try to open this thing. Apollo: Okay, let's see what we're dealing with. Examine button Apollo: There's a big button here. ...Huh. Nothing happened. Examine pictures Apollo: This thing is covered with pictures. And, hey! Each section also rotates! Dhurke: Take a look at this, son. See the picture of a dragon battling a tiger? And this green and purple one... ...is of a Khura'inese butterfly and a mitamah. Apollo: ...I wonder if they're clues for figuring out how to open this box. After examining button and pictures: Dhurke: It appears this box uses a picture-based combination lock. We'll have to arrange the pictures on each side in the correct sequence. Apollo: Let's see... There's the dragon and tiger fight, a Khura'inese butterfly with a mitamah... Dhurke: ...And a number of pictures, too. Apollo: Dhurke, I was thinking... Maybe we should check the evidence we've collected so far. I think we have something that just might help us open it. Dhurke: You read my mind, son. Apollo: I think this will help us open the puzzle box. Present Research Notes Apollo: Leads to: \"Dr. Buff's research notes mention the Song of Ceremony.\" Present anything else Apollo: Dhurke: I don't see how that would help us. Apollo: Really? (Guess that wasn't it.) Dhurke: There's a dragon and tiger fighting, and a Khura'inese butterfly with a mitamah. We've gotta have something related to those things, don't we? Apollo: Hmm... Leads back to: \"I think this will help us open the puzzle box.\" Apollo: Dr. Buff's research notes mention the Song of Ceremony. Maybe its lyrics and the pictures on the box correspond somehow. Dhurke: I think you're on to something, son. Apollo: Okay, let's give it a shot. Each dial has six pictures... ...and there are four dials in all. The box should open once the pictures are arranged in the right order. Funky puzzle box... here comes Justice! Input tiger and dragon picture on top row, Khura'inese butterfly and mitamah picture on middle-top row, praying people and Holy Mother picture halves on middle-bottom row, and Holy Mother's spiritual blessing picture on bottom row Leads to: \"It opened!\" Input any other combination Apollo: It won't open. Dhurke: Maybe the pictures aren't in the right order. The case should open if the pictures are arranged properly, but... Apollo: I know. I should carefully consider which part of the song corresponds to which picture. Apollo: It opened! So this is the Founder's Orb... Dhurke: We did it, son! The orb is finally ours! Founder's Orb updated in the Court Record. Dhurke: At last, the Founder's Orb is ours! And it's all thanks to you, son! Well done! Then again, I'd expect nothing less from my boy! Apollo: Oh, uh, ha ha. It's no big deal. Dhurke: Don't sell yourself short! You may think it's nothing... ...but your insights and reasoning led us here. And I'd say that's truly impressive! Apollo: I don't know about that, ha ha ha. Dhurke: All those battles you fought in the courtroom have shaped you into the man you are today. And I couldn't be prouder! Apollo: ...W-Will you cut it out, already? (...Before I turn into a sun-ripened tomato.) Dhurke: With this orb, I can finally deliver a fatal blow to the Ga'ran regime. Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: So, how exactly do you plan on using it? You're not going to try to become a spirit medium, are you? Dhurke: Don't be ridiculous. I don't need supernatural powers like that. Apollo: So then, are you going to use it as a bargaining chip with Queen Ga'ran? Like demanding she abolishes the Defense Culpability Act? Dhurke: Well, the thought had crossed my mind, but... ...the main thing is returning this to the Kingdom of Khura'in. After all, as a sacred relic of Khura'inism, that is where it belongs. Apollo: Really? That's all you wanted to do? Dhurke: Mm-hm. Because my true objective has always been... ...to find out who asked Dr. Buff to study it and why. Apollo: I'm not sure I follow. Examine Box on altar Apollo: That was one fancy puzzle box. Dhurke: The fact that he chose to use such an elaborate box... ...makes me think that Dr. Buff must've had a rather playful side to him. Apollo: I can almost imagine him saying, \"Go ahead. Open it if you can.\" Talk The orb's significance Dhurke: The official story is that the orb was stolen from the Tehm'pul Temple treasure room. Apollo: Yeah, I heard about that on the news. They also said your group was behind the theft. Dhurke: That's not good... We're probably on an international most-wanted list now. ...Let me ask you something, Apollo: Who do YOU think really stole the orb? Apollo: Umm, I really haven't a clue. Dhurke: Well, I think it was one of the royals. Apollo: Really? Someone from the royal family? Dhurke: Yeah, and I've got a pretty good idea which one it was. Apollo: (He knows who it is?) Care to share your hunch? Dhurke: All I'll say at this point is this: Security is pretty tight, but the royals have unfettered access to the treasure room. Plus, they seem to be turning a blind eye to the orb's loss. Apollo: But why would a member of the royal family do that? Dhurke: ...That, I haven't figured out yet. But whatever the reason, it can't be good. I mean, a Khura'inese royal stealing a national treasure of such religious significance? And then pinning the crime on us, the Defiant Dragons? Apollo: Sounds like a conspiracy or something. Dhurke: I agree. And if the truth were to come to light, it would be a scandal of epic proportions. To allow a foreign national to study a treasure so sacred that it's off limits to the public... It would be seen as an utter sacrilege to those who truly revere the Holy Mother. Apollo: So if this were to go public, support for the Ga'ran regime would weaken. Dhurke: But that's not all. This is just a hunch, but I believe there's something even bigger here. Something that would explain why the orb was being studied in the first place. Something that would shake the Kingdom of Khura'in to its very core. And I'm going to find out what. Apollo: (.........He's probably right. His intuition is usually spot on.) Dhurke, why are you so bent on revolution, anyway? Is it to reform the legal system in Khura'in? Dhurke: There's that. But I'm  also doing this for my children... I want to save Nahyuta. Apollo: What do you mean? Dhurke: ...This is for your ears only. It's the other reason why this revolution needs to succeed. Nahyuta (appears after \"The orb's significance\") Apollo: Nahyuta... I never thought that our reunion would take place in a courtroom. Dhurke: Oh, so you've run into each other already. Apollo: Yeah, but it was like he was a different person. He used to be such a kind, cheerful kid -- always smiling and stuff. But now... He tried to convict Trucy for a crime she didn't even commit. Plus, he kept telling me I had a \"putrid mind\" and to \"let it go, and move on.\" Dhurke: Has it really gotten that bad? It must be Ga'ran's influence. He wasn't like that when he first stepped into the courtroom. Back then, he still had a keen sense of justice. \"I vow to bring the Ga'ran regime down and reform the legal system.\" Dhurke: That's what he swore to do... but that was also five years ago. He'd been the shining star of the Defiant Dragons, and our greatest hope. Apollo: Wait, Nahyuta was a Dragon? Dhurke: He was. But these days, he's more like Ga'ran's lapdog. Apollo: Talk about a complete about-face. Why would he do that? Dhurke: Something must have happened to him. Something that sparked a radical change. Still... I don't think he truly believes in the new path he's taken. It's not conviction that fills his heart; it's resignation and despair. Apollo: I-I see... Dhurke: ...The only thing I know for sure is... Nahyuta is suffering... and he is suffering in silence. Apollo: Nahyuta... is suffering...? Dhurke: Yes. He knows the rightful state of Khura'in's legal system... ...but something forces him to bend to Ga'ran's will, and it's tearing him apart. Apollo: But it's been five years. Do you really think he even still wants to reform the legal system? Dhurke: ...As long as he carries what I've taught him in his heart, I do. Dhurke's teachings (appears after \"Nahyuta\") Leads to: \"\"A dragon never yields.\" ...That's what you always told us.\" Present Founder's Orb Dhurke: The orb is ours at last! Apollo: I'm just glad we were able to make what you said in your broadcast a reality. Dhurke: Me, too. I didn't want to admit it before, but I was starting to have second thoughts about making such a big, bold move. I kept thinking, \"What would happen if we failed to get the orb?\" Apollo: Just another example of how a bluff can be the starting point in the quest for the truth. Dhurke: And what a hard-won truth it was. But I couldn't have done it without you, son. Apollo: \"A dragon never yields.\" ...That's what you always told us. Dhurke: That I did. It's a belief I've held since back when I was lawyer. [sic] The dragon stands at the pinnacle of the natural world. Nothing and no one can bend its will. Apollo: That's why we lawyers must pursue the truth like an unyielding dragon, right? We must fight for truth to the bitter end, no matter what it takes... (Dhurke and Mr. Wright... they have that much in common.) Dhurke: That's why I've held onto this badge, even though there are no more lawyers in Khura'in. I believe that one day, our legal system will return to its former glory. And this badge here is a testament to that belief. Apollo: ...Hmm... I wonder if Nahyuta still believes in what you taught us? Dhurke: He does. That much I'm sure of. A dragon never yields. Dhurke: I know that belief is etched deep in his heart. ...I'd bet my life on it. After all, he is my flesh and blood! Apollo: ............ (This unshakable faith and confidence... It's what draws people to him, whether they like it or not. ...Even people like me.) You know, I remember back when we were kids... ...Nahyuta used to say with great pride, \"I have the blood of the dragon within me.\" Dhurke: Yes, and that's why I want to free him. Free him from the poisonous clutches of the Ga'ran regime. Apollo: So that's your other reason for starting a revolution... Dhurke: Yes. I need to smack some sense into that boy of mine. I mean, what else are fathers for? Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: ...I... I wouldn't know.) Dhurke: Now that we have the orb, on to the next problem -- getting out of here. Apollo: Well, we're not going back the way we came. That's for sure. That hole we fell through is way too high to climb back up to. Dhurke: Actually, I have an idea. That lake water tastes salty, which means it must connect to the ocean. Apollo: W-Wait a second. You're not suggesting we SWIM our way out of here...? Dhurke: That's exactly what I'm suggesting. Apollo: But we have no idea how deep that lake goes. It's pitch black down there. Dhurke: Not a problem. Apollo: How is that not a problem? I mean, how do you even know if there's really a passage to the ocean? Dhurke: Well, one of us has to try, and I'm the better swimmer. Time's a wastin'! I'll be back before you know it, son. Apollo: Dhurke! ...He's gone. I sure hope he knows what he's doing. May 16Mt. Mitama - Kurainese Ruins Apollo: ......... (It's been twenty minutes. I hope he's okay.) What's going on? Uh-oh. Th-The water...! It's rising! And fast! Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! (N-Need... air...) *cough* *sputter* *cough* *cough* ...Ahhh! I don't know how to swim! If I don't grab onto something that floats...! .................. *cough* *sputter* *cough* *cough* ...This is bad! I-I better think of something -- quick! Examine Plastic bottle Apollo: Hey, maybe I can use this like an oxygen tank! ...Wait, what am I thinking?! I need to stay calm and be more rational about this! Driftwood Apollo: I've got it! As long as I hold onto this, I should be able to stay afloat! Stone altar Apollo: This is not good. The water's almost up to the top of the altar. It won't be long before it reaches the roof of the cave. Box on altar Apollo: The puzzle box is still at the base of the altar. It must've been designed to stay put, even at high tide. Wait, that's it! Dr. Buff must've gotten in here from some ocean-side entrance at low tide. That's why his footprints were leading OUT of the lake. So it really DOES connect to the ocean. Not that that helps. I'd drown before I made it out. Top of cavern Apollo: Nnrrgh... It's no use! The hole's still too high up! I'll have to find another way -- and quick -- before I drown! After examining plastic bottle, driftwood, box on altar, and top of cavern: Apollo: The water won't stop rising! Aaaah! I-I'm getting swept away! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh! Please...! STOPPPP! Examine Plastic bottle Apollo: If only that bottle were a little bigger, it'd store that much more air... No, it wouldn't make that much of a difference... I need to stop with these harebrained ideas, and come up with a real way to escape! Cavern ceiling Apollo: The water's almost to the top now. At this rate, I'll run out of breathing room! I'm a goner if I don't find a way out quick! Hole in cavern Leads to: \"The water's just high enough for me to reach the hole!\" Apollo: The water's just high enough for me to reach the hole! I'm saved! All I have to do is go back the way we came! The water might even lift me all the way back up, over that wall of rock! Here goes! ...Huh? The hole! It's full of rubble. The tunnel collapsing above must've filled it in after we fell through it. Nngh... This... This can't be happening! No, I can't give up now. I refuse to die here! Th-The water...! I can't--! *cough* *sputter* I can't... I can't... breathe... .................. (Is this... the end?) .................. (Dhurke... I wonder if he made it out.) .................. (So this is what it feels like to drown. I would've eaten that sushi if I'd known it would be my last meal. ...I feel like I've been through this before. ...Ah, now I remember. It was back when all three of us were living in that shack in the mountains. Nahyuta and I were playing by the riverside when we got swept up in the rapids.) Apollo: AAAAAAHHH! Nahyuta: AAAAAAAGH! Apollo: (I thought we were goners, but then...) Dhurke: Nahyuta! Apollo! Hold on! I'm coming! Apollo: ...*sniffle*... *sniffle*... *sniffle*... Wahhhhh!!! Nahyuta: Waaahhhh!!! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! That was a close one! Thought I'd lost you two! Apollo: I-I'm sorry, Dhuuuuuuurke! Dhurke: All right, that's enough now. Didn't I teach you that boys don't cry? Nahyuta: ...Thank you, Father. Apollo: *sniffle* *hiccup* *hiccup* Nahyuta: You... You could've been killed... But you risked your life... to save us... Why...? Dhurke: What a silly question. What father wouldn't risk his life to save his own children? Nahyuta, Apollo... Don't you ever hesitate to call when you need me. Understand? Apollo: ...Hey Dhurke? This isn't forever, right? You'll bring me back from America someday, right? Dhurke: Of course... I'll come pick you up as soon as things settle down here. Promise. Apollo: Okay! You promised! Apollo: ...Dhurke. I waited and waited. For the day you'd come and take me home. But you never came. That's why I tried to forget about you... ...and my life back in Khura'in. ...Dhurke... Why...? Why... didn't you...? .................. ..................... ???: A... ...lo... A... pol... lo...! Apollo! Can you hear me?! Apollo: *cough* *sputter* *cough* .........D-Dhurke? Dhurke: Still can't swim, eh? Apollo: You... You came back? But why? Dhurke: I said I'd come for you, didn't I? Apollo: Yeah... But you can't hold me and swim...! We're both going to...! Dhurke: Stop talking. You'll bite your tongue. Apollo: What? Whoa whoa whoa! (We're being pulled under! What's going on?! Why is this happeniiiiing?!) .................. May 16??? Apollo: *cough* ...Uuuuugh. Wh-Where...? ???: Ahh, you finally came to, son. Dhurke: Get your fill of seawater? Good thing your name's not Neptune, huh! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: D-Dhurke... Datz: Har har har har har har! You're telling me! Check it out, snot's coming out of his nose! Trucy: What a miraculous escape! Not even some of the escape-artist greats could pull that off! Apollo: ...Wh-What on earth happened? Dhurke: Sorry it took me so long, son. I made it to the ocean, but I figured you still couldn't swim. So I found a local fisherman and had him take us out near the undersea cavern. He tied a rope to me, and I came and grabbed you. Then he yanked me back. Apollo: Oh, so that's what pulled us under with such force. Trucy: Don't forget about me! I assisted in your escape act, too, Polly! Dhurke: I've helped compatriots escape from all sorts of places -- mountain jails, island prisons... But an undersea cavern? Now that was a first! Apollo: ......... (Dhurke... He risked his life for me.) .........Dhurke. I'm only alive because of you. ...Thank you. Dhurke: Oh, uh... Y-You're welcome. I, uh... just did what any father would do for his son. Apollo: (.........He saved my life yet again.) *growl* ...Um... Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! I guess seawater doesn't make for much of a meal! Trucy: It's 'cause Polly didn't have any sushi! Apollo: (Oh, yeah. I haven't eaten anything since this morning.) Datz: ...Oh, that's right! Hey, AJ! Dhurke had me buy this for ya. Apollo: ! Dhurke: Thought you might be hungry. Ready to have some this time around? Apollo: .........Yeah. Thanks! *chomp* *nom nom nom* Oh wow, this is delicious! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Glad you approve! I'd better get some before you eat them all! *chomp* *chew chew chew* Apollo: (Just like old times. Dhurke used to slice up the fish he caught, and we'd all eat fresh sashimi together. He used to talk about all the vitamins and minerals packed in the raw fish.) Datz: *chomp* *munch munch munch* Hey, by the way! Lemme see that orb, AJ! Apollo: Here you go. Datz: Hoa, so that's what it looks like! Trucy: You found the legendary treasure! Nice work, Polly! Apollo: Thanks. ...Guess you could say, mission accomplished! Dhurke: With the orb, our revolution can take a big step forward. Let's celebrate the eve of our revolution! We'll all get dressed up and feast till dawn! Datz: Yeah! Now you're talkin'! Time to party! Apollo: ......... (After all that? I just want to go to bed. Sure wish Nahyuta was here. Maybe one day, we'll enjoy times like these together again. ...The revolution. If it can bring back those happy days... ...you can sign me up for--) ???: Sorry to interrupt your little party, but I'm here for my crystal. Staff: Right, left, right, left, HALT! Apollo: Ah! It's him again! Atishon: Heh heh heh. Well done. Then again, I always knew you could do it. After all, we politicians must be excellent judges of character. Still, I'm impressed you both made it out of there alive. Apollo: ...W-Wait a second. YOU'RE the one who shoved us into that pit? Atishon: It sounds so bad when you say it like that. All I did was give you a little nudge in the right direction. Dhurke: ...So... it was you... ............................................................... You no good, son of a--! Atishon: ...EEP! D-Don't look at me like that! The Crystal of Ami Fey is mine! Now, hand it over! Dhurke: Over my dead body! Atishon: EEK! Detective! Help! Ema: Yeah yeah, I know. Apollo: Ema? What's going on here? Ema: He filed a police report. He claims you're trying to steal his family heirloom. Atishon: Th-That's him! The one with the long hair! Arrest him this instant! He's the thief that made off with the Atishon family's most precious heirloom! Ema: Well, I suppose I should ask you to come in for questioning. Dhurke: Down at the police station? I... think I'll pass. After all, Mr. Atishon seems bent on having me arrested on theft charges. Apollo: (This is not good! If Dhurke gets arrested, he'll be sent back to Khura'in to face execution!) Ema: Sorry, but now that I know you have the crystal, or orb as you call it, I must insist. Will you please come with me, sir? Apollo: Apollo: Ema! I'm afraid I can't let you take Dhurke in! He received the orb from Dr. Buff in a perfectly legal transaction. Ema: Is that so? Can you prove it? Apollo: Of course. This should sufficiently prove that the orb now belongs to Dhurke. Present Orb Transfer Agreement Apollo: Leads to: \"Take a look at this agreement.\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: Look at this! It's proof that the orb is Dhurke's. Ema: Umm... All this proves is you're completely our of your mind. Apollo: Oops... (I guess that wasn't it.) But the doctor definitely transferred it over to us. Leads back to: \"This should sufficiently prove that the orb now belongs to Dhurke.\" Apollo: Take a look at this agreement. Ema: What do we have here? Let's see... \"I agree to hand over the Founder's Orb to the Defiant Dragons if I will come to no harm.\" Hmm... It appears to be a perfectly legal agreement. Atishon: Not so fast! That's not the Founder's Orb! It's the Crystal of Ami Fey, which means their agreement is null and void! Ema: Hmm, this is going nowhere fast. Apollo: You can say that again. ???: Then it will just have to go to trial. Right, Apollo? Apollo: M-M-Mr. Wright? Trucy: Daddy! Phoenix: What's with you two? You look like you just saw a ghost. Apollo: (...Oh yeah. Ema mentioned she had seen him around.) ...Um, what're you doing in Kurain Village, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Mr. Atishon has retained me as his lawyer. Apollo: Wait, you're his... lawyer? Examine Mountains Apollo: You can see Mt. Mitama from here. We're lucky we found the Founder's Orb, and even luckier we got out of there alive. I hope I never have to go through anything like that again. Talk Legal advisor Apollo: Mr. Wright, why are you serving as Mr. Atishon's lawyer? Phoenix: Because he hired me. He needed my help in getting a family heirloom back from Dr. Buff. And it seems he correctly foresaw that something like this might happen. Atishon: It's because those shifty insurgents were harassing poor Dr. Buff. So I knew I might need a lawyer if things went south. I figured with a celebrated lawyer like Phoenix Wright, I couldn't go wrong. Apollo: Is this what you came back from Khura'in for, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: It was just good timing. My work over there just happened to wrap up, so here I am. Plus... Mr. Atishon is a very important client. Apollo: (They know each other? But I've never heard Mr. Wright mention his name before.) The Crystal of Ami Fey Apollo: Mr. Wright, are you sure this is Mr. Atishon's family heirloom? Phoenix: That's my client's assertion. He says it's the Crystal of Ami Fey. Apparently, it's the crystal she once used when channeling spirits. Apollo: Who's Ami Fey? Phoenix: She brought Khura'inese channeling to Japan, and her descendants brought it here. Her true origins are still rather murky... ...but what's clear is she is the founder of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Apollo: Oh, so she's like the one they call the founder in Khura'in -- the Holy Mother. Present Anything Phoenix: I'd think you would have more pressing things to ask me about. Apollo: Y-Yeah... (I'd better ask what I can while I can.) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ...Apollo, I don't plan to betray my client's confidence. I may not know all the facts yet, but I do know we won't be handing the crystal over to you. Apollo: What? Are you saying...? Phoenix: .................. I'm really sorry it's come to this, but... Apollo: Mr. Wright? I don't understand. Phoenix: Let me spell it out then. If you continue to claim that the crystal belongs to your client... ...then I will be seeing you in court. Apollo: Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! Trucy: ...Wh-What's gotten into you, Daddy? Phoenix: Nothing. This is strictly business. Atishon: Heh heh heh. Two lawyers from the same firm facing off? What are the odds! Lucky for me, I believe I have the \"right\" man for the job! What ever are you going to do? Remember, he IS your boss. Apollo: Ngrrrgh... (How did it come to this?!) M-Mr. Wright! Please! Don't do this! Phoenix: Apollo, there's no point in arguing about it here... ...when it's now clear we're headed to court. That's where we'll find out who the crystal really belongs to. Apollo: (I don't believe it. Am I really going to face Mr. Wright in court?) Trucy: Daddy! Apollo! No! We can't have our agency's talent competing against each other! Phoenix: It's too late, Trucy. The die has been cast. We each have to fight for our clients' best interests. Trucy: B-But... Phoenix: So, what's it going to be, Apollo. Are we going to have to take this to trial? Apollo: (I have to battle Mr. Wright in court? THE legendary Phoenix Wright? No matter how many trials of his I've watched... ...no matter how dire the situation, he's always pulled out a win in the end. Can I do it? Can I really take on the man whose footsteps I've been following in...? I owe it to Dhurke to at least try. I... What should I do?) Battle Mr. Wright Leads to: \"There's no turning back now.\" Throw in the towel Apollo: (I can't do this. I mean, how can I go up against a man like him? I couldn't possibly win! ...But do I really want to give up without a fight? If I do, I'll be forever walking in his shadow! Plus, I'd be letting Dhurke down! And I can't let that happen!) Leads to: \"There's no turning back now.\" Apollo: (There's no turning back now.) If it's a trial you want, Mr. Wright, I'm more than happy to oblige! I'm ready to fight for my client... ...even if it means facing off against you! Phoenix: .................................... .................. ...All right. I won't be pulling any punches, either, Apollo. The kid gloves are officially off. May the best attorney win. Apollo: You got it! Trucy: Whoa whoa whoa! First Daddy, now you! Polly! You're not seriously... Apollo: ...Sorry, Trucy. But I have to do this. Phoenix: .................. Apollo... All right, then, I'd better go prepare for tomorrow. See you in court. Trucy: Daddy, no! Wait! Dhurke: A fine mess I've gotten you into, son. I mean, of all the lawyers we could've faced, it had to be him? He's practically a celebrity in Khura'in now. They're calling him the Fighting Phoenix. Apollo: ...I-I'll be fine! (After all, I've come a long way, too! Who knows? I could even end up winning. There's always a chance...... right?) Dhurke: You know, this may be a blessing in disguise. If the trial proves what we found is indeed the Founder's Orb... ...then whoever asked Dr. Buff to study it may be revealed, too. This is our chance to finally pull them out of the shadows! Apollo: ...The first step of your revolution, huh? Dhurke: Yes. The revolution to restore Khura'in to its former glory, and save Nahyuta's soul! Apollo: Dhurke... I swear to fight as hard as I can in court to make that a reality. We're going to win this one. You'll see. Dhurke: I know you can do it... son. Apollo: (It doesn't matter that I'll be going up against Mr. Wright. I have to win this for Dhurke... ...and for Nahyuta. His salvation, along with all of Khura'in, depends on it!) To be continued Nothing to examine during investigation Apollo: Nothing particularly interesting here. Area already examined Apollo: We've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around. Nothing to examine during fingerprinting session Apollo: Doesn't look like there are any prints here. Examine insignificant area on evidence Apollo: (Nothing particularly interesting here.) Consult (while opening puzzle box) Apollo: Hmm, this is harder than I imagined. I thought all we had to do was arrange the pictures according to the song. Dhurke: It's times like these you have to think outside the puzzle-box. Sometimes the truth can only be found when you look at things from a different angle. Apollo: A different angle? (Come to think of it, one of the pictures from the song is missing. Does this mean the pictures don't line up exactly one-to-one?) Turnabout Revolution Image Gallery Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 May 17, 10:08 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Trucy: Just so you know... I'm not going to take sides! Apollo: Message received, loud and clear. Trucy: Good, because I don't like this one bit! You and Daddy should be on the same team! Apollo: S-Sorry, Trucy... (Wow, she's really mad.) Dhurke: I'm sorry, too, little lady. This is all my fault. Trucy: I'm just worried things will never be the same between Daddy and Apollo... ...if they go through with this. Dhurke: Is that all? Well, I wouldn't worry about that. That's the way it is with us men. We may fight, but we don't burn bridges. Trucy: Really? Dhurke: Sure. One minute we're trading blows, and the next, we're having drinks together. We're simple creatures at heart. Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Trucy: I sure hope you're right... Athena: Sorry I'm late, Apollo! Apollo: Athena! There you are! What happened with you and Mr. Wright yesterday? Athena: O-Oh, about that... I ended up going to the wrong airport. I was waiting there, thinking his flight was really late... and before I knew it, I dozed off. By the time I woke up, it was already dark. Apollo: I figured something like that had happened. Being late and dozing off are the two things you do best. Athena: Ugh. Guilty as charged. Apollo: So then, I take it you have no idea what today's case is about? Athena: Not a clue. Sorry... Um, what IS today's case about, if I might ask? Another locked-room mystery? A suspect with a flimsy alibi? Ooh, or a dying message? Apollo: Sorry, strike three, you're out. It's a civil case. Athena: ...A civil case? Apollo: You act like I'm speaking Swahili here. Athena: It's just, the Wright Anything Agency specializes in criminal law, or so I thought. In civil cases, there are no prosecutors, right? Instead, both parties retain an attorney. Apollo: Right. And the other attorney is someone you know very well. Athena: Really? Who? Bailiff: The trial will begin shortly. Please proceed to the courtroom at once. Apollo: (...Okay, let's do this!) Athena: Apollo, wait. Who's the other attorney? And where is Mr. Wright? Apollo: No time to explain. Let's go. Athena: O-Okay! Right behind you! May 17, 10:30 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 6 Judge: Court is now in session. Oh, um... Uh, is this some sort of practice session? A mock trial, perhaps? Apollo: Um... no. No, it's not, Your Honor. Phoenix: It's the real deal, Your Honor. Judge: Hmm... So then you two have had a falling out? I won't have you use my courtroom for that, you know! Apollo: I-It's nothing like that, Your Honor! Phoenix: Exactly. It just so happens that we have different clients in this case. Judge: I see... Well, here's to hoping this has no adverse effect on your working relationship. Athena: You can say that again! I had no idea we'd be going up against the boss today! Ugh... You sure this is a good idea, Apollo? Apollo: ...What? Do you want to switch sides? Athena: Honestly, I'd rather be anywhere but here right now. Apollo: (Well, at least she IS here. I'm really going to need her help.) Phoenix: ...Mr. Justice. Apollo: Yes?! Phoenix: Don't expect me to pull any punches just because you're the opposing lawyer. As I said, the kid gloves are off, and come what may, they'll stay off. Apollo: ...Same here, Mr. Wright! If it's a fight you want, it's a fight you'll get! Phoenix: .................. Apollo: .................. Athena: Yeesh, you guys are really chomping at the bit, aren't you? Judge: Hmm... I don't mind a good fight between co-workers. Just keep this civil case civil. Now then, if the plaintiff would take the stand, we may begin. Staff: Right, left, right, left, HALT! Atishon: Noble judge, members of the gallery! Good day to you! I am Paul Atishon! This is but the start of my epic campaign! And you all have the honor of witnessing it! I believe the youth of this country are our very future. Too long have they been looked down on and given the cold shoulder! So, to them I say! Ask not what you can do for your country! Ask what you can do for me! Judge: M-Mr. Atishon! What is that crazy contraption you're riding in?! Atishon: Heh heh heh. It's my custom-made, election-winning campaign mobile. Beautiful, isn't it? Judge: You're at a witness stand, not a campaign podium. So come out of there this instant! Atishon: Feh... Judge: All right. Now, would the plaintiff's attorney, Mr. Wright... ...please explain the complaint filed against the defendant. Phoenix: Mr. Atishon's complaint against the defendant is simple. The defendant, one Dhurke Sahdmadhi... ...stole my client's family heirloom -- the Crystal of Ami Fey. Mr. Atishon merely seeks its return. Atishon: This wouldn't have happened if that archeologist hadn't kicked the bucket. Judge: ...I see. Well, Mr. Justice, let's have your opening statement, if you would. Apollo: The defense asserts the item in question is the Founder's Orb, a sacred relic from Khura'in. Judge: Hmm... Go on. Apollo: It seems someone asked an archeologist -- Dr. Archie Buff -- to study the orb. Dr. Buff determined that it was a Khura'inese national treasure known as the Founder's Orb. The very orb that was stolen from a treasure room in Khura'in several weeks ago. Judge: Why yes, I saw a news report about that! The theft of a Khura'inese national treasure caused quite an uproar in the kingdom. Apollo: Well, we believe it was not, in fact, a theft in the traditional sense. But rather, that it was spirited out of Khura'in by someone for Dr. Buff to study. Judge: You don't say... And...? Apollo: Around that time, an acquaintance of the defendant learned of Dr. Buff. He made contact with the doctor, who agreed to hand over the orb. Apparently, the doctor wanted nothing to do with it once he'd learned it had been stolen. Judge: Hmm... It seems you even have a transfer agreement between both parties. Apollo: Mr. Sahdmadhi also agreed to return the Founder's Orb to the Kingdom of Khura'in... ...once the doctor verified it was the real thing. Judge: I see... So this dispute centers on... ...whether the item is the Founder's Orb or the Crystal of Ami Fey. That, in turn, will determine the object's rightful owner. Apollo: (I'd better bring my A game. Going up against Mr. Wright won't be a walk in the park.) Judge: Hmm... Come to think of it, the name Dhurke Sahdmadhi sounds awfully familiar. But I can't recall where I've heard it. Apollo: ...Oh. umm, it's probably your imagination, Your Honor. He's just a tourist, after all. Judge: Hmm... My imagination, you say? Athena: Are you sure about this, Apollo? He's a wanted criminal in Khura'in, isn't he? Apollo: ...In Khura'in, yes. Here, he's just a tourist. Judge: Very well, let's begin the proceedings. Bailiff, would you bring in the first witness? Apollo: ...Ema? Ema: Show some manners. We're in court. Apollo: I know, it's just... This is a civil trial, so I was surprised to see a detective take the stand. Phoenix: I had her do some digging on Dr. Buff. Apollo: (What for?) Ema: You disappoint me, Apollo. First, you know I'm not just a detective. I'm a forensic scientist. Do try to remember that. Second, you owe Mr. Wright an apology. After all he's done for you, you have some nerve! Apollo: First, I'm sorry. And second, I'm really just trying to do my job. Ema: You'll never get anywhere with that attitude. Take some advice from someone who's been there. Apollo: Why do I feel like I'm on trial here? Judge: Detective Skye, your testimony, if you please. Witness Testimony -- The Doctor's Dark Secret -- Ema: The police have had their eye on Dr. Buff for some time. And just today, a number of stolen artifacts were discovered in his study. Among them were a priceless urn and a statue that were stolen from the Fey clan. It seems the doctor would do anything to study artifacts, including steal them. As for the relic at the center of this dispute, he likely stole it from the Atishon residence. Apollo: The doctor... is a thief? Why am I just hearing about this now? Ema: Well, \"cat burglar\" isn't something he'd put on his résumé. He was more careful than that. But the fact is, he was a classic treasure hunter. Athena: A treasure hunter, huh... Like people who have thrilling adventures in exotic places, risking life and limb for glory? Apollo: I doubt Dr. Buff was the star of his own hit movie series, Athena. Phoenix: Out of respect for the dead, I will say that Dr. Buff wasn't doing it to get rich. Apparently, he only wanted to borrow artifacts to study them. He would then return them as soon as his research was finished. Ema: According to the doctor's child... ...he would even repair or restore some of the artifacts he stole before returning them. He believed he was honoring the dead by discovering their history through artifacts. But whatever lofty ideals he had, it makes no difference. Larceny is larceny. Judge: Yes, he certainly sounds no different than a regular thief to me. Apollo: So, let's say for a moment that the doctor really did moonlight in stealing artifacts... Might he not have stolen the Founder's Orb in Khura'in and brought it back here himself? Phoenix: Nope. There's no records of him traveling overseas over the past few years. Plus, he couldn't very well leave his reclusive child at home all alone. Judge: Hmm... Then this really must be the Crystal of Ami Fey. Phoenix: Yes. He stole it from the Atishon residence, probably so he could study it. Apollo: ......... (This is the left hook I did not need.) Athena: I bet you never saw that coming, Apollo. Apollo: Yeah, when Mr. Wright said the kid gloves were off, he wasn't kidding. Phoenix: ......... Judge: Mr. Justice, you may proceed with your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- The Doctor's Dark Secret -- Ema: The police have had their eye on Dr. Buff for some time. Press Apollo: Apollo: How exactly did Dr. Buff arouse the suspicion of the police anyway? Ema: Chalk it up to good, old-fashioned sleuthing. After investigating countless artifact thefts over the years... ...the police finally zeroed in on him, and the doctor became their prime suspect. Phoenix: A number of those artifact thefts occurred in Kurain Village, too, if I might add. And they started right around the time the doctor moved there. Apollo: But he was never arrested. I take it there was nothing concrete linking him to a crime? Ema: No. Which is why we were never able to get a search warrant in the first place. It's hard to arrest artifact thieves unless you catch them red-handed. Still, the police had him under constant surveillance. Ema: And just today, a number of stolen artifacts were discovered in his study. Press Apollo: Apollo: Are you sure these allegedly stolen artifacts are the real deal? Ema: They're not fakes, that's for sure. Take the urn, for example. Apparently, it's an extremely intricate work of art. Its design, cracks, and other features would be impossible to replicate perfectly. Phoenix: Actually, I've had a few run-ins with that urn myself. So I was shocked to see it there in the doctor's study. I can say without a doubt, that that urn was stolen from the Fey clan. Apollo: I-I see... Judge: Detective Skye, please continue your testimony, if you would. Ema: Among them were a priceless urn and a statue that were stolen from the Fey clan. Press Apollo: Apollo: Were any other stolen artifacts found besides those belonging to the Feys? Ema: Yes. For instance... Remember the large relief on the wall? It was chiseled out some ancient ruins in the Kingdom of Khura'in several years ago. Apollo: Ch-Chiseled out...? Didn't that damage it? Ema: Well, he did restore the parts that were so faded you could barely see them anymore. It seems he intended to return it someday, so one could say his intentions were good. But good intentions are no get-out-of-jail-free card. That's a fact. Phoenix: If I might add, with respect for the deceased... ...the quality of the restorations was apparently exceptional. It seems the doctor invested a lot of money in hiring an extremely talented specialist. Athena: He sounds like a good man... who took a wrong turn somewhere. Apollo: (I guess Sarge takes after him in that way.) Ema: Any further questions? If not... Ema: It seems the doctor would do anything to study artifacts, including steal them. Press Apollo: Apollo: Had these alleged thefts been going on for some time? Ema: At least five years, as far as we can tell. All the recent thefts had been local... ...but before moving to Kurain Village, he had been stealing from ruins around the world. Apollo: (Dr. Buff was an international criminal?) Ema: This data lends itself to but one conclusion: Dr. Buff was a thief. Ema: As for the relic at the center of this dispute, he likely stole it from the Atishon residence. Press Apollo: Apollo: You claim he stole a family heirloom from the Atishon residence. But claiming something doesn't make it true. Ema: Unfortunately, it IS true. Apollo: How can you be so sure? Ema: A police report was filed concerning the theft -- one year ago, in fact. Apollo: What?! A whole year ago? Ema: August 25 of last year, to be exact. The report state, and I quote... \"The Crystal of Ami Fey was discovered to be missing... ...from the Atishon storehouse at 10 AM. The storehouse lock had been picked. Signed, Paul Atishon-Wimperson.\" Judge: Well, a year-old report certainly lends the the plaintiff's claim credence. The doctor could really have stolen the Crystal of Ami Fey. Phoenix: Not only that, Your Honor... ...but the Founder's Orb was only found to be missing several weeks ago. That is nearly a year after the crystal's theft was reported. Therefore, I believe we must consider the orb and the crystal to be two separate items. Apollo: ......... Athena: Paul Atishon-Wimperson? Not the most awe-inspiring tail end, is it? I see why he cut it. Apollo: Not that he inspires confidence without it. Still, I'd probably do the same in his shoes. Robbery Report added to the Court Record. Press (subsequent times) Apollo: Apollo: This police report say say the \"Crystal of Ami Fey,\" but... ...how do you know it's this relic right here? Ema: Because Mr. Atishon has stated as much. Apollo: (...Well, I'm not buying it.) Athena: Apollo, I was thinking... The plaintiff's legal name is pretty distinctive. Paul Atishon-Wimperson... Do we have any evidence related to his initials or his name? Apollo: We just might. It might even point out a flaw in something Ema said. Athena: You think her logic's faulty? Apollo: Yeah. If the doctor stole the relic from Mr. Atishon... er, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson... ...then there's one thing the doctor did that doesn't make any sense. Athena: Especially if Paul Atishon-Wimperson was desperately searching for his stolen relic. Apollo: (Okay, time to go over the evidence again.) Present E-Mail (after pressing fifth statement) Apollo: Leads to: \"The doctor stole the relic from the plaintiff?\" Before pressing fifth statement Athena: The trial's barely started and we're already backed into a corner. Apollo: To make matters worse the judge seems to agree with the plaintiff's case. But we've still got to give it our all. After pressing fifth statement Athena: A police report was filed about the crystal's theft a year ago. Apollo: But the theft of the Founder's Orb was only reported a few weeks ago. So the crystal's report was filed way before the orb was found missing. Athena: That suggests the stolen relic is the Crystal of Ami Fey, as Mr. Atishon-Wimperson asserts. Hmm... I doubt the police report is a fake. After all, Ema is the one who submitted it as evidence. Apollo: (Still, I feel like something we learned in the police report is important somehow...) Apollo: The doctor stole the relic from the plaintiff? Are you sure? Because that statement doesn't agree with a certain piece of evidence. Ema: What do you mean? Apollo: Take a look at this. Ema: What about it? Apollo: This contains an e-mail from the doctor's computer. Judge: ...E-mail? In that little piece of plastic? ......... I'm afraid I don't understand. Apollo: Oh, umm... This stick here can store all sorts of computer data. Judge: I still don't get it. Apollo: H-Here, just look at this! Apparently, the doctor was reporting his research findings to a certain individual. Now, take a look at this. It's the police report that Detective Skye presented to this court. You can see the plaintiff's legal name on it. Paul Atishon-Wimperson. Judge: I can see why'd he drop \"Wimperson\" from his name, but that's hardly breaking news. Apollo: Look closer, Your Honor. Phoenix: .........Ah! H-His initials! Apollo: Right. The plaintiff's full legal name is Paul Atishon-Wimperson. Now consider this... The e-mail's recipient address starts with three letters. Ema: P-A-W...? Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Don't tell me--! Apollo: Oh, but I will anyway. The individual who hired the doctor to study the disputed item... ...is none other than Paul Atishon-Wimperson. Ema: Wait, th-then that means... Apollo: Exactly. He wouldn't have asked the man who stole his family heirloom to study it. Therefore, how could this possibly be the Crystal of Ami Fey?! Ema: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! ...We never checked the doctor's e-mails. We couldn't even figure out the password to his computer. Apollo: The plaintiff willingly left the orb in the doctor's care so he could study it... ...at the behest of his \"benefactor\"! Ema: ...Wait. Then what about the police report? I have all the details of the theft right here! Apollo: It's probably for another relic -- the real Crystal of Ami Fey. He's just using the report as a way to claim that our orb is actually his stolen crystal. Phoenix: Phoenix: And how are you certain that \"PAW\" refers to my client's initials? Maybe the e-mail's recipient was a dog lover. Apollo: Perhaps. So let's get to know your client a little better, shall we? Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson! Atishon: Feh. I suppose shutting down detractors is all part of a politician's job. Apollo: Answer me this, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson: what is... Your shoe size? Apollo: What's your shoe size? Atishon: How should I know? Apollo: Wait, you don't know your own shoe size? Atishon: I have all my shoes handcrafted in Italy. And the shoemaker comes to my residence to take the necessary measurements. I have better things to do than memorize trivial information like that. Apollo: (Makes we wish I'd memorized the Italian for \"entitled jerk.\") Judge: Maybe this will help you memorize what happens to those who waste the court's time. Apollo: (I really put my foot in it this time.) Athena: Apollo, no matter what his shoe size is, there wouldn't be enough digits. We're looking for a three-digit number. Apollo: Oh, right. Let's see... Leads back to: \"Answer me this, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson: what is...\" Your favorite food? Apollo: What's your favorite food? Atishon: Curry rice. It's an old family favorite. Apollo: Really? As in, boil up some rice and dump some curry sauce on top? THAT curry rice? Atishon: Heh, I bet you assumed I would say French cuisine... ...just because I'm a member of the political elite. But nothing beats the delectable curry recipe my ancestors bright over from Japan. And I'm the kind of representative who upholds the value of such traditions! Apollo: (Is his entire strategy really just to pander to \"traditional values\" voters?) Judge: Your penalty is served, Mr. Justice. Let this be some food for thought! Athena: Apollo, why don't we take another look at the e-mail address? Apollo: No, it's fine! I just need another crack at this. Leads back to: \"Answer me this, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson: what is...\" Your birthday? Leads to: \"What is your birthday?\" Apollo: What is your birthday? Atishon: My birthday? It's July 11th, but what's it to you? (Changed from [My birthday? It's July 11, but what's it to you?] in the original release) ...Oh, I see. You can address birthday gifts to my office. But, full disclosure... I only accept gifts valued at one thousand dollars or more. (Changed from [But, full disclosure... I only accept gifts valued at $1,000 or more.] in the original release) Phoenix: ......... Judge: ......... Atishon: ...Hm? Why has everyone gone silent? Apollo: (How can anyone be that self-centered? Oh, right... politician.) Did everyone hear that? He said, \"July 11th.\" (Changed from [He said, 'July 11.'] in the original release) July 11 -- or rather, \"711\" -- matches the numbers in the e-mail address. Both the name and birthday are a match! I hardly think that's a coincidence! Atishon: .........Wait... Why you sneaky little--! Apollo: (Looks like someone finally decided to join the conversation.) Would the plaintiff care to explain? Atishon: I-I would like to say... that is q-quite... Apollo: Quite what? Atishon: Q-Quite... a thing... you've said. ......... Apollo Um... Any other thoughts? Atishon: No further comments. I stand by my previous statement. Apollo: Apollo: You can't just walk away. Even politicians have to explain themselves in a court of law! Atishon: ...I'm afraid I simply don't know how it happened. I can't possibly explain matters out of my purview. Perhaps it was a mistake on the part of my secretary? Apollo: (Oh no you don't, you slippery eel.) Mr. Wright, would you care to respond? Phoenix: ...I won't argue your assertion. My client lent the treasure in question to the doctor and asked him to study it. It seems that much is a fact. Apollo: (Now we're getting somewhere!) Phoenix: However, it has no bearing on the issue of ownership. Apollo: ...How so? Phoenix: Mr. Atishon, I fully understand your position here. You HAD to hide the fact that you sent the crystal out to be studied. Your family would've been very upset if they had found out. It's a family heirloom, after all. Apollo: You've got to be kidding me! Atishon: Mr. Wright is, well, right, of course. But then, he always is. That's why he's my lawyer. The crystal is a precious Atishon family heirloom, and has been for centuries. But Dr. Buff was so eager to study its proud heritage, I just couldn't say no. I didn't even tell my grandfather. Apollo: Apollo: But in order to win the backing of your so-called \"benefactor\"... ...you were going to give what you claim to be the Crystal of Ami Fey to that person? You were going to give a precious family heirloom away, just like that? Atishon: ...I-I was going to explain everything to grandfather later! Honest! Phoenix: My client's grandfather is very proud of his grandson for following in his footsteps. And if refusing him would've meant dashing the dreams of his darling grandson... ...I doubt the kindly old man could've said no. Judge: Well, grandchildren ARE meant to be spoiled. That's what grandfathers are for. Apollo: Your Honor... Please. (I mean, it's been in the family for centuries.) Atishon: My grandfather thinks highly of my talents as a politician. That's why he entrusted me with this very important name placard today. So I'm sure he would've been okay with me using the crystal as I saw fit. Apollo: (Grrr... Grandpa's spoiled little brat.) Athena: I think the judge is buying it, Apollo. Apollo: No surprise there. He's always going on and on about his own grandchild, after all. Ema: ...Excuse me. Can I leave now, Mr. Wright? I believe my work here is done. Phoenix: By all means, Detective Skye. Thank you for your assistance. Ema: You're welcome. It's nice to testify at a civil trial once in a while. See you around. Judge: Hmm... It seems the facts have changed somewhat. Mr. Atishon-Wimperson apparently lent his family heirloom to Dr. Buff. Mr. Justice. How would the defense like to proceed? Apollo: Oh, umm... (All right, now what?) Athena: Apollo, let's hear what what they know about this so-called \"Crystal of Ami Fey.\" Maybe we can find some inconsistencies in their statements. Apollo: Right... Okay then, Mr. Wright. If the item in question really is an Atishon family heirloom... ...then let's hear all your client knows about it. Phoenix: ...Of course. Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Please tell the defense everything you know about the crystal's origin. Atishon: All right. Now then, listen and learn. This is the tale of the Crystal of Ami Fey, and the illustrious history of the Atishon clan! Are you ready? Our story begins back in the old country, when the Atishon family reigned supreme... Witness Testimony -- The Illustrious History of the Atishon Clan -- Atishon: My ancestor was praised as a benevolent ruler. He protected the spirit mediums, a minority back then, from the rest of the locals. Some discriminated against them, you see, while others tried to abuse their power. As thanks, Ami Fey gave the crystal she had specially made as a gift to him. I am a descendent of that great lord. As such, my political power and influence is backed by centuries of history! Apollo: (Well, that devolved into a great load of self-aggrandizing propaganda fast.) Phoenix: As you can see... ...the Crystal of Ami Fey is an heirloom of the esteemed House of Atishon. Apollo: And you have proof that it has always been in the Atishon family? Phoenix: ...I have someone who gave a statement to that effect. My client's neighbor -- one Ives Shineto, age eighty-five -- gave the following statement: (Changed from [My client's neighbor -- one Ives Shineto, age 85 -- gave the following statement:] in the original release) \"The Atishons showed me the Crystal back when I was but a lad.\" Apollo: Apollo: Can we really trust the memory of an old man? Phoenix: ...Mr. Justice. Would you care you to explain that statement to the judge? Apollo: Oh... Er, I didn't mean-- What I'm trying to say is, um... Judge: Never underestimate the memory of your elders. I may forget my verdicts the next day, but the memories of my past are clear as day! Therefore, I find Mr. Ives Shineto's statement to be perfectly credible. Athena: Wow, did you see how Mr. Wright got the judge on his side? That's definitely a trick I want up my sleeve. Apollo: *sigh* You're not helping, Athena... Judge: You may cross-examine the witness, Mr. Justice. Cross Examination -- The Illustrious History of the Atishon Clan -- Atishon: My ancestor was praised as a benevolent ruler. Press Apollo: Apollo: Um, that object you set down there... Is it something of importance to you? Atishon: It's a name placard. This one here belonged to my grandfather, Abraham Atishon. He had it custom-made during his distinguished political career. It's special because it was crafted from the finest Italian plastic. Apollo: (I wasn't aware the Italians were famous for their fine plastic...) Atishon: Heh heh heh. You can touch it if you want. Apollo: No, I'm fine. Atishon: Very well. I'll just continue with my testimony. My ancestor was praised as a benevolent ruler. But he was also an eminent politician. Atishon: He protected the spirit mediums, a minority back then, from the rest of the locals. Press Apollo: Apollo: So I take it the relationship with the Fey clan was a close one. Atishon: A smooth and open line of communication with my entire electorate... That is the Paul Atishon way. Apollo: Huh...? Oh, sorry. I was asking about your ancestor. Atishon: Heh. Whether it's about me or my ancestor... ...feel free to ask me anything you'd like. Transparency in government! That's the Paul Atishon way. Apollo: (More like: Dodging questions! That's the Paul Atishon way.) Thanks. I'll be sure to ask when I have something you'll actually answer. Atishon: As I was saying, the Atishon family protected the Fey spirit mediums back then. Atishon: Some discriminated against them, you see, while others tried to abuse their power. Press Apollo: Apollo: Spirit mediums were targets of discrimination? Atishon: Yes. Some people even treated them like they were monsters. The transformation the mediums underwent when channeling spirits frightened the locals. And then there were those who tried to use them. Apollo: You mean they sought to control the channeling powers of the mediums? Atishon: Discriminating against a minority is absolutely despicable. A vote for me is a vote to end discrimination. I vow to root it out wherever it may be! That is my promise to you! Athena: He's totally ignoring your questions. It's like you're a moderator at a political debate. Apollo: Yeah, and only HE cares about his talking points. As thrilling as your campaign is, could we please get back to your testimony? Atishon: Feh. As you wish. Now then, as for the Crystal of Ami Fey... Atishon: As thanks, Ami Fey gave the crystal she had specially made as a gift to him. Press Apollo: Apollo: You said she had it made. So then it was made in Japan? Atishon: That's right. They say she hired a famous craftsman to make it. And they say it's quite valuable, too. Apollo: And you were going to take such a priceless family heirloom... ...and just give it to your patron? Atishon: Feh. That's so typical of you ignorant, common types. Making difficult decisions when the chips are down is what being a politician is all about. Apollo: (But only when it's in service of your own political career, you mean.) Atishon: The crystal is a testament to my ancestor's remarkable achievements. And furthermore... Present Research Notes Apollo: Leads to: \"You stated that Ami Fey had the crystal made for your ancestor.\" Atishon: I am a descendent of that great lord. Press Apollo: Apollo: So tell me, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, are you famous in Kurain Village? Atishon: You could say that. But I find my popularity to be rather bemusing. Apollo: Bemusing? Atishon: Yes, my campaign posters keep going missing as soon as I put them up. My avid supporters and female fans are likely taking them home to hang in their bedrooms. Apollo: (...I guess ignorance really is bliss.) Atishon: Heh heh heh. All this only proves my fine lineage. Atishon: As such, my political power and influence is backed by centuries of history! Press Apollo: Apollo: I'm sorry, but is any of that relevant to the issue of the relic's rightful owner? Atishon: ...Have you never heard of kingcraft? Apollo: Kingcraft? Atishon: It's the art of ruling as a king. My father drilled it into my head from a young age. And one of its precepts states: \"Ruin awaits a ruler who responds to every single issue posed by the masses.\" Apollo: (Well, that answered my question about what he meant by \"king of this nation.\" Progress.) Athena: Apollo, who is this Ami Fey, anyway? Apollo: I believe she was the founder of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Athena: The plaintiff claims she had the crystal made for his ancestor. That would mean it was made in Japan, right? Apollo: Yes, I suppose it would. Apollo: You stated that Ami Fey had the crystal made for your ancestor. So, am I to assume it was made in Japan? Atishon: That's right. The craftsmanship is unbeatable! Apollo: Well, that's strange. I don't see how your so-called crystal could've been made there. Atishon: What are you talking about? Apollo: It's quite obvious if you take a closer look at this. Present motif on Founder's Orb pedestal Apollo: Leads to: \"Take a look at the distinctive design here. According to Dr. Buff...\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: See this part right here? Doesn't it exude a mysterious, exotic charm? Judge: Hmm... I don't know about that. Phoenix: What I do know, Mr. Justice, is your assertion exudes a mysterious amount of nonsense. Apollo: ...Oops. Judge: And I assure you there's no mystery behind a penalty for aimless speculation, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Nope. No mystery there, Your Honor. Athena: Apollo, let's go over everything we have on the orb once more. Maybe there's something that can help us prove it wasn't made in Japan. Apollo: Your Honor, I can prove the orb wasn't made in Japan. Leads back to: \"It's quite obvious if you take a closer look at this.\" Apollo: Take a look at the distinctive design here. According to Dr. Buff... ...it's a mitamah motif dating back to the early days of the Kingdom of Khura'in. Judge: The Kingdom of Khura'in, hmm? And you base this on...? Apollo: Here, this piece of evidence, Your Honor. These are the doctor's research notes on the Founder's Orb. This is the box in which the orb was originally stored. It features the same pattern as the one found on the orb. Judge: Hmm... They do look like the same pattern. Apollo: Therefore, I assert that... ...the disputed item must have been made in the Kingdom of Khura'in! Atishon: AAAAAAAAAHHHH! Eeeeeeek! M-My placard...!!! Phoenix: Phoenix: The Kurain Channeling Technique originated in the Kingdom of Khura'in. And Ami Fey is known to have traveled there to train. With that in mind, what's to say she didn't bring that pattern back with her? Apollo: Apollo: But since this is CLEARLY a Khura'inese design... ...not even you can deny... ...the possibility that it was made there -- in the Kingdom of Khura'in! Phoenix: Phoenix: Anything is possible to some extent. That doesn't make it true. So you can't conclude that the orb is from Khura'in based solely on that pattern. If it were that simple... ...I could just as easily say it's Japanese. Judge: I have to agree with Mr. Wright. The pattern alone proves nothing. But that also means there's no basis to claim that the item in dispute was made in Japan, either. Hmm... At this rate, we're going nowhere fast. Apollo: (...Argh. He's right -- we're just spinning our wheels here.) Athena: I wonder if we have any evidence that could break this stalemate. Apollo: (Hmm... Evidence that could break this stalemate...) Exists Apollo: The defense would like to present a piece of evidence to the court. A piece that will finally break this stalemate! Phoenix: Oh? Well, you've sure piqued my interest. Let's see what you've got. Apollo: ...All right. I will now prove that this is, in fact, the Founder's Orb! Present anything Apollo: Phoenix: And just how does that piece of evidence prove that the relic is the Founder's Orb? Apollo: .........It doesn't, does it? Phoenix: Not by any means I can fathom. Athena: Sorry, Apollo, but I have to agree with the boss on this. Apollo: ...Me too, actually. Judge: Me three, defense! Apollo: Yikes! Judge: Time to think that one over again, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Y-Yes, Your Honor... Leads back to: \"Hmm... Evidence that could break this stalemate...\" Does not exist Leads to: \"There doesn't seem to be anything we can use. At least, not at this point.\" Apollo: There doesn't seem to be anything we can use. At least, not at this point. Athena: Well, unless we can find something, this trial won't be going anywhere. Atishon: ......... *whew* That's much better. Apollo: (What's his deal?) Phoenix: ...I have a suggestion. Why don't we consider this from a different angle? Apollo: I'm listening... Phoenix: What if... ...the Defiant Dragons really were authorized to take possession of the relic? Judge: Hmm... I'm afraid I don't know where you're going with this, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Consider the Orb Transfer Agreement, which states: \"I agree to hand over the Founder's Orb to the Defiant Dragons if I will come to no harm.\" What if, as the last part suggests, this was written under duress? That would render the agreement null and void. Apollo: ...What are you suggesting, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: While you were on your little cave expedition, I was investigating Dr. Buff's accident. And there was something you overlooked, Mr. Justice. Namely, that his \"accident\" might have actually been murder. Apollo: What?! (M-Murder?) Judge: M-Mr. Wright! You do realize such statements are not to be made lightly? Are you suggesting the doctor was murdered by the Defiant Dragons? Phoenix: Yes, but follow me on this for a sec. The books that came tumbling down were from the archeology shelf. However, among that mountain of books was a single volume on psychology. What's more, there was blood on it. Apollo: And you feel this is important because...? Phoenix: The took that came tumbling down were from the top shelf -- the archeology books. We know this because the doctor's books were meticulously organized by subject. Archeology took up the entire shelf, so that psychology book is completely out of place. Apollo: (Come to think of it, the shelves were arranged quite carefully.) Phoenix: It's also worth noting that psychology books only take up a tiny part of the bottom shelf. You might wonder why a book on psychology was found amid the pile of archeology books. But I believe I can explain what that single out-of-place book was doing there. The doctor was struck from behind while selecting a psychology book from the shelf. Apollo: And that's when the blood got on the book? Phoenix: Precisely. And to make it look like an accident... ...he was buried under a mountain of archeology books. Apollo: Apollo: W-Wait a second. This is all just speculation, right? Or do you have proof it was murder? Phoenix: Of course I do. Apollo: Y-You do? Phoenix: On a hunch, I had Detective Skye examine the doctor's head wound. She found that he'd been struck by the corner of some object or another. Apollo: Wait, what?! Phoenix: A would like that couldn't have resulted from a fall to a floor, you know. Do you understand what this means, Mr. Justice? The wound makes it crystal clear that Dr. Buff was murdered! Apollo: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Athena: Well, THAT was unexpected! Who'd have thought we'd break out of the stalemate like this! He pulled the ladder right out from under us. Apollo: (Still, if he thinks that's enough to make me back down, he's got another thing coming!) Even if the cause of death was murder, what makes you think it was the Defiant Dragons? You should know better than to hurl baseless accusations! Phoenix: Phoenix: Did you forget who you were up against, Mr. Justice? Apollo: Huh? Phoenix: You didn't actually think I'd come to court without witnesses and evidence, did you? Apollo: Wh-What are you talking about? Phoenix: I would like to request further testimony from the plaintiff. Specifically... ...I would like the court to hear how he saw one of the rebels leaving the crime scene! Apollo: He-- He-- He saw whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! Athena: If he can prove it was murder, that's the end of our client's right to the orb! Did he have this up his sleeve the whole time?! Apollo: Grrr... How could Mr. Wright do this to us? (He was just waiting to spring this trap!) Phoenix: ...Heh. Judge: Hmm... This trial has taken another unexpected turn. But I must mention, Mr. Wright, that you have yet to identify the murder weapon. Phoenix: The object used to commit the murder was not located at the scene of the crime. The murderer likely disposed of it elsewhere. Dr. Buff's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Judge: Well, I never thought we'd be deliberating the issue of murder at a civil trial. All right, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, your testimony, if you please. Atishon: Heh. Prepare to be dazzled! Dazzled by charismatic oration forged in the crucible of campaign battles! Witness Testimony -- The Rebel's Crime -- Atishon: That evening, I was walking alone, lost in thought. I passed by the doctor's house... and that's when I saw Mr. Are'bal. He was running out the front door. It was around 10 at night. Surely that must've been him fleeing the scene of his crime. A vote for me is a vote to end such violence. That is my promise to you! Judge: So the plaintiff saw a possible suspect fleeing from the doctor's residence? And it was within the window of the estimated time of death? Apollo: ......... (Datz Are'bal! What in the world were you doing there then?!) Study Photo updated in the Court Record. Phoenix: It seems that Mr. Are'bal was loitering about Kurain Village that day. There's evidence that he was in the doctor's study as well. Isn't that right, Mr. Justice? Apollo: ......Ah! You mean the suitcase? Phoenix: Exactly. He must have been in quite a rush to leave that behind. Oh, and by the way, Your Honor... ...Mr. Are'bal just so happens to be sitting in the gallery today. Datz: Ack! Phoenix: See? That's him trying to escape as we speak. Judge: Bailiff! Don't let that man get away! Datz: Wright, you backstabber! Why are you doing this to meeee?! Judge: All right. The... counsel-slash-defense may question the plaintiff-slash-witness once more. ...Ahem. Please proceed, Mr. Justice. Cross Examination -- The Rebel's Crime -- Atishon: That evening, I was walking alone, lost in thought. Press Apollo: Apollo: Why were you taking a walk? Atishon: Society is inundated with serious problems that must be solved. And as a politician... ...I'm always on the job, thinking hard about possible solutions, even on my walks. Apollo: Umm... (Thanks for the non-answer.) Atishon: While we live out our comfy lives... ...there are starving children who suffer in the back alleys of our major cities. It's not in me to ignore such suffering! A vote for me, is a vote to end hunger. ...And for world peace! Phoenix: Yes, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, we are well aware of your outstanding character. Now, please continue with your testimony. Atishon: Heh heh heh. I can practically hear my poll numbers surging. Now, on with my speech. After all, the voting public must be informed of the magnificence that is me! Atishon: I passed by the doctor's house... and that's when I saw Mr. Are'bal. Press Apollo: Apollo: Where exactly were you when you saw Mr. Are'bal? Atishon: Right here, under this tree. I saw him dashing out of Dr. Buff's front door. Apollo: And he didn't notice you? Atishon: No. I was hidden by the tree. Judge: Is it really all that important to know from where the plaintiff saw Dr. Buff? No, it isn't Apollo: No, I don't believe it bears any relevance to this case. Judge: All right, then. Will the witness please continue with his testimony? Leads back to cross-examination Yes, it is Apollo: Yes, I believe it matters a lot. I ask that it please be added to the witness's testimony. Adds statement \"I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal.\" if not already added Atishon: I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal. Press Apollo: Apollo: What were you doing under that tree? Atishon: A lack of lateral thinking... That is a politician's downfall. Apollo: What? Atishon: That is why, if I'm elected... I promise to think outside the box! Apollo: Um... uh... The question was, what were you doing under the tree, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. Atishon: Feh... I suppose I can't expect a plebeian such as yourself to understand my grand design. Apollo: (Oh, yeah? Try me, O Lord of Plebs.) Phoenix: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. I believe the court is well aware of your grand political vision. Now, let's have the rest of your testimony, if you please. Atishon: Heh, I can hardly wait for the upcoming election. Atishon: He was running out the front door. Press Apollo: Apollo: Did you notice anything unusual? Atishon: Yes, his behavior was incredibly suspicious. His eyes were darting all around as he ran off in total panic. As soon as I saw that, I knew he had done something, and it probably wasn't good. Apollo: Despite that, you still didn't report it to the police? Atishon: Who would've thought he had killed Dr. Buff? Not me. That's why I didn't report him. Judge: So the witness didn't notify the police. Is that an important statement, Mr. Justice? No, it isn't Apollo: No, it's not important. Judge: Hmm... All right, then. Let's have the witness continue with his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Yes, it is Apollo: Yes, it's important. I request that the witness add it to his testimony. Atishon: ...Feh. Sure, why not. Adds statement \"I had no idea Dr. Buff was dead. That's why I didn't call the police.\" if not already added Atishon: I had no idea Dr. Buff was dead. That's why I didn't call the police. Press Apollo: Apollo: You had no idea he was dead. In other words, you knew nothing about what had happened? Atishon: I am truly ashamed of myself. Apollo: What? Atishon: There's been a gruesome murder in my beloved village. What a fool I've been! I was thinking only of the village's future and world peace! It seems my earnest attitude and industrious nature have come back to haunt me! Apollo: (Only a politician would try to pass off self-aggrandizement as self-deprecation.) Athena: Apollo, you think this is how all politicians will be from now on? Apollo: We're all doomed if they are... Atishon: If you don't mind, I'd like to continue with my testimony. Present Study Photo or Study Diagram (after adding statement \"I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal.\") Apollo: Leads to: \"Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, rather than Mr. Are'bal...\" Atishon: It was around 10 at night. Surely that must've been him fleeing the scene of his crime. Press Apollo: Apollo: But at the time, you didn't know the doctor was dead. Is that correct? Atishon: ...It's true that I've been known as a prodigy from a very young age. Apollo: Huh? Atishon: I graduated high school and college with exceptional grades. As class president... ...I reformed stale old school traditions. My exploits were even covered in local papers. But as exceptional as I am, I can't possibly be expected to know everything at all times. Apollo: (This isn't working. He keeps bending the questions to serve his own needs.) Athena: Hang in there, Apollo! Phoenix: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. I believe the court is well aware of your exceptional nature. Now, would you please continue with your testimony? Atishon: Heh heh heh. I have the upcoming election in the bag. Atishon: A vote for me is a vote to end such violence. That is my promise to you! Press Apollo: Apollo: So, how do you actually intend to end such violence? Atishon: Elite politicians such as myself never reveal their strategies. Did you really think I would divulge such sensitive information to the likes of you? Apollo: Yeah, but, surely you have some sort of campaign platform you're running on? Atishon: ................................... ...No comment. Apollo: (Clearly, his is a platform, told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.) Before adding either statement Athena: They're accusing the Defiant Dragons of murder. If this sticks, we'll lose the orb! Apollo: Yeah, we need to sink Paul Atishon's testimony before it's too late. (Mr. Wright is pulling out all the stops. Then again, I'd expect nothing less from him.) After adding statement \"I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal.\", but before adding statement \"I had no idea Dr. Buff was dead. That's why I didn't call the police.\" Athena: He saw Mr. Are'bal from under that tree? Apollo, maybe there's some sort of an inconsistency there. Apollo: Hmm, I wonder... Athena: Why don't we review the evidence? Apollo: (Yeah. Maybe there's something we overlooked.) After adding statement \"I had no idea Dr. Buff was dead. That's why I didn't call the police.\", but before adding statement \"I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal.\" Athena: He didn't know the doctor was dead? Well, I guess that makes sense, considering the body was inside the study. Apollo: Right, how could he have known? (Guess I could find out where our weaselly witness was when he saw Datz.) After adding both statements Apollo: He said he saw Datz from under the tree. If that's true, then... Athena: Did you figure something out? Apollo: Yeah, I think he's hiding something. Let's take another look at the evidence, Athena. Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, rather than Mr. Are'bal... ...wasn't there's something else that should've had your undivided attention? Atishon: Like what? ...Oh, yes, of course! A politician must also keep his finger on the electorate's pulse, and focus on the nation's-- Apollo: Sorry, but you're way off. Atishon: I am? Hmm... Judge: Would you care to explain, Mr. Justice? Apollo: If the witness saw Mr. Are'bal from his position here... ...then he should've also been able to see the doctor's body. After all, it was right next to a huge window. Judge: Why, I believe you have a point there! Apollo: With the body THAT clearly visible to the witness... ...it's unthinkable that he wouldn't have reported it to the police! Phoenix: Ah! Judge: Hmm... Would the witness care to respond? Atishon: ........................... Apollo: ......... (Did he... fall asleep?) Judge: ...Um, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Atishon: ........................... Judge: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson!!! Atishon: Huh?! Oh, um. Hmm... There are many sides to any issue. Apollo: (What did I ever do to deserve this?) In any case, I'd like the court to acknowledge in the inconsistency in the witness's testimony. Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, did you really see Mr. Are'bal? Atishon: Yes! .................. Apollo: Apollo: Where do you think you're going?! Atishon: Oh, I thought I would return to my seat, seeing as I had already answered the question. Apollo: This isn't some small town hall debate, so you just stay right there until I say we're through. Atishon: I-I'll have to run that by my campaign manager before I... Apollo: Apollo: .........*glare* Atishon: *gulp* Phoenix: ...Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. I think it's time for you to come clean. Atishon: Huh?! Apollo: ...So then, does this mean he DIDN'T see Mr. Are'bal? Phoenix: As your lawyer, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson... ...I advise you divulge that matter we discussed. Silence is no longer an option. Atishon: ...Err, are you sure about this? I'm in the midst of running for office! I can't afford to let any strange rumors get out. Phoenix: Don't worry. You won't suffer any blowback for what you're about to reveal. Judge: \"Blowback\"? I'm not sure I like the sound of that, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Not to worry, Your Honor. Nothing untoward will come of this, I promise. Now then, Mr. Justice. Remember how it was an anonymous caller that reported the doctor's death? Apollo: Come to think of it... Apollo: Ema, who was the first one to discover the body? Ema: About that... Whoever it was, it seems they wanted to remain anonymous. Apollo: What? Ema: It happens now and then. Some people would rather not get involved with the police. Apollo: Wait... You're not saying that... Phoenix: Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. The anonymous source who contacted the police after discovering the body was... ...my client, Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson. Apollo: Wh-What?! (Y-You don't say...) Phoenix: So you see, he played his part as a concerned citizen -- quite admirably, if I may say so. Isn't that right? Atishon: .........Y-Yes, indeed... In our society today, there are too many who choose indifference over righteous action. But I don't number among them. That's why I did my duty as a concerned citizen. One might call me THE model citizen -- one worthy of standing above all the rest! Apollo: (What a real standard-bearer he is, reporting it anonymously.) Phoenix: ...Oh, and by the way, Mr. Justice. Wasn't there someone else at the scene of the crime when my client discovered the body? Apollo: ...Oh, um, you mean Mr. Are'bal? He would have been leaving the doctor's house right around then... Wait, th-that means...! Phoenix: Yes, it does. In short... ...what my client witnessed was Mr. Are'bal fleeing the scene of a heinous murder! Apollo: ...Aaaaaaah! Phoenix: And that's not all! Based on what we've heard so far... ...Mr. Are'bal looked exceedingly suspicious, and that's putting it mildly. We already know the Defiant Dragons threatened the doctor with bodily harm. And now that they've killed him, the so-called Orb Transfer Agreement is null and void! Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Athena: A-Apollo! If we don't come up wit with some sort of counterargument...! Apollo: A-And what sort of evidence do you have? Can you actually prove that it was Mr. Are'bal who killed the doctor? Athena: That move had \"desperate\" written all over it. Apollo: It's all I've got, so I'm going with it! Phoenix: ...Evidence? I suppose it's true that I don't have any... Apollo: I-I knew it! Phoenix: But I do have another witness. Apollo: You do? Phoenix: You should know I always come fully prepared, Mr. Justice. And my new witness will provide testimony proving Mr. Are'bal's guilt. Apollo: ...Gnrggh! Athena: A new witness? I wonder who it could be. Judge: ...Very well. Bailiff, please summon our new witness. In the meantime, the court will take a brief recess. I would like both sides to use this time to prepare properly, understood? May 17District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Apollo: Wow. I knew Mr. Wright would put up a tough fight, but... Athena: Yeah! Just when I thought we had him, he'd turn the tables on us. He really is the Turnabout Terror. Apollo: (We can't let him blindside us again.) Datz: Looks like they've got me again! Three times in one year! \"Datz\" a new record! Har har har har har har! Apollo: Datz, please... No more new records -- or bad puns, while you're at it. It's hard enough trying to help you as it is. Datz: Roger that. I'll be more careful next time! Dhurke: Datz, is what Mr. Wright said true? Did you really pay a visit to Dr. Buff that night? Datz: Sure did. Can't remember the exact time, though. All I know is he wouldn't hand over the orb. Someone put it in his head that we rebels were dangerous. That's why he threw me out. Apollo: So the doctor was still alive when Datz last saw him. Athena: We'll still have to prove it, though. Dhurke: ...Better brace yourself, son. The next witness's testimony could make or break this case. Apollo: Yeah, I know. Hey, where's Trucy? Athena: She went to go see her dad. Apollo: Hmm... Maybe she's still mad. Athena: More like worried. Worried that this trial will create a rift between you two... ...and that you might then leave the agency. Apollo: Ha ha ha. She has an active imagination. Bailiff: Excuse me. The trial will be resuming shortly. Apollo: Well, let's go see what new testimony awaits us. May 17District Court - Courtroom No. 6 Judge: All right, court is back in session. Mr. Wright, you said you had a witness...? Phoenix: Your Honor, I would like to call the lone survivor of the doctor's murder to the stand. Apollo: (Wait.. He can't mean... that Sarge is here?) You mean Dr. Buff's reclusive son? How did you get him to cooperate? Phoenix: ...Nothing a little persuasion couldn't handle. The poor child only agreed to help if it meant catching the killer. Apollo: (Getting a kid like that to overcome his fear... Now that's impressive.) Athena: This must be really important testimony for the kid to come out in public like this. Judge: Very well, Mr. Wright. Please call your witness to the stand. Judge: .........Oh, my! Sarge: Sergeant Buff at your service, sir! Apollo: ...He's here as the drone? Really? Judge: ...Um, Mr. Wright? What exactly is the meaning of this? Phoenix: Past trauma has rendered it impossible for the witness to venture into public. Leaving home was hard enough. And it seems leaving the witness lobby was just too much. But I would still like to continue with testimony delivered via this drone. Judge: Hmm... I understand it must be terrible to lose one's father like that... ...but testimony via a remote control toy? .........Well, let's take things for a spin and see how it goes. Apollo: (Just who's piloting this trial, anyway?!) Athena: The judge sure warmed up to the idea fast. Apollo: I think the phrase you're looking for is \"gave up.\" Sarge: You disappoint me, Corporal Justice! To think I once called you comrade! Apollo: AAAAAAAAAGH! Sarge: Defending the man who killed Papa?! That's full-on treason, soldier! I hereby demote you back to \"private\"! Athena: \"Corporal\"? \"Private\"? What's he talking about, Apollo? Apollo: It's... a long story. Judge: Now then, are you ready to testify, youngster? Sarge: Locked and loaded, sir! Ready to rain lead down upon the perpetrator! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Witness Testimony -- What Happened That Evening -- Sarge: Papa met with someone the night he died. I didn't have eyes on the ground, as I'd already mounted my siege defense, but... ...I did hear him arguing with someone in his study! From my window, I saw the one designated \"Datz\" getting ejected from the premises. After that, the man lingered around the perimeter for some time. He must have regrouped and killed my papa in the study later -- I just know it! Judge: Hmm... So he was thrown out, but later returned and committed the murder, did he? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. So the man my client saw... ...really must have been the fleeing Mr. Are'bal. Datz: Datz: Objeeeeection! Wright, you backstabbing, no good--! I-I didn't kill no one! Sarge: It's the enemy! Ready all missiles! And... FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRE!! Datz: WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA!!! Sarge: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Capitalist pig! I'll turn you into pork stroganoff! And that's just a taste of my ultimate anti-swine weapon! Apollo: (Whoa! It fires missiles, too?!) Judge: ...Yes, well, the witness is all yours, Mr. Justice. Cross Examination -- What Happened That Evening -- Sarge: Papa met with someone the night he died. Press Apollo: Apollo: Your father met with \"someone\"? Could you be more specific? Sarge: No. I was in the midst of a crucial defensive siege operation. Apollo: Right... You're referring to how you don't leave your room, correct? Sarge: You never know where the enemy might be lurking outside the siege perimeter. Apollo: What about, you know, school? Sarge: Oh, uhhh... I don't go to boot camp! I'm a soldier! A sergeant doesn't associate with rookies still too green to fight! Apollo: (With a kid like this, I bet Dr. Buff won't be getting any rest in the afterlife, either.) Judge: Hmm... It was very brave of you to come to the courthouse today. But what was that you said about a siege defense? Sarge: Oh, that? Well... Sarge: I didn't have eyes on the ground, as I'd already mounted my siege defense, but... Press Apollo: Apollo: Um, Sarge? I've always wondered... ...who or what are you battling? Sarge: ! Th-That's... classified. Apollo: Even so, it may be relevant to this case. Phoenix: Phoenix: Umm... I don't know if YOU'RE the right person to be asking things like that... Athena: That's right. Such matter need to be handled with a certain delicacy. Apollo: Oh, ha ha ha. I guess curiosity got the better of me. Sarge: You're all talk and no action, soldier! Out on the battlefield, it ain't the number of pretty words in yer repertoire... ...but the number of bullets in yer gun belt that counts! Apollo: (Easy for you to say. You're the one with all of them. Judge: Would the witness please tell the court what he saw and heard that night? Present Sarge's Drone Apollo: Leads to: \"Sarge, are you hiding something from me?\" Sarge: ...I did hear him arguing with someone in his study! Press Apollo: Apollo: What was the argument about? Sarge: I heard things like, \"Where's the orb?!\" and \"Are you Defiant Dragons really criminals?!\" It sounded real volatile, like a war might break out any second! Apollo: (So the two of them had an argument when Datz came to get the orb.) Did you see or hear anything else? Sarge: Yeah. I heard them arguing, and then, silence. Sarge: From my window, I saw the one designated \"Datz\" getting ejected from the premises. Press Apollo: Apollo: How was Mr. Are'bal acting? Sarge: Like a conquered trooper retreating with his tail between his legs. Apollo: A \"trooper\"...? Well, I guess he does dress like he's in the military. Athena: I bet those two would have really hit it off had they met under different circumstances. Apollo: Yeah, I can see that. Sarge: And so, the defeated soldier was expelled. But that wasn't the end. Sarge: After that, the man lingered around the perimeter for some time. Press Apollo: Apollo: That... does seem suspicious. Sarge: He kept hiding behind trees and telephone poles, and stealing glances at our house. Apollo: Well, he couldn't exactly leave without the orb...) Sarge: I bet he was angry that he'd been kicked out. Sarge: He must have regrouped and killed my papa in the study later -- I just know it! Press Apollo: Apollo: But don't you keep your front door unlocked? If so, anyone could've gotten in.. Sarge: That's true. Papa didn't keep our house locked up. He said there was no need because there were only good people in Kurain Village. Apollo: (Yet he ended up dead, anyway.) Sarge: Only a monster could do what they did to my kind, trusting Papa! There will be no mercy! I vow swift and terrible vengeance! I'll carpet-bomb the killer with everything in my arsenal! FIIIIIIRE!!! Judge: While I sympathize with you, witness, you will refrain from firing Gatling guns in this court. Athena: So Sarge saw Datz, too. Apollo: And just when I thought things couldn't get any worse. I wonder why he hung around after getting thrown out? Athena: I hate to say this, but if Datz is proven to be the killer... ...we'll lose the orb to the plaintiff. So our only option is to prove the Defiant Dragons had nothing to do with the murder! Apollo: Sarge, are you hiding something from me? Sarge: H-How dare you question your superior officer like that! You wanna get in on this stroganoff action with pig-boy over there, soldier?! Apollo: Sorry, but I'm afraid lawyers are missile-proof. Sarge: Wh-What?! Judge: Would the defense care to explain? Apollo: It's simple, Your Honor. Just as he is able to see what is happening in court right now... ...Sarge was able to see what happening in the study then. With his cherished drone, of course. Judge: Ahhh! Now that you mention it... And to think, the answer was right before our eyes this whole time. Apollo: Sarge! You were perfectly capable of patrolling the study that night! So you must've seen something! Sarge: Aaaaaaaaaagh! I'm hit! What is this strange new weaponry you're using against me?! Apollo: Courtroom warriors don't use guns or missiles, because evidence is our weapon of choice! And the evidence has exposed your bald-faced lie! My truth bomb, Sarge... has stripped your defenses bare! Sarge: A t-t... truth bomb?! Noooooooooooo! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH! Mayday, mayday!!! I'm going doooooooown!!! Judge: Oh, my! Are you all right?! Sarge: *cough* *sputter* Evidence... Never have I seen such fearsome ordnance. Apollo: Tell it to us straight, Sarge. After all, you want to help your father, don't you? Sarge: Papa... Apollo: Yes. You want to find out who killed him, don't you? So please. Tell us what you saw that night. Sarge: ...It's... It's... It's not what you think. I-I... I... I didn't see anything. I swear...! Apollo: ...You sure? You seem awfully stressed for someone who didn't see anything. Sarge: ...Grrrrrrr! Apollo: UWAAAAAAHHH! ...S-Sarge. You need to answer my question. Sarge: Shut your piehole, maggot! It'll be a scorching day in Siberia before a lowly private like you orders me around! Apollo: (...What's with him and Siberia, of all places? But if a scorching day is what it'll take, then maybe it's time to turn up the heat.) Hey, Athena. You think a therapy session might help? Athena: Well, it could help alleviate some of his anxiety. NOISE LEVEL100% Athena: ...Plus, I'm picking up a lot of discord in Sarge's voice. That usually means the patient wants to say something, but can't for some reason. Apollo: And in Sarge's case, I imagine whatever's plaguing him is pretty severe. In that case, I leave it to you and your Mood Matrix magic! Athena: You got it! Your Honor, I believe I can be of help here. Judge: Time for a therapy session, is it, Ms. Cykes? Athena: Yes. It will help the witness with his anxiety -- maybe even enough to testify! Judge: Then by all means, please bring the poor child out into the light of day. ...Oh, but I assume this will be all right with you, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Why not? It's not like we all haven't been through this before. Sarge: Wh-What are you butting in for, lady?! There ain't a place on this battlefield for you! Athena: Athena: I beg to differ, Sarge. This G.I. Jane's always ready for a fight in the courtroom! And wait until you see what I've got in my arsenal -- analytical psychology! With it, I'm going to blow a big ol' hole in the armor you've built around your heart! Sarge: UWAAAAAAH! First evidence, now analytical psychology?! Where are these WMDs coming from?! ...W-Well, if it's a battle you want, bring it on! You may have started this war, but I'm going to end it, Corpswoman Cykes! Athena: You got it, Sarge. Time to seek out the agony buried deep in your heart. Widget: Brace yourself! Sarge: I stayed in my room with my drone that evening. Sarge: I heard Datz and Papa arguing with each other. Sarge: Datz got kicked out, but I saw him still hanging around outside. Pinpoint Surprised marker Apollo: Leads to: \"That's strange...\" Sarge: I was in my room, so I didn't know Papa was dead until the next day. Pinpoint Surprised marker Apollo: Leads to: \"That's strange... You reacted with shock when you discovered your father's body... \" Apollo: So I'm looking for unexpected emotions and unnatural reactions, right? Athena: Right -- emotions and reactions that don't fit the content of his testimony. When you find one, make sure you point it out to me. Also, remember not to view his emotional reactions in isolation. Sometimes, it's important to see how they change from one statement to the next. Apollo: Okay, I'll give it a try. Apollo: That's strange... You reacted with shock when you discovered your father's body... ...yet, you weren't nearly as shocked then as when you saw Mr. Are'bal. Normally, you'd expect the death of one's father to be much more impactful. Sarge: ...Enemy fire! Direct hit!!! Athena: That IS strange. I wonder what it could mean. Apollo: Well, we know he wasn't as affected by his father's death as he should've been. And I think I know why. Athena: Oh? Apollo: Sarge, you weren't as shocked at seeing your father's body as seeing Mr. Are'bal because... You're scared of Mr. Are'bal Apollo: Maybe you were scared of him? Sarge: Why you--! How could you even THINK I was scared of that capitalist pig! Apollo: So you weren't scared? Sarge: Listen up, trainee! You feckless amateurs don't even know what true fear is! Naïve little babies like you wouldn't last two seconds out there. So he's your first lesson, private! A heaping spoonful of true, battlefield terror! Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Athena: I think that means you were wrong. But there's no need to look so bitter about it, Apollo. Apollo: No, but that was some bitter medicine... (Ugh, the aftertaste of failure...) Leads back to: \"Sarge, you weren't as shocked at seeing your father's body as seeing Mr. Are'bal because...\" You'd already seen his body Leads to: \"Sarge...\" Something else shocked you Apollo: Did... something else shock you when you saw Mr. Are'bal? Something even more shocking than your father's death? Athena: Hmm, like what exactly, Apollo? Apollo: I don't know... Maybe a mouse or a cockroach? Athena: Eeeuuuwww, gross!!! Sarge: Foolish cannon fodder! Vermin are powerless in the fact of my deadly arsenal! I'll pump 'em full of lead! Apollo: Sounds kinda messy, don't you think? Sarge: ...Ah! Th-Then I'll develop new weaponry! Maybe a flamethrower'd do the trick... Apollo: S-Sure... As long as you keep it \"for vermin use only\"... Athena: Guess it wasn't something like mice or cockroaches after all, huh. Apollo: No, but it was worth a try -- especially to see your reaction. (*sigh* What else could it be...?) Leads back to: \"Sarge, you weren't as shocked at seeing your father's body as seeing Mr. Are'bal because...\" Apollo: Sarge... Maybe the truth is, you left your room that night. And that's when you saw it -- your father's body. Sarge: I-I saw no such thing! Apollo: Really? You didn't see his body? All right then, what DID you see? Sarge: Err... NOISE LEVEL70% Athena: Look, Apollo! We've lost some noise! Apollo: So, just as I suspected... he really did see something. Sarge! Please. Tell us what you saw. Sarge: Ooh... B-B-But... .................. ........................... I-I... The moment I saw it, ooh... ...I-I.. I couldn't bear it. I couldn't stand to lose yet another loved one. Apollo: Huh? (Am I missing something here?) Is that you weren't very shocked when you found out your father was dead? Because you had already sensed he was a goner somehow? Sarge: M-Maybe... Apollo: Please, Sarge. What was it you saw on the night of your father's murder? Sarge: Ooh... Gah gah gah gah. I-I... I saw... ...Agh. Gah. Hrgh. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! UHWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Apollo: Wh-What's happening?! (I don't like where this is going...) Sarge: YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH! NO MORE! NO MORE, PLEEEEEEAAASE!!! Athena: Eeeeeek! Widget: Help! Sarge: I've confiscated your little toy! The battlefield has no place for unauthorized equipment! Athena: W-Widget...! A-Apollo! I can't continue the rest of the session without him! Judge: C-Calm yourself this instant, witness! I hereby order you to submit to your therapy session! What in blazes...?! Sarge: Lookit me! I'm judge, jury, and executioner now! I hereby convene a military tribunal! Apollo: Whoa, whoa... This has gone way too far. Judge: B-Bailiff! Arrest that drone this instant! Sarge: RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWRRRRRR! Bailiff: Stop resisting! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGHHHHH! If you don't come quietly, I'll--! Sarge: FIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRE! Bailiff: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Athena: Give Widget back right-- EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEKKK!!! .................................................................. Athena: *huff* *puff* *cough, cough* Whew, finally got him back. Apollo: Nice work. Judge: Hmm... This witness is truly a handful. Sarge: Ooh... hup, two, three, four... Uwoooooooooooooooooooooooooooh! Phoenix: Ms. Cykes, what is the witness's current psychological state? Athena: Let's see... He's emotionally all over the map. Apollo: So his out-of-control emotions are in control of him, huh. Does that mean we can calm him down if we can figure out the root cause? Athena: Yes. So let's see what we can find. Sarge! Can you hear me? Sarge: Ooh... I-Is that you, Corpswoman Cykes? Athena: I'm here. Now, I want you to take a few deep breaths. Just try to relax. Try it with me. Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out. Sarge: In... Out... In... Out... Athena: And now... Let your emotions take you where they will. Go on, just let it all out! Sarge: UHWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!!! All forces, attaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack! Apollo: (...That's the LEAST relaxing breathing exercise I've ever seen.) Sarge: Datz was still hanging around after he got kicked out when... Sarge: ...I heard more fighting, and I got worried about Papa. Sarge: So I left my room, but suddenly... Sarge: ...I got dizzy and passed out. Sarge: I remember a flame lighting up the room... Probe Flames Apollo: Leads to: \"That's it!\" Sarge: ...and Papa grinning with delight. Probe Flames Apollo: Leads to: \"That's it!\" Sarge: That's when he must have been killed. If only I hadn't passed out! Apollo: So he has two out-of-control emotions, huh. And all we have to do is find out what's causing them to run wild like this? Athena: Yes. Whatever the cause, it should appear somewhere in the Mood Matrix. Let me know if you think you've found it. Apollo: Ugh... Easier said than done. Don't suppose you have any ideas on where to start? Athena: Well... I would think about Sarge's personality and his past. Those are the things that shape a person's emotions. You should be able to find something to work with from there! Apollo: That's it! Sarge... You were overcome with shock and fear when you saw those flames, weren't you? Sarge: Was I...? Apollo: Yes. Just six months ago... ...you and your mother were caught up in an arsonist's blaze. So it's no wonder you would be extremely scared of fire. Sarge: ...Y-Yes, that does make sense. Athena: And maybe, just maybe... ...your subconscious fear of fire was what caused you to withdraw from the world. Sarge: What do you mean, Corpswoman Cykes? Athena: In the outside world, you were bound to come across all sorts of fire. Candles, cigarettes... heck, even the grill at a diner. Even if it's not that often, just the idea that you might see them... ...grew bigger and bigger until you couldn't shut it out. Sarge: ...! I... I think you might be onto something. Candles, cigarettes... Just thinking about them sends a chill down my spine. Apollo: (Wow, the things I take for granted.) Sarge: Now I see. I was afraid... Afraid of the fire. Strange, I didn't even realize it myself. Apollo: About that fire, Sarge... Can you tell me what it was burning? Athena: Just stay calm and maybe something will come to you. Sarge: Oh, umm... ............. ..................Oh! I'm starting to remember! I-It was...! It was that relic! That relic Papa was studying... It was on fire! Apollo: The orb... was on fire? Sarge: Mm-hm. It's still kind of fuzzy...  ...but yes, the \"orb\" was burning right in front of Papa. And there... in the flames was... ...Mama? Yes! Now I remember... I saw Mama appear amid the dancing flames! Apollo: Wait... WHAAAAAAAAAT?! NOISE LEVEL30% Apollo: Wh-What's going on here? Athena: Maybe it's a memory from the fire that killed his mother. Hmm... He might be confusing it with what really happened when his father died. Apollo: So let me guess... More therapy? Athena: Yep. But this time, it seems there's an inconsistency in his statements. And I think we should be able to prove that with the evidence at hand. Apollo: (I hope this inconsistency is the key... ...to proving that the relic is really the Founder's Orb!) Sarge: Datz was still hanging around after he got kicked out when... Sarge: ...I heard more fighting, and I got worried about Papa. Sarge: So I left my room, but suddenly, I got dizzy and passed out. Sarge: I remember a flame lighting up the room, and Papa grinning with delight. Sarge: The relic was on fire, and I saw Mama's face inside. Sarge: That's when he must have been killed. If only I hadn't passed out! Present Founder's Orb Apollo: Leads to: \"Don't blame yourself, Sarge.\" Athena: I believe Sarge's fear of fire is triggering a past memory. As a result, the memory of what he really saw is being suppressed. When he tries to remember, the past memory is being overlaid onto the more recent one. Apollo: Wow, the mind sure is a tricky beast. So, I'll just have to find an inconsistency? Athena: Right. Once you find an inconsistent statement... ...present the evidence that proves it. Apollo: (The main issue here is when the doctor was murdered. Was he really killed while Datz was there?) Apollo: Don't blame yourself, Sarge. After all, even if you hadn't passed out... ...the outcome would've been the same. Sarge: What do you mean? Apollo: I'm talking about the time of death. Your father wasn't killed right after you left your room. Sarge: Wh-What?! Explain yourself at once, Private Justice! Apollo: You said you saw your father burning the orb, right? But that night, he went out to hide it in a cave. So, what you saw, Sarge... ...was something that happened before your father left to hide the orb. Sarge: Ah! Apollo: So you see, you didn't pass out right before he was killed. You passed out right before he left for the cave, to hide the orb in the ruins within. Sarge: S-So, even if I hadn't passed out... Apollo: That's right. The outcome would've been exactly the same. That's because your father, Dr. Buff, was killed after he returned from the ruins. And therefore, Sarge, there's no need to blame yourself. Sarge: Oh... I see... .............. ................................ Private Justice... Can... Can you really say I bear no blame in this? Apollo: ...Why do you ask? Sarge: .........Because... the truth is... ...if I hadn't engaged in my siege defense, Papa would still be alive. Apollo: Sarge... Sarge: Papa wished nothing more than for me to lead a happy, healthy life. That's why he quit his job and moved us out, away from the big city. But even then, I didn't have the courage to set foot into the outside world. And in the end... ...I failed to make Papa's wish come true. Sarge: ..................... ???: ...Um, Sarge? Athena: If you want to make your father's wish come true... If that's what you really want... ...then who's to say it's too late? Why don't you take the first step now? Sarge: ...My first step? Athena: That's right. You can cast off all your regret. You can stop standing still and start moving forward. You have the power within you. I know from experience. I know what's it like to feel like you do. But only you... only you can decide to take the first step! Sarge: ................................ Apollo: If you don't change your tactics now, Sarge... ...the victory you seek in the war you're waging will always lie beyond your grasp. Sarge: ................................................ Hmm... I think I understand now. I've... I've made up my mind! Apollo: ! Sarge: As of this moment... ...I will suspend my siege defense indefinitely! Apollo: ...............Huh? ???: S-Sergeant Buff, r-reporting for duty. Apollo: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! I-I-I thought you were a guy! Athena: You're DEFINTELY not the gruff drill sergeant I envisioned! ???: W-Well, my mama was in the Russian army. Phoenix: I was just as shocked, but it certainly explained a few things when I found out, too. May I introduce to you Miss Armie Buff, age twelve. (Changed from [May I introduce to you Miss Armie Buff, age 12.] in the original release) Apollo: N-No way... Armie: Careful, soldier! Don't forget I could blow you away at a moment's notice! Athena: S-She's just too cute... Apollo: So... Have you always been in a wheelchair, Sarge? Armie: Negative. Only since I was injured... in the fire. Judge: Umm... Your voice sounds awfully different from before. Armie: My drone features a voice modulation device. It's just one of my army's many technological marvels. Judge: Well, you fooled me. I thought some twenty-something military fanatic was at the controls. Armie: I-If it's all the same to you, troops, I'd like to continue my testimony! I've just remembered something! And it's as crisp and clear as a trumpet at roll call. Apollo: What did you remember? Armie: It wasn't my mother who appeared in the burning orb. It was some lady Papa had shown me a picture of a long time ago. He said it was the Holy Mother, the founder of Khura'inism. She appeared right there, right in the burning orb! Apollo: Huh...?! Phoenix: What did you just say?! NOISE LEVEL0%BYE BYE Athena: The Holy Mother of Khura'inism was in the burning orb? Wh-What does that even mean? Phoenix: ...I have a bad feeling about this. Apollo: Could it be...? Could this explain what Sarge means by the Holy Mother appearing in the burning orb? Present Research Notes Apollo: Leads to: \"Dr. Buff's research notes? What do they have to do with this?\" Present anything else Apollo: Armie: What's that? Apollo: A piece of related evidence. Wouldn't you agree? Although, to be honest, I'd have to plead the fifth if you asked me how certain I was. Sarge: Private! Did you really think such a cockamamie plan would rout out the enemy?! Apollo: Yiiiiiikes! {I'd better be more careful!) Athena: If the orb was burning, maybe the evidence you're looking for has to do with fire. Apollo: Yeah, I know. Leads back to: \"Could this explain what Sarge means by the Holy Mother appearing in the burning orb?\" Athena: Dr. Buff's research notes? What do they have to do with this? Apollo: Look at this! The burning orb, the appearance of the founder -- this part points to both! Present third stanza of Song of Ceremony Apollo: Leads to: \"There's a legend about the orb involving a mysterious riddle.\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: It's all... right here! Athena: Umm.. I'm not seeing it. Apollo: Well, it's... Maybe you can explain it, Athena. Athena: I'M not the one who's supposed to explain things when YOU'RE the one presenting! Apollo: (Yikes, she's really mad. I'd better come up with something before her anger burns me to a crisp.) Leads back to: \"Look at this! The burning orb, the appearance of the founder -- this part points to both!\" Apollo: There's a legend about the orb involving a mysterious riddle. And this song, in turn, is said to contain the key to solving it. If the legend is true, then I believe the answer lies in this part of the song: \"Offer thy prayers as fervent as fire Only then shall the Holy Mother return.\" ...Well? Anyone see where I'm going with this? Phoenix: Prayers as fervent as fire... ...Ah! You're supposed to... set the orb on fire? Apollo: The whole stanza seems to suggest that the founder will appear if the orb is set on fire. Athena: ...Wait! S-So the doctor! He...! Apollo: ...Yes, Athena. He had solved the ancient riddle of the Founder's Orb! Judge: Oh, my! Armie: Papa was a great archeologist. So I believe in him... and I want to believe... I want to believe he achieved his long-time dream of solving that riddle before he died. Apollo: Well, we won't know for sure... until we try it for ourselves. Armie: Yes, do it, Private Justice. Please! I want to see what Papa was searching for with my own eyes! Phoenix: Phoenix: The, uh... The plaintiff must object to this! Apollo: Apollo: The plaintiff will stand down and be quiet! Phoenix: Phoenix: Y-You don't have the right to set a precious relic like that on fire! Apollo: Apollo: Oh, but I do. All I needed was Sarge's permission. Since we still don't know if this treasure if the Founder's Orb or the Crystal of Ami Fey... ...any ownership rights the doctor had now belong to his daughter. Therefore, you have absolutely no right to stop us! Phoenix ...Gnrk! Judge: Very well, Mr. Justice. I never thought I'd be saying this, but you may burn the evidence. Apollo: All right, here we go! Apollo: Look! Athena: A-Apollo! The inside of the orb... It's melting! Apollo: There's something in there... Ahhhhhhhhhh! Dh-Dhurke! Isn't she...? Dhurke: Her garb leaves no room for doubt. It's the founder herself! Face and all... Dhurke: I-I don't understand. The greatest of taboos in Khura'inism... ...is the depiction of the founder's face. Yet here it is, hidden within this orb! Founder's Orb updated in the Court Record. Apollo: Sorry, Mr. Wright, but as you can see, the issue is \"crystal\" clear. This figure is the Holy Mother, founder of Khura'inism. And based on that, this must be none other than the Founder's Orb! Phoenix: Phoenix: B-Be that as it may, Mr. Are'bal still may have killed the doctor! If so, it would render the Orb Transfer Agreement null and void! Apollo: Don't play dumb, Mr. Wright. The truth of the matter has already been proven! Dr. Buff wasn't killed right after Sarge saw Mr. Are'bal. It happened after the doctor came back from hiding the orb. And you've no proof that Mr. Are'bal was still around at the time! Phoenix: ...Urrrrrrrgh. Apollo: Your claim that the Defiant Dragons were behind the crime doesn't hold water. And that means the Orb Transfer Agreement is still perfectly valid. Phoenix: ...Arrrrrrrgh. Apollo: Admit it, Mr. Wright. I just burned your whole case to the ground! Phoenix: Ooh... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Apollo: (I won? I actually won?) Judge: M-Mr. Wright! Would you care to respond? Phoenix: .........R-Respond? ...Um... Apollo: (I didn't think so!) Athena: Wait, did we just win? Did we actually beat the Turnabout Terror?! You're amazing, Apollo! Atishon: Don't just stand there, Wright! Do something! Phoenix: ...Umm, well... I don't think there's any digging out of this hole. Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, I think it's time for your concession speech. I have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that this is the Founder's Orb. The facts don't lie, but you obviously do. How's that for a campaign slogan? Atishon: Wh-Why you contemptuous peasant...! Judge: ...Hmmm. I think this is a good time to wrap up this trial. If both parties have no further objections, I will render my verdict. Apollo: No objections here, Your Honor. Phoenix: Err... Um... No ob-- Atishon: Atishon: You can't do this. The crystal is mine! I'll lose the election if I lose that crystal! Phoenix: I'm sorry, but there's really nothing more I can do. Atishon: ...You haven't forgotten about our little chat... have you? Phoenix: ! .......... Apollo: (What's going on here?) Phoenix: Phoenix: ...Y-Your Honor. I...I object to the defense's last claim! Apollo: What?! Phoenix: I don't believe they have truly proven that the relic is indeed the Founder's Orb. Apollo: Apollo: Mr. Wright. I don't think even you could bluff your way out of this one! What possible argument could you have to claim that this isn't the Founder's Orb? Phoenix .........Um, about that... ...................Oh, of course! Apollo: .......... (H-He can't possibly have hit on something...) Phoenix The defense's assertion is incomplete, and here's why. Their claim that this relic is the Founder's Orb is based on a legend. (Changed from [The defense is basing their claim that this relic is the Founder's Orb on a legend.] in the original release) And that legend claims that the founder will return when the riddle is solved at last. Apollo: Right. And that's what happened. The founder was revealed for all to see. Phoenix: But Mr. Justice, what about the rest of the legend? Apollo: Huh? Phoenix: According to the legend, once the founder returned... ...she would bestow spiritual power onto the person who solved the riddle. Apollo: ..........Y-You're kidding, right? Phoenix: Well, Mr. Justice? Do you feel great spiritual power coursing through your veins? Apollo: Um.......... no. B-But receiving spiritual powers and stuff... It's all just mystic mumbo-jumbo, right? Phoenix: Maybe so, but you're the one basing your claim on said legend. And what we saw here does not fully fulfill it, does it? Apollo: N-No, but... Phoenix: Consequently... You cannot rightfully claim that this is the Founder's Orb! Judge: .......... Atishon: .......... Apollo: .......... .......... Apollo: (What's gotten into him? Why is Mr. Wright doing this?) Judge: Hmm... It would appear that Mr. Wright has lost a few of his marbles. Phoenix: ...Th-That couldn't be further from the truth, Your Honor. Judge: In any case... I believe this a good time for a recess. Both sides will have twenty minutes to prepare. (Changed from [I believe this a good time for a recess. Both sides will have 20 minutes to prepare.] in the original release) I ask that all arguments be ready by then. Oh, and Mr. Wright? You'd do well to wash up and find your missing marbles by then, too. Phoenix: .................... May 17District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Athena: Mr. Wright is sure acting funny. I mean, he's famous for going out on a limb, but that last assertion was just plain crazy. Apollo: It's either a bluff or a Hail Mary. Either way, it doesn't make much sense. Trucy: ...Maybe there's something we're missing here. Although, he seemed perfectly normal when we spoke earlier. Athena: ...Apollo, I have a bad feeling about this. I'm going to go check up on him. Apollo: (What's going on with you, Mr. Wright...?) ???: Hey. Private Justice. Apollo: ...Oh, Sarge. Armie: I forgot to mention something. O-On the night of Papa's murder, a strange thing happened. Apollo: Oh? But why are you only telling me about it now? Armie: Well... I didn't say anything before because I thought Papa's death was an accident. But now that we know otherwise, I figured it might be important. Apollo: (There's still more to this case?) Armie: When I left my room and lost consciousness, I passed out right here. Apollo: That's right above the coffee bar. Armie: Mm-hm. But when I came to... ...someone was pushing my wheelchair. Apollo: What?! Armie: I was so scared, I beat a hasty retreat -- as fast as my wheels could take me! Apollo: Do you know who it was? Armie: No. It was pitch black. Plus, I fled to my room so fast, I didn't even have a chance to turn on the lights. Apollo: Maybe it was your father. Armie: No, he would have said something to me. Besides, I'd have known if it was him. Apollo: So then, it could've been... ...your father's real killer? Armie: My thoughts exactly. Apollo: But you didn't report this to the police? Armie: ...I-It didn't even occur to me. Apollo: It's okay. You were obviously still upset, so don't bear yourself up over it. Dhurke: Apollo, this could be really important information. I think the act of pushing Sarge's wheelchair could be part of some bigger scheme. It's hard to see why else the killer would do such a thing. Apollo: (Guess I should take her statement down as evidence.) Armie's Statement added to the Court Record. Apollo: Oh, welcome back, Athena. ...Hm? (What's with the long face?) Athena: .......... Apollo: How'd it go with Mr. Wright? Athena: .......... What should I...? Apollo: Athena? Athena: Oops, sorry! Zoned out there for a sec. The recess is almost over, so let's go! Ha, a-ha ha. Apollo: ........ (What was that all about?) May 17District Court - Courtroom No. 6 Judge: All right. Court is, once again, back in session. Now, umm... Mr. Wright. About that last objection you raised... Phoenix: We, the plaintiffs, still believe that the defense has yet to sufficiently prove its case. They claim that, according to legend, the Founder's Orb would bestow spiritual power... ...yet the relic in question has failed to do so. Therefore, it has failed its own test. Judge: I-I see... Apollo: (He's sticking with that ridiculous argument?) Phoenix: Furthermore... ...even if is the Founder's Orb, it can't be awarded to the Defiant Dragons. After all, they were the ones who killed Dr. Buff. Apollo: Apollo: What are you talking about? That was already proven to be false. There are no grounds for asserting that the Defiant Dragons murdered the doctor! Phoenix: Oh, but I'm afraid there are, Mr. Justice. ...Your Honor. I would like to present new testimony to this court. Testimony that will show that Datz Are'bal did, in fact, kill Dr. Buff! Apollo: What?! Judge: Very well. You may call your witness. Athena: I guess Mr. Wright found another new angle. Apollo: What new testimony could there be this late in the game? Atishon: Fellow citizens! It is I, Paul Atishon, the once and future representative of the people! Apollo: (Jeez, not him again.) Phoenix: My client divulged new information to me during the recess. He remembered something he saw, you see -- something crucial to this case. Apollo: (How very convenient...) Witness Testimony -- Datz's Crime -- Atishon: It was around 11 at night, and I was out on a mobile meet-and-greet around the village. That's when I saw Dr. Buff being murdered from outside his study window! Mr. Are'bal snuck up from behind and struck him on the head. His weapon of choice: a suitcase. A big, strong man like him could easily swing a heavy suitcase into someone's head. Apollo: You saw the murder as it happened?! And you're just telling us now because...? Atishon: Heh heh heh. I saved the best for last. It's a tactic known to all the political greats. Phoenix: The murder weapon was a complete mystery... ...but my client's eyewitness account has finally brought it to light. Judge: According to the autopsy report... ...Dr. Buff was struck in the head by the corner of some object. I suppose that could very well be the corner of a suitcase. Apollo: Apollo: But eyewitness testimony isn't the same as hard evidence! Phoenix: Oh, I wouldn't worry about that if I were you. Apollo: What's that supposed to mean? Phoenix: We have physical evidence, too. A luminol test revealed... ...the doctor's blood on Mr. Are'bal's suitcase. Apollo: R-Really?! But how does that prove that Mr. Are'bal used it as a weapon? Phoenix: Phoenix: You should know the answer to that, Mr. Justice. Since you know was well as I that the suitcase is covered in his fingerprints. Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! (I forgot we'd dusted it right in front of Ema!) Athena: The Turnabout Terror strikes again. Judge: Hmm... This is quite convincing testimony and evidence. Nevertheless, you may proceed with your cross-examination, Mr. Justice. Cross Examination -- Datz's Crime -- Atishon: It was around 11 at night, and I was out on a mobile meet-and-greet around the village. Press Apollo: Apollo: You were on a so-called \"mobile-meet-and-greet\" at 11 at night? Atishon: That's right. It's the perfect time because everyone is at home. You should have seen how the villagers' eyes teared up when they heard what I had to say. Apollo: (With tears of frustration, no doubt.) You weren't riding around in your palanquin? Atishon: That's right. Some village idiot reported me to the police. I've been banned from using it after dark. Athena: No wonder, what with all the noise he makes. Apollo: So, what exactly did you see, then? Atishon: That's when I saw Dr. Buff being murdered from outside his study window! Press Apollo: Apollo: Sounds like you witnessed something rather shocking. Atishon: Indeed. I didn't even believe it at first. I mean, a vicious murder, in Kurain? Apollo: There haven't been many murders there, I take it? Atishon: If I'm elected, I promise you that such a terrible tragedy will never happen again! A vote for me is a vote to banish murder forever from our beloved Kurain Village! Apollo: (Yeah, good luck with that.) Judge: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, please tell the court what you saw at the scene of the crime. Atishon: Mr. Are'bal snuck up from behind and struck him on the head. Press Apollo: Apollo: He snuck up from behind? So you're saying the doctor never even realized Mr. Are'bal was there? Atishon: That's right. He was utterly absorbed in a book. Apollo: ...I see. What did you see Mr. Are'bal do next? Atishon: He climbed up the bookshelf ladder and dumped a bunch of books down on the body. I believe he was trying to make it look like an accident. But that idiot didn't realize I could see everything from outside the window. Apollo: (One of those statements doesn't feel right.) Your Honor, I believe the witness made an important statement just now about how... The crime was clearly visible Apollo: If the crime was visible through the window, that's earth-shattering testimony! Judge: ...Is it? Because to my ears, it sounds like a rather obvious fact. Apollo: ...Oh, sorry. I'm good, then. Judge: Hmmm... Very well. Will the witness please continue with his testimony? Leads back to cross-examination The doctor was reading a book Apollo: The doctor was reading a book at the time of the murder...? That's vital testimony! Judge: Very well. The witness will please add that statement to his testimony. Adds statement \"The doctor was standing in front of the bookshelves, absorbed in a book.\" if not already added Datz is an idiot Apollo: The witness said Mr. Are'bal is an idiot. That's a key piece of information! Datz: Don't you jump on the bandwagon, AJ! I'm no idiot, you hear! Judge: Hmm... I fail to see how that is a key piece of information. Apollo: ...Yeah, I guess it's not, is it? Judge: Then it seems there is no need to add it into the witness's testimony. So let's get on with it, shall we? Leads back to cross-examination Atishon: The doctor was standing in front of the bookshelves, absorbed in a book. Press Apollo: Apollo: You watched a murderer commit his crime and did nothing to stop it? That doesn't sound like a good way to score points with the voting public. Atishon: I'm a politician, not a superhero! I'm under no obligation to risk life and limb. Athena: He's sure quick to deny his obligations when there's nothing in it for him. Apollo: I'm getting tired of listening to his endless campaigning and flimsy rationalizations. Phoenix: About your testimony, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson... You said Mr. Are'bal struck the doctor from behind when he was absorbed in a book. Atishon: Yes, that's exactly what happened. Present Doctor's Reading Glasses Apollo: Leads to: \"The doctor was standing in front of the bookshelves, absorbed in a book, you say?\" Atishon: His weapon of choice: a suitcase. Press Apollo: Apollo: Are you sure? Atishon: Positive. I saw it with my own two eyes. Apollo: Yet, despite your certainty, you kept quiet about it until now? Atishon: No, I was waiting. I knew there would be a perfect chance to talk about it later. Information must always be disclosed in a strategic manner. That is one of the lessons of kingcraft, as taught by the Atishon clan. Apollo: (Is there a lesson, by chance, in the Atishon Kingcraft Guidebook on being honest?) Atishon: Anyway, I saw Mr. Are'bal commit that heinous crime. Atishon: A big, strong man like him could easily swing a heavy suitcase into someone's head. Press Apollo: Apollo: I would have to agree, that suitcase is really heavy. ...Wait a second. How did you know it was so heavy? For all you knew, it could've been empty. Atishon: Gnrk! Phoenix: Phoenix: My client witnessed the crime in progress. So naturally, he saw Mr. Are'bal straining to lift what was obviously a heavy suitcase. I can't say I'm a fan of you trying to discredit my client by tripping him up, Mr. Justice. Apollo: (But I'm just doing what you always do, Mr. Wright!) Before adding statement Athena: Talk about new testimony. He's totally changed his story. Apollo: If he had really seen the murder taking place, you'd think he'd have said so from the start. Athena: Maybe he had some reason to hide what he really saw? Apollo: (If so, that might be our only opening.) After adding statement Athena: Dr. Buff was struck from behind while he was absorbed in a book? He must've been really into it. Apollo: Hmm... It doesn't add up. Athena: What doesn't? Apollo: (That Paul Atishon is lying. I'm sure of it.) Apollo: The doctor was standing in front of the bookshelves, absorbed in a book, you say? I'm sorry, but it seems your testimony is completely unreliable. Atishon: That's quite a bold statement. Well, let's hear you back it up. I challenge you to prove that I am anything but one hundred percent reliable. (Changed from [I challenge you to prove that I am anything but 100% reliable.] in the original release) Apollo: It would be my pleasure. Lately, it seems that the doctor's eyes had gotten so bad, he needed reading glasses. However, his reading glasses were over on his desk. So you see, there's no way he could've been reading a book in front of the bookshelves! Atishon: Hrrrrrrngh! Apollo: I'm sorry, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, but... ...I'm going to have to ask you to explain this discrepancy to the voting public! Atishon: Ngah, gah gah gah! I-I-I... Apollo: You what? Atishon: I-I'll explain it, you lowly cur! I simply made a mistake, you see. The doctor was actually sitting at his desk when Mr. Are'bal hit him over the head! Apollo: But then the doctor would have been facing him. Surely he would've seen him and tried to run? Atishon: D-Dr. Buff was nodding off! I could tell because he his eyes were closed, and he wasn't moving! Apollo: (Sounds more like what you would do.) Then how do you explain the back that he was struck in the back of the head? Isn't that something that should be impossible from the front of the desk? Atishon: ...Oh, um... About that... H-He... He bowed his head when he nodded off. That's when he was clobbered. Judge: Hmm... So that's what you saw. Well, Mr. Justice, that sounds like a perfectly reasonable explanation to me. Do you have a problem with the proposal that the doctor was struck while nodding off? No problem Apollo: No problem here, Your Honor. The doctor was probably dozing, just as the witness said. Athena: N-No, Apollo! Wait! If you accept that, then you might as well admit Datz killed the doctor. Apollo: ...Your Honor! I, uh, actually do have a problem with that statement... Judge: Very well. But let's avoid careless answers like that, or I will have a problem with you! Apollo: (Guess I blew that one.) Judge: Now, as you were saying, Mr. Justice? Leads to: \"There is a problem. A very big problem.\" A big problem Leads to: \"There is a problem. A very big problem.\" Apollo: There is a problem. A very big problem. The witness's statement doesn't hold up under the slightest bit of scrutiny! Judge: Is that so? Then will you please show this court what evidence you have to justify this? Apollo: Gladly, Your Honor. This shows the problem with the witness's claim that he saw the doctor nodding off! Present Study Diagram Apollo: Leads to: \"...A diagram of the study?\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: This shows the glaring problem with the witness's statement! Atishon: ...............Zzz... Apollo: See? The witness has passed out from the overwhelming power of my evidence! Phoenix: No, Mr. Justice. Your lackadaisical attempt to refute him put my client to sleep. That's all. Judge: I feel a yawn coming on myself. Perhaps giving you this penalty will wake me up. Apollo: Surely there are better ways to stay awake, Your Honor? Athena: Apollo, think about the relative positions of the witness and doctor again. Apollo: Right. That's where we'll find the contradiction. Judge: Now then, Mr. Justice. See that you avoid these snooze-incusing answers in the future. Leads back to: \"This shows the problem with the witness's claim that he saw the doctor nodding off!\" Judge: ...A diagram of the study? Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson allegedly viewed the murder from... ...here. And the doctor was allegedly nodding off... ...here. But from his vantage point, the bookcase would've blocked the witness's line of sight. Judge: Why, yes, I believe you're right! Atishon: B-B-But...! Arrrgh! Phoenix: Phoenix: The fact remains, my client knew that the suitcase was the murder weapon. So he definitely had first-hand knowledge of the crime scene! Apollo: I'm afraid I have to agree with you there, Mr. Wright. But then we have to ask ourselves, from what vantage point did he see the murder? Phoenix: What are you insinuating, Mr. Justice? Apollo: From what vantage point could Mr. Atishon-Wimperson have seen the dozing doctor? Once we determine that, I believe we'll finally see the truth behind this incident. The witness saw the murder from... right here! Present area between Bookshelf and Coffee Bar Apollo: Leads to: \"You've got to be kidding!\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Phoenix: How could he have seen it from there? Apollo: Oh, umm... He just did somehow? I mean, I just feel like it must've been from there. Athena: Um, Apollo? for some reason, I feel like you're wrong. Judge: Hmm... And for some reason, I feel like giving you a penalty. Apollo: (So much for that spot.) Athena: Hmm... Looking at it in another way... ...where must Mr. Atishon-Wimperson have been standing to see the doctor nodding off? Apollo: Someplace where the bookcase wasn't blocking his view, I guess. Judge: Now then. Will the defense please indicate where the witness saw the murder from? Leads back to: \"The witness saw the murder from... right here!\" Phoenix: You've got to be kidding! Judge: B-But that's--! Apollo: It is indeed. But everything only makes sense if the witness was there in the study. Athena: I-Inside the study? But that's the scene of the crime! Apollo: I know. Mr. Atishon-Wimperson -- the man who claims to be a witness to the murder... ...was most certainly in that very room. Athena: A-Apollo, are you suggesting...? Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson! Weren't YOU the one who actually swung that suitcase? Atishon: Gaaaaaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Phoenix: What you're proposing is ludicrous! My client is a small, thin man, whereas Mr. Are'bal had the musculature to pull it off. Apollo: ......... (He has a point... I gave up trying to lift that thing after one go.) Atishon: That's right. He's the only one who could've lifted such a heavy object. Now do you understand? The rebel Datz Are'bal is the doctor's killer! Athena: As long as the suitcase is the murder weapon, the suspicion falls entirely on Datz. You'll have to poke a hole in Mr. Wright's argument somehow, Apollo. Apollo: Oh, I will. And with his own technique, no less. If Mr. Atishon-Wimperson couldn't swing the suitcase around... ...we'll just have to consider another way he could've used it as a murder weapon instead. I'm going to turn this case on its head, Mr. Wright, just like you taught me. Phoenix: ...You talk big, Mr. Justice, but do you have what it takes? Judge: Well, this should be interesting... Apollo:: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson's testimony has been filled with one inaccuracy after another. First he stated Dr. Buff was in front of the bookshelves. Now he claims that the doctor was sitting at his desk. So where was the victim REALLY when he was killed? Also, where was his killer, and how was the murder weapon REALLY used? Judge: So the important thing here is the position of the victim and killer related to each other? Apollo: Yes, Your Honor. If they were positioned a certain way... ...it would be possible to use the suitcase as a weapon without lifting a finger. Phoenix: You can't mean...! Apollo: I would ask the court to recall the study's layout. It's quite distinctive, as you can see. Now, if Dr. Buff were sitting in a certain spot, and his killer was at a certain other spot... ...the suitcase would become a weapon ANYONE could use! Judge: Hmm... Very well, Mr. Justice. Where was Dr. Buff's killer at the time of the crime? Present balcony west of Coffee Bar Apollo: Leads to: \"Th-There...?!\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Judge: How could the murder have been committed from there? Phoenix: Yes, I would love to see a demonstration. Apollo: ...Um, well... I can't from here. Judge: Well, I have a demonstration for you from here... on how to give a penalty. Apollo: (So much for that spot.) Athena: If the killer didn't swing the suit case, there aren't many other ways to use it as a weapon. Apollo: I know. And there aren't that many places to use it from, either. Judge: Now then. I hope the defense is ready to try again. Leads back to: \"Where was Dr. Buff's killer at the time of the crime?\" Judge: Th-There...?! Phoenix: Oh... That's... Apollo: This should wrap things up nice and pretty for you, Mr. Wright. I would ask the court to recall the study's layout. But this time, instead of thinking in two dimensions... ...let's think in three. Only then can we clearly see the killer's method at work. The killer didn't have to swing the suitcase. ...If he used gravity to his advantage, that is. That's right. It was the plaintiff -- one Paul Atishon-Wimperson -- who used the suitcase. He pushed it from the second floor... ...and sent it hurtling down onto Dr. Buff, who was sitting at the coffee bar! Atishon: Yaaaaaaargh! Apollo: That psychology book had been at the coffee bar, no doubt. The doctor must have set it down there after he'd finished reading it, or the like. But his blood got on it, which is why the killer thought to hide it in that mountain of books! Phoenix: Phoenix: That's quite an entertaining theory you have there, Mr. Justice. But there's no evidence that the murder took place at the coffee bar. Apollo: ......... (I'm not so sure about that, Mr. Wright. I'd say that evidence of the murder occurring at the coffee bar...) Exists Leads to: \"The evidence does exist, and I'm going to show you.\" Does not exist Apollo: Obviously, there is none! Phoenix: Just as I thought. So, if the coffee bar isn't where the doctor was killed... ...the defense's little theory fails to bear fruit Judge: Hmm... Mr. Wright is correct, of course. Apollo: Urk! ...Umm... Athena: Don't just stand there, Apollo! If you don't do something quick, we're going to lose both the orb AND the creep, together! Apollo: I'm thinking... I'm thinking... Oh! (Wait a second... There IS a piece of evidence that proves the doctor was killed at the coffee bar!) Phoenix: So, such evidence never existed in the first place, did it? Leads to: \"The evidence does exist, and I'm going to show you.\" Apollo: The evidence does exist, and I'm going to show you. Phoenix: Y-You are? Apollo: This, right here, is proof that the murder took place at the coffee bar. Present stained book Apollo: Leads to: \"This brown stain was determined to be coffee.\" Present anything else Apollo: Judge: Hmm... I don't understand how that could be proof of anything. Apollo: You don't, Your Honor? Well, I believe Mr. Wright understands perfectly. Phoenix: All I know is, it's perfectly clear you don't understand what you're talking about. Judge: Now that is something I can understand. Apollo: (Me too... Oww.) Athena: Apollo, let's take another look at that crime scene photo. Maybe there's something in it related to the coffee bar. Apollo: I've got it this time! Leads back to: \"This, right here, is proof that the murder took place at the coffee bar.\" Apollo: This brown stain was determined to be coffee. What's more, it was still a bit damp when we saw it yesterday morning. Phoenix: Ah! Apollo: One look at this book speaks volumes, I'm afraid, Mr. Wright. It tells us the doctor was having a cup of coffee at the coffee bar. That's when the suitcase came hurtling down, striking him on the head... ...causing both his blood and his coffee to spatter onto it! Phoenix: Ack! Atishon: Aaaaaaagh! Apollo: Well, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson?! Atishon: .........Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh... What motive could I have possibly had to kill Dr. Buff?! Apollo: (And there it is. That final excuse cornered killers are so fond of.) Well, the doctor never returned your \"crystal\" to you, did he? Instead, he hid it in the cave ruins. Atishon: Nngh... Apollo: Telling him that the Defiant Dragons were a dangerous bunch was a huge blunder. All it did was make him hide the orb. Your lie came back to bite you in the end. Atishon: Uhhh... Apollo: Even worse, the doctor saw the news reports, so he knew the relic was the Founder's Orb. Being the conscientious researcher he was, he knew he had to return it to its rightful place... ...and that meant keeping it out of your hands. Atishon: Aaaaaaaaaaaaah... Apollo: You were so angry that he refused to return the relic to you... ...that you killed him with your own hands. Isn't that right, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Atishon: Arrrrrraaaaaagh! .........I-I-I... Th-That is... Phoenix: Phoenix: ...A-Apollo! Don't! Please don't accuse my client of murder! Apollo: .........Huh? What do you mean, \"don't accuse him\"? Why would you even say that, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: ...Er, what I meant was, um... He's a promising politician with a bright future ahead of him. It's in our nation's best interests to avoid burdening him with the taint of scandal. Apollo: Say what? Atishon: Wright! You'd better do something to change the current courtroom climate... ...or I'll be charged with murder! And you know what will happen to her if that happens. Phoenix: ...Arngh! Apollo: (What's he talking about? Well, I can ponder that later. For now...) Mr. Wright, you can't possibly believe that Mr. Are'bal is the killer. Are you really going to send an innocent man to prison? I thought you were better than that. Phoenix: Uhhh... Ummm... Apollo: Well, Mr. Wright? Answer me! Phoenix: Errr... Ummm... UUHWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH! Apollo: M-M-Mr. Wright? ...What in the world's going on here? Athena: ......... Apollo: ...If you won't say anything, then...! Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, the defense hereby accuses you of-- Athena: Athena: A-Apollo! Wait! Apollo: Not you, too, Athena! Athena: Umm... It's just, uhhh... I wasn't sure whether I should say anything, but... ...during that last recess, when I went to check on Mr. Wright... ...I overheard something I shouldn't have. Phoenix: I trust Maya is unharmed. Atishon: I can't really say. But just remember... If I'm arrested or fail to obtain the treasure... ...there will be consequences. Consequences of the worst kind, if you catch my drift. Phoenix: Augh! Atishon: Relax. All you have to do is ensure I get my hands on that relic. I must deliver it to my benefactor at all costs. Phoenix: What do they want that relic for anyway? Atishon: Heh heh heh. It's something to do with an old legend. My patron seeks the great power said to be granted to whoever solves its secret. Apollo: ....Maya? As in Maya Fey? Athena: Yes, the boss's legendary former assistant. Apollo: Ms. Fey's being held hostage? Athena: So it seems. Apollo: Why didn't you tell me as soon as you heard this? Athena: Sorry. It's just, Mr. Wright spotted me before I could slip away... ...and made me promise not to tell you. He said it would make things more difficult if you found out. Apollo: Arngh! As if things weren't already hard enough! (So that's why Mr. Wright was acting so strange. I had no idea. This must've been excruciating for him. Think, Justice... There's got to be something you can do!) Judge: Mr. Justice, about that last statement of yours... I believe you were in the middle of accusing the plaintiff of murdering Dr. Buff... Would you care to continue? Apollo: Ack! I-I... Phoenix: Nngh... I'm sorry, Apollo... I'm really, really sorry. Judge: What's gotten into you two? Apollo: ......... (If I accuse that slimebag, I put Ms. Fey's life in jeopardy.) Atishon: Heh heh heh. It seems you've finally caught on. I'm far too important to be accused of murder. After all, our nation's future rests squarely on my shoulders. Apollo: (Nnrgh... Either I give up, or...) Atishon: Once I present the crystal to my patron, my victory is assured! Then one day, I'll become president -- and then, king! I'll have every politician at my command! Now, retract your accusation! Apollo: Arrrrrrnnngh! (I can't kowtow to him, but... but...) The defense would... It would like to retract... the previous accusati-- ???: Dhurke: ...Apollo. Apollo: Dh-Dhurke? Dhurke: I don't know what's going on here... ...but a lawyer should never look the way you do right now... ... with \"defeat\" and \"resignation\" written all over your face. Apollo: ! .........A dragon never yields. Dhurke: Even when wounded, a dragon bites down hard, and never lets go till its dying breath. It glares, it roars, and it latches its jaws firmly onto its prey till the bitter end. That's what lawyers do to get to the truth! Apollo: ...Dhurke. (A dragon never yields... ...He's right. It's all over if I give up now! If Mr. Wright's hands are tied, it's up to me to do what must be done! He's saved my neck so many times. Now... it's my turn to save his!) ...Dhurke, thanks for that wake up call. Dhurke: Heh, now that's the face of a lawyer you've got there, son. Apollo: (Where there's a will, there's a way. And I'm going to find the way to save Ms. Fey AND see that justice is served!) Apollo: That scumbag is holding Ms. Fey hostage to ensure he gets the orb for his patron. And it seems said patron believes in the orb's legend. Thing is, the founder DID appear when the orb was exposed to fire, as the legend said. If the legend is true, then we've already solved the riddle, right? Yes, we have Apollo: Yes, we've definitely solved the riddle! ...And yet... ...we still don't understand what the part about \"bestowing power\" is talking about. I need to rethink this! Leads back to: \"If the legend is true, then we've already solved the riddle, right?\" No, not yet Leads to: \"We have not solved the riddle yet\" We have not solved the riddle yet Apollo: The legend says that the founder will bestow great spiritual power when she returns. But if that's true, it means we haven't solved the whole riddle yet. But how can that be? Are we missing something? ...Wait, maybe... Maybe the part about the founder returning should be taken literally. But how would it be possible for a dead person to return to the world of the living? Cloning Apollo: Oh, I know! Cloning technology! I bet some of the founder's DNA is hidden somewhere in the orb. ...Argh, what am I talking about? They didn't know about DNA and cloning back then. I'd better think of something else. Leads back to: \"But how would it be possible for a dead person to return to the world of the living?\" Channeling Leads to: \"The founder can return though channeling\" Time travel Apollo: Oh, I know! Time travel! We could go back to the past and bring the founder here to the present. ...Wait, what am I saying? Maybe I should cut back on the sci-fi movies. I'd better think of something else. Leads back to: \"But how would it be possible for a dead person to return to the world of the living?\" The founder can return though channeling Apollo: Oh, I know! here IS a way for the dead to return -- spirit channeling! Of course, you'd have to know what he founder looks like first... ...but the orb has revealed her face to us, so what if it's a sign that we should channel her? Given the facts, in order to solve the riddle and receive the founder's power, I'd need... A spirit medium Leads to: \"A MEDIUM IS NEEDED TO OBTAIN THE POWER\" To practice channeling Apollo: All I have to do is train as a spirit medium, so I can channel spirits myself! ...Wait, it can't be that easy. And if I ever did become a medium, I wouldn't need the founder's power anymore anyway. Leads back to: \"Given the facts, in order to solve the riddle and receive the founder's power, I'd need...\" A MEDIUM IS NEEDED TO OBTAIN THE POWER Apollo: The ability of a medium to channel spirits is the final key to unlocking the orb's secret. That means Mr. Atishon-Wimperson's patron will need one, too. And once that slimy politician realizes that, he won't be able to lay a finger on Ms. Fey! Apollo: Everything is going to be okay, Mr. Wright. Because Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson can't afford to harm a hair on Ms. Fey's head. Phoenix: ............Huh? Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson! It seems you've chosen the wrong person to take hostage. Atishon: Wh-What do you mean? Apollo: Your patron seeks to solve the orb's riddle... ...and thereby receive great spiritual power. However, only Maya Fey can truly give them what they really want. Phoenix: She can? Atishon: What do you mean, \"only Maya Fey\"? Apollo: Think about what the return of the founder really means. We should have considered it more literally. After all, the orb was made in the Kingdom of Khura'in -- the birthplace of spirit mediums. Phoenix: ...Ahh, I think I see now. You need to know what the deceased looks like in order to channel them. But in Khura'inism, depicting the face of the founder is taboo. However, her true face was hidden in the orb. So maybe the orb is telling us... to try channeling the founder. Apollo: Exactly. Through a spirit medium, the founder can quite literally return. And if the legend is true... ...the founder just might bestow spiritual power on someone when she does. Phoenix: It's like when Pearls imbued my magatama with spiritual power. If a human could be imbued with such power in a similar manner... Dhurke: It is said the founder possesses immense spiritual power. Such a great feat would not necessarily be beyond her-- W-Wait a second! Th-Then the legend is true?! Apollo: Do you understand now, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? You are holding hostage the final key to unlocking the orb's secret. And if anything were to happen to her, the riddle would remain unsolved, forever! Atishon: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Atishon: Atishon: Th-Th-There's always Pearl Fey! I could simply ask her to help! If she wants money, I have plenty to offer! Apollo: She's not the kind of person to be tempted by material gain. And she certainly wouldn't help you if anything were to happen to her cousin. Atishon: Urhgk. Apollo: Or maybe you'd like to go ask the queen of Khura'in to channel the founder for you. Phoenix: He could, but he'd probably get executed for requesting such a thing. Apollo: ...It's over. Now, confess! You killed Dr. Buff, didn't you? Atishon: Ack! Hrrrrrrrrrrrrrngh! It wasn't supposed to end this way! Judge: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. Are you admitting to committing the crime? Atishon: Errr... Um, I-I-I... You're my lawyer, Wright! Do something! Phoenix: It's true that I'm your lawyer. And as such, it's my job to defend you. ...However, defending my client isn't the only job a lawyer has. There's something else that's equally as important. And that is finding the truth. Atishon: Wh-What? Phoenix Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, you have sought to twist the truth in the dirtiest of ways. I was complicit in your hostage-taking, but in a way, I was being held hostage, too. Even so, there's still time for me to make things right. And I owe it all to you, Apollo. Apollo: ! (Mr. Wright...) Phoenix: I can't allow a murderer to walk away scot-free! Therefore, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, I must resign as your attorney. Atishon: No no no no noooo! D-Does this mean... I'm under arrest? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! ........................ ............... .................................... ........................ Apollo: ...Well? Atishon: ...I've nothing to confess. Apollo: What?! Atishon: I said, I've nothing to confess! I don't and I won't, especially not to a plebeian like you! Apollo: (This guy doesn't know when to give up.) Atishon: Besides, there's no truth to these allegations! I mean, look at the suitcase. You won't find a single print of mine on it! Apollo: All that means is that you wiped them off, taking care to only leave Mr. Are'bal's. Atishon: Heh heh heh. As many a great politician has said before me: no comment. Phoenix: In that case, try switching things up, Apollo. Look at the situation from a different angle. Is there really nothing that points to the suitcase being dropped from up above? Apollo: Hmmm... Evidence that points to the suitcase being dropped from the second floor... Athena: Hmm... If the killer pushed the suitcase from the second floor hallway over the coffee bar... ...that would place him right around here. Apollo: Ah! Maybe... Just maybe...! Phoenix: Thought of something, Apollo? Apollo: I believe this piece of evidence to be connected to the dropping of the suitcase. Present Armie's Statement Apollo: Leads to: \"That... appears to be a statement. But how is that related to this case?\" Present anything else Apollo: Atishon: Wh-What is that?! Phoenix: Apollo, I don't see how that could possibly be related. Atishon: ...Oh, it's not? Tsk, I just wasted a perfectly good reaction! Your Honor! Penalize this pernicious peon! Judge: Hmm.. Yes, well, we all must be held accountable for our words and actions. Apollo: (What do you think I'm trying to do with Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, Your Honor?!) Athena: So the killer dropped the suitcase from above the coffee bar. Apollo: Right. Let's look again to see if we have any evidence related to that event. Phoenix: Come on, Apollo. I'm counting on you. Leads back to: \"I believe this piece of evidence to be connected to the dropping of the suitcase.\" Judge: That... appears to be a statement. But how is that related to this case? Apollo: On the night of the murder, Your Honor, Miss Armie Buff physically left her room. That's when she saw the doctor burning the orb, and subsequently passed out. ...Right above the coffee bar. But with her there in her wheelchair... ...the killer wouldn't have been able to drop the suitcase down onto the doctor. Phoenix: Good point! Apollo: However, according to Sarge... ...she woke up just as someone was trying to move her in her wheelchair. Phoenix: Ah! Armie: ...someone was pushing my wheelchair. Apollo: What?! Armie: I was so scared, I beat a hasty retreat -- as fast as my wheels could take me! Apollo: She must've been in the killer's way and had to be moved. Isn't that right, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Atishon: ...Agrk! Phoenix: And if the killer had pushed the wheelchair with his bare hands... ...we may yet find the conclusive evidence we need. Apollo: Exactly. Fortunately for us, that evidence slipped right through the killer's fingers. If only he'd been able to hold on to it just a little tighter. But now, he is neither able to discard nor alter it. Phoenix: Honestly, that piece of evidence wasn't even supposed to be here in this courtroom today. And yet... it looks like sometimes, things DO get better. Atishon: Unngh! B-B-B-B-But...! Th-This... This wasn't supposed to happen! Apollo: No? Well, too bad. Because the evidence that sped away from you that night... ...has come back to haunt you! Right here at this very trial! Atishon: ARGH! UHWAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! Apollo: Your Honor! The defense's final piece of evidence is on this person! Present Armie Buff profile Apollo: Leads to: \"Th-That's...!\" Present anyone else Apollo: Phoenix: ...Apollo? Apollo: Yes, Mr. Wright? Athena: Umm, I think he's saying that that doesn't jive with anything you've said so far. Judge: It seems Ms. Cykes is the more sensible of you two. Apollo: (Ugh... No need to compare the two of us...) Phoenix: What did the killer have to move in order to drop the suitcase? Consider that, and the rest should follow. Apollo: Okay, I'll get it for sure this time! Leads back to: \"Your Honor! The defense's final piece of evidence is on this person!\" Atishon: Th-That's...! Apollo: On the night of the murder, Sarge passed out... ...only to come to and find that someone was pushing her wheelchair. That's when she fled back into her room. Phoenix: She didn't physically see a single soul after that... Not until Athena drew her out through that therapy session, that is. Apollo: While the killer was able to wipe the prints on the suitcase off... (Changed from [While the killer was able to wipe the prints on the suitcase...] in the original release) ...the same can't be said for the prints that got away. Atishon: Ah. Ah. M-My fellow Kurainians... Apollo: Well, Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson? Try to explain your way out of this one! The podium is all yours! Atishon: Ah. Ah. P-Paul Atishon, savior of Kurain... I-I... I am not a crook... I... My political career...! It can't end like this! I-I'm destined for great things! Something's wrong... This isn't real! It's a dream! No, a nightmare! Ooooooooooooh. Huh? What? ...Wait? ...Really? Ah! Election ResultsWINNER Atishon: Ahhhhhh! Whoa, no waaaaaaaaay!!! BANZAI! BANZAI! BANZAI! BANZAI!!! Breaking NewsPaul Atishon arrested on murder charges and stripped of his electoral win. Atishon: ...Wait, what? ...............No, please. Wait. Don't go! No... No... Please...Whoa! Grandpaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! ........................ Judge: M-Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Are you all right? ...B-Bailiff! Get him to the first-aid station, on the double! Judge: Well, this was yet another unexpected turn of events. In light of everything that's been revealed, it seems that this relic is indeed the Founder's Orb. And it seems Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson can be considered a suspect in Dr. Buff's murder. Phoenix: Apollo, I want to thank you for everything. Apollo: ! Phoenix: Thanks to you, I didn't have to keep bending the truth. I don't know what I would've done without you. Apollo: Er, don't mention it, ha ha ha... Athena: You were amazing today, Apollo! Apollo: (Well, I couldn't have done it without Dhurke.) .........A dragon never yields. Dhurke: Even when wounded, a dragon bites down hard, and never lets go till its dying breath. It glares, it roars, and it latches its jaws firmly onto its prey till the bitter end. That's what lawyers do to get the truth! Apollo: (A dragon never yields... Every lawyer should take that to heart.) Judge: As it seems both sides have no further objections... ...would Dhurke Sahdmadhi please take the stand? Dhurke: .......... Judge: This court awards the orb to the Defiant Dragons per the stated transfer agreement. Should the Kingdom of Khura'in claim ownership... ...the matter may have to be deliberated in court all over again. I just hope, or shall I say pray, that I'm not the judge presiding over that one! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Indeed! A trial like that might spark an international incident. Still, there are bigger and more momentous things astir in the air! Apollo: (The revolution... Dhurke's really serious about this.) Judge: This court is adjourned! May 17District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Dhurke: Nice work, son! We've finally broken through the last obstacle on the road to revolution! Apollo: Revolution... It just doesn't seem real. Dhurke: Yes, well, to think you actually defeated the Fighting Phoenix... All I can say is, that's my boy! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (Well, Mr. Wright did have his hands tied. Who knows if I'd have won if he'd been able to fight me head-on.) Athena: I see it more like you saved Mr. Wright. Apollo: ...Saved him? Athena: Yeah, remember what he said? He didn't have to bend the truth anymore, and it was all thanks to you! Apollo: I don't know about that. (Still, I guess it IS kinda nice to be appreciated.) Trucy: ...Um, Mr. Dhurke? Now that the Holy Mother's face has been revealed... ...are you going to have a spirit medium try channeling her? I, for one, would love to see the return of the legendary founder! Apollo: Yeah, just think about it. Being able to speak to someone right out of the history books... Dhurke: Unfortunately, it's not that easy. Apollo: What? Why? Dhurke: A face isn't enough. You also need the true name of the one you're attempting to channel. Apollo: Oh, right. Pearl mentioned something like that. Dhurke: And the founder's name is only known to the priestess who's been crowned queen. In short, the only living person who knows it is the current queen of Khura'in, Ga'ran. Apollo: Oh, so without her help, we won't be seeing the founder anytime soon? Trucy: Tsk, that's no fun. Founder's Orb updated in the Court Record. Apollo: So, Dhurke, what will you do now? Dhurke: First, I'll start by tracing the route by which the orb came into Dr. Buff's hands. Apollo: Since we now know it was Paul Atishon that asked the doctor to study it... ...isn't he the one who stole it? Dhurke: No, a political nobody like him couldn't get anywhere near the orb, let alone steal it. He must've had inside help. My money is on someone connected to the royal family. Apollo: Oh, right. You said something to that effect back in the cave. Dhurke: Whoever it may be, we need to expose their dirty scheme to the light of day. Apollo: Well, I'm sure Mr. Wright has plenty of information, courtesy of his dirty client. He might be able to shed some light on this. ???: Private Justice! Sarge: That was fine work you did at the trial today! You did your sergeant proud! Apollo: Back at you, Sarge! It took real courage to leave your room like that. Armie: It's all thanks to you and Corpswoman Cykes. With my siege defense over, I can finally sally forth. Sarge: But the battle's only just begun! One for me, and me alone, to fight! Athena: To lose your mother, and then your father... What a terrible thing to endure. Apollo: Yeah... (And being wheelchair-bound doesn't help.) Armie: ...Private Justice! I've been thinking... It's about time I stood on my own two feet. After all, I no longer have Papa to coddle me! Apollo: Huh? I'm afraid I don't follow. Armie: ...Take a good look, soldier. This is one small step for man... ...and one giant leap for me! ......... Hold my drone for me, would you, Private Justice? Apollo: Y-Yes, sir. (What she is up to?) Armie: .........Hrgh! Wh-Whoa... Apollo: Sh-Sh-She's... standing?! Dhurke: Wh-What's this?! Sarge! You mean your legs... They're...?! Armie: The doctor told me that I was ready to walk again months ago. But if I admitted I could walk, I knew I would have to leave the house. So I... I faked it. Apollo: (Makes sense, but...) Armie: I kept pretending I couldn't walk. But I know Papa is watching over me now, and I'd hate to disappoint him. So, from this day forth, I'm going to march forward on my own two feet! Apollo: (What a brave kid, trying to move forward like this. But it must be so hard this soon after her father's death.) Dhurke: Don't you ever stop. You just keep on walking... comrade. Stay brave, because there will be days when you want to stop... ...but I have faith you'll find a way to muster the strength to push through them. Apollo: Yeah, you can do it. Trucy: Hey, Daddy's back! Phoenix: .................. Apollo: Mr. Wright! (What's that look on his face for?) Phoenix: Oh, Apollo! Apollo: Um, is everything all right with Ms. Fey? Phoenix: She's safe... for now. Athena: Well then, we'd better go save her, quick! Where is she, anyway? Phoenix: ...I'm afraid I have some bad news. Apollo: Huh? Phoenix: Maya's... not here in the States. She's still in Khura'in. And she's still being held hostage by the mastermind behind this whole thing. Apollo: The mastermind? Phoenix: ...That's right. Paul Atishon-Wimperson was nothing more than a pawn. Maya's true abductor is in the Kingdom of Khura'in. Apollo: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaat?! I-I don't understand, Mr. Wright! What in the world's going on over there?! Apollo: But as shocking as that news was... ...it was only the beginning. The beginning of something big -- big enough to shake Khura'in to its very core. ...Revolution. I was being swept up in a mighty wave that nothing could stop. Of course, at the time... I had no idea what the days ahead had in store for us... To be continued Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: Please take a look at this piece of evidence. Judge: I'm looking... But what am I supposed to see? Apollo: Oh, um... Uhhh... Phoenix: As your boss and mentor, here's a bit of advice: Never present evidence before you have a good grasp of the situation at hand. Apollo: R-Right... Sorry... Judge: And as the presiding judge, here's a penalty. Apollo: (Ouch. Double-teamed for doing what Mr. Wright always does anyway.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: That statement contradicts with this piece of evidence! Judge: Hmmm... And just how does it contradict with the evidence, Mr. Justice? Apollo: Um... Could I have about five minutes to figure out the answer to that? Judge: The defense will figure it out before he presents his evidence next time! Apollo: (Sounds like a plan...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: There's... something off about that statement... Judge: Hmm... It seemed perfectly reasonable to me. Apollo: No, something's definitely not right if you listen really carefully! Phoenix: A gambler once sang, you've got to know when to hold 'em, when to fold 'em... Judge: Oh, I love this one! ...Know when to walk away, know when to run! Apollo: (I don't know which penalty hurts more: the judge's or their singing.) Consult (when evidence must be presented) Athena: Is it just me, or does that statement sound a bit dubious? Apollo: You know what... you're right. Thanks, Athena! Athena: Anytime! Apollo: (Now to take another look at the evidence...) Consult (when statements must be pressed) Athena: You look like you've hit a brick wall, Apollo. Apollo: Yeah. It feels like I have, too. Athena: Maybe you just haven't brought all the facts to light. Why don't you try pressing a little more? Apollo: Good idea. (Okay, time to turn up the pressure!) Pinpoint wrong emotion (during Mood Matrix segment in the chapter \"Cross-Examining Sarge\") Apollo: Athena: Hmm... This emotion isn't that out of place, given this statement... Apollo, are you just looking at his emotions as they relate to only a single statement? It's really important to look for emotional fluctuation between different statements, too. Apollo: Oh, right. Thanks for the reminder, Athena. (All right, let's try that again.) Probe wrong area (during Mood Matrix segment in the chapter \"Cross-Examining Sarge\") Apollo: Athena: That doesn't seem to be the cause of his current emotional state. Apollo: I could sure use a clue or two right about now. Athena: A person's personality and past shapes their emotional responses. Consider everything you know about Sarge. That's where you'll find the clues you need. Apollo: (Everything I know about Sarge...) Presenting wrong evidence during the Mood Matrix Apollo: Apollo: There's an inconsistency in Sarge's testimony! Judge: Is that so? Would you be so kind as to point it out to the court? Apollo: ...Well if you're going to put me on the spot like that, I admit my confidence is waning. Judge: ...I could say the same about my confidence in you, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Ugh. (I wish you wouldn't, Your Honor.) Athena: Say, Apollo... Sarge is saying that his father was burning the orb when he was killed... ...but doesn't that seem funny to you? Considering what the doctor was up that night, it doesn't add up. Apollo: Well, now that you mention it... (All right, I'd better look through the evidence one more time.) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The Defiant Dragons have failed to sufficiently show their right to the item in question. Therefore, ownership is hereby awarded to... ...the plaintiff, Mr. Paul Atishon. Apollo: That creep Paul Atishon stole the Founder's Orb right out of our hands. The dream of revolution in the Kingdom of Khura'in died that day. And we returned to our daily lives. As for my relationship with Mr. Wright... The word awkward comes to mind. Let's just say it was never really the same. Turnabout Revolution Image Gallery Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 May 17District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Apollo: What do you mean Ms. Fey is still being held hostage? And who's this \"mastermind\"? Phoenix: ...Paul Atishon-Wimperson was nothing more than a puppet. His benefactor was the one pulling the strings. But I have no idea who they are. Apollo: So all we know is it's the person he was trying to give the orb to? Phoenix: Right. He was just following orders. Whoever it is, it seems they really want to get their hands on the orb. Apollo: So then, Ms. Fey's abduction is the work of this so-called \"benefactor,\" too? Phoenix: Right again. Whoever they are, they're in Khura'in... ...along with Maya. Apollo: I wonder who they could be. Dhurke: Wright, this Maya -- the spirit medium you've been talking about... She wouldn't happen to be that bun-haired young lady you defended back in Khura'in? Phoenix: That's her. Why do you ask? Dhurke: I see... I think I know what's going on here.  I've got good news for you, Wright. Maya is somewhere safe. That much I'm sure of. Phoenix: ...I'm afraid you've lost me. Dhurke: Heh heh heh. So that's who the little snot's patron is. It's all starting to make sense. That fool has no idea I'm here in the States with you all. Apollo: Dhurke, you mind filling us in? Phone: .......................................... Phoenix: ...! ...No caller ID. I wonder who's calling? Phone: *beep* Phoenix: Hello? Phone: Mr. Phoenix Wright, yes? Let me start by thanking you... ...for taking such good care of my subordinate. Phoenix: Wh-Who is this? Phone: I believe you know me as Mr. Atishon's... \"benefactor.\" Phoenix: Ah! Apollo: (Sounds like they're using a voice changer or something to disguise themself.) Phoenix: Where's Maya?! Is she safe?! Phone: ...I had my ears on today's proceedings. What a shock it was to hear that the key to solving the orb's riddle is a spirit medium. I admit, I did not see that coming. Apollo: (Wait, did they plant a listening device in here somehow?) Phone: Nevertheless, don't think for a minute that it will guarantee Maya Fey's safety. She is not the only medium within my reach, you see. Phoenix: You harm a hair on Maya's head and you'll have to answer to me! Dhurke: ...Wright, give it here a sec. Phoenix: Wait! Dhurke: Hey, there. How's it going, stranger? Phone: ...Who is this? Dhurke: Why, it's your friendly neighborhood dragon. I just happen to be in the U.S. on a little trip. ...Minister of Justice Inga Karkhuul Khura'in. Phoenix: I-Inga?! Apollo: What?! Phoenix: Maya's kidnapper... Apollo: ...Is Khura'in's... Minister of Justice? Inga: Dh-Dhurke?! Is that you, ya dirty turncoat?! How in the--! What in blazes is going on here?! Dhurke: Oh, you know, just popped over to the States for a little R&R. But enough about me, Inga. That was a poor excuse for a bluff you pulled just now. We both know your threats are as empty as your head. You can't lay a hand on Maya Fey, and I do mean that literally. Inga: Ugh! Apollo: (What is he talking about?) Dhurke: You can kiss your chances of getting the orb goodbye. Inga: ...Heh heh heh. Maya Fey ain't my only... how shall I say... insurance, you know, Dhurke. Dhurke: What? Inga: I've got someone dear to you right in the palm of my hand, see? Now that one, well... You can imagine what kinds of things I could do, right? Dhurke: ! ............ Inga: Heh heh. Glad you're seeing things my way. Meet me at Amara's Tomb tomorrow, 3 PM sharp. And you better come alone, got it? If all goes well, the orb is all you'll need to get Maya Fey back. Dhurke: ......... Apollo: Dh-Dhurke, what's going on? Dhurke: You heard him. I have to get back to Khura'in at once. Apollo: What?! Why?! Dhurke: No time to explain. Apollo: But are you even going to make it? What if there are no seats left on the next flight? Plus, you're a wanted man. They're not just going to let you get on a plane. ???: Let me worry about that, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Ch-Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth? What are you doing here? Edgeworth: Taking care of the hostage situation. Apollo: Oh, now that you mention it... ...Pearl did say that she saw you around in Kurain Village. Phoenix: I had him look into a few things while I was on my way back from Khura'in. ...Including Maya's situation, of course. Edgeworth: I was astonished to hear she was still in Khura'in earlier... ...but it explained why I found no connection between her and Mr. Atishon. Apollo: Sorry to interrupt, but going back to the plane situation... Edgeworth: I've taken the liberty of chartering one for us. It's ready to take off at any time. And I will do what's necessary to hide the fact that Dhurke Sahdmadhi is onboard. Apollo: ...Wow. (Must be nice to be chief prosecutor...) Edgeworth: Wright, we have no time to lose. We must head for Khura'in at once. Phoenix: ...Right. Athena: I'm going, too! After all, you're bound to need my help! Trucy: No fair! I wanna go, too! Phoenix: This isn't a vacation, Trucy. Besides, I'll need you to hold down the fort. Trucy: But Daddy! Apollo: (Guess I should also only bring what's necessary.) ...Sorry Trucy, but would you mind holding on to this stuff for me? Unnecessary evidence foisted onto Trucy. Trucy: Fine. But you'd better bring me back something besides just more evidence. Dhurke: Excellent. Now, let us make haste... to Khura'in! Apollo: And that's how our sudden trip to the Kingdom of Khura'in began. I never imagined I'd return to the country of my youth under such circumstances, though... May 18, 2:30 PMTehm'pul Temple Apollo: That was a long flight. It's already 2:30 in the afternoon. Talk about cutting it close. ........... (The Kingdom of Khura'in... This is no time to reminisce, but... ...I gotta say, this place sure brings back memories.) Phoenix: Hurry up, Apollo! Apollo: Right behind you! Dhurke: Amara's Tomb is located in the courtyard of Ga'ran Palace. We should have just enough time to get there. Athena: Then let's sprint there! Think you can keep up, Apollo? Apollo: S-Sure, no sweat! Edgeworth: I'll contact the royal family and the local police, and inform them of our arrival. Phoenix: Thanks, Edgeworth. Examine Athena: Apollo. I'm sure this place brings back memories, but could you reminisce later? Time's running out! Apollo: You're right. We have to find Ms. Fey before it's too late. Talk Any ideas? Athena: I know you probably want to reminisce and all, but there's no time for that right now! Apollo: You're right. We've got to get to Amara's Tomb with Ms. Fey is being held captive! Present Anything Athena: Apollo! Don't go showing me stuff for no reason! We have to find Ms. Fey before it's too late! May 18, 2:45 PMGa'ran Palace - Royal Residence Apollo: *huff, puff* *huff, puff* I wasn't made for all the running and climbing and near-drowning I've done this week. Phoenix: It's 2:45... Only fifteen minutes left. (Changed from [It's 2:45... Only 15 minutes left.] in the original release) Dhurke: See that cylindrical building rising in the distance? That's Amara's Tomb. Phoenix: Amara... Wasn't that the previous queen? The one who was assassinated? Dhurke: Yes. And I'm the one they pinned it on. Apollo: It will take a few minutes to get to the tomb from here. ???: So, you have returned... Barbed Head. Phoenix: Ah...! Apollo: (I've seen her before on the news. If I remember correctly, this is the crown princess Rayfa Padma Khura'in.) Rayfa: What are you people doing here? This is the Royal Residence! Commoners are not allowed entry without permission. Phoenix: A prosecutor from the States... ...should've already called and requested permission for us to enter. As to why we're here, Your Benevolence... Have you seen Minister Inga? Rayfa: If you seek my father, I just saw him heading toward Amara's Tomb. Phoenix: Was he with anyone? You know, like some shady-looking underlings or something? Rayfa: No, he was alone. Why do you ask? Apollo: (Looks like she has no idea about Ms. Fey's abduction.) Athena: You hear that? I think we have company. *stomp, stomp, stomp* Royal Guard: Bow down before her glooooooory!!! Her Eminence Queen Ga'ran, grand priestess of Khura'in approooooooooaches!!! Apollo: Huh? ...Ga'ran? Ahhh! I-It's--! Phoenix: ...Q-Queen Ga'ran! Ga'ran: ............... Guards... Surround Amara's Tomb at once! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence! Ur di'hara Ga'ran! Apollo: (What's she doing? Is she going to help us?) Phoenix: Excuse me, Your Eminence... Ga'ran: So, our \"Barbed Head\" lawyer returns. May we presume you are here for Maya Fey, the spirit medium who has been abducted? Phoenix: Y-Yes, you may! Ga'ran: Allow us to apologize for the criminal actions of our husband. Phoenix: Oh, um... no need to apologize for him! Ga'ran: Honestly, Inga... Abducting a guest in our country? How could you? Rayfa: Father... abducted someone? Phoenix: Your Eminence, what about those soldiers over there? Ga'ran: They are the Ga'ran Royal Guard, soldiers who serve the crown and no other. Apollo: Royal guard? Ga'ran: They are an elite force selected from only the most loyal and outstanding of our subjects. Apollo: And why have you ordered them to surround the tomb? Ga'ran: The police will not come if it is my husband who is committing the crime. We shall have to storm the tomb and take Minister Inga into custody ourselves! Apollo: Whaaat?! Y-You mean...? Dhurke: Ga'ran! No! His hostage is in there! Ga'ran: Dhurke! How dare you set foot in the palace! Have you come to turn yourself in?! Dhurke: Listen, we need to call a truce for now! Ga'ran: Ga'ran Royal Guard! Seize this traitor of the crown! Royal Guard: As you wiiiiiiish, Your Eminence! Resist and you diiiiiie! Apollo: W-Wait a second! Dhurke: Dhurke: Slow down there, Ga'ran. I'm here to conduct a hostage exchange. But if you take me in now, Maya Fey is as good as dead. Ga'ran: ...A hostage exchange? And why would he choose to do such a thing with you? Dhurke: We can talk about that later. Right now, I need to get in there before it's too late. If I can't resolve this in twenty minutes, you can storm the palace. Now then... if you'll excuse me... Ga'ran: Dhurke, wait! ... *sigh* Guards, allow the insurgent Dhurke Sahdmadhi to pass. Rayfa: Barbed Head, you have some explaining to do! Phoenix: Right... Well, while we're waiting here... ...Apollo, why don't you explain the situation? Apollo: Whaaat?! M-Me? Rayfa: Leave nothing out, Horn Head, or I'll dehorn you where you stand! Apollo: (Horn Head? She doesn't waste any time coming up with nicknames. And what's with the attitude? Her father is the one who abducted Ms. Fey!) Examine Amara's Tomb Apollo: (Dhurke's in there right now.) Guards Athena: The Ga'ran Royal Guard has the tomb surrounded. Apollo: Yeah, and it looks like they might storm the place at any moment. Phoenix: If Her Eminence gives the order, they'll have no choice but to follow through. And I have the feeling she's about ready to do so. Apollo: All we can do is wait and hope for the best, huh... (I hope Dhurke and Ms. Fey both come out of this in one piece.) Any other point of interest Apollo: (This is no time to be looking around. Not until Dhurke gets back.) Move Rayfa: Where do you think you are going?! Apollo: (Oh, right. We're supposed to wait for Dhurke to return.) Talk Hostage taking by Inga Rayfa: Do my ears deceive me, or did I hear talk about my father abducting someone? Apollo: Oh, um, you heard right. He abducted Maya Fey, and... Rayfa: I-Insolent fool! Apollo: P-Pardon my rudeness! Rayfa: A gentle soul such as my father could not possibly have committed such a crime! Phoenix: \"Gentle\"? You think he's gentle? Apollo: I'm afraid it's true, Your Benevolence. He's holed up in that tomb as we speak. Rayfa: Really? I find this difficult to believe. Why would he do such a thing? Inga Karkhuul Khura'in Apollo: Umm, Your Benevolence? You saw your father heading toward the tomb? Rayfa: I did. I was over on that veranda, deep in thought... ...when I saw him hurrying toward the tomb. I'd say it was about ten minutes ago. (Changed from [...when I saw him hurrying toward the tomb. I'd say it was about 10 minutes ago.] in the original release) Apollo: (Why was he rushing? Maybe he was worried he'd be late?) Did you see anyone else heading for the tomb? Rayfa: I saw no one else after he entered. Apollo: So Minister Inga and Ms. Fey are the only ones in there besides Dhurke? Phoenix: Who knows? But I wouldn't be surprised if he had a minion or two with him. Apollo: Dhurke... I sure hope he's all right. Present Anything Rayfa: Horn Head! Stop wasting time and explain what's going on here! And make it quick, or I'll yank those horns right off your head. Apollo: Nngh... How about we keep our hands to ourselves and I'll explain everything...? (Guess I'd better start talking...) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: ...It's only been five minutes? (Argh, it feels like an eternity.) Phoenix: Patience, Apollo, patience. Ga'ran: ................. May 18, 3:20 PMGa'ran Palace - Royal Residence Apollo: It's been almost twenty minutes. What's taking Dhurke so long? Ga'ran: ...The appointed time has come. Our royal guard shall now storm in. Apollo: Umm, can't you wait just a little longer? Ga'ran: No, we cannot. Every second we wait puts the hostage's life in even more danger. Therefore, we see no alternative but to order our guards to storm in. Apollo: (But that'll put Ms. Fey's life in danger, too!) Ga'ran: Guards! Storm the tomb and seize Minister Inga, along with the insurgent Dhurke Sahdmadhi! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence! Apollo: What?! Dhurke's under arrest, too? Ga'ran: Naturally. That traitorous snake assassinated my predecessor, Queen Amara. Now go! Seize them both! Royal Guard: Raaaaaaaaah! We're going in! Follow me, men! For Her Eminence! Ur dihara Ga'raaaaaaaan! Apollo: ............ (I hope no one gets hurt.) Royal Guard: Ah! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Your Eminineeeeeeeence! Apollo: What the--? Why are they running back out?! Ga'ran: What is the meaning of this? Royal Guard: S-Something terrible has happened! Dhurke...! Th-Th-The minister...! H-H-He's dead! Ga'ran: What's this?! Apollo: WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Phoenix: Apollo, quick! Apollo: I'm right behind you! Ga'ran: No one enters without our--! ...Hmph! Come, let us see what has transpired! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence! May 18Ga'ran Palace - Amara's Tomb Apollo: Wh-Where's Dhurke?! Phoenix: Apollo, over there! Apollo: .........Dhurke? Dhurke: ................ Apollo: Dhurke! Wh-Wh-What... What have you done? Dhurke: ..........Apollo? Phoenix: L-Look! Ga'ran: So it is... Minister Inga who has fallen? ...! Guards! Seize this murderous man at once! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence! Surrender or peeeeeeerish, rebel scum! Dhurke: N-No, wait! Aaaaaaaaargh! .............................. ............................................................ Apollo: Dhurke! (They're taking him away...) *thud* Apollo: Oww! (Dhurke just threw something at me.) Wait, this is the... (Is he telling me to keep it safe?) ???: ......Nick? ...Is that you? Phoenix: M-Maya! Are you all right?! Maya: Dh-Dhurke, he... he saved me. ...I feel... exhausted. I can't keep my eyes... open... Phoenix: Maya! Apollo: (Minister Inga -- the man behind Ms. Fey's abduction -- had been killed. And Dhurke was arrested for his murder. So it was that the abduction of Maya Fey came to a sudden and unexpected resolution. With this, the curtain fell on the minister, but things were far from over.) May 18Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence Athena: Apollo! What happened?! Apollo: ......I can't say for sure. But from what I can tell, it seems Dhurke has killed Minister Inga. Athena: Whaaaaaaaaaaat?! You think he did it to save Ms. Fey? Apollo: Most likely... But who knows? I'm really confused right now... Rayfa: M-My father... He's...? This cannot be! I must see for myself! Royal Guard: Your Benevolence! We cannot allow you to pass! Rayfa: Fools! Stand aside! Royal Guard: Forgive us! But we have direct orders from Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran! Rayfa: Uuuuuuuuuuuh! Father... Oh, Father...! Dhuuuuuurke! You will pay for this! Phoenix: ...Apollo, let's go regroup somewhere. Apollo: Y-Yeah... (Dhurke... It wasn't really you that did it... right?) May 18Tehm'pul Temple Apollo: ......... Athena: Are you okay, Apollo? Apollo: ...Y-Yeah. Phoenix: Edgeworth's speaking with the local police... ...so let's sit tight until he returns. Apollo: ...O-Okay. ............... Phoenix: ...I know you must be in a state of shock right now, but I need you to stay with us, Apollo. Apollo: (He's right. I can't go to pieces now!) Thanks, Mr. Wright. I'll be fine! May 18Tehm'pul Temple Edgeworth: Wright, Mr. Justice... I'm afraid I have some bad news. It looks like things will only get more complicated from here. Apollo: Prosecutor Edgeworth... What's happening with Dhurke? Edgeworth: As I understand it, he has been officially charged with the murder of Minister Inga. Apollo: H-He has? Edgeworth: However, I did manage to get us permission to investigate the crime scene. And I expect we'll be allowed to visit Mr. Sahdmadhi shortly. Apollo: ...Thank you. (I'm sure glad Prosecutor Edgeworth is here with us.) Edgeworth: Also, it just so happens that Detective Skye is here in Khura'in... ...so I have asked her to assist us with our investigation. Apollo: What?! What's she doing here? Edgeworth: It seems Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has grown quite fond of her. He's been ferrying her around all over the place. A few days here, a few days there... They've almost become a team of sorts. Apollo: (Despite what Nahyuta says... ...it seems he thinks highly of Ema's skills.) Athena: So what now, Apollo? Apollo: I think I'll go pay Dhurke a visit at the Detention Center. Phoenix: I... want to go check in on Maya at the hospital. What about you, Athena? Athena: Well... If there's footwork to be done, I'd better stick with Apollo and give him a hand. Edgeworth: Very well. Then I will accompany Wright. Apollo: Okay, we'll go our separate ways for now. Phoenix: All right. If anything comes up, you have my cell number. Athena: Do you know your way around here, Apollo? Apollo: It's been over ten years since I left... but I'll try not to get us hopelessly lost. Examine Temple Athena: Mr. Wright stayed there the entire time he was here, apparently. Apollo: Why would he stay at a temple instead of a hotel? Athena: He says it helped to cut costs. Long stays at a hotel really add up, you know. But he had to sleep on the floor with a load of strangers. There weren't any showers, either. Apollo: Wow, that's worse than staying at a youth hostel for backpackers. Spring Apollo: (This is said to be a sacred spring, and a pathway for souls to follow. The people of Khura'in believe the spring draws souls to the temple... ...and by the truth gained in the Hall of Justice beyond, they are memorialized. It seems that legal trials and funeral rites are inseparable in this country.) Background temples Apollo: (There sure are a lot of temples around here. In fact, it looks like most of the buildings around here are related to Khura'inism.) Talk Any ideas? Athena: Queen Ga'ran sure has a lot of personal attendants. Apollo: Yeah. The Ga'ran Royal Guard... They're like her own private army. Athena: More like an elite fan club made up of carefully selected soldiers who adore her. That's how I see it anyway. Apollo: That's... a pretty blunt way of putting it. What to do Athena: Dhurke Sahdmadhi -- the charismatic leader of the Defiant Dragons -- arrested. This is going to deal a major blow to the rebels. Apollo: Yeah. I can already see Datz having a heart attack when he finds out. Athena: Speaking of Datz, he was on the plane with us... ...but I haven't seen him since we landed. Apollo: Dhurke said he wanted Datz to go to him before he caused any more trouble. Athena: ...Yeah, he strikes me as a troublemaker. Apollo: ...I just hope he doesn't do anything crazy, like trying to break Dhurke out of jail. Present Attorney's Badge Athena: I thought that attorney badges were the same around the world. But I just realized this type is only used back home. Apollo: You've had your badge for a while now, and you're JUST noticing that? Athena: Hey, I'm still getting used to things after all the time I spent in Europe. But as they say, when in Rome! Apollo: Wait, what are we even talking about anymore? Founder's Orb Athena: The orb... It was a real surprise to find out that it's hollow on the inside, wasn't it? Apollo: Yeah, and an even bigger surprise to find that the founder's face was hidden within. Athena: But now that the orb's secret has been revealed... ...how are you supposed to restore it to its original state? Apollo: ...Well, it was probably wax or something that melted to reveal the figure inside, so... ...if we turned it upside down and heated it up again, it should go back to the way it was. Athena: Ohhh, I get it! That's one clever little contraption. Photo of My Father Athena: I've been thinking about that photo. Your father was quite the manly man, Apollo. Apollo: Ha ha ha. I sense a compliment in there somewhere. Athena: Huh? Where'd you get that idea? Apollo: Oh, um... N-Never mind. Athena: Never mind what? Apollo: ......... Er, nice weather we're having today. Athena: ......... Aww... Is there something you wanted to hear me say, Apollo? Apollo: L-Look! Just forget I said anything, okay?! Royal Residence Examine Inga's residence Apollo: (Somebody got a little carried away decorating this place. There's a golden lion keeping watch at the entrance.) ...That frog looks like it's cowering under the lion's glare. Athena: Really? 'Cause to me, it looks like the frog is glaring at the lion. Apollo: Come on, Athena. How does that make any sense? Athena: Huh? I just call 'em as I see 'em. Apollo: (I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.) Ga'ran's palace Apollo: The palace of Queen Ga'ran is built to impress. Its white walls and gold ornamentation lend it an imposing air. Athena: It makes Minister Inga's residence look downright humble by comparison. Apollo: Yeah. It shows the difference in their tastes... and which one wears the pants, so to speak Amara's tomb Apollo: The previous queen, Amara, was laid to rest in her own private tomb. Pretty impressive. Athena: They say it cost $800 million to build, and took 400 workers five years to complete. Special memorial rites were also conducted at various points of its construction. Apollo: That's quite an undertaking. Athena: It was built with donations from her devoted subjects and royalty of neighboring countries. It ended up giving a huge boost to the national economy. Apollo: Wow, Queen Amara must've been one charismatic lady... Rayfa's residence Athena: Ooh, look at those flowers! They give the whole house such a cute vibe! I wonder if this is where Princess Rayfa lives. Apollo: ...I doubt it. She doesn't look like the type to decorate with cute flowers. I mean, I may not know her well, but she seems awfully serious and snobby. I bet she uses nothing but roses and peonies - stuffy old people flowers, you know? Athena: ......Apollo. I guess it's too much to ask that you not judge a book by its cover, huh. Apollo: What's that supposed to mean? Footprints Apollo: Are these... Inga's footprints? They appear to be heading toward the tomb. Athena: Didn't Princess Rayfa mention something about that? You know, something about him rushing over to the tomb before we arrived? Apollo: I wonder if he had accidentally dozed off before the exchange or something. Pond or bridge Apollo: Vibrant lotus flowers floating on still waters... Butterflies dancing about... It's almost supernatural in its beauty. Athena: And at the center of it all rises the tomb where Amara's soul slumbers.  It makes you wonder if that bridge there is a getaway to the hereafter. Apollo: Yeah... Especially after both Dhurke and Inga crossed that bridge earlier. Urns Apollo: This overturned urn has spilled water everywhere. Everything around it is soaking wet. Athena: D-Don't look at me! Apollo: (Rightly or wrongly, I'm guessing Athena's the type who gets blamed for a lot of things. And the more people accuse her, the more defensive she becomes. Even to the point of preemptively denying any wrongdoing.) Athena: I said, it wasn't me! Apollo: I never said it was. Amara's Tomb Examine Athena: Apollo, I know you can't help but want to start investigating, but... Apollo: I know. We should pay Dhurke a visit over at the Detention Center. May 18Detention Center - Visitor's Room Dhurke: Apollo! Here to see your old man, are you? Apollo: Dhurke. Are they done interrogating you? Dhurke: Nope, the fun hasn't even started. I imagine they'll really take me over the coals though. Athena: I don't even want to think about how harsh their interrogation method will be. Apollo: ...Yeah, but that's nothing compared to what they'll do if they find him guilty. Dhurke: They've branded me a terrorist who killed the previous queen, and now the justice minister. If found guilty of these crimes, I'll be facing a very public execution. Apollo: P-Public execution...?! (This is worse than I thought!) Dhurke: Come on, son. Turn that frown upside down! You'll jinx us. As soon as I get out of here, I'll take you to this tasty hash house I know. Apollo: .........I'd like that. (I really need to find out what happened. Time to switch to work mode.) Dhurke, can you tell me what happened? ...Oh, and there's also something I want you to take a look at. Examine Bell Athena: .................. Apollo: ...Don't do it, Athena. Don't ring that bell. Athena: Ack! Wh-Who, me...?! Perish the thought. I mean, would I ever do something so childish? Apollo: .................. Athena: All right, all right! Put your bracelet away already. Talk about unfair! Guard Apollo: That guard's standing so still, and with such great posture... I wonder if he spends his days just watching the dust dance in the sunlight. Wait a second. Don't you do that in court sometimes, Athena? Athena: Eep! You mean you noticed? Apollo: Don't think you can take it easy just because I'm the lead lawyer on this one. Talk The incident Apollo: Dhurke, what happened in there? You didn't really kill Minister Inga, did you? Dhurke: Well, the thing is... ...I really don't know. Apollo: Huh? Dhurke: I remember seeing the mural of the founder right as I entered the tomb... ...but I got all dizzy immediately after that. The next thing I knew, I was standing there with a bloody knife in my hand... ...and covered in Inga's blood. Apollo: So you don't remember meeting with him? Dhurke: No. The last thing I remember after entering the tomb is feeling really dizzy. Athena: There's no way he can explain what happened if he can't remember anything. Apollo: Y-Yeah... Dhurke: .........Hmm. I suppose there's no getting out of this one. Apollo: But we can't give up yet! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! I was just messing with you, son. Apollo: Well, stop. It's not funny. Dhurke: S-Sorry. Apollo: (Sheesh. Nothing seems to faze him. Not even being arrested for murder.) Dhurke: This is going to be one tough case, Apollo. Not only have I been charged with Inga's murder... ...but I've also been charged with Amara's assassination from twenty-three years ago. Apollo: You're on trial for two charges? Dhurke: Ga'ran is practically licking her chops just thinking about my public execution. Guess it means we can't afford to lose our heads, huh. Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: I... I don't know how you can laugh at a time like this. Dhurke: ...So, son, I take it you'll be defending me at my trial? Apollo: ...Of course. You can count on me. Dhurke: That's my boy! Looks like your nerves are as steely as those vocal chords of yours! After all, you've got the Defense Culpability Ace to contend with, too. Apollo: ...Oh, right... So if you're found guilty... ...then I'll be charged with the same double homicide, huh. Dhurke: Don't tell me you forgot about that...! Apollo: I'll-- I'll be fine. I-I just have to make sure we win this one. Dhurke: You sure? Because you don't sound very fine. Athena: ...Um, Apollo? What was that about an assassination twenty-three years ago? 23 years ago (appears after \"The incident\") Apollo: About that incident twenty-three years ago... That was when the previous queen, Amara, was assassinated, wasn't it? Dhurke: Yes. Someone set her private residence on fire. She lost her life in the ensuing blaze. Apollo: And you were arrested for the crime? Athena: Why would they arrest you, Mr. Sahdmadhi? Weren't you just a lawyer back then? What relation could you have had with the queen? Dhurke: Um, about that... Amara was... well... she was my wife. I may not look the part, but I was once husband to a queen. In short, I was royalty. Athena: What? No waaaaaay! Are you saying you won the heart of the reigning queen? Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! C'mon, you're talking to a guy who hones his prowess against witnesses on the stand. Even a queen is no match for this dragon's glare! Athena: W-Wow, you're really something else. Apollo: So was a verdict ever reached, Dhurke? Dhurke: I acted as my own attorney and won. ...Until I was accused of fabricating evidence, that is. Then it all went south. Apollo: (...Now where have I heard a story like that before?) Athena: What happened after that? Dhurke: I, uh... I made a run for it. Athena: You ran?! But why? Dhurke: I didn't kill Amara, and I didn't fabricate any evidence. But if I had stuck around for a retrial, I'd have been found guilty for sure. I couldn't allow that to happen; Amara's true killer would never face justice if I did. So I left my law practice behind and went underground. Apollo: But that was twenty-three years ago. ...Are you telling me that after all these years... ...you still haven't discovered the truth? Dhurke: Yeah... The fact that it was arson means that the crime scene was reduced to ashes. There is little in the way of evidence left. It's just been brick wall after brick wall. Apollo: (I guess that means it's all up to me to figure it out, huh. Along with Minister Inga's murder, of course. ...I think I'm going to be sick.) Dhurke: Come on, son. Don't look so down. With you on the case, it'll work out somehow. Apollo: (I hope he's right.) Dhurke: Say, son, do you remember my office? Apollo: ...Sure. (I remember that messy, dimly lit room.) Dhurke: The file I've amassed on Amara's assassination is kept there. I think it might help you on this case. Do you remember how to get there? Apollo: (Let me think... I recall going in through a manhole...) How can I not, Dhurke. I hated how I always got so dirty getting there. And that stench... (That old case is important, too, but I should probably focus on the minister's murder first.) Present Attorney's Badge Dhurke: I'm proud of you, son. You've really become a fine lawyer. Apollo: Well, at least it means I'm qualified to defend you. Dhurke: ...To think the day would come where you'd come to my defense. I'm one lucky man. Now I can die in peace. Apollo: Whoa, slow down! I'm going to prove you innocent, so...! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Just pulling your leg, son! Apollo: (...Even when he's in the slammer, Dhurke is Dhurke.) Founder's Orb Dhurke: I see you got it safely out of the tomb! Apollo: Why did you throw it at me like that? Dhurke: I want you to listen carefully, son. The orb must not fall into Ga'ran's hands... Not ever. Apollo: I thought Minister Inga was the one who was after it. He was the one who lent it to Professor Buff to study, after all. So haven't you exposed his crime now? Dhurke: I have, but... ...there's more connected to this relic than meets the eye... Much more. And whatever it is, I can't help feeling that it could turn this entire kingdom upside down. Apollo: You said something like that before. (Looks like Dhurke's intuition is at it again.) Dhurke: Ga'ran will do anything to retrieve this... ...so guard it well, son -- at least until tomorrow's trial. Photo of My Father Dhurke: That's the only remaining photo of your father. Take good care of it. Apollo: I will. ...I'm just surprised to see it after all these years. Dhurke: I had a tough time tracking it down and retrieving it. It was taken by some European tourists who just happened to be watching your father. I had one of my men go to Europe to look them up and ask whether we could have it. Apollo: Y-You went through all that trouble? Dhurke: ...I did. So don't go losing it or anything. Apollo: I said I'd take good care of it, didn't I? After clearing \"23 years ago\" Talk option and presenting Founder's Orb: ???: I'm afraid your time is up. Apollo: ! N-Nahyuta. Nahyuta: It's time for the prisoner's interrogation. So begone, you putrid-headed, criminal-abetting lawyer. Apollo: Wait! Don't tell me... you're the prosecuting attorney? Athena: What?! But that would mean... Nahyuta: ...Is there a problem here? Apollo: You bet there is. He's your father! Nahyuta: ...And your point is...? My relation to the accused is irrelevant. The fact remains, I am a prosecutor. Apollo: N-No, that's not what I... (I don't think I'm getting through to him.) Dhurke: .........Nahyuta. Long time no see, son. How've you been? Nahyuta: ......... Dhurke: Look... I hear you've been serving Ga'ran -- rather faithfully, in fact. Whatever happened to our dream of taking her down and changing this country, son? Nahyuta: .........The past is the past. Dhurke: What do you mean? Why are you doing this? Nahyuta: .........It's simple. People change. The Nahyuta you knew exists no more. Dhurke: Listen, son, I don't know what made you change like this... ...but you're still my boy, even if you prosecute my case. The rest of the Defiant Dragons and I eagerly await your return. Whenever you're ready, we'll welcome you back with open arms. Nahyuta: ........Ngh! .........As I said, I've moved on. Now, let us waste no more time; for flowers do not blossom simply from talk of the past. Apollo: ......... (Nahyuta... Why do I get the feeling there's something he wants to say, but can't?) Nahyuta: ...Guard, move the accused to the interrogation room. Guard: Yes, sir! This way, you rebel scum! Dhurke: Ow! Watch it! Not so rough, will you! Apollo: (...Nahyuta. Is he seriously going to prosecute his own father?) May 18Ga'ran Palace - Amara's Tomb Apollo: So, this is the tomb of Amara, the previous queen of Khura'in. It's really lavish. I guess you could say it's fit for a queen. Athena: Is the faceless woman in that mural over there Amara? Apollo: No, that's the Holy Mother. She's the one who brought spirit channeling to Khura'in. Athena: Oh, right. The woman in the orb. ???: Oh, it's you two. Getting right down to business, I see. Apollo: Hi, Ema. We heard you'd give us a hand if we needed it. Ema: Yep. Mr. Edgeworth asked me to help where I could. So, it's been quite a while since you've been back in Khura'in, I hear. Apollo: Yeah, more than ten years, in fact. Ema: Well, you sure didn't waste any time. I mean, you're already mixed up in a murder. You're as big a trouble magnet as Mr. Wright. Apollo: P-Please don't say that. My luck's already bad enough as it is. Athena: Ema, I hear Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has requested your services again. He seems to have really taken a liking to you. Ema: You mean His Ephemeral Holiness? MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. I don't mind that he approves of me and my abilities. It's just, his people skills need some serious work. But when he manages a smile and compliments my work, it's hard to say no. Plus, working on investigations overseas is a priceless experience. But flying back and forth between here and home every few days with no days off... That's been tough, and the lack of sleep has been brutal on my skin. To make matters worse, the defendant in this case is someone I know. I mean, how could this get any worse?! MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. Apollo: (Sounds like they've got one complicated prosecutor-detective relationship going on.) Examine Apollo: (We better get Ema's okay before we start snooping around.) Talk The incident Apollo: Ema, have you determined the cause of death? Ema: Blood loss from a stab wound. A single stab in the back was enough to cause the victim to bleed to death. The estimated time of death is 3 PM, which is when Dhurke came onto the scene. Inga's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Apollo: Any suspects besides Dhurke? Ema: No. He, Maya, and the minister were the only ones here. And Maya had been tied up until she was freed by the queen's royal guard. Apollo: Could someone have been hiding somewhere in here? Ema: Not likely. I was told this tomb was searched from top to bottom right after the murder. And during that time, the royal guard set up a perimeter to prevent anyone from escaping. Athena: In other words, the crime scene was completely sealed off? Ema: It would appear so. Apollo: Hmm... No way for a third party to escape without being spotted, so... (Great. It's another one of those convoluted locked-room mysteries.) The incident (subsequent times) Apollo: Ema, have you determined the cause of death? Ema: Blood loss from a stab wound. A single stab in the back was enough to cause the victim to bleed to death. The estimated time of death is 3 PM, which is when Dhurke came onto the scene. Apollo: Any suspects besides Dhurke? Ema: No. He, Maya, and the minister were the only ones here. And Maya had been tied up until she was freed by the queen's royal guard. Apollo: Could someone have been hiding somewhere in here? Ema: Not likely. I was told this tomb was searched from top to bottom right after the murder. And during that time, the royal guard set up a perimeter to prevent anyone from escaping. Athena: In other words, the crime scene was completely sealed off? Ema: It would appear so. Apollo: Hmm... No way for a third party to escape without being spotted, so... (Great. It's another one of those convoluted locked-room mysteries.) The victim Apollo: About the victim, Minister Inga... He was the kingdom's Minister of Justice, correct? Ema: Yes. Inga Karkhuul Khura'in was the second most powerful figure in Khura'in. Plus, he was married to the queen. Apollo: Seems strange that someone of his status would abduct someone. Ema: Apparently, he only told a few of his most loyal subordinates about his plan. That way, there was little chance of the police or even the queen finding out. Apollo: What was Inga hoping to gain by getting his hands on the orb? Ema: That I don't know. But I'm working on it. Apollo: (...I wonder if it really was for what Paul Atishon-Wimperson said...?) Atishon: I must deliver it to my benefactor at all costs. Phoenix: What do they want that relic for anyway? Atishon: Heh heh heh. It's something to do with an old legend. My patron seeks the great power said to be granted to whoever solves its secret. Apollo: (A great power that is said to be bestowed on whoever solves the orb's secret. In Khura'in, only those who can channel spirits are said to be fit to rule. Was that why Inga wanted such power? Did he want to be king?) Amara's tomb Apollo: So this is the tomb of the previous queen? Ema: Yes, Queen Amara was laid to rest here. She lost her life in an arsonist's blaze. What a tragic end. I heard this tomb sits on the actual site of her residence before it was burned down. They built it on the same spot so her soul could rest in peace. Apollo: (So this is where the fire happened, huh.) Athena: Why do you think Minister Inga was holding Ms. Fey captive here? Ema: It's the perfect spot, if you think about it. It's close to his private quarters, which made it easy to keep an eye on his prisoner. And the courtyard is only open to the royal family, so he had little fear of prying eyes. Plus, the tomb is normally locked, and only the royal family is allowed access. Athena: So that's why he picked this place. Apollo: How long had Ms. Fey been held captive? Ema: About six days. Apollo: Really?! That long?! Ema: It appears that she was severely weakened by her prolonged confinement. She passed out as soon as she was freed, and is now on an IV drip at the hospital. She's been asleep ever since. Athena: Poor Ms. Fey. I hope she gets better soon. Present Attorney's Badge Ema: Your attorney's badge? Huh... Apollo: What, that normally gets a better reaction from you. Ema: I'm tired of collecting your fingerprints. It's kind of lost its luster. Apollo: Yeah, but who knows? There could be other people's prints on it. Ema: Ooh, that's true! Hand it over, buddy! Apollo: Ah! Ema: ............Hmph. The only prints I found were yours. Apollo: (Argh, it's all dusty now.) Anything else Ema: Oh, you must need my forensic expertise! Just leave it to me! Apollo: Oh, um... Actually, I was wondering if you see anything strange about this. Ema: ...Oh. .................................... Apollo: (Why isn't she saying anything?) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: Ema, do you mind if we start looking around? Ema: Sure, I've already got the okay. Knock yourselves out. Oh, and here. It's a diagram the police drew of the tomb. I thought I'd give you a copy to help your investigation along. Apollo: Thank you. Tomb Diagram added to the Court Record. Ema: Oh, and let me know if you need my forensic expertise. Don't you dare keep all the fun to yourselves, you hear?! Apollo: You don't need to worry about that. (Besides, I'd hardly classify this as \"fun\".) Examine Front of Amara's sarcophagus Apollo: So this is Amara's sarcophagus. Let's take a closer look. Sarcophagus curtains Athena: Hey, these curtains open, Apollo. Sarcophagus keyhole Apollo: ...That's one big sarcophagus. Ema: They say the mummy of Amara, the former queen, rests inside. Apollo: A mummy, huh? ...Rats, it's locked. Ema: Hey, don't touch that! Apollo: You mean we can't search inside it? Ema: Not a chance. Besides, it's not something anyone'd try opening, anyway. Apollo: What if the real killer's hiding inside? Athena: Hey! Anyone in there? Ema: D-Don't do that! You're going to get us cursed! Athena: C-C-Cursed? Ema: The queen likely bears a grudge toward the living after such a violent, painful death. So no one dares touch the sarcophagus for fear of incurring her wrath. Athena: .........Oh no, Apollo. What am I going to do? Apollo: Don't look at me. Ema: ...In any case, the sarcophagus is temperature controlled. It's kept really cold to preserve the mummy. So even if someone did decide to hide inside it, they would eventually freeze to death. Apollo: I see... (Still, if they bundled up, I bet a person could hide in there for a little while.) Sides of Amara's sarcophagus Apollo: The sarcophagus is surrounded by a curtain. I bet someone could've hidden behind it. Ema: True, but that's one of the many places the royal guard checked after storming in. Athena: Wow, they were really thorough. Ema: Yes, well, apparently, one of their members loves mystery novels. He peered into every nook and cranny with an almost frightening amount of gusto. And when he was done, he said: \"Very interesting. It's like one of those locked-room mysteries.\" Apollo: Sounds like he's in the wrong line of work. Bloodstain on Amara's sarcophagus Athena: Wow, it's covered in blood. Apollo: With a blood spatter this large, it must've gotten all over the killer, too. Come to think of it... There was blood on Dhurke's clothes. Athena: The circumstantial evidence points to Dhurke being the killer. Apollo: That's what I'd conclude if I were a cop, too. (Why are things always so bleak for me...?) Holy Mother mural Apollo: It looks like the Holy Mother was painted here to watch over Amara's sarcophagus. Athena: So it's like, this tomb is protected by the founder? That must be so reassuring to those she left behind. Apollo: Only one problem: they didn't paint the eyes she needs to do said watching. Athena: Come to think of it, she doesn't have a mouth to smile down on the tomb with, either. It's actually kind of creepy. I wonder if being watched over by something like that gives the queen nightmares. Apollo: ...Hey, hey. Keep that up, and the founder just might come and \"watch over\" you, too. Broken statue (while facing Holy Mother painting) Apollo: Look, one of the statues is broken. Athena: Yeah, but it's kind of hard to see from here. Apollo: Let's check it out when we get a little closer. Front of broken statue Apollo: One of the statues is broken. Let's take a closer look. Broken statue Apollo: This thing's more splinter than statue now. Ema: The bullet from the victim's gun did a real number on it. Athena: It seems like something you'd get cursed for, you know? Apollo: In Minister Inga's case, I'd say getting your ticket punched is curse enough. Athena: Yeah, but don't curses extend to the afterlife? Apollo: You need to stop taking what Nahyuta says so seriously. Athena: I-I'm perfectly capable of thinking for myself! Brown magatamas Apollo: It's a magatama... I think. Did it come from the broken statue? Athena: Look, Apollo, there's another one. But the other statues only have one each. Apollo: Hey, you're right. Maybe this statue was special or something. Bullet Apollo: Look, there's a bullet here. Ema: It's from the pistol the victim was carrying. My guess is he tried to shoot his attacker, but missed, and the bullet ended up here. We've already determined the rifling marks to be a match to his gun. Athena: Rifling marks? Aren't those...? Ema: Oh ho! Shall I explain? The science behind it is absolutely fascinating. Apollo: No, no, we're good. Ema: Hmph, lawyers... Think they're so smart. Apollo: You do realize we can hear you. Sparkling object Apollo: Hm? There's something shiny down there. It's a pendant... Athena: There's blood on it. I wonder who it belongs to. Ema: All we know is it's not the victims. No one in the royal family recognized it. Apollo: ...Ema, did you lift any fingerprints from it? Ema: I did, but... ...I wasn't able to get a clean one. Apollo: That's too bad. Ema: But the blood turned out to be the victim's. Apollo: That means it must have fallen here in the course of the murder. (It might be Dhurke's. I should ask him about it later.) Pink Butterfly Pendant added to the Court Record. Body outline Apollo: Guess this is where Inga collapsed when he died. Better take a closer look. Body outline Apollo: They've already taken the body away. It's kind of sad how familiar I've become with body outlines. Ema: I have a photo of the body if you're interested. He was stabbed right in the back; the poor guy was practically skewered. Athena: What's he wearing on his arms? Ema: Those are the Cuffs of Justice. Seems to be a tradition here for the Minister of Justice to wear those forearm cuffs. Apollo: They look like they're made of a thick fabric, so I guess they aren't for protection. Athena: Maybe they're for keeping his sleeves out of the way when handling documents. Apollo: Yeah, that's probably their original purpose. But over the years, the reason for wearing them was probably forgotten. So now, they're just one of many traditional things that people do without knowing why. Athena: ...Oh, I get it. Kind of like the way you roll up your sleeves, huh? Apollo: ...Or your psychology, if we're going there. Athena: I happen to know why I started, thank you very much! Tomb Crime Photo added to the Court Record. Body outline (subsequent times) Apollo: These white lines indicate where the minister's body fell. Athena: Hey, didn't Ema give us a photo of the crime scene before they took the body away? Apollo: Looks like he was stabbed in the back. Athena: Those things on his arms... They're called the \"Cuffs of Justice,\" right? Apollo: Yeah, they're supposedly a traditional part of the minister's outfit. Knife Apollo: So, this is the murder weapon. Ema, did you find any prints on it? Ema: Yep, and they were super clear. They belong to one Dhurke Sahdmadhi. Apollo: That's not good. Were there any others? Ema: There was one more print from another individual... ...but it was too smudged to identify. It's probably an old print from someone else who had handled the knife. Apollo: Oh... (Yet another piece of unhelpful info to add to our ever-growing pile... *sigh*) Knife (subsequent times) Apollo: The murder weapon... Athena: Apparently, Dhurke's prints were found on it. Apollo: That's not very helpful, is it. Cell phone Apollo: I wonder if this is Inga's cell phone. Ema: It should be. His fingerprints are all over it. Apollo: Do you know if he talked with anyone recently? Ema: There were a few calls logged between him and his underlings. They're all members of the secret police, who were directly under the minister's control. Athena: You mean like spies? Apollo: I don't think that's quite it. Pistol Apollo: So the minister was armed, huh. Ema: Mm-hm. That's a four-shot pistol. He had it for self-defense, apparently. But it won't be firing anything any time soon. Apollo: Huh? Athena: He was carrying a broken gun around for show? Ema: No, we recovered a bullet here. Which means the gun probably broke as the minister fired its last round. Thing is... the gun's chambers are all empty. Yet, that one bullet is the only bullet we could find. Apollo: That is strange. Where did the other three go? Athena: ...Maybe Dhurke ate them. Apollo: We can ask the next time we see him. Just be ready for his predictably \"shocking\" answer. Pistol (subsequent times) Apollo: Inga's pistol... He used to carry it for self-defense. Athena: Apparently, he fired all four rounds. Apollo: Yeah, but only one slug was recovered in this tomb. Rows of statues Apollo: It's like a small army of monks, all neatly lined up. It looks like they're facing the sarcophagus in prayer. Athena: If you look carefully, each one has a slightly different expression. Apollo: I wonder if they used real people as models. Athena: Some are frowning, some are smiling... Hm? There's one that looks like he's trying his hardest not to burst out laughing. Apollo: ...Really? Hmm, I wonder why. Athena: Maybe it's like those times when things are so intense, you can't help but laugh. You know, like at funerals and stuff. Apollo: They went through all the trouble of depicting that? Talk about going overboard... Right incense burner Apollo: It's full of ash. My guess would be this is an incense burner. Athena: Hey, look, Apollo. There's something in the ashes. Apollo: ...Let's see what it is. Ash Apollo: It's full of ash. They must burn incense in here. Athena: So, I was wondering, Apollo... Did the ash come from the incense sticks that were burned in this? Or do people put their incense in after there was already she in here to hold them up? Apollo: Don't be silly, Athena. The answer's simple. The ash is the product of prayers from countless visitors who came here. It's not a chicken-or-the-egg kind of thing. Apollo: Oh, that's an interesting take on it. It's so much more poetic than mine! Gemstone Apollo: Is that... a gemstone? Wonder what it's doing here. Athena: Heh heh heh, I've got this one covered, Apollo. Would you like to hear my brilliant theory? Apollo: Well, I guess it wouldn't do any harm. Athena: You know how people make wishes by throwing coins into a fountain, right? Well-- Apollo: You know, on second thought, I'm good. Athena: Whaaat?! Y-You sure you don't need to hear my theory? I was just about to get to the good part! Apollo: Let's just ask Ema. That'll be much quicker. Excuse me, Ema? What's this gemstone doing here? Ema: Oh, that... It's not a gem, it's a button -- albeit a very expensive one -- from the victim's jacket. Must've fallen off and gotten in there somehow. Apollo: See? Every puzzle has an answer, Athena. Athena: Well, I thought my idea was pretty good... Wait... What's with this soot? See here, on the gemstone. Apollo: ...Hey, you're right. Gemstone added to the Court Record. Right incense burner (after examining gemstone) Apollo: It's full of ash. My guess would be this is an incense burner. Grape juice Apollo: This is the grape juice Inga was drinking. He was probably nervous before his meeting with Dhurke. Athena: So he drank grape juice? I'm not seeing the logic here. Apollo: Mr. Wright told me all about it when he was hospitalized a few years ago. He said grape juice has something in it that helps you relax. Athena: Really? ...Um, are you sure he was talking about regular, plain old grape juice? Because it sounds like he was talking about the fermented variety. Apollo: No, he couldn't have meant that. I mean, we're talking about a medical facility. They wouldn't have allowed something like that in. Athena: R-Right... Let's just leave it at that. Side paintings (while facing Holy Mother mural) Apollo: There's a painting up there, but I can't see it very well from here. Paintings right of Holy Mother mural Apollo: A baby on a lotus blossom? That's one strange painting. Ema: Apparently, that's part of a mural depicting the life and times of Queen Amara. You know, like a storyboard or something. Apollo: So that baby's supposed to be Amara? Athena: This one depicts Amara preaching to the faithful. Apollo: It's hard to put into words, but I've never seen anything like it. Let's see, the next one is... I-Is that... Dhurke? Why does he have horns? Athena: My best guess is... ...it depicts the first time Amara and Dhurke met. Apollo: So he's supposed to be some kind of demon who's seducing her? Athena: Well, he WAS successful since they got married after that. Apollo: ...The mural continues on the opposite wall. Paintings left of Holy Mother mural Athena Is this supposed to be Amara channeling a spirit? Apollo: It looks like the spirit of some country's sultan or something. And she seems to be conveying something to his retainers. Athena: ...Sh-She's on fire. Apollo: This must be Amara's assassination as allegedly carried out by Dhurke. They really made him look evil. Athena: ...This is the weirdest one of all. Apollo: Is that supposed to be Dhurke facing his punishment in the afterlife? Anyway... Hm? I guess that's the last one. Athena: I guess we're supposed to see this as a happy ending. Apollo: Yeah, except nobody came out of this story happy. Chair Apollo: Ms. Fey was apparently tied to this chair. Let's take a closer look. We should try to cover every angle possible here. Let's use [left analog stick / WASD] to change our perspective and take a careful look around. (Changed from [Slide the Touch Screen...] in the original release) * (Line [...or use the Circle Pad ([Circle Pad]) to look around carefully in this area.] removed in the Trilogy release) Seat, rails, or legs of chair Apollo: (...Poor Ms. Fey. She must've been tied up to this chair.) Athena: I can just imagine how much her backside must've hurt after sitting here for so long. Apollo: It would've been torture for you, I bet. I mean, you don't know how to sit still. Athena: If by that you mean I like to stay active, then I have to agree with you. Rope Athena: I bet you didn't know, but I happen to be a bit of an escape artist myself. Trucy showed me how to do her rope escape trick. Apollo: Uh-huh. And why would you bother learning something like that? Athena: Because we're always getting into trouble when working cases with Mr. Wright. So I thought it might come in handy someday. Apollo: Well, I guess you're right about that. Ms. Fey could've definitely used that knowledge. Athena: That's right! So now, you just sit right here and we'll get started. Apollo: What in the world gave you the idea I wanted to learn?! Bloodstain on chair leg Apollo: Look, there's a bloodstain on one of the chair legs. Ema: Really?! Hey, you're right. I completely missed that. Apollo: Let's move the chair so we can check under it. ...There's more blood under the chair leg. Ema: Hmm... I wonder what it's doing there. I have some luminol here. Why don't you do some testing around it? Spray floor near rope Leads to: \"Look!\" Apollo: Look! The bloodstain leads all the way to the sarcophagus! Athena: Ema, is this Minister Inga's blood? Ema: Hold on one second... .........Huh? That's strange. I didn't get a match. Apollo: So then... whose blood is it? Dhurke and Ms. Fey weren't wounded as far as we know. Athena: And the blood's been wiped up by someone for some reason. Apollo: Yeah, that's strange, too. Mysterious Bloodstain added to the Court Record. Bloodstain on floor (after examining bloodstain on chair leg) Apollo: There's a bloodstain on the floor. Athena: It's already been mostly wiped up, but the stain leads all the way to the sarcophagus. Apollo: I wonder whose blood it is. Wall curtains Apollo: Someone could have hid behind these curtains. Athena: Here, I'll go give it a try! Well, can you tell I'm hiding here? Apollo: No, I can't tell at all. That's it! That's the perfect hiding place! Athena: We did it, Apollo! We solved the case! Ema: Sorry to burst your bubble, but... ...the royal guard searched the tomb high and low right after they stormed in. And they said no one else was in here besides Minister Inga, Dhurke, and Ms. Fey. Apollo: ...Well. Back to the drawing board, I guess. Athena: My brilliant deduction -- destroyed in three sentences. After examining sarcophagus keyhole, sides of Amara's sarcophagus, bloodstain on Amara's sarcophagus, Holy Mother mural, broken statue (zoomed in), brown magatamas, sparkling object, body outline (zoomed in), knife, cell phone, pistol, gemstone, bloodstain on chair leg, and wall curtains: Apollo: I think we've covered just about everything. Maybe we should go over what we've learned so far. Athena: Umm... For starters, we're dealing with a locked-room murder. But instead of the tomb being locked, it was being cordoned off by the royal guard. And after the murder, no one was found to be hiding inside. Apollo: Right. In addition... ...we also know that Dhurke's fingerprints are all over the murder weapon. Athena: The curtain around the sarcophagus was drenched in the victim's blood on one side. The blood must've also gotten on the killer when they stabbed the minister from behind. Apollo: Dhurke had blood on him when the crime was first discovered. Unfortunately, he doesn't remember what happened. .................. Athena: ............ Apollo: (This is not good.) Athena: So, what we know so far is... ...things couldn't be worse for our case. And that's still and understatement somehow. Apollo: Yeah, it's looking pretty grim. Ema: Oh, uh! If you two are done here, I'll have to ask you to leave. Go on, scoot! Apollo: Something wrong, Ema? Why are you trying to give us the boot? Ema: ...It's just easier if you're not here when His Ephemeral Holiness arrives. ...Ah! Apollo: (Speak of the devil.) Ema: P-Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... Nahyuta: Detective Skye... It seems you've spoken at length with these two lawyers. I do hope you've also kept an eye on them. Ema: Y-Yes, of course! Like a hawk! They didn't touch a single thing! Ha, a-ha ha ha! Nahyuta: ...Give a lawyer an inch, and they'll take a mile. Never forget that. Apollo: (There's that look of distrust again.) ...Hey, Nahyuta. Do you really believe that Dhurke's guilty? Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: And are you seriously going to prosecute this case? I mean, he's your father. You were once part of the Defiant Dragons, weren't you? Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: Hey! Nahyuta! Wait! I said wait! Come on, Athena, after him! Athena: Huh? ...Oh, uh, right behind you! May 18Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence Apollo: Nahyuta, would you stop already?! Nahyuta: .........What do you want? Apollo: It's about Dhurke. Would you please hear me out? Nahyuta: ...I fail to see why I should. Now, if you'll excuse me... Apollo: Apollo: Nahyuta! ...Are you afraid of what I might have to say? If not, there's no harm in listening, right? Nahyuta: .........Very well. Speak. But make it quick. There is much I must do. Apollo: (Why does everything have to be so difficult with you?) Talk Prosecuting Dhurke Apollo: So, I know you'll be prosecuting Dhurke's case, but... ...aren't there any other prosecutors in this country? Why does it have to be you? Nahyuta: ...Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran, personally requested that I serve as prosecutor. Apollo: Sh-She did? That WOULD make it hard to say no. Nahyuta: Her Eminence thinks highly of my prosecutorial skills. Apollo: Still, she didn't have to ask you to handle a case against your own father. Be honest. You really don't want to do this, do you? Nahyuta: ...Ahh. You speak of love and sentiment. Apollo: Er, I guess so. Nahyuta: I do not deny such human emotions. But... the law is the law. And placing personal feelings above it is beyond reprieve. ...Do you disagree? Apollo: W-Well... No, I don't disagree, but... Nahyuta: Civilizations only exist due to the confines of the law. Without them, love and sentiment would lack the fertile they need to flourish. Do you disagree? Apollo: No, but... Nahyuta: The law must be obeyed. This truth sits above all else, including personal feelings. Therefore, whether or not I am the son of the accused is of no consequence. It is that simple, or would you say otherwise? Apollo: Nnnngh... B-But... Athena: Come on, Apollo! Tell him how wrong he is! Apollo: B...But don't you... you know... wish it wasn't that way...? Nahyuta: ............... Athena: ......... Nahyuta: It appears I've wasted my breath on you. Athena: And the winner is... Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! Nahyuta: ...Hmph. Still spewing empty words devoid of meaning or consequence, I see... ...you putrid red pepper. Apollo: Argh! ........ (I know I'm right... But did he have to be so eloquent about his point? It's like he's trying to cover something up with his pretty words.) Athena: Apollo, I'd cut back on the debates with him if I were you. Just stick to questions, like the one you wanted to ask. Who Dhurke cares about (appears after \"Prosecuting Dhurke\") Leads to: \"Nahyuta, I wanted to ask you about that hostage situation.\" Present Attorney's Badge Nahyuta: Why is that badge before me? Apollo: Remember how we used to talk about what we wanted to be back when we were kids? I wanted to be a lawyer, and you, a prosecutor. You said you wanted to prosecute bad guys to make sure they got punished. Nahyuta: Yes, passing judgment upon evil... That is my calling. And it is why I have taken this case. Apollo: Are you saying Dhurke is evil? Nahyuta: He who goes against what is righteous and holy... ...I shall reap his soul with all my power, whoever he may be, for that is my role. Apollo: (Then I'll just have to defend his soul with all MY power, Nahyuta.) Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Nahyuta: Alas... Another soul has departed this world, and must now be guided to the Twilight Realm. Apollo: You would even hold last rites for a kidnapper like Minister Inga? Nahyuta: Criminals, too, must be given funerary rites. Deny that, and their soul will turn malevolent, bringing woe upon the living. That is why all who pass on must receive a proper requiem. Apollo: Makes sense. I mean, if I were murdered, I'd probably be pretty keen on revenge, too. Anything else Nahyuta: The putrid-minded lawyer seeks information from me? Apollo: Come on, throw me a bone here. Nahyuta: I think not. Apollo: Well, aren't we stingy? Apollo: Nahyuta, I wanted to ask you about that hostage situation. Inga said he had someone dear to Dhurke in the palm of his hand. And he was using that person, along with his hostage, as leverage in obtaining the orb. Nahyuta: ...! That's news to me. Apollo: Well, that's what Inga said. Dhurke: You can kiss your chances of getting the orb goodbye. Inga: ...Heh heh heh. Maya Fey ain't my only... how shall I say... insurance, you know, Dhurke. Dhurke: What? Inga: I've got someone dear to you right in the palm of my hand, see? Now that one, well... You can imagine what kinds of things I could do, right? Dhurke: What? Inga: I've got someone dear to you right in the palm of my hand, see? Now that one, well... You can imagine what kinds of things I could do, right? Dhurke: ! ............ Inga: Heh heh. Glad you're seeing things my way. Apollo: I got the impression Dhurke had no choice but to follow Inga's demands after he heard that. So who do you suppose this special person is? Nahyuta: .........I wouldn't know. BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: ! (My bracelet's reacting!) Hey, Nahyuta, about what you just said-- Nahyuta: Apollo: Ack! Ow-ow-ouch! M-My bracelet is crushing my wrist! Youch! That really hurts! Wh-What the heck's going on?! Nahyuta: ...I'm wise to your tricks, you putrid pepper. That bracelet reacts to the anxieties around you by squeezing your wrist. But now that I know how it works, I can make it tighten around your wrist any time I wish. Consider this a warning. Apollo: Argh... (I don't know how he did it, but this renders my bracelet useless.) Nahyuta: Such devilry is powerless in the face of the Holy Mother's blessings. Athena: Looks like your special power won't work against Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, Apollo. We'll have to try something else. Apollo: Argh, you're right. We'll just have to ask Dhurke about this. Nahyuta: .........It appears... Apollo: ? Nahyuta: ...You intend to go through with a trial you have no hope of winning. Grow up, Mr. Justice. We are no longer children, you and I. Apollo: I'm not the one who needs to grow up, Nahyuta. In case you didn't hear, I won my last case against none other than Mr. Wright. Nahyuta: ! Athena: You tell him, Apollo! Nahyuta: ............... Apollo: (Is he mad? I can never tell with him.) Nahyuta: ...This trial is different. Your foolishness will only earn you a death sentence for aiding and abetting a criminal. And those who die as criminals... ...are doomed to be reborn in the next life as something lower than a bug or vegetable. You would be lucky to return to this realm as a patch of mold. Apollo: M-Mold? That's pretty harsh. Nahyuta: If you wish to avert such a fate, abandon this folly before it is too late. Apollo: ...I don't care if I end up as a dollop of blue cheese dressing in my next life! I'm going to defend Dhurke in court! Nahyuta: .........You fool. Know this... I intend to prosecute the accused with all my might -- no matter what you say or do. Consider yourself forewarned. ...Now, if you will excuse me. Athena: Prosecutor Sahdmadhi knows his father will be publicly executed if he's found guilty. Yet he won't show even an ounce of mercy. Apollo: ............... (...Nahyuta. Is this the real you? Have you really changed? Do you really plan on sending Dhurke to his death? Do you even hear me? Don't Dhurke and I matter to you anymore?) To be continued May 18Tem'phul Temple Phoenix: (Maya passed out right after we found her in the tomb.) Maya: ...I feel... exhausted. I can't keep my eyes... open... Phoenix: (She's been out cold ever since. We haven't been able to get a word out of her. The doctor says it's just exhaustion, but I can't help but worry...) Edgeworth: What is it, Wright? Are you all right? Phoenix: ...Yeah. Just thinking is all. I'm glad you're here, Edgeworth. We wouldn't have gotten the permissions we have without you. Edgeworth: ...Well, I didn't come all the way to Khura'in to be useless. Speaking of the investigation, I received a few things from Detective Skye. These should prove to be useful to us as well. Inga's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Tomb Diagram added to the Court Record. Tomb Crime Photo added to the Court Record. Phoenix: I can't thank you enough, Edgeworth. (Honestly, I'd have been so lost without him these past few days.) ???: You there! The \"Barbed Head\" lawyer, Phoenix Wriiiiiight! Phoenix: Huh? .........You're... from the Ga'ran Royal Guard, right...? Royal Guard: I am Lah'kee, royal guard member and Her Eminence's shoooooulder rubber!!! Phoenix: That's... very specific... And what does the royal shoulder rubber want with me? Wait, come to think of it, my shoulders ARE a bit stiff-- Royal Guard: Don't be absuuurd!!! I am here for one purpose ooonly!!! I am to bring you before Her Eminence... ...Queen Ga'ran, grand priestess of Khura'in!! Will you complyyy?!!! Phoenix: The queen? What could she want with me? (And why does he have to shout like that?) Edgeworth: Hmm... I can't fathom why Queen Ga'ran would summon you... ...but I advise you to accept Her Eminence's gracious invitation. .........Royal shoulder rubber Lahkee, was it? May I join Mr. Wright in his audience with the queen? Royal Guard: The name's Lah'kee! L-A-H apostrophe K-E-E!!! And...! All praise the omnipotent Queen Ga'raaan!!! For she has already foreseen and approved your request, Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth!!! You are both to come with meeeee!!! Edgeworth: You mean to say that Queen Ga'ran sees our every move? Royal Guard: Yes indeeeed! Her Eminence's spiritual power is immeeeeeeense!!! She can even see what's going on thoooousands of miiiiiiiiles away!!! Edgeworth: .........Wright. I fear I'll lose my hearing next if we don't hurry. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Me, too... Why would the queen herself summon me personally? What could she possibly be up to? Examine Temple Phoenix: There weren't any hotels available, so this is our home for tonight. It's a bed to sleep in and a roof over our heads. Phoenix: Sorry to disappoint, but... there aren't any beds here. We'll have to sleep on the floor next to a bunch of strangers. Edgeworth: Wh-What? ...Tell me there's a shower at the very least. Phoenix: The kitchen sink works just fine, I hear. Edgeworth: Of all the-- Wright, you will work to bring this case to a swift resolution. The sooner the better. Edgeworth: .........I suppose it will do. Spring Phoenix: The water's so clear, it's like a window into the soul. Edgeworth: I wouldn't stare too hard into it, Wright. Or you may find all your bluffs staring right back at you. Phoenix: No pool-gazing in front of a client. Got it. Temples in background Edgeworth: There appears to be many temples in this area. Phoenix: Yeah, there are always a lot of monks and worshippers praying around here. And then there's tourists like us. Edgeworth: It's unfortunate that we have more pressing matters to attend to. Then again, sightseeing with you of all people isn't exactly at the top of my list. Phoenix: (As if you have the luxury to be so picky, Edgeworth.) Talk Any Ideas? Edgeworth: So you'd been here all this time. I wondered where you had gone. Phoenix: ...Don't tell me you missed me, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: As if. The courts have been so peaceful without you around. Phoenix: You make it sound like I leave legal devastation in my wake. Edgeworth: Heh... Well, don't you? What to do Edgeworth: Well, Wright, what do you intend to do now? Phoenix: I was thinking... I want to help Apollo win this case. So why don't we try to gather whatever information we can? Edgeworth: You're quite the considerate boss. Phoenix: Well, I kinda forced him to take care of the office in my absence, so... ...it's the least I can do. Present Attorney's Badge or Tomb Diagram Edgeworth: Still at it, I see. I guess borders mean little in the face of your incurable habit. Phoenix: Well, I heard you used to present evidence left and right during your investigations, too. Edgeworth: That was a long time ago. ...Besides, who did you hear that from? Phoenix: Oh, I have my sources. Edgeworth: Oh? Well, tell your \"source\" that I look forward to his next salary review. Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Edgeworth: It's ironic that the man tasked with upholding the law should end up breaking it. Phoenix: Well, it's not like we don't have our fair share of that back home. Edgeworth: Hmph, that is a thing of the past. The worst offenders have already been removed. Phoenix: Now that you mention it, wasn't Gaspen Payne expelled from the prosecutor's office? Edgeworth: Yes, he was a particularly troublesome individual. I was shocked to see him resurface here in Khura'in, and with considerable sway, no less. I just hope he doesn't end up making a mess of things here as well. Royal Residence Examine Ga'ran Palace Phoenix: Ga'ran Palace, the heart of the kingdom's government and religion. Edgeworth: Yes, the two are inseparably intertwined here in Khura'in. The religious beliefs of its people touch every aspect of their lives, including legal affairs. Phoenix: Right. Like how they commune with spirits in court. I suppose Khura'inism is the glue that binds their faith, law, and politics together. It may seem strange to foreigners like us, but for them, it's perfectly natural. Landscape Phoenix: What a beautiful place this is. But I'd be enjoying this a whole lot more if we weren't investigating a murder. Edgeworth: Commoners aren't normally allowed access to the royal residence, you know. Under ordinary circumstances, it would be impossible to take in such a spectacular view. Though murder is certainly a unique reason to be offered such a rare opportunity. Rayfa's residence Phoenix: This place is decorated with all sorts of colorful flowers. And that view from the veranda looks like it would be amazing. If I had to guess, I'd say Rayfa must live here. Amara's Tomb Phoenix: Amara's Tomb -- the scene of Inga's murder. Poor Maya was held captive in there. Edgeworth: To think she was actually being held here in Khura'in. If only we had found out sooner. Phoenix: ...No point dwelling on that now. All we can do is to keep moving forward. Edgeworth: Yes, of course. Footprints Edgeworth: There are footprints coming from this residence. Phoenix: Too bad they just kinda end. I wonder who made them and where they went. Urns Phoenix: This overturned urn spilled its water all over the place. It was already knocked over when we got here earlier this afternoon, so... ...we can rule out Athena at least. Edgeworth: .........Wright. What does it say about you if your first suspect is your own subordinate? Inga's residence Phoenix: ...What a gaudy building. Looks like something you'd appreciate, Edgworth. Edgeworth: ...For the record, Wright, I have absolutely no interest in such ostentatious things. Phoenix: (Says the man who rides around in a red sports car, wearing that frilly cravat thing.) Amara's Tomb Examine Anywhere Phoenix: Apollo and Athena are already working this area. Edgeworth and I should try someplace else. Detention Center Examine Bell Edgeworth: This bell must be for summoning the guard. Phoenix: I bet one of your detectives would come running if you rang it. Edgeworth: Let's find out, shall we? Phoenix: Th-They're not seriously going to show up, are they? Guard Phoenix: Oh, the guard's asleep. And here I thought he was stoically doing his duty. Impressive. May 18Ga'ran Palace - Audience Chamber Ga'ran: Ah, the \"Barbed Head\" lawyer has arrived. We bid you welcome. And you, as well, Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth. Phoenix: Th-Thank you. (This place is still as magnificent as last time.) Ga'ran: We have heard much about you, Barbed One. It seems your bluffs and tomfoolery tend to leave our court devastated in their wake. Phoenix: Uh... Is that what people have been saying about me? Edgworth: ...Wright! Where are your manners?! Your Eminence. I am both humbled and delighted to be in your presence. Phoenix: Oh, umm... Your Eminence... Um, glad to be here. Looks like you're doing well. Ga'ran: ...Heh. It is all right. There is no need to keep your head bowed all day. Edgeworth: Yes, Your Eminence. Rayfa: ............ Phoenix: (Rayfa's not looking too good. I guess even she can't just bounce back from her father's murder...) ...So what can I do for you, Your Eminence? Ga'ran: We wish to question you about something related to the case at hand. Phoenix: (Perfect. Because I have a few questions of my own.) Examine Throne Phoenix: That's one swanky throne. I wouldn't mind taking a seat there myself. Edgeworth: The jester and the crown. I imagine it'd make quite the interesting picture. Phoenix: You know Edgeworth... I hate to say this, but you're absolutely right. Guards Phoenix: It's the Ga'ran Royal Guard. The one who came for us earlier said that he's the royal shoulder rubber. ...Um, excuse me. But are each of you charged with your own specific task? Royal Guard: I'm the royal teeeeeaaaa server! Royal Guard: I'm the royal taaaaaaster! Royal Guard: I'm the royal bed maaaaaaaker! Royal Guard: I'm the royal fitness traaaaiiiiine-- Phoenix: All right, all right... I'm sorry I asked. Edgeworth: At this rate, one has to wonder if there is no task left unassigned by Her Eminence. Talk Inga's crime Ga'ran: We fear we do not fully comprehend what has transpired. So it is that we summoned you here to further elucidate the situation. Is it true that our husband Inga had been seeking the Founder's Orb? Phoenix: That's right. He wanted to trade a hostage for it. That's why he abducted Maya Fey. Rayfa: Insolent fool! *ka-tonk!* Phoenix: Oww! Rayfa: That is a lie! A lie, I say! Father would have never done such a thing! Phoenix: B-But he did abduct Maya. That much is-- Rayfa: I will not stand here and listen to this nonsense! You will pay for this, you... you...! *ka-tonk!* *ka-tonk!* *ka-tonk!* Phoenix: Ow-Ow-Oww! P-Please, Your Benevolence! Ga'ran: That is quite enough, Rayfa. We understand your feelings, but we fear he speaks the truth. For we believe we know why your father would do such a thing. Rayfa: Huh? Ga'ran: We believe he was seeking the orb as a means of obtaining spiritual power. And with it, he intended to usurp the throne. Rayfa: .........M-Mother... Phoenix: What do you mean, Your Eminence? Ga'ran: Inga was planning a coup, for he was dissatisfied with the current administration... ...and his secret police was the primary instrument of his treason. Phoenix: The secret police... They came up during the high priest's murder trial, too. An elite force under the direct command of the Minister of Justice -- in this case, Inga. The man who was hunting down rebels as Lady Kee'ra was a member of that group. Ga'ran: Indeed. Inga turned that once proud force into his own private army. And he intended on using them to launch a coup and assassinate us. Edgeworth: So Your Eminence had no control over them? Ga'ran: As much as it shames us to admit it, Khura'in is not the unified realm it would appear to be. We are truly sorry you have had to witness the dirty underbelly of our kingdom. Rayfa: H...How could Father...? Ga'ran: But know that Inga could not have become king simply through our assassination. For in Khura'in, only those who possess spiritual power may sit on the throne. Edgeworth: I see... That explains why Minister Inga was seeking the Founder's Orb. Ga'ran: Barbed One, do you recall the man known as Pees'lubn Andistan'dhin? Phoenix: ...What about him? Ga'ran: He, too, was involved in Inga's machinations. Inga had bought his loyalty, ordered the man to steal the orb, and covered up the theft. Phoenix: And then, he sent the orb to the U.S. for Dr. Buff to study... It's all coming together... Dhurke the criminal Ga'ran: The capture of the infamous villain Dhurke Sahdmadhi... It may prove to be the crowning achievement of our reign. Now, perhaps, the kingdom may return to the peace it once knew. Oh, what a joyous day. Royal Guard: Hail to Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran, Grand Priestess of Khura'in! Her Eminence's spiritual power invoked a blessing straight from the Holy Mother! Phoenix: (I could see how her cronies would be elated at the prospect. But the queen herself seems almost giddy for someone whose husband was just murdered.) Rayfa: Father... Phoenix: (Rayfa, on the other hand, doesn't appear to be taking it so well.) About that incident that occurred twenty-three years ago... The one in which Dhurke was accused of assassinating Queen Amara. Ga'ran: Yes, he set fire to her private residence, burning my dear sister alive. Phoenix: Murder by arson... Ga'ran: ONly a demon would be capable of such a heinous crime. Phoenix: (But that event also set the stage for you to become queen...) What did you do before you were crowned queen, Your Eminence? Ga'ran: As part of our training to be queen, we served in many different governmental positions. The longest of which was as the previous Minister of Justice. It was in that position that we were best able to support our elder sister, Queen Amara. Phoenix: (Interesting... That's her husband's position, or at least it was.) And when you ascended to the throne, you passed the Defense Culpability Act. Defense Culpability Act (appears after \"Dhurke the criminal\") Phoenix: \"...those who would support criminals will be deemed just as guilty.\" What prompted you to pass something like the Defense Culpability Act, Your Eminence? Ga'ran: ...The assassination of our dear sister Amara. When the infamous villain Dhurke Sahdmadhi was apprehended... ...he announced that he would act as his own lawyer. Phoenix: (That's right... Dhurke used to be a lawyer.) Ga'ran: Dhurke had been an extraordinarily talented lawyer, and highly esteemed by the people. But he falsified evidence in an attempt to win his own case. Phoenix: I see... Ga'ran: But when the truth of his fabrications and the assassination of the queen came to light... ...the people were devastated. And trust in the legal system plummeted. Edgeworth: .........Now why does that sound so familiar? Phoenix: Yeah, I wonder, aha-hah-hah... Ga'ran: In Khura'in, the Hall of Justice is a sacred space where victims receive their last rites. Should the people lose their faith in it, the kingdom would be shaken to its very core. That is why the Defense Culpability Act had to be passed. It was the only way to keep our legal system from tumbling into the abyss. Phoenix: So that's how you sought to eliminate the use of perjury and phony evidence, huh. But that law is what made lawyers go extinct in your kingdom. Now there's no one left to defend those who have been accused. Ga'ran: .........We see how you could take issue with such a reality. However, we have not banned the act of lawyering itself. Those who are confident that they can prove their client's innocence... ...are always welcome to mount a vigorous defense, as you yourself have shown. Phoenix: W-Well, I guess so, but... Without lawyers, there's the possibility of false charges being filed and prosecuted. Ga'ran: So long as our prosecutors continue to run nothing but perfect trials... ...there needn't be fear of such nefarious dealings. Do you disagree? Phoenix: (Perfect prosecutors and their perfect trials, huh...) Edgeworth: Let's not get started down THIS path... Ga'ran: Furthermore, here in Khura'in, we have the Divination Séance. And so it is we no longer need lawyers, for the dead do not lie. Phoenix: Well, in the short time I've been here, I've beaten back false charges twice. And I've found that cases built on the memories of the dead are less than perfect. So yes, I do take issue with the Defense Culpability Act, to say the least. Ga'ran: ...Ho ho ho. Such relentless rhetoric. Your reputation precedes you, Barbed One. It feels as if we ourselves were being cross-examined. Phoenix: O-Oh, no, that wasn't my intention. Ga'ran: ...It is true that some feel that the Defense Culpability Act is a necessary evil at best. But it is a small sacrifice upon which the peace of our kingdom has been forged. Phoenix: (If you consider executing innocent lawyers a small sacrifice, then sure.) Ga'ran: The fact is that following its passage... ...the crime rate here in Khura'in dropped markedly. Therefore, we have no regrets concerning the enactment of the Defense Culpability Act. Phoenix: (Really? None at all?) Edgeworth: Wright, why don't we leave it at that? This isn't a court of law, after all. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Present Anything Phoenix: Um, please take a look at this... Ga'ran: ...That reminds us of when Dhurke was still practicing law. So, we see that lawyers in your country also present evidence... ...simply to gauge the other party's reaction when all else has failed. Do not presume to use such simplistic methods upon us. Phoenix: S-Sorry. After clearing all Talk options: Ga'ran: About the Founder's Orb that was to be exchanged for the hostage... It went missing after the murder. Would you happen to know anything about that? Phoenix: It's missing? I'm sure Dhurke had it when he went into the tomb. If it wasn't there, I have no idea where it could be, Your Eminence. Ga'ran: ...In that case, then perhaps Dhurke has hidden it somewhere. ...Incidentally... there is the matter of that horned youth you were with. Phoenix: Oh, you must mean Apollo. Ga'ran: From his odd hairstyle, may we assume him to be a relative? Perhaps, your younger brother? Phoenix: N-No, no! You've got it all wrong. He's Dhurke's son. Well, more like foster son -- they're not actually related by blood. Ga'ran: Dhurke's...? .........Royal guard! Royal Guard: Your Eminence! Phoenix: Hm? (What's she whispering in that one guy's ear?) Ga'ran: .........Thank you for your time. The two of you may go now. Edgeworth: Yes, Your Eminence. We'll be on our way. Phoenix: (Okay, now what? Apollo and Athena have the murder scene investigation covered, so... ...maybe we should go speak with the locals over at the bazaar.) May 18Khura'in - Bazaar RAWWWRRR! Edgeworth: Wh-What... Was that a lion? Phoenix: Oh, that? Caught me by surprise, too, when I first heard it. It's the cry of a local bird known as a warbaa'd. Edgeworth: A bird? That sounds like that? Warbaa'd: RAWWWRRR! Edgeworth: Sounds more like a beast than a bird, if you ask me. Phoenix: It's a form of mimicry. You know, to help protect them against predators and stuff. Edgeworth: Yes, well... Can't say I've heard one quite like that before. Phoenix: Oh, it's more than unusual -- it's endangered. It's extremely rare to encounter one in the wild these days. Edgeworth: ...If it's so rare, then what's one doing out here in the middle of the bazaar? Phoenix: You got me. Maybe it's got something to do with it being their national bird. *BANG* Phoenix: Aaahh! (Was that a gunshot?!) ???: Har har har har har! Startle ya, PW? Phoenix: Wh-What was that, Datz?! Datz: The Defiant Dragons' newest weapon. I call these puppies... Dragon Snot Snaps! Phoenix: Uh, huh... And you need those... why? Datz: Because our hard work is starting to pay off! Thanks to our TV signal hijacking and stuff, more and more people are joining our cause. But on account o' that, the regime's been cracking down on us real tough-like. Phoenix: Yeah, there's been a lot going on lately. Datz: You can say that again. I mean, what with the high priest's fake-murder-slash-suicide. People are calling it the \"DCA Tragedy,\" and it's causing a real public uproar. Phoenix: (Hopefully this means Tahrust's death won't be in vain after all.) ...So how exactly is a handful of firecrackers going to be of help to you guys anyway? Datz: Simple. First, I supply 'em to our fellow rebels. Then we use 'em as a diversion when we need to shake Ga'ran's goons. Phoenix: Huh? Datz: Like this! *BANG!* Phoenix: Whoa! W-Will you cut that out?! I'm not with the regime, and I'm not chasing you! Datz: Har har har har har har! Haaaar har har har har! Your reaction! That was priceless, PW! Warbaa'd: RAWWWRRR! Datz: Har har har har har har! Guess I startled that warbaa'd, too! Phoenix: (It's a miracle no one's trying to arrest him while he's too busy laughing.) ???: You there. Datz: ! Rayfa: You are one of those insurgents, are you not? Datz: Yikes! ...Take that! *BANG!* Rayfa: Eek! Phoenix: Aaand he's gone. Those firecrackers are more useful than I thought. Rayfa: Barbed Head! Phoenix: Your Benevolence. What can I do for you? Rayfa: I... I wanted to speak with you. .........About what my mother said... I do not believe a word of it. My father could not have been planning a coup. Phoenix: Well, I can understand why you'd feel like that, but... Rayfa: It was a setup! Someone must have been plotting against him. Phoenix: Um, and how do you know that? Rayfa: I just do. Because the Holy Mother guides me. And as the royal priestess, I must uncover the truth for all to see. Phoenix: (Hmm... Maybe this is just how Rayfa expresses her sense of duty.) Rayfa: You're investigating this matter, are you not? Then rejoice, for I shall accompany you, and bestow upon you the royal priestess's wisdom. Phoenix: Ha, a-ha ha. That's the best news I've heard all day, Your Benevolence. (No one would dare get in our way with Rayfa by our side.) We humbly accept your offer, don't we, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: As you wish, Wright. Rayfa: Excellent. Then let us begin with my father's private quarters. We should be able to find some clues there. I shall expose this false charge for what it is, if it is the last thing I do! Phoenix: (Could it be? Is the reason she's so defensive about Inga because she's a daddy's girl?) Rayfa: Barbed Head! Let us not waste any time! My father's private quarters are located within the royal residence. Now, follow me! Phoenix: Wait! She's sure in a hurry. Edgeworth: Wright, the minister's private quarters may hold evidence related to his murder as well. Phoenix: Yeah, maybe we can kill two birds with one stone. (Rayfa's awfully fired up. I just hope she'll be ready for the truth we find. After all, it's hard to believe that Inga was not in full control of the whole affair.) Examine Any point of interest Edgeworth: I never thought the day would come when we'd be investigating a case side by side. Phoenix: Oh? 'Cause I never thought the day would come when you'd get sentimental on me. Edgeworth: Nghrk! Come on, Wright! Time's a wasting! Phoenix: Wait, exactly which one of us was wasting time here? May 18Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence Phoenix: Now, if we could figure out which of these buildings houses Inga's private quarters... That's where we'll find Rayfa. Examine Inga's residence Phoenix: Now that's what I call an extravagant exterior. Is this where Inga's private quarters are? Edgeworth: Watch your step, Wright. That urn's been knocked over, spilling water everywhere. Phoenix: Yeah, the ground's soaked. I wonder who did this? ???: .........*sob* Phoenix: Hm? ...I think someone's in there. ???: *sob* Father... *sniffle* Phoenix: Is that... Princess Rayfa? Rayfa: There were still so many things I wished to tell you... Phoenix: (...She always puts on such a brave face. But hearing her crying all alone... I... I can't help but think of Trucy.) Rayfa: *sob* Father... ............... Phoenix: ...Um, Princess Rayfa? Are you in there? Rayfa: Ah! J-Just a moment! I'll be right out! .........I see you are finally here. Well, let us commence our investigation, shall we? Phoenix: ...Um, Your Benevolence? Maybe you should rest for a minute first. Rayfa: ...! You were eavesdropping on me! Weren't you?! Phoenix: Um, no! I mean, yes... Sorry. I couldn't help overhearing... Rayfa: .........Grrrr. Phoenix: I-It wasn't like I was spying on you or anything! Rayfa: ...You stupid... stupid... Barbed Head! *ka-tonk!* Phoenix: Yeowch! Edgeworth: ...You could've feigned ignorance. It's as if your brain-to-mouth filter shuts off the moment you step out of the courtroom. Phoenix: Ugh... I'm not THAT bad, Edgeworth. Rayfa: ...Anyway, what took you so long? I thought you would never get here. You have a lot of nerve, keeping the crown princess waiting. Phoenix: Oh, um... sorry? Rayfa: This was my father's residence. I have already unlocked it, so you can go right in. Oh, and... Be careful. Some dingbat dog in the courtyard and spilled water over there. Phoenix: A dingbat dog? Rayfa: That's right. The yappy mutt spilled a whole urn's worth. Phoenix: I wonder how it got into this area. Do you know what it looked like? Rayfa: Hmph. I have better things to do than to memorize what some stray dog looks like. Anyway, it is not worth talking about. Let's search my father's room, shall we? Phoenix: (...I really hope she's all right.) Inga's residence (subsequent times) Edgeworth: The Minister of Justice used to live here. Phoenix: Yeah, the decor looks like something he'd choose. After examining Inga's residence in Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence: May 18Ga'ran Palace - Inga's Private Quarters Phoenix: (What a mess. You can definitely tell a guy used to live in this room. I guess Inga and I had at least that much in common.) Rayfa: ...Bah, this staff keeps getting in the way. Nayna! .................. ...Oh. Phoenix: (Huh? Where's Nayna? Normally... ...she comes running whenever Rayfa calls.) Rayfa: ...That's right. Nayna is... Phoenix: (Nayna is... what?) Rayfa: Oh, well. You, Barbed Head! Come, hold this staff for me. Phoenix: Wh-Why me? Rayfa: Just take it! It's too heavy, and I am tired of holding it! Phoenix: (*sigh* How does Nayna put up with this day in and day out?) Um... I'll just set it over here for now. Examine Shoeprints Phoenix: There are some muddy shoeprints here. (Come to think of it... There was some spilled water by the entrance. Somebody must've stepped in it before coming in here.) Edgeworth: They're already dry. That means they're at least several hours old. Rayfa: Then someone must have been in here today in the early afternoon... ...for our servants clean this room each day. Here in Khura'in we have a saying: \"Leave not today's untidiness to the morrow.\" Phoenix: (Mine is: \"Why clean up today what you can leave for tomorrow?\") Hair dye bottle Phoenix: What's this? ...\"Je suis L'Belle!\"? Never thought I'd see THIS brand again... Edgeworth: It appears to be a sample of some sort of spray-on hair color. Phoenix: \"Color: Jet Black\"... I wonder if Inga was going grey. Here, Edgeworth. Maybe you can use it. Edgeworth: I like my natural hair color just fine, thank you very much! Desk Phoenix: His desk is crammed full of documents! Edgeworth: Hmm... They appear to be paperwork for executions. Phoenix: B-But for this many cases?! Edgeworth: Indeed. Something is rotten in the Kingdom of Khura'in. Hm? This one dates back to five years ago. Phoenix: Something tells me he simply kept putting them off because he hated doing paperwork. Bed Phoenix: That's one luxurious and comfy-looking bed. I've slept on nothing but hard floors since coming to Khura'in. Can't wait to sleep in a nice, soft bed again. Rayfa: Then take it. It's yours, if you wish. ......We'll have to clean this room out, anyway, now that my father's gone. Phoenix: But don't you want to keep these things as a memento of your father? Besides... I don't need his spirit haunting me late at night. Rayfa: .........Do you suppose if I slept on it, I could see my father once more? Phoenix: P-Princess Rayfa... (I honestly don't know how to answer that...) Bust Phoenix: Wow... That's one gaudy sculpture. Rayfa: My father sculpted it himself from a block of solid gold. Phoenix: (Why does it not surprise me that he was also a narcissist?) Ha ha ha. It's pretty detailed. He even included that personal stamp of his. Hey, the stamp's a little loose. Ah! Edgeworth: Look. There's a secret safe inside! Rayfa: Oh, my! To think such a thing was here all this time! Phoenix: Rats. Looks like we'll need the combination to get in. Bust (subsequent times) Edgeworth: To have a secret safe in his own bedroom... It seems the minister was a rather cagey man. Phoenix: Let's take a look inside. Who knows what we might find. Safe (after examining bust) Phoenix: We can't open this without the combination, but I doubt Princess Rayfa would know it... Edgeworth: Well, if we can't open it, we can't open it. For now, let's continue our investigation, and come back to this dilemma later. Syringe Phoenix: It's a syringe and a vial... Rayfa: Those were for my father's back pain. He said it really helped when the pain was particularly unbearable. Phoenix: It was that bad, huh. Edgeworth: He must've been injecting some sort of painkiller directly into his back, then. Rayfa: Yes, my father said his back pain could knock him off his feet. Phoenix: I know the feeling. I've experienced some pretty severe back pain of my own... Rayfa: Well, we can't have you throwing your back out in court, so why don't you take a vial? Phoenix: Oh, uh, no thanks. I hear your body builds up a tolerance to that sort of thing. Painkiller Shots ninja'd into pocket. Rayfa: I thought you didn't want them. Phoenix: (I'm going straight to a chiropractor as soon as I get home.) Syringe (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's a syringe and a vial... Rayfa: Those were for my father's back pain. He said it really helped when the pain was particularly unbearable. Phoenix: It was that bad, huh. Edgeworth: He must've been injecting some sort of painkiller directly into his back, then. Rayfa: Yes, my father said his back pain could knock him off his feet. Phoenix: I know the feeling. I've experienced some pretty severe back pain of my own... Backrest of chair Phoenix: This chair looks like it was modeled after Inga's suit jacket. Edgeworth: Hmm... The backrest even has those fancy buttons of his. I imagine they make the chair awfully uncomfortable to sit on. Rayfa: Actually, they served to massage the pressure points on his back. My father suffered from terrible back pain, you see. Phoenix: ...I wonder if it really works. Notepad Phoenix: This notepad must've belonged to Inga. Let's see... That's strange. Edgeworth: These appear to be notes detailing people's most prominent characteristics. Phoenix: Hey, there's even some stuff about me in here. Why would he bother doing this? Rayfa: Hmm... I am afraid even I can't answer that. Phoenix: (Whatever the reason, it's giving me a case of the heebie-jeebies.) Edgeworth: Hmm... It's as though he was taking down descriptions of people over the phone... That's what it reminds me of, anyway. Rayfa: What a brilliant deduction! One fitting of a chief prosecutor such as yourself. I commend you. Edgeworth: ...Heh, that's high praise coming from you, Your Benevolence. Phoenix: (Edgeworth's right. They do look like dictation notes, but... I don't know... I mean, why bother describing Nayna, who he must've seen every day?) Inga's Notepad added to the Court Record. Notepad (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's the notepad with those descriptions of various people in it. I wonder what Inga was using it for. Move Rayfa: Barbed Head. First you make me wait, and now you're simply going to leave?! Phoenix: (Guess I should stay put for a while.) Talk The kidnapping Rayfa: Barbed Head... I, the Royal Priestess of Khura'in, shall share my thoughts on the abduction. Phoenix: You will? Rayfa: ......Listen carefully, for such opportunities do not come often. Phoenix: Y-Yes, of course. We'd be grateful to hear anything you'd like to share. Rayfa: ...My father was very likely seeking to obtain the Founder's Orb. But it was not for the purposes of a coup d'état. It was all... for my sake! Phoenix: For your sake? Rayfa: The Founder's Orb is capable of bestowing great spiritual power. My father truly believed that. And he wanted that power to be mine. I haven't finished my training, and I still can't channel spirits! He was doing it for me! Phoenix: ......Right, I see. Rayfa: Well? Do you understand why he did it now? Phoenix: ............I do, but... ...it doesn't change the fact that Minister Inga was a kidnapper. Rayfa: Ah! Phoenix: But I guess you don't believe he is, do you? Rayfa: Ooooooh! New information is sure to surface upon further investigation. S-Suffice to say, he did this all for me. End of story! Phoenix: (Was he really trying to obtain the orb for Rayfa? Somehow, I doubt it. Speaking of powers... ...I wonder if Rayfa will be performing the Divination Séance tomorrow. I should probably ask her about that. Nayna Phoenix: Your Benevolence, I noticed Nayna isn't with you today. Rayfa: .........I know not where she has gone. I have not spoken with her since this morning. I assume she must be quite busy today. I did catch a glimpse of her a little after two o'clock. I tried calling out to her... ...but she went off somewhere again. Phoenix: A little after two? That's about an hour before the murder. Rayfa: ...Indeed. Of all the times for this to happen... She normally comes to me the moment I call her name. Phoenix: (I know it's hard to believe, but even nannies have lives, you know...) Edgeworth: Your inability to find her after the murder is slightly alarming. I wonder if her absence is related to today's incidents somehow. Rayfa: Do you think she was unwittingly caught up in them? Phoenix: Who knows... At the very least I don't think she was at the scene of the crime. Rayfa: Nayna... I hope she is all right. Phoenix: (Rayfa seems really worried for Nayna.) Tomorrow's Séance (appears after \"The kidnapping\") Phoenix: I take it you'll be conducting tomorrow's Divination Séance? Rayfa: Who else, if not I? Phoenix: Good point. (The thing is... ...Divination Séances are all about what victims experienced in their final moments. So, tomorrow... ...Rayfa will experience her own father's death, exactly as it happened. That's more than anyone should ever have to deal with.) ...Do you really have to go through with the Séance tomorrow? There's really no one else? What about just calling the whole thing off? Rayfa: ............It's not as if... ...It's not as if I'm doing this because I want to. Phoenix: No? Rayfa: Ah! N-Never mind. I misspoke! The Divination Séance is a very important duty of the royal priestess. And it is one I intend to fulfill. Phoenix: (There's that word: duty.) Maya: ...Your Benevolence. As crown princess, you are destined to rule this kingdom one day. That means there will be many things that you alone must determine. Things like how to keep your people happy, and what is true and what is false... And most importantly, what role you must play therein. Rayfa: .................. I wonder if I am even up to the task. Phoenix: (Performing the Divination Séance IS very important for a priestess... ...but duty or not, it's a heavy burden for someone so young. Even worse, she'll be forced to watch her father's murder. Will it be a weight too heavy for her to bear?) Nayna and Rayfa (appears after \"Nayna\") Phoenix: Your Benevolence, has Nayna served you long? Rayfa: Yes, she has been at my beck and call for as long as I can remember. I have heard she even cared for me as an infant, right down to changing my diapers. Phoenix: Your diapers? It almost sounds like she could be your mother. Rayfa: Indeed. But that is a simple fact of life when your mother is busy being queen. Nayna takes care of my every need. She is my teacher in all things, as well. Phoenix: (Rayfa's pool of knowledge seems rather lopsided in some respects. Could that be the result of Nayna's teachings?) Rayfa: Nayna... Could it be that my trusted attendant has come to dislike me? Now that I think about it, perhaps I've been acting rather spoiled as of late. Phoenix: Oh, I'm sure she'll be back. Rayfa: ...Yes, I suppose Nayna would never truly abandon me. Upon her return, I will do something nice for her. Perhaps she'd like a shoulder massage. Phoenix: (And yet, I can't shake the feeling that Nayna's connected to this case in some way.) Present Attorney's Badge Rayfa: Remove that vile badge from my sight! If you insist on tormenting me, I will take matters into my own hands! Phoenix: Hey, don't bite it! Rayfa: ............ Hmm, it's much harder than I thought. Phoenix: ...What did you think it's made of? Tomb Crime Photo Rayfa: ...! ............ Phoenix: Um, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: .........Father. Phoenix: Whoops, s-sorry! Didn't mean to hurt you like that. Rayfa: Hmph! Do not underestimate me! I am the royal priestess, and as such I will experience my father's death tomorrow. So hand it over! A photo of a corpse... will not... phase... Phoenix: Your Benevolence! Edgeworth: Wright, you fool! Put that picture away! Rayfa: ...Nngh. There is no need to worry. I simply lost my footing, that's all. Phoenix: (Now I'm REALLY worried about tomorrow.) Painkiller Shots Rayfa: My father's back used to cause him considerable pain. I would give him massages from time to time. He seemed to truly enjoy them. Phoenix: Hmm, I didn't peg you as the dutiful daughter type. Rayfa: But never again... will I... Phoenix: Your Benevolence... Um... I could stand in for your father if you'd like-- Rayfa: ............Rrgh! *WHAM* Phoenix: Youch! M-My back! I think you broke something! Rayfa: Hmph. That's what I call the royal treatment. Inga's Notepad Rayfa: These are notes my father took on the characteristics of those around him. I wonder what he wrote about me. Phoenix: Let's see... Pink raiment... Tattoos on face... Ch-Childishly cute?! Rayfa: Huh?! Phoenix: That last one's rather subjective, isn't it... Anything else Phoenix: Your Benevolence, I wanted to ask you about this. Rayfa: Nayna! Nayna! Where are you?! Phoenix: Um, I thought you said she wasn't around... Rayfa: ...Oh, yes, of course......... Well, you're sadly mistaken if you think questioning Nayna will clear things up. Phoenix: (But I'm trying to question you, not Nayna.) After clearing all Talk options and examining shoeprints, hair dye bottle, bust, syringe, and notepad: Phoenix: I'm really beginning to wonder what's inside that safe. Any idea what the combination might be, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: None whatsoever. Phoenix: (It looks like a four-digit combo lock, so maybe it's a date. But it's probably not anything that would be easy to guess.) Well, let's try some dates and see what happens. I wonder what date Inga would use as a combination? Date the DC Act was enacted Phoenix: How about the date the Defense Culpability Act was enacted? Do you know when that was, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: Nayna! Nayna! Edgeworth: Your Benevolence... *whisper, whisper*... Rayfa: Yes, of course... I believe the date would be: June 14! Phoenix: (Really, Edgeworth? Is whispering in the ears of elites the secret to your success?) All right, let's give 0-6-1-4 a try. Nope, that's not it. Time to try something else. Leads back to: \"I wonder what date Inga would use as a combination?\" Parents' anniversary Phoenix: How about your parents' anniversary? Rayfa: Hmm... I have not the faintest idea of when it is. Phoenix: Yeah, I guess you wouldn't, huh. Edgeworth: ...It's December 11. Phoenix: H-How in the world do you know THAT fact, Edgeworth?! Edgeworth: Hmph, I don't. I simply deduced it using elementary school-level logic. Though I doubt you'd grasp how I arrived at my conclusion, so I'll save my breath. Phoenix: (There's no way you didn't use some kind of superpower to come up with that...) Anyway, here goes... 1-2-1-1. ...No good. It won't open. Let's try another number, shall we? Leads back to: \"I wonder what date Inga would use as a combination?\" Rayfa's birthday Leads to: \"When's your birthday, Your Benevolence?\" Phoenix: When's your birthday, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: Hmph, you are wasting your time. It could not possibly be my birthday. Phoenix: Aw, come on. It's worth a shot. Rayfa: ...Fine. It's December 24. Phoenix: Christmas Eve? Well, let's give it a try. 1-2-2-4... Ahhh! ...I-It... It opened! Rayfa: It did?! Phoenix: Yep. And it looks like the bottom safe was a fake. Edgeworth: Something meant to mislead would-be thieves, no doubt. Still, it was rendered quite ineffective by his use of such an easily-guessed combination. Rayfa: Wh-Why, Father...? Why my birthdate...? Examine Open safe Phoenix: Okay, let's see what's in here. Hm? This looks like a letter or something. Let's see... \"Dear Father... I wanted to wish you a happy birthday. You're always so kind, and I love you very much. I hope you live to be a hundred years old! Love, Rayfa.\" ............... Rayfa: I-I wrote this to my father when I was eight years old. F-Father... Why would you hold on to... something so childish and stupid...? Phoenix: .........There are some other papers in here. Hmm... Ah! This... This is the plan for his coup d'état! Rayfa: Wh-What?! Give me that! .........I... I don't understand. Edgeworth: It seems Justice Minister Inga was plotting the assassination of the queen. Rayfa: This... This can't be true. Father would never harm Mother. Phoenix: (Poor Rayfa. This has to come as a terrible shock.) ...What's this? There's a photo in here, too. Hmm... It's of a woman and a baby. I wonder who they are. ...On the far left, there's a law book with the mark of the Defiant Dragons branded on it. Rayfa: .........Wait! Th-Th-That's...! Phoenix: Your Benevolence? Rayfa: ...How... How can this be? *thud* Phoenix: P-Princess Rayfa! Rayfa: ............... Phoenix: (She's looking incredibly pale.) Your Benevolence. Are you all right? Rayfa: .........All right? How can I be all right? Phoenix: Huh? Rayfa: .........All that I have believed... It was all lies. Phoenix: I'm afraid I don't follow. (What the heck's she talking about?) Um... Can I ask who the woman is in this picture? Rayfa: ...H-How should I know?! .........It seems I didn't know ANYTHING that was going on! Phoenix: (...Doesn't look like I'm going to get much more out of her while she's like this.) Woman's Photo added to the Court Record. Rayfa: .........Mother. Phoenix: Huh? Rayfa: I must ask my mother... about the secret she is hiding. Phoenix: Um, what secret...? Rayfa: ...I must go. Goodbye. Phoenix: Wait! ...What was that all about? It's like her mind was off somewhere else. Edgeworth: It appears this photo really upset her. Phoenix: (I wonder who the lady in this picture is.) ???: Stop! Shah'do! Come back here! ???: Ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff! Phoenix: Wait, that sounds like... Ahlbi and Shah'do. Edgeworth: That's odd. Commoners aren't normally allowed in this area. I wonder what's afoot. Any point of interest (after examining open safe) Phoenix: I better not touch anything without Rayfa's permission. Who knows what she might say... or do if she finds out. After examining open safe in Ga'ran Palace - Inga's Private Quarters: May 18Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence Shah'do: Ruff ruff ruff! Edgeworth: Nghoooooooooh! Phoenix: Ahhh! Edgewooooorth! Edgeworth: .........I hope one of you has a good explanation for this. Ahlbi: Ahhhhhh! I'm SO sorry! Phoenix: Hi, Ahlbi... Ahlbi: No, Shah'do! Bad dog! Leave the man's frilly thingamajig alone! Shah'do: Grrrrrrrrr... Edgeworth: If you would kindly detach your dog from my cravat. Ahlbi: R-Right away, sir! Just hold still, and... Edgeworth: And...? Shah'do: Grrrrrr... Ahlbi: Hrrrrrgh! Hrrrrrrrrrrrgh! Edgeworth: Nghoooh! Stop pulling like that! You'll only stretch the fabric! Ahlbi: Come on, Shah'do...! Let go of his... carava-chamacallit! Shah'do: Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! Ahlbi: Hmm... This isn't working. I'll just have to pull harder, then... One, two... Edgeworth: Wait! What are you--?! Ahlbi: THREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! RRRRRRRNNNNNNNNGH! .........Come OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON! Edgeworth: NNNNGHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH! AAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! I NEED AAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRRRRR! *huff... huff... huff...* Were you trying to kill me?! Ahlbi: I'm really sorry, mister. My dog has a habit of attacking frilly things like that. Phoenix: (Maybe for his sake, he should stick to more traditional targets, like cars, or his tail...) Ahlbi: What's worse, he snuck in here again today and stole some weird-looking hat. I don't know what to do anymore. Bad dog! You're a very bad dog! Shah'da: *whine* Phoenix: (Wait a second... I've seen that hat before.) Examine Urns (after clearing \"Ahlbi in the courtyard\" Talk option) Leads to: \"Ahlbi, you wouldn't happen to know how this urn got knocked over, would you?\" Talk The frilly hat Phoenix: Ahlbi, could I see that hat again? Ahlbi: Sure! Phoenix: (Wait... Isn't this... Isn't this Nayna's hat? But I thought she'd disappeared.) Ahlbi: Shah'do swiped it from someone. Phoenix: Um, Ahlbi? How exactly did Shah'do get this? Ahlbi: Allow me to explain! It all started while we were on a walk through the bazaar today. When, suddenly, Datz popped out of a manhole! Datz: Hah! Ahlbi: Whoa! Datz: The fangs of the Defiant Dragons... ...Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaah... ...Datz Are'bal is here! .........Say, you wanna join our cause, kid? Ahlbi: (Misattributed to Datz Are'bal in the original release) Huh? Ahlbi: Naturally, I was super startled by that weirdo's sudden appearance. Warbaa'd: RAWWWWWWRRRRRR! Shah'do: Ruff ruff! Datz: Back! Dog of the Ga'ran regime! Ahlbi: (Misattributed to Datz Are'bal in the original release) Huh? But this is my dog, Shah'do... Datz: Defiant Dragon secret weapon: Dragon Snot Snaps! ACHOOOO! *BANG* Ahlbi: WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOA! Oof! Datz: Har har har har har! Aw man, the look on your face! That was classic! Ahlbi: The sudden bang of the firecracker spooked Shah'do, and he ran off into the crowds. Shah'do: Ruff ruff ruff ruff! Ahlbi: Ahhhhhh! Shah'do, come back here! Datz: Har har har har har! That'll teach ya, Ga'ran's lapdog! Policeman: You there! What do you think you're doing?! Datz: ...Ack! Not good! Ahlbi: That's when a policeman came running over and hauled Datz away. That happened right around 2 PM, if I remember correctly. Phoenix: (...I'm not even going to pretend I know what Datz was trying to do.) Ahlbi: I chased right after Shah'do, and... ...when I finally caught up to him here in the palace courtyard, he had this in his mouth. Edgeworth: 2 PM, hmm? That's about an hour before the minister's death. Phoenix: Nayna supposedly went missing after the murder... ...but this would place her here at the palace at around two. (Changed from [...but this would place her here at the palace at around 2.] in the original release) Ahlbi's Statement added to the Court Record. Ahlbi: Actually! I just remembered I saw something pretty amazing around that time, too! Phoenix: Something amazing? The frilly hat (subsequent times) Phoenix: Ahlbi, could I see that hat again? Ahlbi: Sure! Phoenix: (Wait... Isn't this... Isn't this Nayna's hat? But I thought she'd disappeared.) Ahlbi: Shah'do swiped it from someone. Phoenix: Um, Ahlbi? How exactly did Shah'do get this? Ahlbi: Allow me to explain! It all started while we were on a walk through the bazaar today. When, suddenly, Datz popped out of a manhole! Datz: Hah! Ahlbi: Whoa! Datz: The fangs of the Defiant Dragons... ...Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaah... ...Datz Are'bal is here! .........Say, you wanna join our cause, kid? Ahlbi: (Misattributed to Datz Are'bal in the original release) Huh? Ahlbi: Naturally, I was super startled by that weirdo's sudden appearance. Warbaa'd: RAWWWWWWRRRRRR! Shah'do: Ruff ruff! Datz: Back! Dog of the Ga'ran regime! Ahlbi: (Misattributed to Datz Are'bal in the original release) Huh? But this is my dog, Shah'do... Datz: Defiant Dragon secret weapon: Dragon Snot Snaps! ACHOOOO! *BANG* Ahlbi: WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOA! Oof! Datz: Har har har har har! Aw man, the look on your face! That was classic! Ahlbi: The sudden bang of the firecracker spooked Shah'do, and he ran off into the crowds. Shah'do: Ruff ruff ruff ruff! Ahlbi: Ahhhhhh! Shah'do, come back here! Datz: Har har har har har! That'll teach ya, Ga'ran's lapdog! Policeman: You there! What do you think you're doing?! Datz: ...Ack! Not good! Ahlbi: That's when a policeman came running over and hauled Datz away. That happened right around 2 PM, if I remember correctly. Phoenix: (...I'm not even going to pretend I know what Datz was trying to do.) Ahlbi: I chased right after Shah'do, and... ...when I finally caught up to him here in the palace courtyard, he had this in his mouth. Edgeworth: 2 PM, hmm? That's about an hour before the minister's death. Phoenix: Nayna supposedly went missing after the murder... ...but this would place her here at the palace at around two. (Changed from [...but this would place her here at the palace at around 2.] in the original release) Ahlbi: Actually! I just remembered I saw something pretty amazing around that time, too! Phoenix: Something amazing? Something amazing (appears after \"The frilly hat\") Phoenix: So, Ahlbi, what was it you saw that was so amazing? Ahlbi: I saw Her Eminence Queen Ga'ran channeling a spirit! Phoenix: Is it really that big of a deal to see her channeling someone? Ahlbi: You bet it is! Commoners are never allowed to behold the sacred rite. Phoenix: Oh? Can you tell me more? Ahlbi: Of course! I'm always happy to explain! Um... I believe it was around 2:10 PM today. I got lost on the palace grounds while looking for Shah'do. Ahlbi: Ooh... What is this place? It gives me the creeps. Where could Shah'do have gone? Ahlbi: In my search, I took a peek into a small room and... ...that's when I saw Queen Ga'ran! She was channeling a spirit for a neighboring kingdom's king! I saw her transform right before my eyes! I was so excited, I had to take a picture of it! Phoenix: You... You took a picture? Ahlbi: I know I shouldn't have... ...but I just couldn't help myself! Phoenix: (Between this and the treasure room, Ahlbi's not exactly the picture of self-restraint...) Ahlbi: Her channeling rite ended right after that, so I ran off before anyone could spot me. Phoenix: You could've been arrested again, you know. Ahlbi: ...Yeah, I know... ........................ Anyway, here's a copy of the picture. Just don't tell anyone I was the one who took it. Phoenix: (...I worry about his future sometimes.) Channeling Photo added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Come to think of it... ...how did you and Shah'do get into the royal residence anyway? It's not open to commoners, after all. Ahlbi: Allow me to explain! Something amazing (subsequent times) Phoenix: So, Ahlbi, what was it you saw that was so amazing? Ahlbi: I saw Her Eminence Queen Ga'ran channeling a spirit! Phoenix: Is it really that big of a deal to see her channeling someone? Ahlbi: You bet it is! Commoners are never allowed to behold the sacred rite. Phoenix: Oh? Can you tell me more? Ahlbi: Of course! I'm always happy to explain! Um... I believe it was around 2:10 PM today.

Phoenix: (Between this and the treasure room, Ahlbi's not exactly the picture of self-restraint...) Ahlbi: Her channeling rite ended right after that, so I ran off before anyone could spot me. Phoenix: You could've been arrested again, you know. Ahlbi: ...Yeah, I know... ........................ Anyway, here's a copy of the picture. Just don't tell anyone I was the one who took it. Phoenix: (...I worry about his future sometimes.) Come to think of it... ...how did you and Shah'do get into the royal residence anyway? It's not open to commoners, after all. Ahlbi: Allow me to explain! Ahlbi in the courtyard (appears after \"Something amazing\") Ahlbi: There's a way to get into the palace from the bazaar. It's a bit of a tight squeeze, though. Shah'do can easily fit, but anyone bigger than me is out of luck. Phoenix: You don't say... Ahlbi: Yeah, part of the palace wall is damaged, and there's a hole I can just make it through. Phoenix: Go on. Ahlbi: Heh heh heh. Betcha didn't know they have some really tasty food here! Phoenix: Oh? Then this isn't your first time in here, huh. ...Trespassing is illegal, you know. Ahlbi: N-No, it's not like that! I didn't mean any harm. It's just... I want to help change this kingdom. Phoenix: What do you mean? Ahlbi: Well, after Ms. Fey's trial, I started thinking. Like maybe... Maybe there was something I could do to help the revolution, too. Phoenix: (...Maya's trial, huh. That tragedy only happened because of how twisted Khura'in's legal system has become.) Nahyuta: How utterly foolish to cast away one's life for such a reason! There must have been other ways to cover up the crime! Tahrust: Yet, had I done so, my wife would rush to my defense. And when the case went to trial... ...she would suffer the same fate as I under the Defense Culpability Act. I could not have lived with myself had she been convicted because of that fiendish man! Rayfa: Th-This... This cannot be... All I have done under the laws of our kingdom... It has all been... Phoenix: (The DC Act led to the false charges against Maya and the high priest's suicide. But that trial also caused the public to start questioning the current state of things. And it seems even Ahlbi has some pretty strong feelings on the matter.) Ahlbi: I knew there had to be something I could do to help! That's when I remembered the hole in the palace wall, and started thinking... ...maybe I could sneak in and take a picture of one of the royals up to no good. I just want to do my part! Edgeworth: The spirit of revolution seems to be catching on, even with one so young. Wright, the momentum is steadily building, and the tipping point is fast approaching. It's just a matter of when. Phoenix: I agree. And the public's perception of the Defiant Dragons seems to be changing, too. But Ahlbi... You can't go trespassing like that. Even if it's for a good cause, it's not right. Ahlbi: Okay. I won't do it again. Phoenix: Ahlbi, is that really all you have to confess? You haven't been up to any other mischief? And when I say \"you,\" I mean Shah'do. Ahlbi: Huh?! Oh, um... I-I... I don't know what you're talking about. Aheh... heh heh heh... Phoenix: (Nice try, Ahlbi, but the proof is literally right in front of us.) Present Attorney's Badge Ahlbi: Oh, that's an attorney's badge from your homeland, right?! I've studied all about it. Allow me to explain! There's a reason why the badge is shaped like a sunflower. You know how sunflowers always turn to face the sun -- the source of their well-being? Well, lawyers are like that -- they will chase after anything that will make them money! Phoenix: Whaaat?! Ahlbi: ...I guess people hate lawyers in your country, too, huh. Phoenix: Umm... Where did you get your information from again? Ahlbi: A proud sermon Chief Prosecutor Payne gave in the middle of the bazaar the other day. Phoenix: Nngh... Lawyers already have a bad enough time here without his lies. Channeling Photo Ahlbi: I know I shouldn't have taken that picture... But it was the first time I'd ever seen a spirit medium at work! I couldn't help myself. Phoenix: (At least he knows what he did was wrong.) Ahlbi: .........100-- no, 400 dahmas per copy sounds about right. Phoenix: Ahlbi... You're not planning to sell this photo to tourists, are you? Ahlbi: ...! Ah-ha ha ha! Come on, Mr. Wright, You don't really think I'd do that, do you? Phoenix: (Now I REALLY fear for his future.) Anything else Phoenix: What do you know about this, Ahlbi? Ahlbi: .........S-Sorry. I don't know anything about that. I'm the worst tour guide ever. Phoenix: N-No, no, it's my fault for randomly whipping it out and asking you about it. Ahlbi: Don't worry. I'll study hard, so I'll be ready to answer all your questions next time! Phoenix: (Argh, now I feel like a jerk.) Phoenix: Ahlbi, you wouldn't happen to know how this urn got knocked over, would you? Ahlbi: Ah! Phoenix: Because Her Benevolence told me something rather interesting. Rayfa: Be careful. Some dingbat dog got in the courtyard and spilled water over there. Phoenix: A dingbat dog? Rayfa: That's right. The yappy mutt spilled a whole urn's worth. Phoenix: The \"dingbat dog\" she mentioned wouldn't happen to be Shah'do, would it? Ahlbi: ...Ooh...! ......... I guess the dog's out of the bag. Sorry I lied. But I was worried I'd get in trouble. I know I shouldn't lie to a lawyer like that. Phoenix: No, it's not good to lie to anyone like that. So let's try to only tell the truth. Okay, Ahlbi? Ahlbi: Oh, Mr. Wright! I almost forgot. I saw a couple of Americans a moment ago. They had really weird haircuts, so I thought they might be friends of yours. Phoenix: ...R-Really, now... Um... Edgeworth: It seems your little friend thinks all us Americans have strange hairstyles. I suppose we have you to thank for that, Wright? Phoenix: ......... So, what exactly did their hair look like? Ahlbi: There was a guy with two crops of hair sticking out of his forehead like antennae. Then there was this lady with a long bunch of hair that looked like a big, orange spider leg. Phoenix: Oh, that sounds like Apollo and Athena. What were they doing? Ahlbi: They were racing through the bazaar... ... with the Ga'ran Royal Guard in hot pursuit! Phoenix: Wait, whaaaaaat?! Edgeworth: Why were they being pursued...? Phoenix: I'm not sure, but I have my suspicions. I just hope they're all right. Ahlbi: S-Sorry for not mentioning it before. It just kind of slipped my mind, heh heh... To be continued May 18Khura'in - Bazaar Apollo: *huff, puff, huff, puff* Those... Those guys... sure are... persistent! Athena: *huff, puff, huff, puff* Yeah. They even wore ME out, and that doesn't happen often. Apollo: Why are they after us, anyway?! Athena: Ah, Apollo! It's the royal guards again! Apollo: Argh! Q-Quick, hide! Royal Guard: Hey! Where'd Horn Head and Spidey Hair gooooooo?!! Athena: ...Spidey Hair? They're not talking about me, are they? Apollo: I-Is that a trick question...? Royal Guard: We know you're hiding somewhere around heeeeeeeeeeere!!! RAWWWRRR! Athena: A-Apollo, that weird-looking bird over there... Did it just...?! Apollo: ...Yeah, it did. It's called a warbaa'd and... You know what? I'll tell you all about it later when we're not being chased by masked men! Royal Guard: Come out, come out, wherever you aaaaare!!! ...Hand over the Founder's Orb, if you know what's good for yooooouuuuuu!!! Apollo: (It figures they're after the orb.) Athena: I don't want to know what they'll do to us if we were captured. If they grill us in those obnoxious, loud voices... ...I'd cave after the first hour and confess to whatever they wanted, truth or no! Royal Guard: Come out now, you foreign deeeeevils!!! This has gone faaaaaar enough!!! You must not keep Her Eminence waiting any looooooonger!!! RAWWWRRR! Apollo: W-We've gotta get out of here! There must be a safe place to hide somewhere! Examine Manhole cover Leads to: \"Look, a manhole.\" Any other point of interest Apollo: Maybe we could hide here. Athena: No way! They'd find us in no time! Royal Guard: Stay where you aaaare!!! Athena: Th-They're closing in on us! Apollo: We've gotta find a place to hide! Talk Any ideas? Athena: Apollo! We shouldn't be standing around talking like this! Who knows what they'll do to us if they catch us! Apollo: You're right. Let's find somewhere safe to hide! Present Anything Athena: Apollo! Do you really HAVE to show that to me right this second?! Apollo: S-Sorry. It's just... something I do now when I'm stuck... Anyway, your shouting isn't helping, either. Royal Guard: That voice! It's Spidey Hair!!! Athena: Eeeeek! ...Hiii-yaaaaaa!!! Royal Guard: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!! Apollo: (Sh-She sent him flying!) Athena: L-Let's find somewhere else to hide before the other guards get here! Apollo: Look, a manhole. ...Ahhh! That's right! Dhurke: Say, son, do you remember my office? Apollo: ...Sure. (I remember that messy, dimly lit room.) Dhurke: The file I've amassed on Amara's assassination is kept there. I think it might help you on this case. Do you remember how to get there? Apollo: Athena! I know where we can hide! Follow me! Athena: Oh?! Where are we going?! Apollo: Hrrrrrrrnngh! Athena: W-Wait. You're not seriously thinking about going down there? It smells like rotten eggs. And are those rats I hear?! Apollo: We've got no choice! I can get us somewhere safe, but this is the only way in. Quick, before it's too late! Athena: Ugh. It's going to take forever to get this stench out of my hair. May 18Former Sahdmadhi Law Offices Apollo: .........Looks like we lost them. That was close. .................. (Dhurke's office... How long has it been since I last set foot in here?) At least we're safe now, but... (Why is Athena all huddled over in the corner like that?) Datz: Ah! Apollo: Datz? Datz: AJ! What the heck are ya doing here? Apollo: Ga'ran's royal guards are after us. Datz: Har har har! Once a rebel, always a rebel. Don't worry. The regime doesn't know about this place, so ya can relax now. Apollo: Good. But since when am I part of the rebellion? I don't recall signing up. ???: Apollo! Apollo: Mr. Wright? What are you doing here? Phoenix: We saw you two go into that manhole. Edgeworth: You narrowly escaped the guards' notice. Phoenix: It was like watching a pair of ostriches burying their heads in the sand. Apollo: (I guess that was a closer shave than I had thought...) Phoenix: Anyway, you're safe and sound now, and that's what really counts. Oh, I also have some evidence for you. Apollo: Thanks, Mr. Wright. Case evidence received from the boss. Edgeworth: So, what is this dubious hovel we've found ourselves in, anyway? Apollo: It's the Defiant Dragons' safe house... also known as the former Sahdmadhi Law Offices. Edgeworth: I see... Well. Though it might just be happenstance... ...here I am -- a chief prosecutor -- hiding out in a rebel base. Apollo: Um, please don't report this place to the local police, Prosecutor Edgeworth... (Might as well take a look around while we're waiting for the heat to die down out there.) Come on, Athena. Stop moping over there and help me check this place out. Athena: *shudder* Please tell me there's a shower here. Apollo: There's a sink in the kitchen. And if you're lucky, maybe even some soap. Athena: .........I'm sorry I even asked. Examine Picture of Ga'ran Apollo: There's a scary-looking knife sticking out of the queen's picture. If anyone saw this, they'd think the Defiant Dragons were a violent group. Datz: Oh, that? That was actually me trying to kill a fly. I threw that knife at it and whiffed, and the thing ended up stuck right between her eyes. Apollo: You mean this wasn't on purpose?! White flowers Apollo: Datz, what's with the altar? Datz: It's where we pay our respects to the victims of the Defense Culpability Act. The DC Act is a heinous law that puts innocent people to death! Apollo: (A law that's supposed to protect the people sends them to their graves instead... Talk about insane.) Ladder Athena: Wait... Don't tell me we have to go back through the manhole to get out of here... Apollo: The only reason this safe house is still safe is because the front door's been boarded up. Athena: Fine, then I'll just have to live here till the revolution begins! Apollo: ...What if I told you rats come out at night? Athena; Then we'll just have to start the revolution before sundown! Apollo: (I bet the revolution never thought it'd get a new ally this way.) Photos Athena: Hm? Who's the kid... Wait a second! That's YOU, Apollo! I'd recognize those horns anywhere! Apollo: Is that really the only way ANYBODY recognizes me?! Athena: Hee hee hee. You were so cute! ...And who's THAT fine-looking young man? Apollo: That's Nahyuta, back when he used to smile. Athena: ...Wow. His smile is absolutely angelic. Datz: Sure brings back memories! That was taken the day we all went out fishing. Athena: What was Prosecutor Sahdmadhi like when he was younger? Datz: He was kinda quiet, but passionate when it came to his convictions. When he finally made prosecutor, he was all fired up to change Khura'in for the better. But now he's nothing more than Ga'ran's lackey! Apollo: (Seems like Datz has a lot to say about Nahyuta. I'll ask him about his thoughts later. Photos (subsequent times) Apollo: These pictures sure bring back memories. Nahyuta is cheerfully smiling in this one. That quiet smile he gives in court now seems almost fake by comparison. Lizards Athena: Eeewww... Is that a newt? Apollo: Come on, Athena. Can't you tell a gecko when you see one? Athena: What's the difference? Apollo: Geckos like to live in houses, while newts prefer to be outside near water. They're totally different creatures. Athena: Well, how do you know this one wasn't caught outside near some water? It could very well be a gecko. Apollo: No, I'm pretty sure it's a newt. Athena: Oh, so then you agree it's a newt, Apollo? Apollo: Ack! (I fell right into her trap!) Phoenix: You're both wrong. It's just a plain old lizard. TV Apollo: I'm surprised to see so many appliances here. There's even a TV. Datz: Speaking of which, we gave the people of Khura'in quite a shock... ...when \"The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm\" was last on TV. Apollo: You mean that show where actors play the parts of Dhurke and Rayfa? You hijacked that in the middle of its broadcast, right? Datz: Yep. All their writers do each week is try to ruin the Defiant Dragons' good name. So we decided to hit 'em where it hurts! Har har har har har har! Apollo: That must've been real shocking, especially for the kids who'd waited all week to see it. I mean, the show's main villain was actually hijacking the very show he's in! Coat Athena: Dhurke's jacket... You should try it on, Apollo. It might actually suit you. Apollo: R-Really? Datz: There's also a spare eye patch here. Why not try that on, too? Athena: ...Pffft. ...*snicker* Hee hee hee! S-Sorry, sorry. Just picturing you in all that... Ha ha ha ha! It's just too funny! Apollo: (Oww... My pride...) Sign Apollo: Sahdmadhi Law Offices... That's the sign Dhurke used to display out front. Hey, Datz. I heard the office used [sic]do quite a bit of business. Datz: That it did. Dhurke was a famous lawyer with countless courtroom victories, after all. He was the Dauntless Dragon who turned trials upside down... ...snatching victory from the jaws of defeat! His fame as a lawyer spread far and wide across Khura'in back in the day. Apollo: ...I hope the day comes when he can proudly display this sign again. Spider Apollo: What's with all the spider webs, Datz? Don't you ever clean the place? Datz: Not the webs! We have what ya call a symbiotic relationship. They catch the bugs that get in here, and I don't clean 'em up! Apollo: You know... that actually makes a lot of sense. Law book Apollo: This is Dhurke's old law book. Athena: Look, there's a mark on the cover. It looks like it was branded with a hot iron. Apollo: Yeah, I think it was done in protest against the Defense Culpability Act. There's an entry on the DC Act right here. See? Athena: Oh, so this is the infamous anti-lawyer law you guys are always talking about... Dhurke's Law Book added to the Court Record. Law book (subsequent times) Apollo: This is Dhurke's old law book. Athena: Look, there's a mark on the cover. It looks like it was branded with a hot iron. Apollo: Yeah, I think it was done in protest against the Defense Culpability Act. There's an entry on the DC Act right here. See? Athena: Oh, so this is the infamous anti-lawyer law you guys are always talking about... File Athena: I wonder what's in this file. Oh, it's full of newspaper clippings. Apollo: It seems to be a collection of documents and information on Amara's assassination. (So this is what Dhurke was talking about.) Athena: We already know most of the stuff here on top. Let's see what else there is. Wow, where did he get all this? Umm... Anything important here...? Hmm, what about this... \"Apollo's roving musician father got caught up in this incident and lost his life.\" ...Whaaat?! Th-This is about your father, Apollo! Apollo: Looks like it. But I was never told much more than what's written here. Athena: Really? How come? Apollo: Dhurke always skated around the subject. Maybe he thought I was still too young. Plus, I always thought of Dhurke as my dad, so I never really brought it up. Athena: ...Oh, I see. Still... I feel kind of sorry for your real dad. Apollo: (My real dad... I was never really interested in learning about him. But after seeing his picture, I can't help but feel a little curious. I wonder if Datz could tell me anything about him.) Amara's Assassination File added to the Court Record. Athena: ...Apollo, this file looks like it might be useful. But there are so many pages, I can't tell what's important. Apollo: We need someone to help organize all of this. (And I think I know just the person to ask.) File (subsequent times) Apollo: This file has a ton of information on Amara's assassination. We should go over the important parts later. Talk Sahdmadhi Law Offices Apollo: So, Datz, you guys are still using this office, I see. Datz: Yep. 'Cept now it's the official HQ of the Defiant Dragons. But as Dhurke said, and I quote... \"We must keep it for the day when Khura'in needs lawyers once more.\" Phoenix: Restoring the legal system to its rightful form through popular uprising... You can tell how much Dhurke believes in his cause. Datz: Oh, and AJ. Dhurke said something else that might interest ya. He said he hopes you'll come back and take over this office someday. Apollo: T-Take over?! Me? Datz: Those were his words. He may've been half joking though. Datz: Dhurke! Guess what I heard from PW! AJ's become a lawyer! Dhurke: ...Yeah, I've been meaning to tell you. Datz: Must've been because of you, Dhurke! Dhurke: I'm not so sure about that. I imagine he's already forgotten about me. Datz: Whaddaya talking about? I bet he can't wait to follow in your footsteps. Dhurke: Hah, ha ha ha. Nothing would make me happier. Maybe one day he'll return to Khura'in and take over this office. ...Heh. It's just a pipe dream, though. Apollo: .........Dhurke really said that? Datz: Dhurke was never a hands-on kinda dad... ...but not a day went by that he wasn't thinking of ya. That much I'm sure of. Athena: Doesn't get more paternal than that. Apollo: (Dhurke... And to think, I really did spend my days trying to forget you. I'm looking forward to a nice, long talk once you're free.) Nahyuta (appears after examining photos) Apollo: Datz, wasn't Nahyuta once part of the Defiant Dragons? Datz: Yep. Yuty was a rising star in the resistance! He vowed to fight for the cause through the legal system. Said he'd become a prosecutor, and give Inga and Ga'ran the smackdown they deserved! Apollo: But now he's... Datz: Yeah... a puppet of the Ga'ran regime. Not only that, but now he's gonna prosecute his own dad. It doesn't add up! Athena: I wonder what happened to him. Datz: Me, too. But if I had to guess... ...I'd say Ga'ran has some serious leverage over him. Apollo: Leverage? Like what? Datz: Wish I knew. But it seems like Dhurke knows. I tried to press him about it, but he wouldn't say. Apollo: (Come to think of it, Dhurke did say...) Apollo: Nahyuta... is suffering...? Dhurke: Yes. He knows the rightful state of Khura'in's legal system... ...but something forces him to bend to Ga'ran's will, and it's tearing him apart. Apollo: (If that's the case... ...I bet Nahyuta doesn't really want to go through with Dhurke's prosecution.) My father (appears after presenting Photo of My Father) Apollo: Do you know what my biological father was like? Datz: Dhurke once told me about him. He was a modern minstrel, walking the world and making music in his travels. Athena: This file also has some information on your real dad. It says he died in the blaze at Queen Amara's residence twenty-three years ago. Datz: That's right. Dhurke had invited him over. Dhurke's the kinda guy who can become fast friends with just about anyone. And it seems your pops was like that, too, AJ. They hit it off at a bar... ...and the next thing ya know, Dhurke's asked him over to play some tunes. Apollo: And then the place went up in flames... Datz: Yeah. Dhurke had just stepped out for a sec when the fire broke out. .........Apollo. You were there, too, but you were still just a baby. Apollo: ...I remember hearing about that when I was little. Datz: Yeah, it was a crying shame. Your pops just happened to take you along that day. So you were there with him when the fire broke out. But Dhurke risked his life to save you! Apollo: (It's like Dhurke's done nothing but save me all my life...) Datz: All your pops's stuff got burned up. Including anything that could've helped us identify him. All we knew about him at first was his stage name, \"Jangly Justice\" or something like that. Dhurke did everything he could just to dig up what little we know now. Apollo: ...Um, what about my mother? Do you know anything about her? Datz: All we know is she was traveling with your pops. But that day, she was off doing something on her own. Apollo: So then, she probably didn't even know my father had been with Dhurke, huh. Athena: But she must've been desperate to find you and your father once you'd gone missing. Datz: No doubt. But the queen's assassination threw the kingdom into chaos. The police were so overwhelmed, they were probably hardly of any help to her. We searched and searched till our legs gave out, too, but we never found her. And with your father's stuff all burned up, we had zero leads -- not even a photo. Apollo: So that's how I became an orphan... Datz: Yeah... Who knows? Maybe your mom read about the details of the fire in the newspaper. And maybe she figured you'd died along with your pops. Athena: Wow, I had no idea you'd been through all that, Apollo. Present Photo of My Father Apollo: Datz, I wanted to ask you about this picture. Datz: That's the picture of your pops that Dhurke found. And he had a heck of a time tracking it down. He said he searched all over for it! Apollo: Why...? Why would he go through all that trouble? Athena: Datz, please tell us everything you know about Apollo's dad! Dhurke's Law Book Datz: The Mark of the Dragon... That's the symbol of our group, the Defiant Dragons. Apollo: Dhurke has the same mark tattooed on the palm of his hand, right? Datz: Yep. And I've got one, too. Apollo: Really? Where? Datz: On my heart! Apollo: ...Oh, you mean metaphorically. Like you're ready to die at any time for the cause or something like that? Datz: You got that right. Dead or alive, I'll always be a Defiant Dragon! Amara's Assassination File Apollo: Datz, about this file... Can you help me figure out whihc pages are the most relevant? Datz: Yup, sure can. I got the whole thing memorized. See this page? It's definitely worth a look. Athena: Oh, that's right! Prosecutor Sahdmadhi was part of the royal family, wasn't he! Datz: Yep. But he was expelled after that whole thing with Dhurke happened. He must've gone through hell once he entered the legal world though. Apollo: Because of the whole \"the sins of the father are visited upon his children\" thing? Datz: Yep. In the eyes of the people, Dhurke is not only a traitor to his kingdom... ...he's also the terrorist who assassinated the previous queen. So, as his son, Yuty no doubt got the cold shoulder at every turn. Apollo: That must've been really hard on him. Datz: Yeah, the ties between father and son aren't something you could break, even if you tried. No matter where he went, he was probably labeled the son of a criminal. But despite it all, he made a name for himself through blood, sweat, and tears. I mean, just look at him now. He's a star prosecutor working cases around the globe. He's become a hero! The pride and joy of Khura'in! Apollo: (Now that's the Nahyuta I know -- super smart and never willing to give in. He must've studied and fought like his life depended on it to get to where he is today.) Amaras Assassination File updated in the Court Record. Anything else Datz: Ahhhhhh! Apollo: What? Do you know something about this? Datz: Nope. Just felt like shouting is all. Apollo: (He had me going there for a sec...) After clearing all Talk options, examining law book, and presenting Amara's Assassination File: Old Man: So then you believe me? You believe in my son's innocence?! Beh'leeb: Your poor son -- imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit... Let's petition the government for his release and a declaration of innocence! Old Man: Oh, thank you, thank you! I'm forever in your debt! Apollo: Hm? Who's that? Datz: Hey there, Mrs. Inmee. Hard at work, I see. Beh'leeb: Yes, I have my own battle that I must wage. After all, there are many who suffer under the Defense Culpability Act. Rebel: Mrs. Inmee! Please don't forget about our case, too! Beh'leeb: I won't! I will look into it as soon as I am able. Phoenix: Um, Datz? What's Mrs. Inmee doing here? Datz: She's lending an ear to all those suffering under the regime's wrongful accusations. A lady whose husband's been imprisoned, parents whose son's been falsely charged... She's helping all those types of people. Phoenix: So she's trying to help the revolution along... ...in her own special way. Datz: Yep. And thanks to her, more and more folks are coming over to our side! All the people who've been unhappy with the regime have been waiting for just this chance! And they're starting to speak out in support of us! Apollo: (The people are responding... and a grassroots movement is growing... Dhurke's dream of revolution may finally come true.) Athena: What should we do about the Founder's Orb? We'll probably run into the royal guards again the moment we leave this place. Phoenix: Well, we can't stay here forever, so we'll have to think of something. Apollo: ...I've got it. Why don't you hold on to it, Datz? It should be safe here, right? Datz: You can count on me! I'll get it back to you in time for tomorrow's trial at the Hall of Justice. Founder's Orb left with Datz. Athena: What now, Apollo? Apollo: Well, we've got a handle on what happened twenty-three years ago. Maybe we should pay Dhurke a visit. There's something I want to show him. Phoenix: I'll join you. I want to talk to him before tomorrow's trial. Edgeworth: Maybe I should wait here, then. We'll attract undue attention if we go in too large of a group. Bazaar Examine Yak Apollo: It's a yak. They used to serve as a beast of burden here. Athena: They're actually kind of cute up-close. Hello there, big fella! Or are you a girl...? Apollo: Umm, if you stick your face that close to it, it's liable to-- *sluuuuurp* Athena: Eeewwww, gross! .................. Apollo: ...Need some tissues? Athena: I-I could use a handful of wet naps, if you've got 'em... Bird Athena: What's this bird doing here? Apollo: I wouldn't get too close to it if I were you. ???: RAWWWWWWRRRRRR! Athena: Eeeeeeeeek! Apollo: ...Athena, meet the warbaa'd. Its cry resembles a lion's roar to scare off predators. Athena: Wow... that's one gutsy little bird. But I bet it's not really all that tough. Apollo: How about we just leave the bird alone? Cart Apollo: (So many street stalls... And they all have stuff you can't find back home.) Athena: We should spend some time shopping here when this case is over. I'd like to buy Trucy a souvenir or something. Poster Apollo: There's a poster here... \"The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm\"...? Phoenix: It's a special-effects-driven action-here show that's become a huge hit here in Khura'in. Apollo: (Maybe it's a cultural thing, but she totally looks like a villain to me.) Steaming buns Phoenix: Khura'in's national delicacy, magatah'man -- or \"soul buns,\" if that makes it easier. Apparently, they're so delicious, they'll send your soul straight to the Twilight Realm. Apollo: \"Delicious\"? More like \"deadly.\" Phoenix: Actually, in one of the commercials, an old man literally drops dead after taking a bite. And at the very end, there's a warning that goes, \"Enjoy at your own risk.\" Apollo: Like I said: deadly. Manhole cover Apollo: (This is the manhole that leads to Dhurke's office-turned-safe house. It's the only way in or out. And for obvious reasons, there's no doorbell or welcome mat.) Souvenir stands Apollo: (The souvenir stands sure are popular with the tourists. I should check them out later.) Tehm'pul Temple Apollo: Tehm'pul Temple is just up ahead. When I was a kid, I used to race Nahyuta and my friends to the top. Present Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Athena: The victim was the Minister of Justice, the second most powerful person here in Khura'in. In Wright Anything Agency terms... ...I guess that would be you, Apollo. Apollo: Ha ha ha. Thanks, but... ...everyone knows it's Trucy. Athena: ...Yeah, you're probably right. On second thought, she might actually be number one. I mean, even Mr. Wright is no match for her. Apollo: .........Remind me not to forget to buy her a souvenir. Dhurke's Law Book Athena: I can't believe Dhurke's been fighting the good fight for over twenty years. Fighting for the truth and the repeal of the Defense Culpability Act... Apollo: Yeah. And being branded a traitor for it. That's got to be extremely hard on him. Athena: Whatever happens, we can't let them find him guilty! We have to help him achieve his life's dream! Anything else Athena: .........What? Are you just going to show that to me without a word? Apollo: (I guess she doesn't have anything to say about it.) Athena: W-Well?! Are you going to at least say SOMETHING?! Inga's Private Quarters Examine Phoenix: Edgeworth and I already searched this room. Apollo: Oh, okay. (I wonder if anything interesting turned up?) Hair dye bottle Athena: \"Je suis L'Belle! SAMPLE\"... Now THERE'S a brand I know well... Apollo: .........Yeah... Me, too. Athena: Let's see what it says on the back. \"The hair care sensation celebrities have been RAVING about! Guaranteed to make you WANT to proclaim, 'Je suis L'Belle!' to the world! This product is NOT FOR SALE. EVER. Even if you come to really like it, PEASANT.\" Apollo: I REALLY still don't get his sales strategy... Any other point of interest Phoenix: We already investigated that, Apollo. May 18Detention Center - Visitor's Room Dhurke: Hey there, son. Came to see your old man again? Apollo: Hi, Dhurke. Guess they're done questioning you? Dhurke: Yeah... You'd think Nahyuta might've cut his old man a little slack, but no. He really laid into me. Seems they're really keen on recovering the Founder's Orb. When I wouldn't tell them where it was, he confiscated what few possessions I had left. Apollo: (...Wait, Dhurke's not wearing his attorney's badge. They even took THAT from him? *sigh*) Talk Nahyuta Dhurke: He confiscated all my prized jailbreaking tools. Apollo: What did you expect? I mean, no prosecutor in their right mind would let a prisoner keep stuff like that. Athena: Did he take your attorney's badge, too? Dhurke: No. I thought it strange, but... ...just when it looked like he was going to take it from me, he changed his mind. Apollo: I wonder why. Dhurke: Indeed. I find it hard to understand anything he does these days. Your attorney's badge (appears after \"Nahyuta\") Apollo: Your Khura'inese attorney's badge... You've worn it all these years -- even though all the lawyers are gone. Dhurke: Yes, because the Dragon's Eye is the embodiment of my creed. Apollo: (To show the world that \"a dragon never yields,\" huh.) Apollo: Hey, Dhurke? Why do you still wear your badge? You're not a lawyer anymore, right? Dhurke: This badge is my heart and soul, son. I'll never stop trying to realize my dream -- not until my very last breath. Nahyuta: \"A dragon never yields,\" right?! Dhurke: Exactly. ...Nahyuta, Apollo, I vow to restore Khura'in's legal system to its rightful state one day. I want to pass on to you a world where you can live free from the fear of tyranny. Apollo: (He was always saying stuff like that to the two of us. Nahyuta... Is the reason why you didn't take Dhurke's badge... ...because you still remember those talks, too? I really hope that's what it is.) Dhurke: ...Son, would you keep my badge for me? Apollo: Are you sure?! I can't take something so important to you. Dhurke: That's exactly why I want you to hold on to it, Apollo. I'm placing my fate in your hands. Apollo: .........All right. I'll make sure it stays safe. Dhurke's Badge added to the Court Record. Your attorney's badge (subsequent times) Apollo: Your Khura'inese attorney's badge... You've worn it all these years -- even though all the lawyers are gone. Dhurke: Yes, because the Dragon's Eye is the embodiment of my creed. Apollo: (To show the world that \"a dragon never yields,\" huh.) Apollo: Hey, Dhurke? Why do you still wear your badge? You're not a lawyer anymore, right? Dhurke: This badge is my heart and soul, son. I'll never stop trying to realize my dream -- not until my very last breath. Nahyuta: \"A dragon never yields,\" right?! Dhurke: Exactly. ...Nahyuta, Apollo, I vow to restore Khura'in's legal system to its rightful state one day. I want to pass on to you a world where you can live free from the fear of tyranny. Apollo: (He was always saying stuff like that to the two of us. Nahyuta... Is the reason why you didn't take Dhurke's badge... ...because you still remember those talks, too? I really hope that's what it is.) Present Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Dhurke: Inga Karkhuul Khura'in... He was an entirely insufferable, unlikable fellow, but I never thought he'd wind up dead. Apollo: Why didn't you like him? Dhurke: He was the most hawkish one in the Ga'ran regime. He established the secret police to arrest us rebels without due process. Those they managed to capture were immediately executed. My compatriots in the Defiant Dragons came to call him \"The Executioner.\" Apollo: \"The Executioner\"? Pretty ironic, considering how he ended up. Dhurke: He's probably in Hell now, being tormented by those he wrongfully put to death. Pink Butterfly Pendant Apollo: I found this in the tomb. Look familiar? Dhurke: ...Ah! Th-That's... Apollo: Dhurke? Dhurke: Where did you find it? Apollo: Down between the monk statues in the tomb. Is it yours, Dhurke? Dhurke: .........Oh, um, it's... it's something I bought. Apollo: ? (Why's he suddenly acting all awkward?) Dhurke: Hmm... I wonder when I lost it. Let's have it. It's very important to me. Apollo: O-Of course... (I'll just make a note about it for future reference.) Pink Butterfly Pendant returned to Dhurke, but a record of it remains in the Court Record. Dhurke's Law Book Dhurke: Careful with that. Don't go showing it around town. You'll be branded a rebel. Apollo: But I'm not a rebel. Dhurke: Don't be ridiculous. You're a member of the Defiant Dragons simply by being my son. Or did you think that dragon tattoo on your rear end was just for show? Athena: Whaaat?! You have a tattoo on your butt, Apollo?! Let me see! Apollo: Relax, Athena. He's just jerking our chains again. Amara's Assassination File Dhurke: I prepared that myself. Use it well. Apollo: I'm surprised you were able to gather this much information. Dhurke: It wasn't easy. After all, all of the evidence from the assassination was lost in the fire. And the newly-installed Ga'ran regime was in full control of the media. Every lead I tried to follow led to a dead end. Apollo: So then how am I supposed to solve this case? Dhurke: ...You'll figure something out once tomorrow's trial is underway. After all, no one's looked into this assassination since my last trial. Apolo: (I hope I can turn things around enough to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.) Dhurke's Badge Dhurke: Ah, my attorney's badge. You don't see those around here anymore. Apollo: It's not exactly something you can wear publicly, is it? Dhurke: Yeah... And if you did, people would jeer and throw things at you. I've had tomatoes, cabbages -- even eggs thrown at me. Apollo: That sounds awful. But at least they didn't throw rocks. Dhurke: ...True. Plus, if you were good at catching things, you'd have the start of a good meal. Apollo: What?! Dhurke: It's true. An hour's walk can yield all you need for a nice, big hot pot! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (Dhurke... I'm sorry I never knew how bad things were when you were raising us.) Anything else Dhurke: Is that for me, son? Apollo: No, I was just wondering if you knew anything about it. Dhurke: What? You came to visit me and you didn't even bring a present? Apollo: (I'll take that as a \"no.\") After clearing \"Your attorney's badge\" Talk option and presenting Pink Butterfly Pendant: Phoenix: Apollo, remember how Inga said he had \"someone dear to Dhurke\"? Why don't you ask about that? Apollo: Oh, right. I'll give it a try. Talk Someone dear to Dhurke Apollo: What did the minister mean when he said... ...he had someone dear to you in the palm of his hand? Who was he talking about? Dhurke: Hm? Apollo: Nahyuta seemed to know, but he wouldn't tell me anything. Dhurke: W-Well, I've no idea, so... Phoenix: Well, you obediently followed his every word after he said that... ...so it seems to me the minister was in close proximity to someone you really care about. Dhurke: Oh, um... Apollo: Someone you really care about that isn't Nahyuta...? Wait, don't tell me--! Is there a new lady in your life, Dhurke?! Dhurke: Wh-What?! No! Don't be ridiculous, son! Apollo: .................. Dhurke: .................. The love of my life was Amara. But she's gone now and there will never be another. BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: (Ah! My bracelet! Wait, does this mean...? Dhurke... Have you REALLY not met somebody new?) Present Bracelet Dhurke: The love of my life was Amara. But she's gone now and there will never be another. Perceive twitching left forearm on \"But she's gone now\" Apollo: Apollo: ...Dhurke. You can't fool me. You tensed up when you said, \"But she's gone now.\" And you unconsciously moved your arm... ...causing something to press up against your jacket. Dhurke: Ahhhhh! ...H-How did you do that?! Apollo: ...Oh, so that's it! You're hiding a woman's photo up your sleeve. You don't have to keep secrets like that from me, Dhurke. You're an eligible bachelor now. But you'll... introduce her to me at some point, right? Dhurke: I keep telling you, there's no other woman! Apollo: Fine, then let's see it. What are you hiding up your sleeve? Dhurke: ...It's just this. Satisfied? Apollo: Huh? But that's the pendant we found in Amara's Tomb... Dhurke: See? I wasn't trying to hide anything. Apollo: (...Then why did he tense up?) Dhurke, let me take a look at that. Dhurke: Ah! Apollo: .........Hey, what's this button for? *click* Apollo: Whoa! I-It's...! Athena: It's a picture of Dhurke and some lady! And she's really young-looking, too! Mon Dieu! Are you into younger women, Dhurke?! Apollo: Heh heh. Dhurke, you old dog, you. You got yourself a younger lover. Dhurke: Will you stop with this nonsense! This is Amara before she died. If you look closer, you'll see that I was younger, too. Apollo: Hey, you're right. Athena: Aww. That's no fun. Apollo: ...Wait a second. Haven't we seen this woman before? Athena: .........Now that you mention it...! Apollo: Isn't this woman the same as the one in the pendant's photo? Present Woman's Photo Apollo: Leads to: \"The woman in the pendant is also the one in this photo.\" Present anything else Apollo: Athena: Apollo... I don't see how that has anything to do with the woman in the pendant's photo. Dhurke: Have you had your eyes checked lately, son? Apollo: (I'm wrong, not blind! Maybe I should compare the pendant's photo against the evidence again.) Dhurke, I know I've seen the woman in the pendant's photo before. Leads back to: Isn't this woman the same as the one in the pendant's photo? Apollo: The woman in the pendant is also the one in this photo. Dhurke: ! A-Apollo, where did you get this? Apollo: From the safe in Inga's room. Phoenix: ...Apollo. If this is Queen Amara, it had to have been taken at least twenty-three years ago. But that's just not possible. Dhurke: ! Apollo: Yeah, I just noticed the same thing. Here's why this photo couldn't be twenty-three years old! Present law book Apollo: Leads to: \"Take a look at the law book. It has the mark of the Defiant Dragons branded on it.\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Dhurke: I don't see how that proves anything. Apollo: Look closer. Doesn't that part look, you know, kinda modern? Athena: Hmm... I don't know about that. Maybe you just don't know what's considered new and hip these days, Apollo. Apollo: Nngh... Dhurke: This photo is at least twenty-three years old. I don't know how you could say otherwise. Apollo: That's where you're wrong, Dhurke. (There's something in this photo that couldn't have existed back then.) Leads back to: \"Here's why this photo couldn't be twenty-three years old!\" Apollo: Take a look at the law book. It has the mark of the Defiant Dragons branded on it. But that mark didn't exist until after you started your revolutionary activities, Dhurke. So, this photo must've been taken AFTER Ga'ran came into power. ...And that didn't happen until AFTER Amara was assassinated. Dhurke: Gnrk! Apollo: ...So then, how could Amara even be in this photo? ...............Wait a second. That would mean that Amara is... ...still alive? Dhurke: Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh! ............Looks like you found me out, son. Apollo: Wait... So it's actually true?! Leads back to Talk options Perceive wrong area Apollo: Apollo: You seem uneasy, Dhurke. Wait... Don't tell me you're ashamed because she's much younger than you?! Dhurke: D-Don't be ridiculous! I'm just getting tense because of your intrusive questions! Anyone would react the same way! Apollo: (Hmm, I guess that's not it... Still, my bracelet reacted... ...so I know he must be hiding something!) Leads back to Talk options Someone dear to Dhurke (after perceiving) Apollo: Dhurke! What do you mean, Amara's still alive?! I thought she'd been assassinated. Dhurke: .........So did I. But it seems she made it out alive, only to be held captive by the Ga'ran regime. Apollo: Why would they do that? Dhurke: When I fled from the law and went underground twenty-three years ago... ...I heard some shocking news from a Defiant Dragons spy. There were rumors of Queen Amara being sighted in the palace. Apollo: And those rumors turned out to be true? Dhurke: Yes. I snuck into the palace to see for myself. She was confined within the grounds, but otherwise, she was as fit as a fiddle. Phoenix: S-So then, the sarcophagus in the tomb... It's empty? Dhurke: Yes. That entire tomb is one big charade. Ga'ran had it built to stage Amara's death. Athena: So we're not going to be cursed by her vengeful spirit? That's a relief. Dhurke: She was being held under virtual house arrest. So I freed her, and we made a run for it. This photo was taken back then. Apollo: (Look at how they're both grinning from ear to ear.) .........Hm? (There's a fingerprint on the metal part. I guess Dhurke must've left it by accident.) Athena: Ooh, Mr. Sahdmadhi! I wanna hear ALL about how you ran away with Queen Amara! Pink Butterfly Pendant updated in the Court Record. On the run with Amara (appears after \"Someone dear to Dhurke\") Apollo: I'm surprised Amara agreed to run away with you. I mean, Ga'ran must've told her that you tried to kill her. Dhurke: I tried to convince her that I wasn't the one who set the blaze. Apollo: And she believed you? Dhurke: She said, and I quote, \"I shall accompany you so I may ascertain the truth myself.\" Heh, she always was a tough one to read. Athena: I bet she was thrilled you came to her rescue, Mr. Sahdmadhi. To be set free by your beloved... It's like something out of a fairy tale. Dhurke: Yeah, well... There was no \"happily ever after\" once Ga'ran's people caught up with us. They took Amara away to who-knows-where. I snuck back into the palace and searched high and low for her, but to no avail. They probably moved her to some remote mountain prison or the like. Apollo: Dhurke, does Nahyuta know about this? Dhurke: He knows she's his true mother. I told him as much. Apollo: Wait... Is that why Nahyuta is following Ga'ran's orders? Dhurke: .........Most likely. Athena: So then, do you think that deep down, he doesn't really want to prosecute you? Dhurke: Well, he's not one to show his feelings. And lately, I've had no idea what he's thinking. Phoenix: Apollo. We need to grill the queen about Amara when we have the chance. Athena: ...Um. I was wondering about something. The little baby the lady's holding... Is that Prosecutor Sahdmadhi? Apollo: Not necessarily. It could just as well be me. After all, we're only one year apart. Athena: I don't know. I mean, the kid in the picture is too cute to be you. Apollo: (...Let's settle this by asking Dhurke himself.) Something important (appears after \"On the run with Amara\", then presenting Woman's Photo) Apollo: So what's this \"something important\" you have to tell me? Dhurke: ........................ Listen son. Even if you manage to prove me innocent tomorrow... ............... ...I... I don't have long to live. Apollo: Huh? ............... Wh-What are you talking about? Dhurke: What I mean is, I can already hear the Twilight Realm calling my name. There is no escaping death now that it has its sights set on me. Apollo: What?! ............I-Is this another one of your jokes? Dhurke: I wish it was. Apollo: Ha... Ha ha ha. You can't fool me, Dhurke. (Hm? That's strange. Why isn't my bracelet reacting?) Dhurke: ............ Phoenix: ...Are you sick? Dhurke: I-It's something like that. Apollo: So you're not joking? Dhurke: .........I'm afraid not, son. Sorry. Apollo: I-Isn't there a cure? Or at least some sort of treatment? Dhurke: Unfortunately not. Not for what I've got. Apollo: If you need some kind of surgery, I'll work hard until I can pay for it! So... Please...! Dhurke: .........It's too late. There's nothing more to be done now. Apollo: B-But you always say, \"A dragon never yields.\" So why are you giving up now? Dhurke: ...Apollo, I'm sorry. I really am. Apollo: ............I don't understand. Why is this happening, Dhurke? Why? Dhurke: ..................Listen, Apollo. I've got a favor to ask of you. Would you keep quiet about this? I don't want my fellow Dragons to find out. They'd lose all hope if they knew I was dying. Would you do that for me? Apollo: ............Of course. (Why is this happening now? Just when I was finally starting to feel like you really are my... I thought that this time, we'd finally... But now...) ...Damn it... Why...? Athena: Apollo... Dhurke: Listen, son. I don't have much longer to live... ...but I'll never let them execute me. Not before I finish what I need to do. Apollo: ...I know, Dhurke. There's no way I'm going to let them prove you guilty. (Before he goes, I'm going to turn back time by righting the wrongs that have been done. I'm going to restore Dhurke's freedom... ...and return a real smile to Nahyuta's face! I'm going to win this case. I just have to!) Dhurke: ...Son. I have one more... big secret. Apollo: What? There's something else you've been hiding from me? Dhurke: I'm afraid I can't tell you what it is. I'd be betraying a certain someone if I did. Apollo: Huh? What's that supposed to mean? Dhurke: .........Forgive me. You'll just have to find out for yourself. That's the only way. Apollo: I don't understand, Dhurke. Dhurke: ..................... Apollo. In court tomorrow... ...you may find yourself faced with a truth that is difficult to accept. But I know you. And I know you can handle the truth, no matter what it turns out to be. I know that because I believe in you. You're my son, after all! Apollo: ...Dhurke. (What is he talking about? Wait... He's not going to reveal that he actually IS the killer, is he?) Phoenix: Looks like we've run out of things to discuss. Apollo? ...Are you okay? Apollo: ...I'm fine. ???: FREE HIM NOW...!!! RELEASE DHURKE...!!! Apollo: What's going on out there? Dhurke: Sounds like the party's getting started without me. Apollo: Huh? Athena: It's coming from the temple. Let's go, Apollo, and take a look! Something important (subsequent times) Apollo: So what's this \"something important\" you have to tell me? Dhurke: ........................ Listen son. Even if you manage to prove me innocent tomorrow... ............... ...I... I don't have long to live. Apollo: Huh? ............... Wh-What are you talking about? Dhurke: What I mean is, I can already hear the Twilight Realm calling my name. There is no escaping death now that it has its sights set on me.

Present Pink Butterfly Pendant or Woman's Photo (after clearing \"Someone dear to Dhurke\" Talk option) Dhurke: Amara... I hope she's doing well. Apollo: I've been wondering, Dhurke... How could a commoner win the heart of a queen anyway? Dhurke: ...Hm? Wait, don't tell me... Have you fallen for Princess Rayfa, son? Apollo: Wait, what?! Athena: ...Apollo. I had no idea you liked your women so young. Apollo: No! I don't! Phoenix: She's barely in her teens. That's just not right, Apollo. Apollo: Listen to me! I never said anything about her! Dhurke: Aww, it's all right son. In a few more years, the age difference won't matter so much. Apollo: Would you guys just stop already?! Woman's Photo (after clearing \"On the run with Amara\" Talk option) Apollo: Dhurke, about the cute little kid in this photo... Is that me? Dhurke: ...Huh? What are you talking about? Apollo: .................. Athena: See? I told you it was Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. Dhurke: Hm? .........Oh, I see. Well, either way, it's not you, son. Apollo: So then... ...if it's Nahyuta, it was taken when he was about a year old, right? And that would mean... ...you ran away with Amara around twenty-two or twenty-three years ago? (Changed from [...you ran away with Amara around 22 or 23 years ago?] in the original release) Dhurke: Hm? .........You're pretty good with numbers, son! Impressive. Apollo: Huh? (What kind of answer is that?) Woman's Photo updated in the Court Record. Dhurke: .........Before you go, son, there is something else I need to tell you. Something important. Apollo: What is it, Dhurke? I've never seen you act so serious before. After clearing \"Something important\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: May 18Tehm'pul Temple Apollo: Wh-Whoa! What IS all this?! Anime cutscene Datz: Ow-ow-oww! Let go, will ya?! Policeman: W-What are they-- Datz: Huh? Well, look at that! The people are coming to take their courts back! Policeman: Don't hold back, men! Arrest them all! Rebel: Dhurke belongs to the people! Give him back! Rebel: Yeaaaaah! Where are you holding him?! Policeman: Quiet down, you! Child: Th-They have my big sister, too! But she didn't do anything wrong! Policeman: Ouch! YOUCH! Stop pulling my hair! Old Man: Release my son! Release him now...!!! Policeman: Aaaagh! Stop that! No biting! Apollo: This... is really something. Phoenix: And it looks like Datz and Mrs. Inmee are leading the charge. ???: ...You unenlightened fools. Do you honestly think this will change anything? Datz: Yuty! ...Why do you keep serving that witch Ga'ran?! Apollo: Ah! (It's...) Hey, Nahyuta! Nahyuta: ! You again? Apollo: What's going on here? Nahyuta: It would appear that the insurgents are fanning the flames of the rebellion. ...But I never thought it would grow so large. However, they will all be under arrest shortly. Reinforcements are almost here. Apollo: They'll be arrested? Just for protesting? Nahyuta: They are aiding and abetting a criminal by seeking his release. Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran, has ordered they be arrested and judged en masse. Apollo: B-But weren't you once a member of the Defiant Dragons, too? How can you go along with this? Nahyuta: ...I am simply following the orders that Her Eminence has handed down. Apollo: No, it can't be as simple as that. Listen, Nahyuta. There's something I want to talk to you about. Hey! You're not getting away this time! We need to talk. Nahyuta: .........*sigh* I see there is no reasoning with you. Very well, then. Speak. Examine Protesters Athena: Look at all these people! They've got the whole temple surrounded. Phoenix: And it looks like Datz is fanning the flames. The police are going to really have their hands full with this many protesters. Apollo: This whole thing is like a powder keg waiting to go off. We should keep our distance for now. Talk Dhurke Apollo: Nahyuta, do you really have to serve as prosecutor on Dhurke's case? I mean, prosecuting your own flesh and blood... It's just not right. Nahyuta: Again with this drivel? Your ethical standards are not the be-all, end-all of the world around you. Apollo: (I'm not getting into another debate with him.) .........Nahyuta, did you know that Dhurke is sick? Nahyuta: What? Apollo: He apparently doesn't have that much longer to live. If found guilty, he probably wouldn't even make it until his execution day. Nahyuta: What are you talking about? Apollo: Knowing this, are you still prepared to send an already dying man to his grave? Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: Well? Nahyuta: ...I... Apollo: Enough with the zen monk act, Nahyuta. Tell me how you really feel. Nahyuta: .........Mr. Justice. Each person is born with a role to fulfill. And I... must fulfill mine. Apollo; Well, I'm not convinced that taking Dhurke to trial is a part of your lot in life. Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: As for why you've been at Ga'ran's every beck and call... ...I think I might have the answer. Amara (appears after \"Dhurke\") Leads to: \"Nahyuta. You know the truth about your mother, don't you?\" Present Dhurke's Law Book Nahyuta: That's... Apollo: The rebels' \"Mark of the Dragon.\" It symbolizes a person's opposition to the Defense Culpability Act. Nahyuta: You seek to argue with me about the legal system? ...If so, you're wasting your breath. Lawyers and prosecutors do not lay down the law; they merely follow it. The laws decreed by our sovereign are absolute. There is no room for debate. Apollo: So \"let it go, and move on,\" right? Why is that your only answer to everything? Apollo: Nahyuta. You know the truth about your mother, don't you? About how the former queen is still alive and being held somewhere. Nahyuta: So Dhurke told you, did he... Yes, it's true. My mother was spirited away to some remote corner of this kingdom... ...to keep her safe from harm. Apollo: Safe from harm? But Dhurke said the Ga'ran regime is holding her captive. Nahyuta: No, they are keeping her safe. Apollo: So you don't know where Amara is being held? Nahyuta: I only know that it is some secluded hideaway where visitors are not allowed. I have heard she leads a simple life, akin to that of monastic disciples. Apollo: (Sure sounds like she's being held captive to me.) Listen, Nahyuta... Aren't you really doing the queen's bidding... ...because she's holding Amara captive? Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: And this whole thing with Dhurke... You know he didn't really kill Inga, don't you? Nahyuta: .................. Apollo: Dhurke doesn't have much longer to live, so I want to help him however I can. This time, it's our turn... Apollo: *sniffle* *hiccup* *hiccup* Nahyuta: You... You could've been killed... But you risked your life... to save us... Why...? Dhurke: What a silly question. What father wouldn't risk his life to save his own children? Nahyuta, Apollo... Don't you ever hesitate to call when you need me. Understand? Apollo: It's our turn to help Dhurke however we can. Nahyuta: .................. .................. .........What you speak of... is futile. Apollo: ! Nahyuta: .........Let it go, and move on. The guilty verdict... The hopelessness... You must resign yourself to it all. Clinging to false hope now will only serve to magnify your future despair. So let it go... and move on... Apollo: ...Nahyuta. (Are you really going to just roll over on this?) Nahyuta: ...I've no more time for idle chatter. I must prepare for tomorrow's trial. Now, if you'll excuse me... Apollo: ......... Athena: Apollo. I sensed a whirlpool of emotions coming from within Prosecutor Sahdmadhi just now. Anger, shock, bewilderment... ...and an icy sorrow, as deep and dark as an abyss. Apollo: Yeah, I picked up on that, too. Looks like Dhurke really won't be the only one who will need my help tomorrow. Phoenix: ...I think it's about time to pay Queen Ga'ran another visit... ...and ask her about her sister Amara. Talk Any ideas? Athena: I didn't know Dhurke was sick. What's wrong with him? I mean, he looked fine to me. Apollo: ...I really don't know. The Dhurke I remember would go out hunting in the middle of winter... ...while everyone around him was dropping like flies with the flu and whatnot. Athena: ............... Apollo: .................. Phoenix: ........................ Apollo: .........Come on everyone, cheer up! The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles, right? Phoenix: ...Apollo, you don't have to put on a brave face for-- Apollo: No! I'm fine! Besides, Dhurke will have his day in court. I won't let this get me down. What to do Athena: So you don't know Queen Amara at all, Apollo? I thought that since you used to live with Dhurke, that maybe you had met her. Apollo: Dhurke escaped with Amara twenty-three or so years ago, so I was still just an infant. Even if I had met her, I wouldn't have remembered it. Athena: I guess not. But that means you may have been cared for by a queen. And if you had been, then... Apollo: Th-Then what? Athena: You would've turned out... I don't know... better? Apollo: Wh-What's that supposed to mean? May 18Ga'ran Palace - Audience Chamber Phoenix: Hm? The royal guard isn't around. ???: That is utter... utter... hooey! You cannot continue to deceive the people like that! ???: ...Rayfa. Justice is much more than simply speaking the truth. Apollo: Is that Princess Rayfa and Queen Ga'ran over there? Rayfa: Y-You deceived me, too, Mother! How can I ever believe a word you say again?! You... You... nincompoop! .........Ah. Phoenix: Your Benevolence... ...I, uh, couldn't help but overhear... Rayfa: Nnnnnnnnnnnngh... You impudent--!! *ka-tonk!* Phoenix: Oww!!! Apollo: Are you okay, Mr. Wright? I can't believe she actually punched you... Phoenix: ...Yeah, I'm used to it by now. Athena: What's the matter with the princess? Apollo: It sounded like she was arguing with her mother. Phoenix: .........Maybe it has something to do with this picture. Rayfa said she had to ask her mother about some secret or another as soon as she saw it. Apollo: So then... ...does that mean that Princess Rayfa knows what really happened? That Amara wasn't assassinated, and is still very much alive? Phoenix: It would seem so. And she doesn't seem to be taking Ga'ran's lies very well. But that's no surprise, considering how much Rayfa reveres her mother. Athena: That would definitely cause her a great deal of anguish and sadness. ???: Eavesdropping, are we? How very rude. Ga'ran: Hm? You there. Are you not Dhurke's son? Apollo: Oh, um, nice to meet you, Your Eminence. We're actually here to speak with you, if you could spare a moment. Examine Throne Apollo: ............ Phoenix: Apollo? What are you doing? This is the queen's audience chamber. You can't snoop around in here. Apollo: Oh, right. Sorry! (I wonder what it'd be like to sit there with Athena and Mr. Wright groveling at my feet... No! Stop! I can't let myself think about that sort of thing!) Talk Amara's alive? Apollo: Your Eminence, Dhurke told me about Amara. About how she's still alive, that is. Ga'ran: ...We know not of what you speak. Apollo: After Dhurke learned Amara was still alive, he rescued her, and they ran off together. But she was captured and remains captive in a secret location to this day. As for Nahyuta doing your bidding, it's only because Amara's life's in your hands. Ga'ran: Ho ho ho. What an active imagination you have. Royal Guard: Ha ha ha ha ha ha! A lawyer AND a comedian! How droll! Apollo: (Wh-Whoa. Where'd THEY come from? Anyway! If she's going to play dumb, I'll just have to jog her memory with some evidence!) Amara's alive? (subsequent times) Apollo: Your Eminence, Dhurke told me about Amara. About how she's still alive, that is. Ga'ran: ...We know not of what you speak. Apollo: After Dhurke learned Amara was still alive, he rescued her, and they ran off together. But she was captured and remains captive in a secret location to this day. As for Nahyuta doing your bidding, it's only because Amara's life's in your hands. Ga'ran: Ho ho ho. What an active imagination you have. Royal Guard: Ha ha ha ha ha ha! A lawyer AND a comedian! How droll! Apollo: (Argh! If she's going to play dumb, I'll just have to jog her memory with some evidence!) Amara's alive! (appears after \"Amara's alive?\", then presenting Woman's Photo) Apollo: So then, you admit that Amara's still alive? Ga'ran: .........Yes. She is under our protection in a safe location. Apollo: (I think you mean \"being held prisoner.\") ...And where is she being kept? Ga'ran: Ho ho ho. Now why would we tell the son of a traitor that? Apollo: (Guess she has a point there.) Ga'ran: Now, heed our warning, Horned Devil. It would not be wise to inform the people that Amara yet lives. It would only serve to plunge public order into chaos. Apollo: I have no intention of doing that. (Besides, there are real terrorists out there who might try to kill her.) Ga'ran: ...Good. Now, there was something we have been meaning to ask you. Do you know what has become of the Founder's Orb? The Founder's Orb (appears after \"Amara's alive!\") Leads to: \"The Founder's Orb went missing after Dhurke took it into the tomb.\" Present Attorney's Badge Ga'ran: What have we here? Apollo: It's the attorney's badge used by lawyers like me back home. Ga'ran: Well, in this country, lawyers are a loathsome breed. And we would advise you not to needlessly advertise your place among their ranks. For even now, the bad karma Dhurke has engendered brings woe to your kind. It is a simple matter of cause and effect. Apollo: (Yeah, an effect you caused by enacting the Defense Culpability Act.) Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Ga'ran: His own ill will was visited upon him. So it is within the cycle of karma. Others might call it divine retribution -- the punishment of the gods. Apollo: You don't seem particularly sad, even though it was your own husband. Ga'ran: We were betrayed by the man we had called husband. Moreover, we are the Grand Priestess, summoner of spirits from the Twilight Realm. For us, death is not the end, for we can still speak with those who have passed. Apollo: (I guess being a spirit-channeling queen gives you a different take on life and death.) Woman's Photo (after clearing \"Amara's alive?\" Talk option) Apollo: Your Eminence, I ask that you take a look at this photo. Ga'ran: Why, that's--! Apollo: It's a photo of Amara. And here you can see a law book bearing the mark of the Defiant Dragons. I believe you know what that means. Ga'ran: .................. ..........Very well. Royal guard, stand down. Royal Guard: Yes, Your Eminence! Your wish is our command! Ga'ran: It seems there is no need to perpetuate this charade any longer. We shall speak... of all we know. Dhurke's Law Book Ga'ran: To burn such a mark upon a sacred text of the law... He will surely be visited by what he has wrought. And to think he once called himself a man of the law. Apollo: I think it's just his way of objecting to the DC Act. Ga'ran: Yet that act is but an objection to his falsified evidence. How appalling that even now he recognizes no responsibility and knows no shame. Anything else Apollo: So, I was wondering if... Ga'ran: We have no intention of bestowing any information upon you or any other lawyer. Apollo: (Guess someone doesn't like to play nice with others.) Ga'ran: The Founder's Orb went missing after Dhurke took it into the tomb. As his son, we thought you might know something of its current whereabouts. Apollo: I knew it. I suppose I should thank you for that free running tour of Khura'in. Ga'ran: ...That was the royal guards' own doing. Apollo: (Nice try, lady. But now you're definitely not getting the orb, ever.) Why do you want the orb so badly, anyway? Ga'ran: Because... it would be most dangerous in the wrong hands. It must be recovered. Phoenix: Is the legend true? Can the orb really impart spiritual power? Are you worried that someone could overthrow you with it? Ga'ran: The Holy Mother's power is without equal. Should Her Holiness once again return to our world... ...she could conceivably bestow great power upon the one who unlocked the orb's secret. Phoenix: I guess it makes sense, considering spirit channeling is a fact of life here. Ga'ran: ...So we ask you, Horned Devil. Did you receive the Founder's Orb from Dhurke? Apollo: ...Does it look like I did? Ga'ran: ...So you like to play games, do you? ...Royal guard! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Eminence! Ga'ran: Search this devil, and his belongings! Apollo: What? Royal Guard: At once, Your Eminence! Don't move!!! You're only making this haaaaaarder on yourseeelf!!! Apollo: Yikes! Hey, cut it out! Argh! What the--?! Athena: Eeeeeek! Apollo! Don't strip here! Royal Guard: Stop resisting!!! Just submit to our strip search alreeeeeady!!! Apollo: N-No, wait! Hey! Cut it out! Aaaaaaaaaaaaagh! .................. (Rest in pieces, my poor, tattered dignity.) Royal Guard: There's no sign of the Founder's Orb, Your Eminence! Ga'ran: .........So, you have hidden it somewhere. Heh. No matter. We shall recover it one way or another once you are found guilty of abetting the accused. Apollo: (Dhurke was right. She really is bent on getting the orb.) ???: Mother! Apollo: Looks like the princess is back. Rayfa: I took a stroll to try to calm myself, but... I still find this situation unacceptable. The people must be informed about Queen Amara! Apollo: ! (So she DOES know about that!) Ga'ran: Rayfa, you do not yet possess a clear grasp of how a government and its people interact. There will always be secrets that must be kept from the ignorant masses. Rayfa: You have little faith in our people, Mother. But it is the Royal Priestess's duty to always speak the truth. And as such I cannot remain silent! I will not! Ga'ran: Hah. The truth, you say? Your mind has been poisoned by the Barbed One. Phoenix: It was an honor and a pleasure, Your Eminence. Ga'ran: ...We must speak with our child. It is a mother's duty to discipline her child, after all. Now, if you would excuse us. Apollo: (Discipline? Coming from her, I don't like the sound of that at all...) Phoenix: Well, Apollo, let's head back to the safe house for now. Apollo: Good idea. We need to go over what we've found and collect our thoughts. May 18Former Sahdmadhi Law Offices Edgeworth: ...Ah, you're back. Athena: Thank you for holding down the fort, Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth. Sorry it took so long. Hope you weren't too bored. Edgeworth: ...I watched \"The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm\" while you were gone. And my verdict is... it's an outrage! Especially its theme song. Even worse, the people here believe it's an original, Khura'inese show. Can you believe it! I've already spoke about it at length with Mr. Are'bal here, and he... Apollo: (I'm not sure what he's babbling about, but at least it seems he wasn't bored.) Phoenix: Moving along to things that actually matter... We've gathered about all the information and evidence we can concerning this case. I think it's time we go over everything we've learned so far. Examine Any point of interest Phoenix: ...Apollo. We probably shouldn't search the place while Datz is gone. Besides, we need to go over the case for tomorrow. Athena: What's with you recently? It's like you want to spend every free minute we have snooping. Apollo: (But don't you get the urge to look at everything you can sometimes, too?) Talk About Inga's murder Phoenix: The orb trial... Maya's abduction... And the murder of the mastermind behind it all, Justice Minister Inga... It's a lot to consider. Think you have all the facts straight in your head? Apollo: Yep, I've got it covered, Mr. Wright. It's the truth about what really went down that's going to be the problem. Athena: Yeah, it's like the more we learn about this case, the less we understand. Phoenix: I agree. There's a deep darkness enveloping this case. I'm almost afraid of what we will find once we lift that black veil. Suffice to say, the real killer is certainly waiting underneath. Apollo: (The real killer, huh... Now that's the million dollar question.) Phoenix: Who killed Inga, and why? Think, Apollo. Who would you say had a motive to commit this crime? Apollo: Umm... Athena: I, for one, am drawing a complete blank. Phoenix: I want to know how the killer slipped into the tomb, killed Inga, and slipped back out... ...without ever being seen. That's a bona fide locked-room mystery right there. Apollo: Well, we've collected plenty of evidence and statements. I just hope the rest comes out in court. It'll be a thinner tightrope than usual, that's for sure. Amara's assassination Phoenix: This case has one big fly in the ointment. In order to prove Dhurke completely innocent... ...we'll also have to exonerate him of the crime committed twenty-three years ago. Apollo: Amara's supposed assassination... Athena: Right. We know Amara's still alive... ...but Dhurke could still be charged with plotting to kill her. Apollo: He couldn't discover the truth -- even after over two decades of investigating. So our biggest hurdle is going to be the complete lack of evidence. The fire made sure of that. Athena: Mr. Wright, have you ever won a case without any evidence? Phoenix: No, that's one thing I've never done before. Apollo: A trial unprecedented even in the decorated annals of the Wright Anything Agency... (Still, I can't help but wonder... Was there really no evidence left behind?) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: You flash that badge like a pro now. And with such confidence, too. I can really feel it. Apollo: R-Really? Phoenix: ...Sure. Take Trucy's case, or that civil trial yesterday. You really came into your own during both of them. Apollo: Eheh... Heh heh heh. (I can feel my cheeks betraying me...) Athena: You'd better not be thinking of starting your own firm, Apollo. Apollo: What? No, of course not. (I'm probably not ready for that, anyway.) Pink Butterfly Pendant, Woman's Photo, or Amara's Assassination File Phoenix: Amara... She's still alive. Apollo: But she's basically being held prisoner somewhere. Phoenix: This puts Dhurke at a distinct disadvantage. ...Not to mention us, too. Apollo: And Nahyuta is under Ga'ran's thumb because of all this as well. Phoenix: Yep. It's a problem all right, and it's not like we can just go and rescue Amara. There must be something we can do... Athena: We'll just have to pin our hopes on Dhurke's revolution! Apollo: So, basically, the fates of Amara and Nahyuta... ...depend entirely on our ability to beat the charges against Dhruke tomorrow. Dhurke's Law Book or Dhurke's Badge Phoenix: What would you do if the Defense Culpability Act was established back home? Apollo: What would I do? That's a good question. Athena: What are you worried about, Apollo? You'd always have a job as Trucy's assistant. Apollo: Uh-huh... And what about you, Athena? Couldn't you become a therapist? Athena: Hmm... I don't know if I could do it for a living... Phoenix: I'd probably go back to playing piano. Apollo: ..................... Athena: ............... Phoenix: Hey! What are those looks for?! Anything else Phoenix: Just because you don't know something, doesn't mean that I do, Apollo. That's an important lesson for you to learn. Apollo: (In other words, this didn't ring any bells.) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ...Oh, and we can't forget about the Defense Culpability Act. \"...those who would support criminals will be deemed just as guilty.\" In short, if Dhurke is found guilty, and is sentenced to death... ...we'll likely join him in a very public execution. Apollo: Y-Yeah... Athena: Beat the charges or die... What kind of crazy, upside-down legal system is this, anyway?! Phoenix: ...Don't worry. I can't ask someone as young as you to risk your life, Athena. So tomorrow, it'll just be me and Apollo on the courtroom floor. But you can support us by watching from the gallery. Athena: What?! No... I wanna help! I'm part of the agency, too, after all! Phoenix: ...Sorry, but this is a direct order from your boss. Plus, there's Prosecutor Blackquill to think of. He said he'd use me for sword practice if I put you in harm's way. Athena: Nrrgh... Simon... Well, at least promise me this, you two. Promise me you'll make it back alive! Apollo: Ha... Ha ha... Make it back alive... huh... Phoenix: What's with that face, Apollo? You'll never inspire confidence in your client like that. And it'll play right into the prosecution's hands. Remember, \"the worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles.\" Apollo: You're right! Even when it seems hopeless, or when there's not a shred of evidence to be found... ... we can never let it show on our faces... right? (But will I actually be able to do that tomorrow? When push comes to shove, will I be able to force my biggest smile?) To be continued Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Apollo Justice) Apollo: Nothing particularly interesting here. Area already examined (while playing as Apollo Justice) Apollo: We've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Phoenix Wright) Phoenix: Nothing particularly interesting here. Area already examined (while playing as Phoenix Wright) Phoenix: I've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around. Nothing to examine during investigation (during chapter \"Apollo's Narrow Escape\", while visiting Bazaar) Apollo: We've gotta find a place to hide!\n-- Dhurke Explains Himself --Dhurke: I was struck by a sudden dizziness the moment I entered the tomb.Press Apollo: Apollo: You were struck by a sudden dizziness? (Was it because of his illness?) Is that something that has ever happened to you before? Dhurke: Can't say that it has. Maybe age is catching up with me. I'm no spring chicken, after all! Apollo: (That's not the issue here.) Ga'ran: Hmph. A most cunning excuse. One befitting an insidious insurgent. Dhurke: Oh? Ga'ran: A killer who does not recall his crime... How very convenient. Next, I imagine you will plead insanity. You aim to seek a lesser sentence through excuses and subterfuge, do you not? Dhurke: Dhurke: Don't make me laugh, Your Malevolence. Ga'ran: How dare you! Dhurke: I'm merely stating my innocence. I've no intention of offering excuses. It's your baseless speculation I would decry as foolish... ...you deceitful witch. Ga'ran: .........Is it your wish that I should claim your head right now, in this very hall? Dhurke: Well, that would certainly speed things along, hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: Apollo: Um, Dhurke? Why don't you let me handle it from here? And if there's anything you need to say, you can say it through me, okay? (Anything to stop you from needling the queen.) Ga'ran: Hmph. Next time you have an objection, you'd better have some proof to go with it, Dhurke. Judge: The accused will continue with what he DOES recall of the crime.Dhurke: The next thing I knew, I was standing there with a bloody knife in my hand.Press Apollo: Apollo: Hmm... Do you recall anyone putting the knife in your hand, Dhurke? Dhurke: Wish I could say I did, but I don't remember a thing from before I came to. You think there might have been a third party in the tomb, son? Apollo: Yeah, because if you didn't do it, then the real killer must've been there with you. Ga'ran: Ga'ran: ..................  Royal Guard: You called, Your Eminence?! Apollo: (Does she go anywhere without those goons?) Ga'ran: Was there a third party in the tomb when you were securing it? Royal Guard: No, Your Eminence. We searched hiiiiigh and low, but found no one of the sooooooort! Ga'ran: ...And there you have it. Phoenix: Oh, right. They did search the place. Ga'ran: Furthermore... ...my guards had the entire tomb surrounded, so there was no way for anyone to escape. Royal Guard: That's right! No one got in or out without our knowledge! Her Eminence's on-site directives were absolutely flaaawless! Ur dihara Ga'ran! Apollo: ...Argh. Ga'ran: Do you see now? The presence of a third party is beyond the realm of possibility. The tomb was, for all intents and purposes... ...completely sealed off from the rest of the world. Gallery: What a waste of time.How can it be any more obvious? Dhurke must be the killer. Apollo: (Thanks for nothing, gallery guy. As if our graves weren't already deep enough.) Ga'ran: Accused. What do you believe about the possible presence of a third party? Dhurke: Hmm... Well, based on the situation you presented... ...I'd say the chances are slim to none. Apollo: ......... (You didn't have to agree with her, Dhurke...) Ga'ran: Heh heh heh. Let the accused's statement be added to his testimony. Judge: Very well. Mr. Sahdmadhi, if you would... Apollo: It's like, the more we press, the thinner our case gets. Phoenix: Well, let's keep pressing, and maybe we'll work out the wrinkles in it, too. Adds statement \"The possibility of a third party being there in the tomb is probably nonexistent.\" if not already addedDhurke: The possibility of a third party being there in the tomb is probably nonexistent.Press Apollo: Apollo: We can't prove you innocent without at least the possibility that a third party was there. Dhurke: Find the possible in the impossible, son. That's just what a lawyer's got to do sometimes. Isn't that right... Wright? Phoenix: Who, me? ...Yeah, you could say that. I've seen more than my fair share of trials like that... They'd start with no viable evidence, useful testimony, or any hope of winning... But through cold sweat, desperation and a little luck, I always managed to pull them off. Dhurke: ...Wright. I can see we are kindred spirits, you and I! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: Jeez, taking cases like that must shave years off your life. Phoenix: Ha ha ha. If that were true, I'd be long dead. Apollo: (Find the possible in the impossible? Can I prove that it was at least possible that there was a third party there?) Dhurke, what did you see at the scene of the crime? Dhurke: Let's see, I came to...Present Mysterious Bloodstain Apollo: Leads to: \"Your Eminence, I'm afraid this trial will not go exactly as you anticipated.\"Dhurke: And lying right in front of me was Inga, dead as a doornail.Press Apollo: Apollo: YOu stated that he was as dead as a doornail. How can you be so sure? Dhurke: It's pretty easy to spot the difference between a soulless man and the soulless shell of a man. His complexion and the amount of blood at the scene made it obvious which it was. Ga'ran: Hmph. Watch your words, or you shall join Minister Inga much sooner than expected. You can bow your head before him and seek his forgiveness there in the Twilight Realm. ...If you still have a head to bow, that is. Dhurke: You bloodthirsty spider. What happened to you? There was still a little love in your heart twenty-three years ago. You even used to think of me as a brother. Ga'ran: ........It seems you truly do have a death wish. Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Is that really all you've got? Apollo: Dhurke, I'm begging you... Enough of the lip -- just deliver your testimony. Please. Dhurke: All right, all right. I'll try, but I can't promise anything.Dhurke: I've no recollection of what happened in the interim.Press Apollo: Apollo: A day's passed since the murder. Haven't you remembered anything in that time? Dhurke: My memory is a complete blank. It's as if that part of my brain has been scooped right out. Ga'ran: How very convenient. But even if you've no memory of the event, your guilt is without question. There is nothing more to debate. Dhurke: You're forgetting one thing, Ga'ran. I have no motive. Ga'ran: You lead a band of insurgents that seeks to overthrow the government. I would say that alone is motive enough to slay our kingdom's minister of justice. Dhurke: Dhurke: I've declared countless times that I lead a bloodless revolution. I forbid violence and murder, even if some younger members may have a thirst for blood. Apollo: (A bloodless revolution... He wouldn't really have a motive, in that case. Is that an important statement?) Yes, it is Apollo: That was an important statement. I'd like my client to add it to his testimony. Judge: Very well, then. The accused will please do as the defense has requested. Adds statement \"I don't have a motive for killing Inga. After all, me and my ilk seek a bloodless revolution.\" No, it isn't (No, it's not all that important.) Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after adding statement \"I don't have a motive for killing Inga. After all, me and my ilk seek a bloodless revolution.\") Apollo: Apollo: A day's passed since the murder. Haven't you remembered anything in that time? Dhurke: My memory is a complete blank. It's as if that part of my brain has been scooped right out. Ga'ran: How very convenient. But even if you've no memory of the event, your guilt is without question. There is nothing more to debate. Dhurke: You're forgetting one thing, Ga'ran. I have no motive. Ga'ran: You lead a band of insurgents that seeks to overthrow the government. I would say that alone is motive enough to slay our kingdom's minister of justice. Dhurke: Dhurke: I've declared countless times that I lead a bloodless revolution. I forbid violence and murder, even if some younger members may have a thirst for blood. Apollo: (A bloodless revolution... He wouldn't really have a motive, in that case.)Dhurke: I don't have a motive for killing Inga. After all, me and my ilk seek a bloodless revolution.Press Apollo: Apollo: A bloodless revolution? Could you be more specific? Dhurke: I'm talking about dragging this pompous prosecutor here off her bloody throne. So go ahead, Ga'ran, act all high and mighty now, because it's the last chance you'll get. Ga'ran: You still speak of rebellion despite the charges against you? You truly are a fool. I will prove your guilt soon enough, and display your head for all of Khura'in to see. People will forever speak of you -- not as a revolutionary, but as the terrorist you are.  Dhurke: You're mistaken, Your Maleficence. It will be YOU the people will speak of... ...as the tyrant who was overthrown by her own people. Ga'ran: .........I wonder if you will still be spewing such nonsense before the headsman's axe? Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! I'm afraid I'll still be like this in the afterlife, despot! Apollo: (I know that self-restraint is as foreign as apple pie to Dhurke, but... ...I'd really rather go home than to the Twilight Realm after this.)Dhurke: But I didn't kill him. At least, I don't think I did. It'd go against everything I believe in.Press Apollo: Apollo: Can you state that you didn't kill him more definitively? Dhurke: How can I, when I have no memory of what happened? Apollo: Well, can you at least state whether or not you are a murderer? Dhurke: That, I can do. I am not a murderer. And I would never kill anyone, no matter the circumstances. Ga'ran: Ga'ran: And do you have any evidence to support your claim that you did not kill the minister? Dhurke: Evidence? No. Can't say I do... Ga'ran: In that case, you will strike the statement \"I didn't kill him\" from your testimony. Apollo: Wait. You can't just discard testimony like that. I mean... I'm the one cross-examining the defendant and all... Ga'ran: Hold your prattling tongue, foreign devil! I am the queen of this kingdom. And the queen IS the law. As such, I need not follow the laws that are in place. I can make and break them at will!  Judge: Henceforth, the accused will refrain from stating \"I didn't kill him.\" Apollo: Whaaaaaat?! Dhurke: Sure. Whatever. It's \"The Ga'ran Show,\" after all. Same as always. Changes statement from \"But I didn't kill him. At least, I don't think I did. It'd go against everything I believe in.\" to \"Though, I guess there's no evidence that proves I didn't kill him either...\"Dhurke: Though, I guess there's no evidence that proves I didn't kill him either...Press Apollo: Apollo: Dhurke, leave the evidence-finding to me. Now please, will you stop agreeing with everything the prosecution says? Dhurke: All right. I'll stick to the facts from now on. But remember, son, if you truly believe in me, you should be able to prove my innocence. I know you can do it. Apollo: (He believes I'll prove him innocent. Even with all these inconvenient truths? Is that what he's saying?) Phoenix: I think Dhurke might be on to something. Even the most disadvantageous facts may point the way to the truth. So don't ignore them. Think of them as food for thought. Apollo: Don't worry, I know. (The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles. I need to remember that, no matter how difficult the facts may be to deal with.)Before adding any statement Apollo: His testimony didn't exactly explain anything, did it? Phoenix: Nope. In fact, he basically just testified to the effect of he CAN'T explain himself. But that's undoubtedly what Ga'ran wanted. Apollo: Just great... Phoenix: Apollo. We need to turn Dhurke's non-explanation into an explanation about something. Fast.After adding statement \"The possibility of a third party being there in the tomb is probably nonexistent.\" Phoenix: If only we could establish the possibility of a third party... Apollo: But does the possibility itself even exist? Phoenix: We don't have a choice. Proving it exists is the only way to start a real dialogue here.After adding statement \"I don't have a motive for killing Inga. After all, me and my ilk seek a bloodless revolution.\" Phoenix: Dhurke says he has no motive... but what do you think, Apollo? Apollo: Well... I, for one, am glad he doesn't, because it would just make matters worse. Phoenix: True.Apollo: Your Eminence, I'm afraid this trial will not go exactly as you anticipated. Because I can show how there might have been a third party in that tomb!Ga'ran: ...Oh, how very fascinating. Go on; I do so love a good fairy tale.Apollo: We did a luminol test at the crime scene. And we found a bloodstain that didn't match the justice minister's blood. I will remind you that neither Dhurke nor Ms. Fey were injured during the incident. The thing is, this bloodstain we found had been wiped up by someone.Judge: What's this?! B-But... Who would've done such a thing?Apollo: That's the big question, isn't it? Who wiped up the blood, and why? Thinking about it logically... It must be someone who wanted to conceal their presence at the scene of the crime.Ga'ran: Oh? And to whom do you suppose the bloodstain might belong?Apollo: The bloodstain belongs to...Amara Apollo: The bloodstain belongs to Amara Sigatar Khura'in, the previous queen of Khura'in! Judge: Why would Queen Amara's blood be in such a place? Apollo: Maybe it got there when she was assassinated. Judge: Her tomb was erected on top of the very spot where her residence was put to torch. How could her blood have ended up inside it? Apollo: Stranger things have happened. Judge: Yes, like you going this long without a penalty. Apollo: Argh! (I guess I was really reaching there.) Phoenix: Apollo, think about who would want to conceal a trail of their own blood. You should be able to make an educated guess from there. Apollo: Right! I got this! Leads back to: \"The bloodstain belongs to...\"The real killer Leads to: \"The bloodstain belongs to the real killer, of course.\"The victim Apollo: The bloodstain belongs to the victim. Minister Inga was stabbed, after all! Ga'ran: And? Do you also know who wiped it up? Apollo: Um... maybe the royal guard after they stormed in? Ga'ran: You contend they neglected their duty to preserve the crime scene? Apollo: Maybe one of them was the royal janitor, and just couldn't help himself. Ga'ran: Such an imbecile would never rise to the rank of royal guard. Your Magistry! Judge: Clean up your act, defense! Apollo: Angh! (Where's a royal janitor when you need one?) Phoenix: Apollo, just think about who would want to cover up their bloodstain. Apollo: R-Right. Got it. Leads back to: \"The bloodstain belongs to...\"Apollo: The bloodstain belongs to the real killer, of course. Whoever it was, they were probably shot while they were attacking Minister Inga. And since their blood would give them away, they had to wipe it up. And I say this because we know for a fact that the justice minister fired his gun in the tomb.Ga'ran:Ga'ran: You have the memory of a flea. There was nowhere for anyone to hide. This, too, is a known fact.Apollo:Apollo: But a bloodstain from a third party means there must've been someone hiding there.Ga'ran: ...Very well, then, tell me this: Where was this third party hiding?Apollo: Oh, um...Phoenix: The crime scene was thoroughly searched after it was discovered. So if there was a hiding place, it would have to be somewhere no one would dare look.Apollo: (Somewhere no one would dare look? Hmm...)Judge: Let's have your answer, defense. Now, where could a third party have hidden?Present Sarcophagus Apollo: Leads to: \"There's one place no one would search, not even the queen's royal guard.\"Present anywhere else Apollo: Judge: How could anyone have hidden there? Apollo: Well... think of it this way. The killer could have hidden anywhere. Judge: I am afraid I don't follow. Apollo: What if the killer was a dwarf? That means the smallest of spaces could become a hiding place. Judge: By dwarf... you mean those little people who appear in fairy tales? Apollo: Exactly. That solves all the mysteries surrounding this case! After the royal guard stormed in, the dwarf escaped through the partially opened door... ...or clung on to one of the guards when they were leaving. Judge: What nonsense! Did the dwarf also make off with your brain, defense?! Apollo: B-But you can't unequivocally assert that there wasn't a dwarf there, can you? Ga'ran: Just as you cannot assert there was one there, either. Apollo: ...Oh, right. Well, let's just forget I said that then. Judge: The Hall of Justice is no place for flights of fancy! Apollo: I-I'll stay more grounded next time! Promise! Leads back to: \"Now, where could a third party have hidden?\"Apollo: There's one place no one would search, not even the queen's royal guard. And that would be... Inside Queen Aamara's sarcophagus. Even now, it's locked up tight. No one would find you if you hid in there. I'm told that it's temperature-controlled to preserve the mummy within. But if someone dressed warmly enough, they could withstand the cold for a short time.Judge: Th-This is sacrilege! Surely the perpetrator of such a foul deed would be cursed!Apollo: But that's just it. The killer knew everyone would be too scared to open the sarcophagus.Phoenix: True. The guards were so scared of being cursed, they wouldn't even touch it.Apollo: And when the coast was clear... ...the killer made a quick escape from within their frigid confines.Judge: Well, now! That does sound like a plausible method of evading capture.Apollo: The defense requests a DNA test on the bloodstain! And then we'll see just who the real killer is!Ga'ran:Apollo: ...!Ga'ran: ...Bow our head and knell, lawyer... ...so your head may be parted from your shoulders.Apollo: Huh? But the trial's not even over. Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!Ga'ran: How soon you forget. You are already on the headsman's scaffold. As such, I could order your beheading at any moment.Apollo: .........Um, all I did was request a DNA test.Ga'ran: There is no need to request such a test. Royal guard. Bring it forth now.Royal Guard: Here you are, Your Eminence!Ga'ran: The police have already identified the source of the bloodstain. The DNA test revealed... ...that the blood is of the traitor, Dhurke Sahdmadhi.Apollo: What?! But Dhurke wasn't injured. So where did his blood come from?Phoenix: Maybe he coughed it up.Apollo: ! (Dhurke's illness... Still there was a lot of blood. Could he have really coughed up that much? And did he wipe it up to hide his failing health? Dhurke... Is it really that bad...?)Dhurke: Aw, shoot. You got me.Mysterious Bloodstain updated in the Court Record.Ga'ran: Pay attention, Horned Devil. For this case has already been solved. You claimed that this bloodstain would lead us to the real killer, did you not?Apollo: Um, about that...Ga'ran: Did you or did you not make that claim of your own volition, defense?Apollo: Yes... I did.Phoenix: ...After she steered you in that direction, that is.Apollo: Arnngh...! (I fell right into her trap.)Ga'ran: Heh heh heh. Do you see now, the folly in opposing the very embodiment of the law? Whatever you say or do shall come to no avail. A third party at the scene of the crime? It's beyond the realm of possibility!Apollo: Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!Royal Guard: Praise be for Queen Ga'ran! Her Eminence's legal tactics are beyond compare!Phoenix: I hate to say this, but she really got us good.Ga'ran: The key to Amara's sarcophagus is under the protection of the royal family. My husband and I are the only ones who could open it. Therefore, it would be impossible for some knave to open it.Apollo: (Can I really discount the sarcophagus as a hiding place, though? What if the real killer is still in there? ...No, that's just ridiculous.)Ga'ran: I believe we have rebels and sympathizers in the gallery today. It is to you I speak. Have you been listening? Dhurke Sahdmadhi, the one who proclaimed a bloodless revolt... ...has betrayed your cause by resorting to murder.Gallery:No, it can't be. Dhurke would never...There must be some kind of mistake.Dhurke: ........................Apollo: (The Defiant Dragons and their sympathizers are starting to have doubts.)Phoenix: So this is why Ga'ran allowed us to cross-examine Dhurke. By establishing his guilt in Inga's murder... ...she's effectively damaged his reputation among those who support him.Apollo: True, but now we have an even bigger problem.Ga'ran: And now, filthy lawyers, you will honor your end of the bargain. Accept your guilty verdict for your failure to explain your client's actions.Apollo: .........*gulp*Judge: Huh?Ga'ran: Now, I shall pass judgment on the criminal, Dhurke Sahdmadhi.Judge: What's this? You...? Shall pass judgment...? ...But Your Eminence, is that not my role...?Ga'ran: Hold your tongue. You are but a figurehead before me, the embodiment of law. ...Consider yourself dismissed.Judge: ..................Ga'ran: As queen of Khura'in, I shall now pass judgment upon the accused!GuiltyApollo: ............Judge: ..................Dhurke: ................................................Apollo:Apollo: Wait, wait, wait! You didn't even give me a chance to rebut!Ga'ran: Know when you are defeated, lawyer. .........But just this once, I am willing to show you the depths of my compassion. Tell me why I should allow these proceedings to continue. Come, convince me.Phoenix: Q-Quick, Apollo! Even if you have to bluff, we've got to keep this trial going. Show her that the crime could've been committed by a third party!Apollo: How am I supposed to do that?!Phoenix: O-Oh, um... Why don't you start with... um... How about the timing of Inga's murder?Apollo: What?Phoenix: This whole case is built on a single premise... ...that Inga was murdered after Dhurke entered the tomb. But what if that's not true?Apollo: Like, if our assumptions are all wrong? (Hmm... It just might work...)Judge: Well, don't keep us waiting, defense.Apollo: Umm... Dhurke became the prime suspect... ...because it didn't seem probable that there was a third party at the scene of the crime. But there is another question we should ask ourselves at this time. Was Minister Inga really killed after Dhurke entered the tomb?Ga'ran: ......... What nonsense is this?Apollo: Setting aside the assumption that the murder occurred after Dhurke arrived on the scene... ...opens up the possibility of a third party committing the crime. The question before us is, when was Minister Inga really killed?After the body was found Apollo: Maybe he was murdered after his body was found. Judge: ......I'm afraid I don't understand. How could there have been a body to discover BEFORE the murder occurred? Apollo: It's like one of those Zen riddles. I saw a show about them on TV the other day. They're questions or stories that can't be explained using logic. But continual meditation on the illogical can lead to enlightenment. A famous example is, \"What is the sound of one hand clapping?\" Judge: ...I have a better question, defense. What is the sound of one penalty landing?! Apollo: Oww! Phoenix: Better save those riddles for later, Apollo. Apollo: L-Let me try that again, Your Magistry! Leads back to: \"The question before us is, when was Minister Inga really killed?\"After Dhurke entered the tomb Apollo: A third party committed the murder after Dhurke entered the tomb. Judge: Oh? Could you kindly tell us who it was and how they did it? Apollo: ...I was going to do that right now, with everyone's help, of course. Judge: What a wonderful idea... ...were this a classroom. Apollo: ...Lesson learned. Phoenix: Apollo, if Dhurke isn't the culprit... ...then it should really narrow down when the murder could've happened. Apollo: R-Right... Could I have another shot at that, please, Your Magistry? Leads back to: \"The question before us is, when was Minister Inga really killed?\"Before Dhurke entered the tomb Leads to: \"Isn't it possible that...\"Apollo: Isn't it possible that... ...before Dhurke even set foot in the tomb, Minister Inga was already dead?Judge: Hmm... That would certainly make the possibility of a third party more probable.Dhurke: ...Why, of course. I fell unconscious right after I entered the tomb. Even if I hadn't, I wouldn't have had a clear line of sight to his body from the entrance. Which means...Apollo: ...You wouldn't have noticed his body either way. This scenario is entirely possible. And so we can't rule out the possibility of a third person committing the crime.Judge: ......I see... Well, that certainly does make sense.Apollo: (So far, so good... This might actually work!)Ga'ran: .........Very well. I shall play along with whatever little game you have knocking around in that tiny mind. I was starting to get quite bored of all this; I could do with a distraction.Apollo: (Yes!)Ga'ran: Let us hear some testimony that will shed light on when exactly the minister was slain. Bailiff, summon Rayfa. Surely she has recovered by now.Judge: .........B-But what about me...? Don't I serve a purpose anymore...?Judge: I hope you are feeling better, Your Benevolence.Rayfa: .........Must I perform the Divination Séance?Judge: What? ...Oh, no, no. We merely require your testimony this time.Rayfa: ............... ...How could my testimony be of any value?Judge: Your Benevolence?Apollo: Princess Rayfa seems awfully depressed.Phoenix: After what she's been through, summoning her again is like rubbing salt in the wound. Being unable to perform the Séance was probably the last straw.Apollo: (I hope she doesn't pass out again.)Rayfa: ...Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, may I ask you something?Nahyuta: Of course, Your Benevolence.Rayfa: I, um... I've been meaning to ask you this since yesterday. Did you know about... ...Queen Amara... ...and... about me?Nahyuta: ! From where did you hear such a thing...?Rayfa: From Mother... and only yesterday.Ga'ran: Rayfa was carrying on about telling the truth to the people. So I told her. I told her what the \"truth\" really was. For it is up to a mother to discipline her child.Nahyuta: ...I see. Be as it may, Your Benevolence, it has no bearing upon our trial here today. So, there is no need to let it trouble you.Rayfa: ...I know.Phoenix: ...Ga'ran told Rayfa about something other than Amara's status?Apollo: Sounds like it, but what could it be?Ga'ran: Rayfa, the defense has proposed something preposterous. They somehow think your father was already dead when Dhurke entered the tomb. But I believe you can prove them wrong. Are you prepared to do what is required of you?Rayfa: ..................Yes. I am ready to testify.Judge: Very well, then, Your Benevolence. Your testimony, if you please...Witness Testimony-- What Rayfa Witnessed --Rayfa: On the day of the murder, I was gazing upon the courtyard from my second-floor veranda. Around 2:30 PM, I saw my father heading for Amara's Tomb. Then, at about 2:45, I saw Barbed Head and company enter the courtyard. I saw no one go in or out of the tomb after my father entered at about 2:30.Apollo: Your second-floor veranda? (Oh, she must be talking about that house facing Inga's private residence.) So that's the location from which you saw your father? And at about 2:30?Rayfa: Yes. And shortly after that, you people arrived at the royal residence.Judge: So, after the minister entered Amara's Tomb at around 2:30... ...no one went in or out of there until the murder was discovered?Ga'ran: The tomb is closed to outsiders, so no one could have snuck in before the murder. That rules out any possibility of a third party lying in wait to slay my poor husband.Apollo: (Or so she'd like us to believe.)Ga'ran: Now hear me, you useless lawyer. Cease this charade and bow before me. For I, Queen Ga'ran, shall finally have your head!Apollo: Nngh...Judge: Forgive me, Your Eminence, but first, let us allow the defense to question the witness.Cross-ExaminationCross-Examination-- What Rayfa Witnessed --Rayfa: On the day of the murder, I was gazing upon the courtyard from my second-floor veranda.Press Apollo: Apollo: You say you'd been watching the courtyard until we arrived, correct? That seems like an awfully long time. Rayfa: ............There is much that weighs on my mind. Apollo: I see... (She really does sound troubled.) Phoenix: I don't think she ever fully recovered from the previous trial. Maya: ...Your Benevolence. As crown princess, you are destined to rule this kingdom one day. That means there will be many things that you alone must determine. Things like how to keep your people happy, and what is true and what is false... And most importantly, what role you must play therein. Rayfa: .................. I wonder if I am even up to the task. Apollo: ...I guess it's not easy being a princess. ...Um, Your Benevolence? I'd be happy to lend an ear if you'd ever like to talk. Rayfa: .........Hmph. What would you know of my woes? Do not presume to exceed your station in life! Apollo: (Sheesh... Teenagers.) Judge: Your Benevolence, what did you witness from your veranda? Rayfa: Well...Rayfa: Around 2:30 PM, I saw my father heading for Amara's Tomb.Press Apollo: Apollo: Did your father seem different or troubled in any way? Rayfa: Hmm, let me think... ...Oh, there was one unusual thing. Apollo: There was? Rayfa: Yes, a shriek emanated from within my father's quarters... ...after which I witnessed him bolt outside, his countenance drained of its usual color. Apollo: He screamed and he was looking pale? What do you suppose happened? Rayfa: I know not. Perhaps he had a bad dream. Apollo: Maybe it was a nightmare about being raked over the coals by the queen. Ga'ran: ...It seems our young lawyer here wishes to hasten his journey to the Twilight Realm. Apollo: S-Sorry, sorry! That was rude of me. Judge: Does the defense believe the witness's last statement to be important? Apollo: I believe it is. I would like the witness to add it to her testimony. Adds statement \"My father let out a scream and came dashing out of his room -- his face, pale.\" if not already addedRayfa: My father let out a scream and came dashing out of his room -- his face, pale.Press Apollo: Apollo: Hmm... And why do you think he screamed? Was he surprised by someone who didn't belong there? Did anyone else come out? Rayfa: I-I... I didn't see anyone else... Just my father. Apollo: (That last statement was seriously lacking in conviction. Should I press her on this?) Be nice and leave it be Apollo: (Poor thing, I feel sorry for her. I'll just leave it be for now.) Your Benevolence, please continue with your testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press softly Apollo: Your Benevolence.  Rayfa: Y-Yes?  Apollo: This incident was a real shock to us all. It must have been really terrible for you. But I want to let you know, I know how you feel. Rayfa: P-Please, stop. You... presume too much. Apollo: It's times like these that you need something to take your mind off things! How about we all go on a picnic together or something?! Rayfa: .........I need no sympathy from you! Go on your little picnic alone, Horn Head! Apollo: (Well, that didn't go well.) Phoenix: Apollo. You have to take a more aggressive approach with people like her. Apollo: (Yeah, he's probably right.) Rayfa: ...Now, back to my testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harshly Apollo: Your Benevolence! Let's have some details! The more, the better! Rayfa: D-Details, you say?  Apollo: Yes. For example, are you sure you didn't see anyone in the royal residence before 2:30? Rayfa: ......... Apollo: Well?! Is that a yes or a no?! Rayfa: Eek! F-Foreign devil! I'd been gazing upon the courtyard since about 2 yesterday... ...yet I saw none other than my father. .........Oh, if only I had stopped him then. *sniffle* Phoenix: I think you've struck a nerve, or rather, obliterated one. Apollo: Maybe I pressed a little too hard... (Still... that last statement seemed a little off somehow.) So, you didn't see anyone except your father in the courtyard after 2 PM, huh. Please add that to your testimony, Your Benevolence.  Adds statement \"I had been gazing upon the courtyard since about 2, but father was the only one I saw.\"Press (after adding statement \"I had been gazing upon the courtyard since about 2, but father was the only one I saw.\") Apollo: Apollo: Hmm... And why do you think he screamed? Was he surprised by someone who didn't belong there? Did anyone else come out? Rayfa: I-I... I didn't see anyone else... Just my father. Apollo: (That last statement was seriously lacking in conviction.)Rafya: I had been gazing upon the courtyard since about 2, but father was the only one I saw.Press Apollo: Apollo: Is the royal residence always so empty?  Rayfa: Naturally. It is where the royal family lives, and we are few in number. Besides Nayna and the little birds who visit, I have no one else to talk to. Apollo: (Is there anything more stereotypically princess-y than talking to birds?) So Nayna wasn't around at all yesterday? Rayfa: It seems she was quite busy. I was all alone the entire day. It's been like that a lot lately. Phoenix: Rayfa doesn't go to school, so she probably doesn't have any close friends. She must lead a rather solitary life. Apollo: I guess being a princess isn't all it's cracked up to be. Ga'ran: .........Rayfa, I shall buy you a new servant. Rafya: I-I don't want you to buy me a servant like some sort of pet! I want Nayna! Apollo: (I'm beginning to see why Rayfa turned out like she did.) Judge: Your Benevolence, please tell us about what happened after you saw your father. Rayfa: Well, it was around 2:30 when I saw him heading for the tomb...Present Ahlbi's Statement Apollo: Leads to: \"Your Benevolence.\"Rayfa: Then, at about 2:45, I saw Barbed Head and company enter the courtyard.Press Apollo: Apollo: 2:45... Yes, I believe that's around when we arrived. Mr. Wright, Athena, Dhurke, and I were running toward the tomb. Rayfa: Yes. I was taken aback, as we don't normally see commoners in the palace courtyard. Even more shocking was that Dhurke -- a wanted man -- was with you. Apollo: Yeah, I suppose so. Rayfa: I thought the villainous leader of the Defiant Dragons was here with his minions... ...because it was, you know, \"time for a revolution.\" Apollo: I think you've been watching too much of that TV show. Ga'ran: I have already banned its broadcast for containing content unsuitable for our kingdom. Besides, the actress playing Rayfa looked nothing like her. I can't have my subjects feeling so... disappointed when they see the real Rayfa. Rayfa: M-Mother...! Why are you so cruel to me?! Are you so ashamed?! Once I am all grown up, I shall be just as full-figured as that actress! Phoenix: She's placing all her hopes on one final growth spurt. Apollo: For her sake, I hope it's in her DNA... Ga'ran: I suppose you could always hope for a miracle... Rayfa: Oooh... I'll show you! I shall double my milk intake and grow up big and strong! Judge: There there, Your Benevolence. I think you are fine, just the way you are. Now, may I ask that you continue with your testimony? Rayfa: ...I wish I could grow up faster.Rayfa: I saw no one go in or out of the tomb after my father entered at about 2:30.Press Apollo: Apollo: Is it possible you missed seeing someone pass through? Rayfa: No. My veranda has a commanding view of the entire grounds, and I saw no one else. Apollo: (Hmm... But that doesn't seem right, somehow.) Ga'ran: Hmph. Do not underestimate my daughter. She may be lacking elsewhere, but her eyes are the finest. Rayfa: L-Lacking elsewhere? Apollo: (Talk about a mother I'd never wish on my worst enemy...) Phoenix: She needs Nayna now more than ever.Before adding statement \"I had been gazing upon the courtyard since about 2, but father was the only one I saw.\" Phoenix: So no one entered the tomb after Inga went in at about 2:30? And no one was seen leaving it, either? Apollo: But if the murder occurred before 3 PM... ...then Rayfa should have seen the killer going in or out. Phoenix: Well... ...we'll just have to try to get as much info out of her as we can.After adding statement \"I had been gazing upon the courtyard since about 2, but father was the only one I saw.\" Phoenix: Rayfa didn't see anybody in the royal residence area after 2PM?  Apollo: That's a really long time to just look at a courtyard... Phoenix: She was probably lost in thought.

However, the mysterious bloodstain (evidence 20) indicates that someone (Dhurke) was bleeding in the tomb, and the blood had to be wiped up by someone.

Rayfa actor: Aaah! Why me?! Dhurke actor: Mwahahahaha! It's time for a revolution! Rayfa actor: No! Let go of me! Plumed Punisher actor: That's far enough! Dhurke actor: Who's there?! Plumed Punisher actor: It is I-- The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm! Dhurke: Good people of Khura'in, we can't allow things to go on like this. The Defense Culpability Act has done nothing but produce countless victims of wrongful convictions. The time to act is now. For we, the Defiant Dragons, have obtained the ultimate weapon: the Founder's Orb! And to the Ga'ran regime: Make no mistake about it-- I will personally dethrone you! A dragon never yields. Nor will he rest until his revolution is complete. May 16, 11:00 AMWright Anything Agency TV: ...And this concludes our report on the recent television hijacking in Khura'in. But really, who could have anticipated a surprising turn of events? Trucy: Did you hear that, Polly? Someone hijacked the airwaves over there! It's like something out of a movie! Apollo: ......... Trucy: Apollo? Apollo: ......Um, yeah. Dhurke... What are you up to this time? Trucy: Wait a second... Do you know the TV hijacker or something, Apollo? Apollo: ......You could say that... but it was a long time ago. Trucy: ...And WHY do you know someone like that? I mean, they're calling him an \"insurgent.\" Apollo: Y-Yeah, about that... ???: Hey now. Is that any way to talk about the man who raised you? Apollo: Huh? Dhurke: Hey there, Apollo! Long time no see! How've you been, son? Apollo: I-I-It's-- Trucy: It's that guy that was on TV! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Guilty as charged! Surprised to see me, Apollo? I just beamed in from Khura'in, and boy are my arms tired! Apollo: Th-Th-This can't be happening! ...I must be dreaming... or hallucinating... or both... Trucy: No, you're not, Apollo! It's that TV hijacker-slash-insurgent in the flesh! Apollo: ........ (I'm so confused.) Trucy: Um! Mr. Hijacker! Sir! I have SO many questions, I don't even know where to begin! But let's start with that bit about \"the man who raised you.\" Dhurke: Wait, don't tell me you haven't told anyone about me, son? It's okay to brag about it. Tell everyone your old man's me, the rebel Dhurke! I mean, my face is all over TV these days! I'm practically a celebrity, hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: .........Trucy, what do you say we close up early today? Trucy: What?! Why?! Dhurke: ...Aw, come on, son. No need for the cold shoulder! Apollo: ......... (*sigh* I know I'm going to regret this, but...) What do you want, Dhurke? You just show up here without warning after all this time... What gives? Dhurke: I came all this way to see you, son! Come, rejoice! Apollo: Riiight... Why don't you tell me the real reason you're here. Dhurke: W-Well... Okay, so maybe there's a little something I need your help with, too, but... The fact is I came here to see you. That's the honest truth. Apollo: Yes, I think we've established that. (It figures... I haven't seen him in ten plus years and he's already asking for a favor. He really is a rebel in the purest sense -- he just does whatever he pleases.) Trucy: C'mon, Polly! I need details. Inquiring minds want to know! Apollo: Okay, okay. Hold your horses. First, I've got a few questions of my own. Examine Bookshelf Dhurke: Hm? Why, this is Apollo's journal. Apollo: Huh?! What's it doing at the office? Trucy: It's magic! Dhurke: Let's see what he wrote... Apollo: N-No, don't! Dhurke: Huh... There's nothing in here. Apollo: What? Trucy: This calls for a special spell! Presto diario! Dhurke: Why, there's writing appearing right before my very eyes! Trucy: Like I said, it's magic! Now go ahead, read to your heart's content! Apollo: Wow! ...Er, I mean, give me that! Charley the plant Apollo: That's Charley the houseplant. Dhurke: You know, my hideout used to have a houseplant, too. We called it \"Apollo.\" Trucy: I bet it was a cactus! Dhurke: How'd you guess? Trucy: Because Polly's hair's just as spiny! Apollo: Hey, leave my hair out of this. Trucy: And he has a prickly attitude, to boot! Apollo: (I better quit while I'm ahead.) Hula hoop Dhurke: More magic props... Oh! I've seen a ring like this before! I used to be quite good with these. Apollo: Really? Why don't you show us? Dhurke: Well, if you insist! I'll show you the act of daring-do I used to perform to supplement my income. First, I have to light the ring on fire, then I'll jump through it... Apollo: That's a fire hoop, this is a kid's toy, Dhurke... Magic props Dhurke: This is one seriously cluttered office. I mean, do you really need a piano here? Trucy: Well, it has sentimental value for Daddy, you see... Apollo: Yeah, but this office could use a little help with its bottom line. What if we sold it? Trucy: Apollo! ...You'd better give me a cut of the proceeds when you do. Dhurke: Money before memories, eh? This office's finances really must be in dire straits then. Magic split box Dhurke: This is one of those contraptions for cutting people into pieces! Trucy: How did you know that, Mr. Dhurke? Dhurke: Well, it just so happens I've been in one of these myself. Apollo: Really? Trucy: You have? Dhurke: Yes. Once, when I was being held prisoner by Minister Inga's secret police... ...they tried to torture me into revealing one of my compatriot's hideouts. Apollo: That's a torture device, this is a magic prop, Dhurke... Dhurke: Man, I barely escaped that thing alive! Trucy: Well, you have my respect as a magician for your death-defying spirit! Table Dhurke: What's with this bright red jacket? Who would wear such a garish thing? Trucy: Maybe one of our clients forgot it here. Dhurke: I'd love to get a look at the man who'd dare wear something like this! Trucy: Me, too! Apollo: (I know I don't wear it much, but... she has to know it's mine, right?) Talk Dhurke Dhurke: Pleased to meet you, little lady. My name is Dhurke Sahdmadhi. I'm a... well... a rebel by trade. Trucy: A rebel? But on TV, they were calling you an insurgent. So which is it? Personally, I vote for a rebel with a cause -- a real \"head\"-ache for anyone in your way! Apollo: Trucy...! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! You got me there. I'm the head of a resistance group. The Defiant Dragons. We're like the good, the bad, and the ugly... but without the good part. In Khura'in, I'm like the bogeyman -- a tall tale parents use to spook their kids straight! Trucy: That's too bad. You seem like you'd be a fun, cool guy to hang with! Dhurke: ...This little lady's a real catch, son. I'm talking bride material, if you get my drift. Apollo: Wait, what? Trucy: Oh! Stop it! You're embarrassing me... Dad. Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha. She's a plucky one, all right! Apollo: Someone pluck me out of my misery... Trucy: Now, about that \"man who raised you\" business... Foster father (appears after \"Dhurke\") Trucy: What did Mr. Dhurke mean when he said that he's \"the man who raised you,\" Apollo? Apollo: The truth is, I grew up in the Kingdom of Khura'in. Did I, uh... never mention that? Trucy: Oh, so you grew up in... Khura'in?! Wait, are you saying... ...you're not from around here, Polly? Apollo: No, it's just I was raised in Khura'in when I was really little. Trucy: Still, that's a shocker. It's like I hardly know anything about you! How come you never told me?! Dhurke: ...Apollo. You really haven't said a word about your past, have you? Apollo: What, that I was raised by a wanted criminal? It's like a bad joke. Trucy: It does sound rather melodramatic. I doubt anyone would even believe you. So you two haven't seen each other in a while, huh? Apollo: You could say that. I'd wager it's been at least ten years. Trucy: Wow... That's a really long time. Apollo: Yeah, well, I figured he'd forgotten about me. Dhurke: Not a chance! It's just, well... Starting a revolution takes time, and keeping it going even more so... And being a wanted man, I couldn't just hop a plane to come say hello. Apollo: ...I get it. It's fine. (Though, truth be told... ...it's weird having Dhurke suddenly show up acting all paternal. I'd even almost forgotten about Khura'in... No, that's not true. I probably tried to forget about it on purpose.) Trucy: Now then, Mr. Dhurke, what is it we can help you with? Request (appears after \"Foster father\") Dhurke: I need to get my hand on the Founder's Orb, the most sacred treasure of Khura'in. That's where you come in. Apollo: The Founder's Orb? Trucy: Wait, but didn't you say you already have it in that broadcast of yours? Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Don't go believing everything you see on TV, little lady. No one's seen hide nor hair of the Founder's Orb for some time. Trucy: No way! Apollo: S-So that was just a bluff...? What are you going to do if you DON'T find it? Dhurke: I don't know. Guess that just means we HAVE to find it, son. 'Cause I can't really back down now, can I? Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (*sigh* Different year, same old Dhurke. It's all coming back to me now.) Hold on. I think I read something about this in the newspaper a while back. Something about you stealing a sacred treasure from a temple's treasure room. Dhurke: That's a load of crock. We didn't lay a finger on the orb. Apollo: Really? Dhurke: Yes, Baseless allegations, all of it. Our enemy has really found a way to keep us all on our toes. Trucy: Ooh! So it's like a setup! Dhurke: That's the long and short of it. However, my compatriot has been hot on the orb's trail. And just the other day, his hard work finally paid off. We now know the Founder's Orb is in... Kurain Village. Apollo: Kurain Village? Dhurke: Yes. I hear there are spirit mediums there. They even have direct relations with Khura'in. Apollo: Spirit mediums... Right... Dhurke: Some doctor of archeology there supposedly has the orb. His name is Archie Buff. My Defiant Dragon compatriot has already made contact with him. Apparently, someone asked the doctor to study the orb. Apollo: So whoever asked him to do that is the real thief? Dhurke: Most likely. Apollo: And you think this guy will just hand the orb over to you? Dhurke: My compatriot, Datz, says Dr. Buff has already promised to do so. It seems he knew it was stolen, and wanted to do the right thing. Apollo: (Datz... I remember running around him when I was a kid.) (So he's here, too, huh.) Dhurke: Apollo, I want you to be present as my lawyer when I take possession of the orb. Would you do that for me? Fine Leads to: \".........Fine, but I'll charge my standard fee.\" Nope Apollo: I haven't seen you in years, and you waltz in here asking for a favor? You have a lot of nerve, you know-- Trucy: Of course we'll help! Right, Apollo?! Apollo: W-Wait, Trucy...! Trucy: Oh, come on. It's not like you have any work anyway. Besides, we're talking about rebels and legendary treasure here. It'll be fun! Apollo: (*sigh* Why is she always into the things I'm not?) Leads to: \".........Fine, but I'll charge my standard fee.\" Apollo: .........Fine, but I'll charge my standard fee. Now tell me about the Founder's Orb. The Founder's Orb (appears after \"Request\") Apollo: If I remember correctly, the founder is always depicted as a faceless spirit medium. Trucy: What do you mean \"faceless\"? Dhurke: Images of the founder, the Holy Mother of Khura'in, never show her face. To depict it is to commit the greatest taboo in Khura'inism. Apollo: The greatest taboo, huh? (I wonder why? I mean, what could she have looked like to make them hide her face like that? Dhurke: As for the Founder's Orb, it was discovered during an excavation eight years ago... ...and has an interesting legend that goes along with it. It's said that there's a riddle to the orb, and that any who can solve it... ...will receive immense spiritual power from the founder herself. Apollo: Sounds like one big fairy tale to me. Dhurke: In any case... ...it's just what us Defiant Dragons need to get our revolution started. With it, we can gain the spiritual power, and thus, the legal authority to rule Khura'in! Apollo: Wait, suppose I believe this legend. Then, anyone could become king or queen? And THAT'S why you think it'll help you overthrow the Gar'an regime? Dhurke: Only the rulers of Khura'in have ever laid eyes on the orb, Apollo. A legendary treasure that bestows immense spiritual power... Doesn't that sound like something you'd want to see with your own two eyes? Apollo: (...That does sound just a tiny bit intriguing.) Founder's Orb added to the Court Record. Dhurke: That should just about cover everything. Any other questions? Apollo: Not right now. Dhurke: Ah, I almost forgot. I brought you a present. Eat up, son! Apollo: ...Sushi? Dhurke: I figured you probably couldn't afford three square meals a day, so... Trucy: Yay! I was just thinking it was time for lunch! Dhurke: You dig in, too, little lady. After all, we're practically family, right?! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Trucy: Thanks, Dad! Ooh, that tuna looks good! *chomp* *nom nom nom* Dhurke: This salmon sushi's got my name on it! *chomp* *chew chew chew* Aren't you hungry, son? This is some of the best sushi you'll ever have! Apollo: .........I'm... I'm good. Dhurke: O-Oh, well... Okay then. ...Actually, I have one more present for you. Here. Apollo: What's this? Dhurke: A picture of your father. It's been twenty-three years since he passed away. Apollo: Huh?! This... This is my father? Dhurke: His name was Jove Justice. Apollo: Jove... Dhurke: I haven't talked to you about your real father in some time, but as you know... ...he was a musician -- a wandering minstrel, if you will -- and a talented one at that. Apollo: ............ Why... Why are you giving this to me now? Dhurke: I thought it was sad you didn't know what your old man looked like. I searched high and low to find that one picture. Apollo: ............ Trucy: What's wrong, Apollo? Don't you want it? Apollo: (I don't know. I mean, it's not like I ever met the guy.) Dhurke: Well, I went through all the trouble of finding it, so go on, take it! And don't ever let it go, you hear? Photo of My Father added to the Court Record. Dhurke: Well, now that our bellies are full, what do you say we hit the road? Apollo: One second. Hey, Trucy, any idea where Athena is? Trucy: She left early this morning to pick up Daddy from the airport. Apollo: Oh, I almost forgot. Mr. Wright is coming back today. Trucy: Yeah... but I wonder why he cut his trip short like that. Anyway, shouldn't they have been back by now? Apollo: Knowing Athena, she probably got lost. Well, there's no point sitting around here waiting. Let's get going. Trucy: I can't wait to see that super mysterious treasure! Dhurke: To Kurain Village, then! The Founder's Orb awaits! The Founder's Orb (subsequent times) Apollo: If I remember correctly, the founder is always depicted as a faceless spirit medium. Trucy: What do you mean \"faceless\"? Dhurke: Images of the founder, the Holy Mother of Khura'in, never show her face. To depict it is to commit the greatest taboo in Khura'inism. Apollo: The greatest taboo, huh? (I wonder why? I mean, what could she have looked like to make them hide her face like that? Dhurke: As for the Founder's Orb, it was discovered during an excavation eight years ago... ...and has an interesting legend that goes along with it. It's said that there's a riddle to the orb, and that any who can solve it... ...will receive immense spiritual power from the founder herself. Apollo: Sounds like one big fairy tale to me. Dhurke: In any case... ...it's just what us Defiant Dragons need to get our revolution started. With it, we can gain the spiritual power, and thus, the legal authority to rule Khura'in! Apollo: Wait, suppose I believe this legend. Then, anyone could become king or queen? And THAT'S why you think it'll help you overthrow the Gar'an regime? Dhurke: Only the rulers of Khura'in have ever laid eyes on the orb, Apollo. A legendary treasure that bestows immense spiritual power... Doesn't that sound like something you'd want to see with your own two eyes? Apollo: (...That does sound just a tiny bit intriguing.) Present Attorney's Badge Dhurke: What's that? Apollo: It's my attorney's badge. Dhurke: I can relate. I used to want to show mine off, too. But don't ever show it to anyone in Khura'in. They'll run you right out of town the moment they find out you're a lawyer. Apollo: I wonder how it went for Mr. Wright. Knowing him, he probably flashed his left and right... Founder's Orb Dhurke: The Founder's Orb... They say the Holy Mother will return when the riddle of the orb is solved. And she will bestow great spiritual power upon whoever accomplishes that feat. Apollo: (I wonder if I could channel spirits if I had such power.) Photo of My Father Dhurke: Brings back memories... He was a fine young man. So cheerful and fun to be around. His big, booming singing voice would captivate everyone in the tavern. But looks-wise, he was like a grownup version of you. Apollo: Um, that still doesn't give me a sense of what my real father was like. After clearing \"The Founder's Orb\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency: May 16Kurain Village Apollo: (So this is Kurain, the mystical village of spirit channeling... ... and where ancient traditions come alive. Looks like a really peaceful place.) Dhurke: Ahh, I love the air here! Nothing beats the mountains, huh, Apollo?! Apollo: (Come to think of it... We used to live way up in the mountains, too, just like this.) Dhurke: Sure brings back memories. Those were the days. The three of us living happily in peace. Trucy: ...I still can't wrap my mind around it all, you know. That Mr. Dhurke is not only Polly's daddy, but Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's as well. And the way you two talked about it like it was nothing the whole bus ride here! Apollo: (I guess it IS a lot to take in...) Trucy: So tell me, Mr. Dhurke, what was Apollo like as a kid? Dhurke: Oh, he was full of piss and vinegar, he was. A real rascal! He and Nahyuta used to run around in the open fields, naked as jaybirds. I've even got pictures of him posing in his birthday suit! Apollo: Whoa, whoa, Dhurke! Trucy: No way! Prosecutor Sahdmadhi used to be like that, too? Dhurke: The two of 'em would end up with leeches on their butts and cry like babies, hah-ha ha! Apollo: Dhurke! Don't you think you've said enough?! Dhurke: Aw, you're no fun. Trucy: Yeah! I wanted to hear more about the misadventures of Polly! ???: Hey, what are you people doing here? Apollo: Ema? Dhurke: You know this lady, son? Apollo: Yeah, this is Ema Skye. She's a detective. Ema: Technically speaking, I'm a forensics expert, but I'll let it slide. ...Anyway, I can't say I'm surprised to see you here. You always seem to pop up whenever there's trouble afoot. Still, what are the odds of running into you here in the boonies? Apollo: By \"trouble,\" you mean you're investigating a case? Ema: Does it look like I'm here to sightsee? .........Wait, don't tell me... You're not here to see Dr. Buff, are you? Apollo: Huh? How'd you know that? We're actually on our way to meet with him right now. Ema: Figures... Well, follow me. I'll show you the way. Apollo: ...Really? Dhurke: Don't look a gift horse in the mouth, son. Just follow the nice lady. Examine Phone booth Apollo: (A phone booth and a bus stop made of wood. They both look really old. You hardly ever see phone booths in the city anymore.) Dhurke: Apollo... what's this glass box for? Apollo: (I guess you hardly see them in Khura'in, too.) Kurain Boulder Apollo: There's a big boulder towering into the sky over there. According to the sign, it's called the \"Kurain Boulder.\" It also says that a spirit dwells within it. Hmm... A rock with a spirit in it? Dhurke: It's called animism -- the belief that spirits dwell within inanimate objects. They've probably enshrined this boulder as a sacred object. Their tradition of worshiping such objects is similar to our tradition in Khura'in. Apollo: I-Interesting... (Who knew Dhurke could make sense every once in a while?) Mountains Dhurke: Seeing those mountains really takes me back. I remember when we used to live high in the mountains to escape from the government. Apollo: So, you don't live there anymore? Dhurke: Nope. I needed a more convenient place to lead the revolution from. But that old mountain hut is still there. Apollo: (Man, I miss that hut...) Dhurke: What, are you getting homesick, Apollo? You can come on back to Khura'in anytime, you know? Apollo: N-No, no, I'm fine. Besides, I've got a lot on my plate here... Fey Manor Apollo: A thatched roof... First time I've ever seen one in real life. Dhurke: It looks just like the traditional thatched roofs they use in Japan. All we need now are some samurai with topknots, a few ninjas, and a cuddly mascot. Apollo: When was the last time you were in Japan? Talk Any ideas? Dhurke: Mass transit and electronic communications... This country's infrastructure is really advanced compared to Khura'in. Apollo: Why don't you see the sights once you have the orb? Dhurke: Well... I guess I could use a break. How about you show me around? Apollo: ...Oh, um, I'll probably be busy with work, so, uh... Dhurke: ...I-I see. Trucy: What are you talking about, Polly? Your only work right now is cleaning the office. What to do Dhurke: The Founder's Orb should be with the doctor right now. What do you say we go take a gander? Apollo: What if he doesn't have it? What if you came all the way from Khura'in for nothing? Dhurke: I'll cross that bridge if and when I come to it. Besides... even if I leave empty-handed, at least I got to see you, son. Apollo: ...Oh, ha ha. Thanks? Dhurke: N-No, no -- I really mean it. May 16Kurain Village - Doctor's Study Apollo: So this is Dr. Buff's study... Trucy: Wow, look at all those books! The shelves go from floor to ceiling! It's like a library in here! Dhurke: Yes, and lots of artifacts, too. A true archeologist's paradise. Look, son! There are so many relics, they're spilling onto the floor! What a delightfully amusing room! Apollo: All I see is a mess. (And what's with that white outline...?) ...Um, Ema, where's the doctor? Ema: Well the thing is... he died last night. Apollo: Wait, what? Ema: It seems an avalanche of books knocked him off his bookshelf ladder. We're labeling it an accidental death. Apollo: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Please tell me you're joking... Ema: As if I'd come all the way out here for a few laughs, Apollo. Apollo: ...Yeah, I guess not. Dhurke: A scholar killed by his own books... Apollo: Oh man. What do we do now? I mean, how can he transfer ownership of the orb to you if he's dead? Dhurke: Yes, that is a problem. Apollo: Ema, can you please tell us exactly what happened? Examine Ema: What do you think you're doing? You can't just poke around without my permission. Apollo: (Guess I should ask her what's going on first.) Talk The doctor's death Apollo: So the doctor died in an accident? Ema: I received a call this morning saying Dr. Buff had been found dead under a pile of books. Apollo: This morning? (Talk about bad timing...) You mentioned that he had fallen off a ladder. Ema: Right. We believe he fell from the top of that big ladder there. Apparently, he triggered an avalanche of books while fumbling to reach one. And that sent him headlong on a fatal fall onto the hard floor. Trucy: How sad... Killed by his own books. But at least he was doing something he loved. Dhurke: For a scholar, I suppose it's kind of like a soldier killed in the line of duty. You could say he died an honorable death. Apollo: Ema, who was the first one to discover the body? Ema: About that... Whoever it was, it seems they wanted to remain anonymous. Apollo: What? Ema: It happens now and then. Some people would rather not get involved with the police. Dhurke: I can relate to that. Apollo: (Yeah, being a wanted man and all.) What now, Dhurke? A dead man can't exactly hand over the orb. Dhurke: We'll just have to find it. It must be around here somewhere. Apollo: Just to fill you in, Ema, we're actually here to get something. The Founder's Orb (appears after \"The doctor's death\") Apollo: Pops here had an agreement with the doctor. The doctor was supposed to hand over a sacred relic known as the Founder's Orb. Dhurke: \"P-Pops\"...? Ema: Oh, I see. That could be a problem, considering he's dead. Do you have a plan B? Apollo: Umm... Dhurke: I have an agreement in writing. My compatriot Datz should have it. Ema: Well, there shouldn't be any problems, then. So, who IS this gentleman you're escorting? Dhurke (appears after \"The Founder's Orb\") Leads to: \"Oh, right, I haven't introduced you yet. This is Dhurke. He's from the Kingdom of Khura'in.\" Present Attorney's Badge Ema: Your attorney's badge? Huh... Apollo: What, that normally gets a better reaction from you. Ema: I'm tired of collecting your fingerprints. It's kind of lost its luster. Apollo: Yeah, but who knows? There could be other people's prints on it. Ema: Ooh, that's true! Hand it over, buddy! Apollo: Ah! Ema: ............Hmph. The only prints I found were yours. Apollo: (Argh, it's all dusty now.) Founder's Orb Ema: Scientifically speaking, ancient relics are highly fascinating. Apollo: Why's that? Ema: Because of all the tests I can run. CT scans, electron microscopy, chemical analysis... The list goes on and on! If you ever do find one, you'd better bring it to me straight away! Apollo: Can I count on getting it back intact? Ema: We'll see. Scientific advances don't come without sacrifices, you know. Apollo: (...I know someone who WON'T be seeing the orb anytime soon.) Anything else Ema: You sure like to shove things in people's faces, don't you? Apollo: What about you? You're always dusting around for prints. Ema: That's my job! Apollo: Well, it's not like I'm presenting evidence for the fun of it, either. Ema: Really? Because it sure seems like you enjoy it, Apollo. Apollo: Right back at you, Ema. Apollo: Oh, right, I haven't introduced you yet. This is Dhurke. He's from the Kingdom of Khura'in. Ema: All the way from Khura'in, huh? So, what do you do there? Dhurke: I used to practice law, but I'm taking a break from all that. I'm focused now on making Khura'in a better place through... volunteer work. Ema: Volunteer work, huh? How interesting... Apollo: (...Well, it's not technically a lie.) Ema: So, how do you two know each other? Apollo: Oh, um... He's sorta my foster father. Ema: Come again? Trucy: Yeah! And he's Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's real father, too! Ema: Whaaat?! You mean you... and Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... ............I'm so sorry. It seems you've had quite a life. Apollo: (...Guess she's put a few things together.) Ema: Actually, Dhurke, you look kind of... familiar. Have we met before? Dhurke: Um, not that I recall. Apollo: (Great... She must've seen that news report on TV. It will really complicate things if she figures out he's a wanted man.) There are lots of guys who look like him. Sure you're not mistaking him for someone else? Ema: Are there, really? I mean, a middle-aged man with long hair and an eye patch? You don't see that every day. Apollo: W-Well, I'm sure you're just imagining things. Ema: So what does that sacred relic you're searching for look like? I mean, there's lots of stuff in here that's old and relic-y. Dhurke: Indeed. Unfortunately, I've no idea what it actually looks like. Apollo: So then, how are we supposed to find it? Dhurke: That, I do not know, either. We'll just have to go through each candidate one by one. Apollo: Great plan of attack there, Dhurke. Well, Ema, do you mind if we give this room a once-over? Ema: ...I guess not. But in exchange, you're going to help me in my investigation. Apollo: Sure. It can't hurt. Trucy: Ooh, I can't wait to get started! It'll be like hunting for buried treasure! Examine Body outline or pile of books Apollo: So this is where Dr. Buff died. Ema: Poor man... He fell right on his head, and probably died almost instantly. Apollo: I see some blood on the book there, but what's that dark stain? Ema: It appears to be coffee. It's still damp, so it must have gotten on there recently, perhaps even last night. Dhurke: That's a mighty big window he's next to -- big enough for someone to see inside. Ema: Exactly. That's how the local resident who reported his death found him to begin with. The doctor's body was visible from outside the window. And a passerby called in earlier this morning to report what they'd found. Apollo: So you mean this case is still only a few hours old? Dhurke: That explains why your investigation is just getting underway. Study Photo added to the Court Record. Study Diagram added to the Court Record. Body outline or pile of books (subsequent times) Apollo: So this is where Dr. Buff died. Dhurke: Yeah, the police received a call this morning... ...so their investigation is still just getting started. Glasses Apollo: There's a pair of glasses on this little pyramid here. Ema: They belonged to the doctor. Scientifically speaking, they appear to be your ordinary run-of-the-mill glasses. Trucy: I guess they don't pique her interest, scientifically speaking. Computer Apollo: This PC is password protected. Trucy, you think your magic can do something about this? Trucy: Hmm... I don't think it can override a password. Now, a locked desk... That I can get into. Like yours back at the office, Polly! Apollo: (Yikes... I'd better watch what I put in there.) Trucy: What? Do you put weird stuff in your desk? Stuff you don't want anyone to see? Apollo: Jeez, are you a mind reader, too? Trucy: No, but unlocking your thoughts is a cinch! Ladder or bookshelves Apollo: The doctor fell from the top of that ladder. Dhurke: Hmm... From that height, a fall onto a hard surface would probably kill anyone. Apollo: I don't know why anyone would want to climb that high in the first place. Trucy: Guess you can say he climbed it all the way to heaven... Raincoat Apollo: It's a two-tone raincoat. Dhurke: It's still a bit damp. I think someone might've worn it recently. Shoe shelves Apollo: There are a few pairs of shoes here. I guess there must be an entrance on this floor, too. Ema: Yeah, there's a backdoor over that way. But it's usually locked from what I can tell. The visitor's entrance is up that spiral staircase. Apollo: (That's the way we came in.) Geoglyph Apollo: There are animal drawings on the floor. They look like those famous geoglyph things. Dhurke: They remind me of the chalk outlines detectives draw around bodies. And the doctor's has [sic] just joined them. Now that's what I call dedication to one's field. Apollo: I don't think it was on purpose. Window Apollo: What a huge window. I bet you could see the entire study from the outside. Dhurke: How could he concentrate in here? I'd feel so exposed. Apollo: Well... He does have a bookshelf positioned for some privacy around his desk. Mechanical statue Dhurke: There's some sort of machinery inside this clay figure. Apollo: Whoa, it's moving! EX-TER-MI-NATE. EX-TER-MI-NATE. DES-TROY ALL TAR-GETS. EX-T-T-TERRRrrr... *scrape* *grind* Apollo: D-Do I even want to know what that thing is for?! Notebook Apollo: Look, it's one of the doctor's notebooks. Dhurke: Maybe there's something about the orb in there. It's a photo of the treasure box! The one from Tehm'pul Temple's treasure room. These must be his research notes on the Founder's Orb. Apollo: What's that on the right page? It looks like a poem or something. Dhurke: Let's see... Oh, it's the song that's performed during the Dance of Devotion. It's been sung during Khura'inese rites of offering since ancient times. Apollo: Oh, I think I've heard of that. Dhurke: There's also a legend associated with the song. Some say the solution to the orb's riddle is contained therein. Apollo: It's a song everyone in Khura'in knows? Not much of a way to keep it secret. Trucy: It's called \"hiding secrets in plain sight,\" Polly. Us magicians know all about that. Dhurke: Huh. That's strange. Apollo: What is? Dhurke: Dr. Buff's notes contain the second half of the song. Only the first half is sung during the Dance of Devotion. Most people haven't even heard the second half. Apollo: The second half? As in the part that begins, \"Offer thy prayers\"? Dhurke: I'm impressed. That's some thorough research he was conducting. Research Notes added to the Court Record. Model plane Apollo: Is this a bird? Dhurke: It looks like an airplane to me. Apollo: No, there couldn't have been any planes back when this was made. Dhurke: Yes, but it has wings and both horizontal and vertical stabilizers. That makes it an airplane. Apollo: No, it's definitely a bird. Dhurke: Open your eyes, son... As a lawyer, your job is to see the true nature of things. Apollo: (I still say it's a bird.) Misty Fey scroll Apollo: There's a brown stain on this scroll. Hm? Why does it smell like... gravy? Dhurke: Why would there be a gravy stain on it? Apollo: Who knows? But it looks like it's meant to be there. Dhurke: Maybe the artist was trying to inspire a \"gravy\" new trend: food splatter art. Apollo: That pun wounded me \"gravy-ly,\" Dhurke. Coffee machine Apollo: A coffeemaker and a bunch of coffee cups... He must've taken his coffee breaks here. Oh, and there's a filter with old coffee grounds in here. *sigh* Guess I'd better clean this up. Dhurke: What are you doing there, son? Apollo: Ah! (What AM I doing, cleaning this office?!) Dhurke: Don't tell me they have you on coffee duty back at your office. Apollo: N-No, no... It's just, if I don't keep the place clean, no one will. Ami Fey statue Apollo: It's a golden statue. Looks pretty old, too. Dhurke: Hmm... I imagine it has great archeological value... Maybe too great for a private researcher of Dr. Buff's caliber. Apollo: I wonder how he got his hands on something like this. Sacred Urn Apollo: \"Ami\"... Hmm... Why's someone's name written on here? Trucy: Maybe it's so if it ever got lost, someone could return it to its owner. You know, like how school kids put their names on things. Apollo: Yeah, but this is just an urn. And the name is written so big. Trucy: Well, I wrote my name on my magic panties. It says W-R-I-G-H-T in super big letters! Apollo: (The less said about this, the better.) Spiral staircase Apollo: It's a spiral staircase... And it's connected to a hallway up there. Why'd they have to place the second floor so high up? Ema: Wait... You're not afraid of heights, are you? Apollo: Oh, um... Well... Trucy: Oh, Polly's hilarious around high places. He gets all wobbly, like a baby deer taking its first steps. And his face turns as green as a watermelon. Apollo: It's not nice to make fun of people's phobias, you know. Dhurke: Come to think of it, the visitor's entrance is on the second floor. What an odd layout for a house... Wall relief Apollo: What a huge wall relief. Hmm... It seems to depict a spirit channeling. Dhurke: Hey... this spirit medium looks like the Holy Mother of Khura'in. Apollo: Yeah, her face was left blank, but the rest is clearly detailed and well-crafted. Dhurke: Did you know some researchers claim that the Holy Mother had three eyes? And that her third eye was able to divine the truth, just like the gods above. It is said to be on her forehead. Apollo: Like you said, you shouldn't believe everything you hear. Suitcase Apollo: That's one big suitcase. Dhurke: It's locked. Is it the doctor's? Ema: No, someone left it here last night. Apollo: So the doctor might've had a visitor? But how can you tell? Ema: That sticker there. You only see those on airport luggage. Which means, its owner is likely from overseas. Dhurke: Is there any way to figure out who it belongs to? Apollo: Not unless we can open it to see what's inside. Dhurke: Guess not... ???: Heh heh heh. Ah-ha ha ha! Ema: That's because you're not me: Ema Skye, forensics expert extraordinaire! Try as you might, you won't find the word \"impossible\" in my forensics handbook! Dhurke: I-Is she okay, son? It's like she became an entirely different person. Apollo: Oh, that's just what happens when her forensics switch gets flipped. Ema: With this, identifying the suitcase's owner will be easy as pie! Apollo: Is that fingerprint powder? Ema: That's right. And there's no better time than the present to use it! Here we go! You remember how to do this, right? Apollo: I apply the powder to where I think some prints might be, and blow any excess off? Ema: Exactly. Well, have at it! Apollo: (Hmm... Now where would I expect to find prints on a suitcase?) Examine any fingerprint on stickers closest to keyhole Leads to: \"Hey Ema, I've got a pretty clear print here.\" Examine any fingerprint on handle Ema: This one isn't clear enough for a match. Apollo: Hmm... Where else could someone leave prints behind? Dhurke: Think, son. How might someone handle a suitcase? Start by considering what you do with them. Apollo: Well, besides being wheeled or carried, they can be opened and closed. So, I should look for prints that would be left at those times. Examine any incomplete fingerprint Ema: You'll need to use more powder than that to get a clear print. Examine excess powder Ema: There's still too much powder left. Try blowing some more off. Apollo: Hey Ema, I've got a pretty clear print here. Ema: Okay, now let me know who you think it could belong to. Apollo: (Hmm, who could it be? It would have to be someone who would've paid Dr. Buff a visit.) Compare Datz Are'bal profile Analyzing...Analysis CompleteMatch Found Leads to: \"We have a match!\" Compare anyone else Analyzing...No Match Found Ema: We didn't get a match. Trucy: Any other ideas, Apollo? Apollo: Hmm... Well, we can probably assume the print belongs to the suitcase's owner. (But who could that be? It would have to be someone who would've visited the doctor.) Leads back to profile selection Ema: We have a match! Apollo: Datz... Come to think of it, he did stop by to see the doctor, didn't he? To conclude the orb transfer agreement. Dhurke: So he's the one who forgot his suitcase here. Apollo: Where do you suppose he is now? Dhurke: Haven't heard from him in a while, and he's not answering his phone. Trucy: Wait, you don't think he left his phone inside his suitcase, do you? Dhurke: I wouldn't put it past that knucklehead. Ema: Actually, I think we may have run into him earlier. Apollo: Really? Ema: A suspicious man had been reported in the area, but when one of my officers approached to question him, he took off like a shot. Apollo: What?! Dhurke: Sorry about that. Khura'inese people aren't all like him... I swear. Ema: Well, he's probably still in the village somewhere. Apollo: Maybe he knows something about the orb. Suitcase (subsequent times) Apollo: So this suitcase belongs to Datz. Dhurke: How could he leave something so big behind? Apollo: Because, you know... it's Datz. Talk Dhurke Apollo: Oh, right, I haven't introduced you yet. This is Dhurke. He's from the Kingdom of Khura'in. Ema: All the way from Khura'in, huh? So, what do you do there? Dhurke: I used to practice law, but I'm taking a break from all that. I'm focused now on making Khura'in a better place through... volunteer work. Ema: Volunteer work, huh? How interesting... Apollo: (...Well, it's not technically a lie.) Ema: So, how do you two know each other? Apollo: Oh, um... He's sorta my foster father. Ema: Come again? Trucy: Yeah! And he's Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's real father, too! Ema: Whaaat?! You mean you... and Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... ............I'm so sorry. It seems you've had quite a life. Apollo: (...Guess she's put a few things together.) Ema: Actually, Dhurke, you look kind of... familiar. Have we met before? Dhurke: Um, not that I recall. Apollo: (Great... She must've seen that news report on TV. It will really complicate things if she figures out he's a wanted man.) There are lots of guys who look like him. Sure you're not mistaking him for someone else? Ema: Are there, really? I mean, a middle-aged man with long hair and an eye patch? You don't see that every day. Apollo: W-Well, I'm sure you're just imagining things. Present Study Photo Ema: Maybe it was Dr. Buff's wish to die under a pile of his beloved books. I know I could die happily under a big pile of forensic equipment. Apollo: Well, I'll pass on dying under a big pile of evidence from my past cases. It's all murder weapons and photos of dead bodies. Ema: So, what? Are you saying you don't love your job? Apollo: Being buried in the tools of one's trade is hardly a valid way to assess dedication, Ema. After examining body outline or pile of books, ladder or bookshelves, notebook, Sacred Urn, spiral staircase, and suitcase: Dhurke: It seems the orb isn't here. Apollo: That means Datz might be our only lead at this point. Dhurke: Detective Skye said he might still be here in the village. We should try to find him. May 16Kurain Village ???: Good day to you, citizens of Kurain Village! My name is Paul Atishon, and I want your vote! Apollo: Wow, that's REALLY loud. Trucy: Look, something's coming this way. ???: Paul Atishon, savior of Kurain, has come to-- Ahhh! It's you people! Dhurke: Apollo? What is that strange conveyance coming this way? Staff: Right, left, right, left, HALT! Apollo: (It's one of those... what-do-you-call-'ems? Palanquins...?) ???: So, you finally left Dr. Buff's house! What were you doing there?! ...What a bunch of shady-looking characters. Apollo: (And you aren't?) So I take it you knew the doctor? ???: Heh, what a foolish question. I've memorized the names and faces of the entire electorate here in Kurain. After all, I am the man who's destined to be king of this fine nation someday. Apollo: Um... who are you? (And what do you mean, \"king\"?) Atishon: Ignorant fools. I am THE Paul Atishon. I am a soon-to-be eminent politician -- a man whose name will go down in history. You should be ashamed that you've never heard of me before. Dhurke: Is he really that famous of a politician, Apollo? Apollo: Not that I know of. Atishon: I'm running for a seat on the local council right now. Apollo: (I guess even Jerk Q. Public has to start somewhere.) Atishon: But my election is a sure thing, I'm told. After all, my grandfather was a famous politician with untold influence. In short, I'm the chosen one, the golden boy, the powerhouse of politics! Trucy: ...And rider-of-his-grandfather's-coattails. Atishon: Heh heh heh. Are you blinded by my majesty? Go ahead! Bask in the resplendent glory that is me, the chosen one! Apollo: Um... Sure... Atishon: ...Ah! A pleasant day to you, good people of Kurain! I am Paul Atishon! It's time to reclaim the glory of Kurain, together! A convenience store on every corner, a karaoke bar in every home! A vote for Paul Atishon is a vote for a happier, hopey-er Kurain Village! Old Man: Turn off that infernal racket, you fool! You're a stain on your grandfather's good name! Atishon: Thank you, good sir! Your support is appreciated, as always! Trucy: I guess he's one of those people who only hears what they want to hear. Apollo: ...In other words, he's a model politician. Atishon: Now where was I? Oh right, you were in the doctor's house. Just what in the world were you doing in there? Hmm? Talk Paul Atishon Apollo: Is this what you ride around in when you're campaigning? Atishon: That's right. It's perfect for the narrow roads and steep hills here in this village. It has a top speed of five miles per hour, but it suffers from serious reliability issues. (Changed from [It has a top speed of 5 miles per hour, but it suffers from serious reliability issues.] in the original release) Namely, these imbeciles tire out too quickly. Staff: *cough* *huff, puff* We'll try harder next time, sir! Apollo: (Poor guys... They're exhausted and covered in sweat.) Atishon: The Atishon family has been in politics for generations, even back in the old country. Apollo: Really? Atishon: My grandfather, Abe Atishon, was a prominent member of Congress. And he was born right here in Kurain. There isn't a person here who hasn't heard of him. Apollo: (All I asked about was his palanquin.) Atishon: You must've heard of the Atishons. I'm even reviving our old country campaigning style. Apollo: ...Oh, um... politics aren't really my thing. Trucy? Trucy: I don't recall ever reading about them at school. Atishon: Feh... Young people today. You people really need to pay more attention to politics. The doctor's house Atishon: So, what business did you people have at Dr. Buff's house? Apollo: He was going to transfer ownership of the Founder's Orb to us. It's a sacred relic from the Kingdom of Khura'in. Atishon: The Founder's Orb? So you tried to get your hands on it, did you? Apollo: Wait, what do you know about the orb? Atishon: Heh. I know that it's mine, that's what. Apollo: How do you figure that? Atishon: Because I know it's not the Founder's Orb. Its real name is the Crystal of Ami Fey. Apollo: The Crystal of Ami Fey? Atishon: That's right. It's been passed down for generations in the Atishon family. Until it was stolen, that is. But just when I had zeroed in on the culprit... ...the doctor hid it away and then kicked the bucket. Apollo: So you're saying Dr. Buff stole your family heirloom? (That's not what Dhurke said. Strange...) But I've been told the doctor himself said that... ...he had the \"Founder's Orb.\" Atishon: It's all that weird foreigner's doing! He filled the doctor's head with nonsense! Nonsense like the Crystal of Ami Fey being the Founder's Orb. Apollo: \"Weird foreigner\"? (Could he mean...?) Is this the foreigner you're talking about? Present Datz Are'bal profile Apollo: Atishon: Yes, that's him! Apollo: I thought so. (Now we really have to find Datz.) Leads back to Talk options Present anyone else Apollo: Atishon: Who's that? Wait, I know everyone around here, so this must be a new eligible voter for me! Apollo: Yes, wouldn't that be nice. (Because I certainly wouldn't vote for you. It seems this isn't the person he's talking about. But I can't imagine the doctor had contact with that many foreigners way out here.) Leads back to Talk options Datz (appears after presenting Datz Are'bal profile upon selecting \"The doctor's house\" Talk option) Dhurke: Do you know where this man is now? Atishon: I imagine he's at the Detention Center by now. I called the authorities after I found him hiding in my dog's doghouse. Apollo: Whaaat?! Dhurke: That buffoon... Apollo: Well, at least we know where he is now. Dhurke: Let's head over to the Detention Center and see what he knows about the Founder's Orb. Atishon: So, you really are after my crystal. Apollo: No, we're looking for the Founder's Orb, and we have an agreement to prove it. Atishon: Well, just so you know, you're not going to lay a finger on it. It's mine. And I intend to give it to my benefactor. Apollo: Your... benefactor? Your benefactor (appears after \"Datz\") Athison: My benefactor is ready to support my rise to the pinnacle of the political world. They have immense influence here, you see, and I intend to harness that influence. Apollo: So you're just going to give your family heirloom away to this person? Atishon: That's right. It's a purely political decision. Apollo: And in exchange, your patron will get the people of Kurain to vote for you? Atishon: Heh heh heh. Eminent politicians are skilled at leveraging all of their connections. Apollo: ......... (Isn't it illegal to buy votes?) Well, good luck with that, I guess. Atishon: Heh, you just wait. Paul Atishon will reign supreme someday. Present Attorney's Badge Apollo: Actually, I'm a lawyer. Atishon: Heh heh heh. You're so shallow. Relying on your badge to impress people... What would you be without it? I petty men like you have no sense of self. Real men make their own mark in this world. Apollo: (Says the man who's riding on his grandfather's coattails.) Anything else Apollo: What do you think about this? Atishon: Paul Atishon is the \"squeaky-clean candidate.\" So if you're going to bribe me, try to be a little more subtle about it, would you? Apollo: Huh? I wasn't trying to bribe you. Atishon: \"Don't accept any bribes unless they come in unmarked bills.\" This is but a fraction of the political wisdom my grandfather shared with me. Better luck next time. Apollo: (After a spin cycle or two with those bills, I bet I'D be \"squeaky-clean,\" too.) Wright Anything Agency (after examining body outline or pile of books, ladder or bookshelves, notebook, Sacred Urn, spiral staircase, and suitcase in Kurain Village - Doctor's Study, then visiting Kurain Village) Talk Any ideas? Dhurke: About that Paul Atishon fellow... He's aiming to be a councilman and beyond, as his famous grandfather once was, right? No doubt some would vote for him on the merits of his grandfather's achievements. I see a grim future for Kurain Village if someone like that is able to climb the ranks. Apollo: I wouldn't worry about it. Who in their right mind would vote for him with the way he's campaigning? Dhurke: So the more aggressively he campaigns, the less people will want to vote for him? That makes me want to get out there and help him fail. What to do Apollo: We turned the doctor's study upside down, but never found the orb. Dhurke: Yeah, I didn't expect this to be so hard. Trucy: Well, I think it's fun. It's like a big old treasure hunt! Dhurke: That orb is the key to Khura'in's future, you know. Trucy: Yeah, and our office's future, too! Apollo: (She does realize it's not up for sale, right?) Present Anything else Dhurke: Ah, the old show-'em-and-see-what-they-say tactic. I used to try that whenever I had nothing else to say. Apollo: Who says I have nothing else to say? Dhurke: It's written all over your face. Apollo: Like you have anything to add right now. After clearing all Talk options with Paul Atishon in Kurain Village: May 16Detention Center - Visitor's Room Datz: ......... Dhurke: .........Hey. Datz: Yipes! Apollo: What's he doing under the desk...? Datz: Foul cogs of the corrupt regime! I've nothing to say to you! Dhurke: Datz, it's me, Dhurke. Datz: Oh! Dhurke! You're a sight for sore eyes! I knew you'd come save me! Dhurke: Well, this is another fine mess you've gotten yourself into. Datz: Har har har har har! My bad, my bad! 'Least the grub here's pretty good compared to that prison back home! Ya get three squares plus a place to sleep! Why don't ya join me, Dhurke?! Dhurke: No thanks. They'd just send me back to Khura'in where I'd face immediate execution. Datz: Yeah, I guess that wouldn't be such a good idea. Apollo: (Looks like he's still the same, too.) ...Long time no see, Datz. Datz: Huh? Hey, ya look... kinda familiar... A-A-A-Apollo?! Is it really you, m'boy?! A-to-the-J, all grown up and whatnot! How've ya been?! Apollo: Fine. And you, Datz? You look good, besides the incarceration and all. Datz: ...Pffffff! Haaaaar har har har har! Those horns, AJ! Apollo: Horns? Datz: They've grown up with ya, just like a stag's antlers! I can't take it! Apollo: *sigh* You really haven't changed a bit. Anyway, there's something we needed to talk to you about. Datz: Sure, pull up a chair. I've got all the time in the world. The slammer's like my second home. It's really not so bad once ya get used to it. Trucy: He's rather laid back for someone in police custody. Talk About the orb Apollo: Datz, was what the doctor had really the Founder's Orb? Datz: Absolutely positively! The doc was sure of it! Dhurke: Really? Because someone from the village is calling the Crystal of Ami Fey. He also claims you were filling the doctor's head with lies. Datz: That ain't true! The doc said he was sure it was the real deal. All his fancy research confirmed it was the Founder's Orb. Apollo: So then that Paul Atishon character was lying? Imagine that, a politician who lies... Datz: I bet he wants the orb all to himself! Trucy: Hmm... I wonder who's telling the truth? Datz: Well, take a look at this! It proves the doc believed he had the Founder's Orb! Dhurke: Let me see that. \"I agree to hand over the Founder's Orb to the Defiant Dragons... ...if I will come to no harm.\" Signed, Dr. Archie Buff. Datz: See, I got it all down in writing! Dhurke: But Datz... ...why does it say, \"if I will come to no harm\" at the end here? Trucy: Sounds like he was scared of you. Apollo: Datz, did you threaten the doctor in any way? Datz: No, ya got it all wrong! It was the doc's friend! HE told the old man us rebels were dangerous. It's his fault the doc thought I might hurt him! Apollo: Sounds like the work of that politician. He's really made a mess of things. Orb Transfer Agreement added to the Court Record. About the orb (subsequent times) Apollo: Datz, was what the doctor had really the Founder's Orb? Datz: Absolutely positively! The doc was sure of it! Dhurke: Really? Because someone from the village is calling the Crystal of Ami Fey. He also claims you were filling the doctor's head with lies. Datz: That ain't true! The doc said he was sure it was the real deal. All his fancy research confirmed it was the Founder's Orb. Apollo: So then that Paul Atishon character was lying? Imagine that, a politician who lies... Datz: I bet he wants the orb all to himself! Trucy: Hmm... I wonder who's telling the truth? Datz: Well, take a look at this! It proves the doc believed he had the Founder's Orb! Dhurke: Let me see that. \"I agree to hand over the Founder's Orb to the Defiant Dragons... ...if I will come to no harm.\" Signed, Dr. Archie Buff. Datz: See, I got it all down in writing! Dhurke: But Datz... ...why does it say, \"if I will come to no harm\" at the end here? Trucy: Sounds like he was scared of you. Apollo: Datz, did you threaten the doctor in any way? Datz: No, ya got it all wrong! It was the doc's friend! HE told the old man us rebels were dangerous. It's his fault the doc thought I might hurt him! Apollo: Sounds like the work of that politician. He's really made a mess of things. Reason for arrest Dhurke: What have you done now, Datz? Datz: Nothing! I'm innocent, I tell ya! It all started when this dog-faced cop tried to question me! He looked so funny, I started laughing at him. That's when they came after me. But it was hilarious, I tell ya! I mean, a human police dog? How funny is that! Apollo: Right... So what happened after that? Datz: They caught me hiding in a doghouse. Dang pooch ratted me out! I guess that's what I get for laughing at one of his doggy comrades. Apollo: Sounds like the dogs got the last laugh. Dhurke: Datz, weren't you cleared of those jailbreak charges? And your capture by Lady Kee'ra deemed unlawful? Datz: Yeah, but... The cops here don't seem to like me anyway. Apollo: What are the charges this time? Datz: Unauthorized entry, or something like that. They think I'm an illegal alien! And I can't prove otherwise 'cause I lost my passport! Trucy: Is there any way they'd let you go? Datz: Not without my passport... If only I had it! Dhurke, AJ! You gotta find my passport! Apollo: ...All right, we'll find it. (One more thing to add to our to-do list. Now, where might Datz's passport be?) Examine Security camera Apollo: I hate the feeling of being constantly watched. Dhurke: Indeed. Considering my current situation, the less I'm seen, the better. Apollo: Well, it's not like there's an international arrest warrant out for you. Dhurke: True, but I seem to have made quite an international splash with that hijacking stunt. I had to sign a ton of autographs and take a load of selfies before I got to your office. Apollo: Wait, what? Dhurke: Maybe they thought the hijacking was part of some movie's promotion. Guard Apollo: He's completely uninterested in us. Dhurke: That suits me fine. It will only complicate things if I'm recognized. Apollo: Right... You're known as some sort of scary terrorist who fled from Khura'in. Though, in reality, no one would believe you're the real Dhurke of legend anyway. Microphone Apollo: Dhurke, why are you holding that mic? Dhurke: I get this strange urge to speak whenever there's a microphone before me. We, the Defiant Dragons, shall--! Apollo: No, stop! Stop...!!! Present Attorney's Badge Datz: Why, AJ! You've become a fine lawyer in your own right! Apollo: Nah, I still have a lot to learn. Datz: Aw, c'mon, don't be so hard on yourself. If I ever went to trial, I'd definitely want you on my side! Apollo: Knowing you, you'd probably skip town before the trial even started. Founder's Orb or Orb Transfer Agreement Datz: The doc agreed in writing to hand the orb over to me, but he kept stalling, like he didn't trust me or something. Dhurke: That scary mug of yours no doubt frightened him. Datz: Look who's talking! Trucy: Honestly, I think you're both about equally scary looking. Apollo: (Ouch... Both Dhurke and Datz look like they've been stabbed right in the ego.) Anything else Datz: Oh, is that for me!? Apollo: No, I was just showing it to you. Datz: Anything I could use here in the slammer is more than welcome! Apollo: Um, Datz, the guard is giving you some serious side eye. After clearing all Talk options: Datz: Oh! About the orb's whereabouts... Maybe the doc's kid knows something! Apollo: The doctor has a kid? Datz: Yeah... A bit of a shut-in, though. The poor thing's own bedroom has become like a self-imposed prison. Apollo: A shut-in? Sounds like it will be a challenge just to get a conversation going. Guard: Time for your questioning. Follow me. Datz: It must be lunchtime. Today is fried chicken, if I'm not mistaken! Guard: You'll get your lunch IF you behave yourself. Datz: Dhurke, AJ. I'll see ya guys around! Dhurke: Our only lead now is Dr. Buff's kid. But luring a shut-in out is... Apollo: ...Not going to be easy. I know. May 16Kurain Village - Doctor's Study ???: Oh, it's you again. Ema Looking for Mr. Wright? He was just here a second ago. Apollo: He was?! Trucy: What was Daddy doing here? Apollo: Good question. Ema: He said he was looking for something. Apollo: Did he say anything else? Ema: Let me think... Something about how his ride never showed up at the airport. Yes, that was it. Apollo: (I guess Athena really did get lost...) Trucy: But what's Daddy doing all the way out here in the first place? He can't be looking for us since no one told him we'd be here. Apollo: Hmm... Ema: Well, if you're here to take another look around, be my guest. I have other work to do, so if you'll excuse me. Apollo: Of course. Thanks, Ema. Dhurke: First and foremost, we'd better find Datz's passport. We should also have a word with Dr. Buff's child. Trucy: Hey, is it just me... or is there something new in here? Dhurke: ...Oh, you mean that thing? Yeah, we should take a closer look at it, too. Apollo: Let's not forget about Datz's passport. It should be around here somewhere. Examine Suitcase Apollo: Datz's suitcase... Maybe his passport's in there. Trucy: Annggh! It's no good. It's locked tight. Apollo: We should've asked him for the key. Drone Apollo: What's this? A model helicopter? Trucy: Don't you know anything, Apollo? It's a drone! They're all the rage right now. I bet it belongs to the doctor's kid. Dhurke: We need to ask them about the orb's whereabouts. Apollo: Yeah, but luring out a shut-in isn't going to be easy. Any other point of interest Apollo: Nothing new here. Let's go look somewhere else. After examining suitcase and drone: Apollo: What are we going to do about Datz's passport? It's probably right there inside his suitcase, but we can't get it open. Trucy: Why don't I take it over to Datz so he can unlock it? That way, you guys can continue looking for the orb. Apollo: Good thinking, Trucy! Trucy: Okay, here I go! ...Huh? What the...? Hrrgh...! This thing weighs a ton! Apollo: Let me try. ............Jeez, how can a suitcase be so heavy? Is it filled with bricks or something? Dhurke: Knowing Datz, he probably packed his dumbbells in there. It's certainly much too heavy to lug all the way to the detention center. Here, let me take a crack at that lock. Apollo: What, are you going to pick it? *click* *click, click* *click* *click* Dhurke: There you go. Apollo: That was fast. Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha! A lock like that is child's play to me. Especially after all the wrongly imprisoned compatriots I've busted out over the years. Apollo: You've sure seen a lot of action for an ex-lawyer. Dhurke: Aaand here we go. Datz's passport. Trucy: I'll take it over to him. Apollo: Thanks, Trucy. Trucy: No problem! Now you guys enjoy some quality father-son treasure hunting time, okay? See you later! Apollo: (There she goes. I wish she wouldn't make such a big deal out of our little \"family\" situation.) Dhurke: Father-son time, eh? Hmm... Been ages since we've had a father-son talk, huh, son? Apollo: Yeah, well over a decade. Dhurke: So, Apollo, um... how've you been? Apollo: Oh, uh... Fine. I'm fine, I guess. Dhurke: Is that so? Fine, you say? Well, fine is fine by me! Good to hear! Apollo: ...Um, okay. .................. Dhurke: ........................... Apollo: ............ (Umm... So what do we talk about now...?) Dhurke: ...Hm? Get down! Hit the dirt, son! Apollo: Huh? What the--? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! .........Unngh......Oof... ......... Dhurke: Speak to me, son! Say something! Apollo: ......Ooh... Th-that smarts... ???: Youuuu maggots! Whattaya think yer doin', invading Buff airspace?! It'll be a scorching day in Siberia before you get past me, ya yellow-bellied yahoos! Apollo: Whoa! ...It can talk?! What kind of drone is this, anyw... ...AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYY! ???: Drone, nothin'! That's Sergeant Buff to you, soldier! You got that, you lowly grunts?! Apollo: Oww... What the who now...?! Dhurke: Buff? Sounds like the doctor's son is behind the controls. Apollo: He's controlling this thing? Dhurke: Apollo, let's play along for now. At least until we can get the information we need out of him. Apollo: G-Got it. Um... Sergeant Buff? Sarge: Sergeant Buff, sir! You forgot to say, \"sir\"! Ain't you never seen a war movie before?! Apollo: Oh, right. Let me try that again. Sergeant Buff, sir! Sarge: Better. Much better. Now, state your name, unit, and rank, soldier! Apollo: Oh, um, I'm Apollo Justice. I serve at the Wright Anything Agency. And my rank is, um... fledgling lawyer? ...Sir! Sarge: Affirmative, Private Justice. Apollo: P-Private? Sarge: Listen up, diaper baby! Your commanding officer's orders are absolute! Disobedience means a one-way trip to the firing squad! Do I make myself clear?! Apollo: Oh, um... sir! Yes, sir! Sarge: Good, good, we might make a man out of you yet, private! Now for you, Cyclops! Dhurke: Huh? ...Oh, you want my name, unit, and rank, too? Um, I'm Dhurke Sahdmadhi. I command the rebel group the Defiant Dragons, and my rank is... um... leader, sir! Sarge: Excellent! Welcome aboard, Komandir Dhurke! Wait a second! What's with that ridiculous mop you call a head? Soldiers should be clean cut! Dhurke: S-Sorry, but this is my signature look. I'm not going to-- WHOOOOOOOOOA! Fine, fine! I'll get a haircut before we ship out! Sarge: Listen up, you! It's kill-or-be-killed out on that battlefield. No place for leave-in conditioners. All you've got is your life, and you're lucky to have that! Apollo: (He's oddly obsessed with field survival for someone who never goes outdoors...) Dhurke: This is going to be harder than I thought, son. Examine Anything Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Sarge: Don't let me catch you stepping out of line again. Apollo: (...Guess I'd better play along and ask what he wants.) Talk Sergeant Buff Apollo: Um, are you controlling that drone from your room, sir? Sarge: Affirmative! But I can see everything you do from here, so... Teeen-HUT, soldier! Wipe that stupid look off your face! I'm going to whip you sheltered peaceniks into shape! Apollo: (With what? Your \"charming\" personality?) Dhurke: Look, it's got a camera and speakers, too. Sarge: And that's not all, Komandir! With these arms, I can cook and clean, too! Speaking of which... Private Justice! You're on latrine duty! Snap to it, on the double! Apollo: ...*sigh*... As if I don't see enough of the toilet back at the office. Sarge's Drone added to the Court Record. Dhurke: That thing's pretty handy. Us Defiant Dragons could use one of those. Sarge: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Yes, it is a fine piece of hardware, isn't it? I modified it especially for siege defense! Apollo: Siege defense...? You mean how you won't leave your room? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! Sarge: Holing up in a stronghold to defend against an enemy is an age-old military tactic! A timeless strategy still applicable in modern warfare! I hope you're not trying to mock the wisdom of my forefathers! Apollo: I-I... I meant no offense. It was just an observation. Sarge: So the greenhorn who ain't even discharged a firearm's got something to say, does he?! Apollo: S-Sorry, sorry! It won't happen again, sir! Sarge: Darn tootin'. Now, state your intentions, soldier. Sergeant Buff (subsequent times) Apollo: Um, are you controlling that drone from your room, sir? Sarge: Affirmative! But I can see everything you do from here, so... Teeen-HUT, soldier! Wipe that stupid look off your face! I'm going to whip you sheltered peaceniks into shape! Apollo: (With what? Your \"charming\" personality?) Dhurke: Look, it's got a camera and speakers, too. Sarge: And that's not all, Komandir! With these arms, I can cook and clean, too! Speaking of which... Private Justice! You're on latrine duty! Snap to it, on the double! Apollo: ...*sigh*... As if I don't see enough of the toilet back at the office. Dhurke: That thing's pretty handy. Us Defiant Dragons could use one of those. Sarge: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Yes, it is a fine piece of hardware, isn't it? I modified it especially for siege defense! Apollo: Siege defense...?

A timeless strategy still applicable in modern warfare! I hope you're not trying to mock the wisdom of my forefathers! Apollo: I-I... I meant no offense. It was just an observation. Sarge: So the greenhorn who ain't even discharged a firearm's got something to say, does he?! Apollo: S-Sorry, sorry! It won't happen again, sir! Sarge: Darn tootin'. Now, state your intentions, soldier. Location of the orb (appears after \"Sergeant Buff\") Apollo: We had an agreement with your father. He had promised to hand over the Founder's Orb to us. Sarge: What?! Papa promised you that?! Dhurke: He did. But he died before he could tell us where it's hidden. Now we have no idea where it is. Sarge: .................. ...Oh. *sniffle* Apollo: Hm? Sarge: P-Papa... Why...? Why'd you have to die? Dhurke: It was an unfortunate accident. And I'm sorry for your loss. Apollo: If it helps at all, I know how you feel, Sergeant Bu-- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! What'd I do nowww?! Sarge: Y-You insignificant maggot! What would an unseasoned rookie like you know about how I feel?! First I lost Mama... and now I've lost Papa! Apollo: You lost your mother, too? Sarge: She's been gone for some time now. I'm... I'm all alone now. All alone... *sniffle* Dhurke: ...Sergeant Buff, would you tell us a little more about what happened to your mother? Your mother (appears after \"Location of the orb\") Sarge: Mama passed away about six months ago. We were still living in our apartment in the city. Back then, I had yet to engage in my siege defense strategy. Apollo: (In other words, something caused him to withdraw from the world.) Sarge: ...It was arson. It happened so suddenly... and before we knew it, our apartment was a sea of flames. Mama and I were trapped inside. But help never came. So Mama cradled me in her arms... ...kicked out a window... and jumped! Apollo: She did what?! Sarge: She was like a walkin', talkin' medal of valor, my mama was. She delivered me safely to terra firma with a perfectly executed PLF. It's a five-point landing technique used by paratroopers to land safely on the ground. Apollo: (She sounds like a superhero or something.) Sarge: But from that height, she suffered massive injuries in order to protect me. She... She died so that I could live! AHHHHHHHHHHHH! MAMAAAAAAAAAAAA!!! Apollo: I... I don't know what to say... Dhurke: And the person who started the fire? Sarge: He was immediately apprehended. They say he was standing outside laughing while the building burned. Dhurke: At least justice was served. I hope that brought you some solace. Sarge: I've lost both my parents now. You can't possibly know how I feel! *sniffle* *sob* Mama... Papa... Apollo: (Poor kid. It's hard losing both your parents at such a young age. He must really feel alone now.) Dhurke: Apollo... I imagine you know what he's going through. Apollo: I do? Dhurke: The road to recovery begins by talking to someone who's suffered the same hardship. I know you have something that shows you understand. Present Anything (before clearing \"Your mother\" Talk option) Sarge: What insubordination! Apollo: ARRRRRRAGH! Sarge: Petty trinkets have no place in Buff's army, soldier! Now drop and give me twenty! Apollo: (Sheesh... At least let me show the evidence before you shoot it down...) Photo of My Father (after clearing \"Your mother\" Talk option) Leads to: \"Um, sergeant, sir. Would you please take a look at this?\" Apollo: Um, sergeant, sir. Would you please take a look at this? Sarge: What do we have here? Apollo: It's a photo of my father. I wasn't even a year old when he died... in a fire. Sarge: What?! Dhurke: And like your mother, he died in an arsonist's blaze. But in his final moments, he managed to save his infant son. Sarge: P-Private Justice, you've suffered a loss just like mine. Apollo: I have... And that's why I know how you feel. Sarge: B-But... you still have your mother, don't you?! Apollo: No, I lost her, too. Sarge: What?! Apollo: She disappeared after the fire. I don't know if she's still alive or dead. Heck, I don't even know what she looks like. Sarge: Wow... Dhurke: Sergeant Buff, his experience is very much like your own. If anyone can understand the sadness in your heart, it's him. Sarge: Rrrr... Nnngh... .............................. ATTEEEEEENSHUN!!! I salute you, Comrade Justice! You are no longer a private in the Buff Army! Henceforth, you will be a corporal! Apollo: Corporal? Dhurke: Congratulations on your promotion, Corporal Justice! Apollo: ...I'm just glad that seemed to cheer him up a bit. Sarge: Now, comrade, let's toast to your new stripes! And call me Sarge! Don't be shy! We're a band of brothers now! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Dhurke: Now's our chance, corporal! Ask him about the Founder's Orb. Apollo: (Dhurke's getting waaaaay too much of a kick out of this.) Examine Ladder or bookshelves Apollo: Sarge, sir, do you ever read these books? Sarge: Why, of course! Soldiers must have extensive knowledge, as well as fighting prowess. I'm learning all I can each and every day in preparation for the big battle! Apollo: The big battle? Sarge: Um, you know... for when I go back to school. I'll need to be up to date on every subject. Stuff like... y'know, the latest comics and Hollywood gossip... Apollo: Oh, I see... (What about reading, writing and arithmetic?) Well, I'm rooting for you, Sarge! Sarge: Th-Thanks. I'll try my best. Computer Apollo: This computer could provide some useful information. Drat. It's password protected. Dhurke, you're good at getting into places you're not supposed to. Dhurke: Don't look at me. I don't know the first thing about computers. Sarge: Ha ha ha ha ha! Leave it to me! A modern day warrior must be well-versed in technology... and have a mean, mean pride! After all, he who controls information, controls the battlefield! *click clack click clack click clack* Sarge: Aaaaand I'm in! Apollo: Looks like modern day warriors have mean, mean keyboard skills, too. Dhurke: Okay, let's see what we can find. *click clack click clack click clack* Dhurke: Oh, what's this...? An e-mail message? Now this is interesting. It's a research report to whoever asked the doctor to study the orb. Sarge: Here, I put the data on this! Take it and use it well, soldier! E-Mail added to the Court Record. Computer (subsequent times) Apollo: The doctor's computer. It contains an e-mail detailing the progress of his research. Dhurke: I wonder who he prepared the report for. Glasses Apollo: Are these the doctor's? Sarge: Yes, those are Papa's reading glasses. He said he'd been having trouble reading lately. But those glasses seemed to help. Dhurke: Reading glasses, eh? I'll just hold on to these. Apollo: ...Dhurke. Don't tell me you're having trouble reading, too? Dhurke: Perish the thought! ...I-I just don't want to leave any stone unturned. Doctor's Reading Glasses added to the Court Record. Raincoat Apollo: It's a raincoat... Hm...? It's a bit wet, and there's fresh mud on it... That must mean someone wore it recently. Dhurke: Indeed. Maybe even as recently as last night. Apollo: Sarge, did it rain here last night? Sarge: Negative. There wasn't a cloud in the sky. Apollo: Hmm... Then how did this raincoat get all muddy and wet? Sarge: When I saw it last evening, it looked pretty clean and dry to me. Apollo: That means it got like this later at night. Dhurke: Good eye, son. This may very well turn out to be a vital clue. Raincoat added to the Court Record. Raincoat (subsquent times) Apollo: It's a raincoat... Hm...? It's a bit wet, and there's fresh mud on it... That must mean someone wore it recently. Dhurke: Indeed. Maybe even as recently as last night. Apollo: Sarge, did it rain here last night? Sarge: Negative. There wasn't a cloud in the sky. Apollo: Hmm... Then how did this raincoat get all muddy and wet? Sarge: When I saw it last evening, it looked pretty clean and dry to me. Apollo: That means it got like this later at night. Dhurke: Good eye, son. This may very well turn out to be a vital clue. Statue EX-TER-MI-NATE. EX-TER-MI-NATE. DES-TROY ALL HU-MANS. Apollo: What's this thing's problem...? Sarge: It's an OOPArt -- an our-of-place artifact. Papa won it in an online auction. Apollo: An online auction? Sarge: Yes, he said it's an alien weapon that destroyed an entire ancient civilization. Apollo: (...Where do I even start with an explanation like that?) Sacred Urn Apollo: This urn with \"Ami\" painted on it looks really old. But I don't think it's going to provide any info we need. Spiral staircase Apollo: Is your room upstairs, Sarge? Sarge: Yes, it's the one at the end of the hall. Dhurke: What do you say you come out, so we can enjoy a snack together? Sarge: B-But... Dhurke: I promise we won't bite! Sarge: ...............If you insist... ...then I'm not going to talk to you anymore! Dhurke: No, wait! Apollo: Dhurke, you'd better apologize quick. Dhurke: ...I'm sorry for pushing. Sarge: V-Very well. As long as you don't do it again, I'll let it slide this one time. Suitcase Apollo: It's Datz's suitcase. It's full of survival gear and questionable souvenirs. But we already got his passport, so we can leave it be for now. Shoe shelves Apollo: It's a shoe cubby. Hmm, these shoes look like they belong to Sarge and his dad. ...Ah, these boots here are a little damp! Dhurke: And it looks like there's something inside this one. Apollo: Maybe Doctor Buff wore them last night. Dhurke: They might lead us to where he hid the orb. Let's take a closer look. Examine outsole Apollo: There's a question mark on the bottom of this boot. Sarge: Papa had those custom-made for his archeological fieldwork. He had the soul of an adventurer. Dhurke: This boot had the \"sole\" of an adventurer, too. Examine residue on insole (before examining hook-and-loop fastener straps) Apollo: Something's giving off a soft glow inside this boot. But it's too dark in there to see what it is. Examine hook-and-loop fastener straps Apollo: We might get a better look inside if we undid these straps. Examine residue on insole (after examining hook-and-loop fastener straps) Leads to: \"It looks like some kind of glowing moss.\" Apollo: It looks like some kind of glowing moss. Dhurke: It could've come from wherever the doctor went last night. Must've gotten in with some of that mud. Apollo: It might be worth looking into... ...if it'll help us pinpoint where the doctor hid the orb. Glowing Moss added to the Court Record. Shoe shelves (subsequent times) Apollo: There's some glowing moss inside this boot. Dhurke: I'm willing to bet it got there from wherever the doctor went last night. Talk Location of the orb Apollo: Sarge, sir. Do you have any idea where the orb might be? Sarge: It was here in Papa's study until last night. But he said he was going to go hide it somewhere. He mentioned something about a shady character being after it. Apollo: Where do you think he could've hidden it? Sarge: Hmm... Somewhere in the village, I'd guess. He said he'd found a suitable hiding place for it. Apollo: So, it was here last night. That is, until he went out to hide it somewhere in the village. The only question is where? Dhurke: Maybe he left some clue here in his study. Let's search the place again. Apollo: (We should also find out more about Dr. Buff. It might steer us toward the hiding place.) Doctor Buff (appears after \"Location of the orb\") Apollo: So, Sarge, what was your father like? Sarge: Papa was as king as Mama was courageous. His whole reason for moving to the countryside was for me. Apollo: What do you mean? Sarge: I initiated my siege defense strategy after Mama died. Papa was so worried about me, he moved us here to the countryside. He thought the fresh air, blue skies, and natural surroundings might alter my tactics. Dhurke: What a fine father. Sarge: He even quit his position at the university to move here. Apollo: He did? Sarge: He did. He gave up his beloved research position just for me! \"A parent must be prepared to sacrifice everything for his child.\" That's what Papa said! Dhurke: ...Well, I'm feeling about two inches tall right now. Sarge: There's no one in the world I respected more than him. But that just makes his passing all the more devastating. *sniffle, sniffle* Papa, may you continue your beloved research up there with the angels! Present Attorney's Badge Sarge: What's that? Apollo: It's my attorney's badge, sir! Sarge: You mean like a medal?! What act of valor earned you such an honor? Apollo: I rescued my clients from those who would brand them as guilty, sir! Sarge: A heroic act, indeed! Apollo: Thank you for your kind words, sir! (This whole \"sir\" thing is getting real old, real quick.) Photo of My Father Sarge: Corporal Justice... you shoulder a bitter past. Apollo: You've been through quite a lot yourself, Sarge. Sarge: ...Corporal, if I may... um... Apollo: Yes? Sarge: ...Well... um... it doesn't have to be that often, but... W-W-Would you mind coming over from time to time? Apollo: You want me to visit you? Sarge: O-Only if you want to, of course! Apollo: ...Sure. I'll come by, and I'll even bring along my coworkers, Sarge. Sarge: R-Really?! Yaaaaaay! Our band of  brothers continues to grow in rank! Ha ha ha ha! Dhurke: ...Nice work, son. Glad to see you haven't changed one bit. Apollo: (What's that supposed to mean?) Study Photo or Research Notes Sarge: Why...? Why did Papa have to fall in battle? Apollo: (He's putting on a brave face, but he's still just a child.) Sarge: In honor of Papa's heroic sacrifice...  let us march on, comrade! To victory! Apollo: Huh?! I-I mean, sir! Yes, sir! Dhurke: Are you two seriously bent on waging war against that bookcase? Sarge's Drone Apollo: It looks like you can do everything by yourself. Sarge: Indeed! I can even cook and build things whenever I want! Apollo: So there's really no reason for you to leave your room, huh. Sarge: Yes, but there is still one gaping hole in my siege defense. ...Going to the bathroom. Apollo: When nature calls, it's best not to fight it. Sarge: Yes, all great tacticians will say never wage a battle you have no hope of winning. Anything else Apollo: Please take a look at this. Sarge: Let me ask you something, Corporal Justice! How does that aid you on the battlefield?! Apollo: Um, well, if you count the courtroom as a battlefield, it's a fairly useful weapon. Sarge: Good answer! A military man must know his weapons inside and out! Keep up the good work, corporal! Apollo: S-Sir, yes, sir! (I guess that's all he has to say about that.) After clearing \"Doctor Buff\" Talk option and examining computer, glasses, raincoat, and shoe shelves: Apollo: Okay, let's go over what we've learned so far. Wherever it was that Dr. Buff went, he needed a raincoat. And it was somewhere where this glowing moss grows. Any ideas where that might be, Sarge? Sarge: Negative, comrade. I hate to say my intel's a little thin on this one. I've been occupied with my siege defense strategy ever since we moved to the village. Dhurke: Well, son, it seems we have no other choice. We'll have to ask the locals if they know of a place like that. Wright Anything Agency Trucy: Ah! Apollo, Mr. Dhurke! Did you have some quality father-son time together? Talk Any ideas? Dhurke: That poor child... How is he going to survive all on his own? Apollo: Yeah, it's not like he can go out grocery shopping on his own. We should drop off some food later. Dhurke: No, that would only make it worse. We should be encouraging him to come out on his own. Once his food runs out, he'll have to leave the house if he wants to eat. Apollo: Talk about your old-school siege tactics. Sounds more like you want to starve him out... What to do Apollo: Um... Dhurke: Yes? What is it? Apollo: ............ Dhurke: ............ Apollo: (Talk about an awkward silence. I have no idea what to say.) ............ (Yeah... I've got nothing.) Dhurke: Aw, come on, son! Don't tell me you've got nothing! May 16Kurain Village Apollo: Ugh. It feels like somebody's watching me, and it's really creeping me out. Oh, it's just Paul Atishon's campaign posters. When did he put these up? (Whatever. I've got more important things to be paying attention to.) Dhurke: What great weather! It really lifts the spirits. I know! After our little treasure hunt, what do you say we go hunting, son? Apollo: Hunting? We used to do that a lot... didn't we? Dhurke: Just look at that mountain. I bet there are some feisty wild boars up there! Apollo: I... think I'll pass... but thanks. Dhurke: Oh, so hunting's a no-go. Um, well... I guess that wild boar stew will have to wait, then. .........Hm? Apollo, something seems different from the last time we were here. Apollo: Uh... You mean the posters? Dhurke: No, not those. Apollo: (What's he talking about...? Guess I should take a look around myself.) Examine Paul Atishon campaign posters Apollo: When did Paul Atishon have a chance to put up all these election posters? Old Man: That fool keeps stickin' 'em on our houses! He's a disgrace to his distinguished heritage! Apollo: He's doing this without permission? Fey Manor Apollo: A thatched roof... First time I've ever seen one in real life. Dhurke: It looks just like the traditional thatched roofs they use in Japan. All we need now are some samurai with topknots, a few ninjas, and a cuddly mascot. Apollo: When was the last time you were in Japan? Bus stop Apollo: (A phone booth and a bus stop made of wood. They both look really old. You hardly ever see phone booths in the city anymore.) Dhurke: Apollo... what's this glass box for? Apollo: (I guess you hardly see them in Khura'in, too.) Mountains Dhurke: Seeing those mountains really takes me back. I remember when we used to live high in the mountains to escape from the government. Apollo: So, you don't live there anymore? Dhurke: Nope. I needed a more convenient place to lead the revolution from. But that old mountain hut is still there. Apollo: (Man, I miss that hut...) Dhurke: What, are you getting homesick, Apollo? You can come on back to Khura'in anytime, you know? Apollo: N-No, no, I'm fine. Besides, I've got a lot on my plate here... Kurain Boulder Apollo: There's a big boulder towering into the sky over there. According to the sign, it's called the \"Kurain Boulder.\" It also says that a spirit dwells within it. Hmm... A rock with a spirit in it? Dhurke: It's called animism -- the belief that spirits dwell within inanimate objects. They've probably enshrined this boulder as a sacred object. Their tradition of worshipping such objects is similar to our tradition in Khura'in. Apollo: I-Interesting... (Who knew Dhurke could make sense every once in a while?) Canvas Leads to: \"What do we have here?\" Apollo: What do we have here? It looks like an unfinished picture... like something a little kid might paint. Dhurke: Hmm, you're right. But I can't quite tell what it's of. Apollo: I think it's supposed to be nighttime, but what's that thing on the left? Dhurke: Um... A monster, or some kind of alien, perhaps? In any case, it's a pretty poor excuse for a drawing. Apollo: Well, what did you expect from a little kid? ???: A... little kid...? Apollo: Huh? Oh, it's you, Pearl! Pearl: Why, Mr. Apollo, is that you? What a pleasant surprise! It's been quite some time. How have you been? Apollo: Fine, thanks. You're looking good, too, Pearl. Dhurke: Aren't you going to introduce me, son? Apollo: Of course. This is Pearl Fey. She's a spirit medium here in Kurain Village. Pearl, this is Dhurke, my umm... client. Pearl: Hello, sir. Pleased to meet you. If there is anything I can do to help, please let me know. Dhurke: Nice to meet you, too. And what a polite little girl you are! Pearl: ...Um, actually... I'm a high schooler. Dhurke: Whoops! Sorry about that! So, you're a spirit medium? Does that mean you can channel spirits, then? Pearl: Yes. I'm still in training, though. But I'm well-versed in the art of spirit channeling. Dhurke: Well now, isn't that something! I mean, back in my country, our little princess hasn't channeled a single spirit yet! Pretty impressive, young lady! Pearl: Oh, but compared to Mystic Maya, there is so much more I must learn! Apollo: Mystic Maya? Oh, right, Maya Fey... Mr. Wright's former courtroom assistant. He told me all about her. She's a spirit medium, too, if memory serves. Pearl: Yes, she's an amazing medium. And soon, she'll be the next lead of the Fey clan, too! Apollo: (Mediums and spirit channeling... I've heard all about it from Mr. Wright. He said that mediums will even physically become the person they're channeling. I wonder if even little Pearl would turn into a hulking giant if she hand to channel one...) Pearl: I hope you don't mind me asking, but what brings you all the way out here, Mr. Apollo? Apollo: Oh, just a small matter to take care of. Pearl: ...Wait, would it happen to be the matter Mr. Edgeworth is looking into? Apollo: Prosecutor Edgeworth? What's he doing here? Pearl: Oh, so it's a different matter, then? Because I just saw him a moment ago. He appeared to be searching for something. Apollo: Oh? Hmm... (Mr. Edgeworth is a friend of Mr. Wright's, and the district's chief prosecutor. Why would HE be here in Kurain? Well, no point obsessing over it.) Come to think of it, you live here in Kurain Village, don't you, Pearl? Pearl: Yes, I was born and raised here. Dhurke: This is perfect, Apollo. Let's ask the young lady if she knows where the doctor might have gone last night. Apollo: I was thinking the exact same thing. (Maybe I should show her what we found in the doctor's study.) Examine Paul Atishon campaign posters Pearl: Honestly! Why does he keep putting these up? And on people's houses, no less! Apollo: That's got to violate some campaigning law or something... Here, Pearl, I'll help you take them down. Apollo: Whew... Why did he have to put up so many... Pearl: Yeah... And it won't be long before he puts more up. It's really driving me crazy. Dhurke: Why don't you scribble something on them? You know, just some harmless graffiti? Pearl: ...Actually, that's just what I was thinking when I was sketching. Apollo: ...Why don't you join us for lunch at the office sometime? It'll get you away from all this. House Pearl: This is Fey Manor. Mystic Maya lives here. I hope she's doing well... Apollo: (Oh right. Ms. Fey's off studying and training in Khura'in.) Mountains Apollo: There's a lush, green mountain in the distance there. Pearl: It's home to a variety of animals. They sometimes come down to the village. I've seen foxes, badgers, and even bears. Apollo: B-Bears? Dhurke: Well, one would certainly never go hungry around here. Pearl: The poor animals! They are not for hunting or eating! Understand?! Dhurke: But badger and bear meat are so good... Canvas Dhurke: This picture looks like something you might've painted when you were little, son. Apollo: I think I would've done a little better than this. Pearl: ......... Canvas (after perceiving) Apollo: On closer inspection, there's more to this picture than meets the eye. Dhurke: Son, didn't you ever learn that honesty is the best policy? Apollo: Way to go, Dhurke! I was trying to get us out of the hole we dug ourselves into earlier! Talk Kurain Village Dhurke: What a peaceful place. Ahh... Nothing beats mountain air. Pearl: Many of the villagers have left for the city, but I just love it here. Blue skies, lush forests, star-filled skies at night, and fireflies in the summer. Plus, the big, beautiful, blue ocean is just beyond that mountain! Dhurke: The ocean?! What do you say we go for a swim, son? Apollo: ...Oh, um... I think I'll pass. (Besides, I can't swim.) ...Um, Pearl? Kurain Village is like, \"the home of spirit mediums,\" right? Pearl: Yes, and I'm a part of a long line of mediums. Apollo: I've never seen a channeling before, but... ...is it possible to channel the spirit of anyone who's passed away? Pearl: No, not just anyone. You must know their face and true name. Apollo: Really? You can channel a spirit just by knowing their face and name? That's an amazing ability. Pearl: It is, but it can only be learned by those with a gift occurring in certain bloodlines... ...and years of intense training. At present, Mystic Maya and I are the only ones in our village who can channel spirits. Dhurke: Looks like spirit mediums are highly valued here, much like they are back in Khura'in. Pearl: I heard there used to be many more of us a long time ago... ...but now, we are in very short supply. Most of the women nowadays don't want to stay; they want the thrill of the big city. Apollo: Yeah, well, you guys aren't exactly close to any shopping malls or nightclubs out here. But what about you? Are you NOT interested in things like that? Pearl: W-Who, me? Well, I... I wouldn't mind a new outfit or two, and, well... Oh, never mind. Apollo: It's okay, Pearl. You are at that age, after all. Paul Atishon (appears after \"Kurain Village\") Apollo: Oh! We met this weirdo earlier named Paul Atishon. Do you know anything about him? Pearl: Yes, he's been campaigning a lot around here lately. And the noise he's been making has become quite a problem. People are especially upset that he's campaigning at all hours of the night and day. Dhurke: Hmm, well... The local police should arrest him for disturbing the peace. Pearl: Unfortunately, there's little they can do because the Atishon family is so powerful. Apollo: (...Well, isn't HE the proverbial pampered provincial prince.) He seems pretty intent on winning here in Kurain. Is there some special reason why? Pearl: I'm not sure, but I have an idea. The spirit mediums of Kurain once held considerable sway in the political world. Judging by his slogan, maybe that's what he's after. Apollo: Great, so he's just another politician seeking powerful connections... Dhurke: The ability to commune with the dead gives comfort to those anxious about the future. Tiny Khura'in has preserved its independence by the queen's power of spirit channeling. It must play a similar role in this village. Pearl: Yes. Even today, many here revere those with spirit medium blood flowing in their veins. Apollo: So basically, as Paul Atishon's benefactor goes, so goes the whole village? (Who is this benefactor? Who could hold this much sway over Kurain Village?) Where the doctor went (appears after presenting Glowing Moss) Apollo: Pearl... Do you have any idea where Dr. Buff might've gone last night? Pearl: Umm... Well... Apollo: ......... Pearl: ...Uhh, about that... ...All I know is Dr. Buff was somewhere on Mt. Mitama. BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: ...! (My bracelet...! It's reacting! Which means Pearl is hiding something from me.) Present Bracelet Pearl: All I know is Dr. Buff was somewhere on Mt. Mitama. Percieve twitching left thumb on \"Mt. Mitama.\" Apollo: Apollo: Pearl, you seem anxious around the topic of Mt. Mitama. I could tell because you'd rub your thumb over a splotch of dried paint as you said it. Pearl: Oh! U-Um, well...! Apollo: That nighttime painting is yours, isn't it? Pearl: .........! ...This is so embarrassing. As you saw, I'm not a very good artist. But that picture has nothing to do with Dr. Buff! Apollo: I'm not so sure about that. In fact, I'm going to guess that while you were out here painting last night... ...you actually saw the good doctor heading out to Mt. Mitama from the bus stop. Pearl: N-No! I-I didn't see anything like that! I swear! Apollo: ...No, I'm positive you saw the doctor. After all, he's right here in your picture. Present human-like figure Apollo: Leads to: \"Y-You think that's the doctor?\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: See? Isn't the doctor right there? Pearl: Really? That doesn't look like him to me. Apollo: Well, I guess it IS pretty abstract. Pearl: Oh... Is it really that hard to make out? Er, what I mean is, it has nothing to do with Dr. Buff! After all, I never even saw him that night! Leads back to: \"...No, I'm positive you saw the doctor. After all, he's right here in your picture.\" Pearl: Y-You think that's the doctor? I may not be a very good artist, but at least I know how to draw a person! Apollo: Okay, if this isn't a person, then what is it? Pearl: Er... Th-That's a... a rain spirit! Apollo: ......... Pearl: .................. Apollo: ...Um, and what's a rain spirit doing at a bus stop? Pearl: Oh, umm, rain spirits have places to go, too! Apollo: ........ (This is getting ridiculous.) Sorry, Pearl, but you're not a very good liar. That is Dr. Buff, and this piece of evidence proves it! Present Raincoat Apollo: Leads to: \"This is the raincoat we found in the doctor's study.\" Present anything else Apollo: Pearl: The only thing I'm guilty of is being a terrible artist. But you're taking advantage of that to claim the picture is something it's not! Apollo: N-No no, it's... (...totally like that, but...) Pearl: That isn't a person! It's a rain spirit, I tell you! Apollo: No, Pearl, that isn't a rain spirit. Leads back to: \"That is Dr. Buff, and this piece of evidence proves it!\" Apollo: This is the raincoat we found in the doctor's study. It's still wet and muddy, so we know that someone wore it last night. Now, let's see how this pattern is the same as the \"rain spirit\" in your picture? Pearl: ...Ah! Apollo: You didn't see a rain spirit last night. You saw Dr. Buff wearing this raincoat! Pearl: Ah! ...I... I'm sorry. I know I'm not supposed to lie, but... Leads back to Talk options Percieve wrong area Apollo: Apollo: Pearl, you seem uneasy about something. Pearl: Anyone would feel uneasy being stared at like that! Apollo: Huh? But I...! Dhurke: I'd be unnerved, too. I mean, your eyes are practically popping out of your head. Apollo: I-I get it. I'll tone it down a little. (Guess I was wrong.) Leads back to Talk options Where the doctor went (after perceiving) Pearl: I'm sorry I didn't tell you before, Mr. Apollo, but I did see the doctor last night. Apollo: It's all right. Just, please, tell me everything you know. Pearl: ...Of course. I was painting out here last night... when the doctor came up to the bus stop. He was wearing a raincoat, even though it wasn't raining, and a helmet with a light on it. Apollo: Sounds like he was well-prepared for something. Pearl: I know. That's why I asked him if he was going off exploring again. He looked startled, like he hadn't noticed me there. And then, he suddenly said... \"Please don't tell anyone you saw me here.\" Apollo: Why would he want to silence you like that? Dhurke: Something must've happened to spook him. And he didn't want anyone to know where he was going to hide the orb. Apollo: But where could he have been going dressed like that? Pearl: My best guess is a cave somewhere on Mt. Mitama. I heard there's a cave there where mediums of the Kurain tradition went to train long ago. Legend has it, there are some sort of mystical ruins in there. Apollo: Mystical ruins? Sounds like the exact sort of place an archeologist might go. Present Attorney's Badge Pearl: Hee hee. Seeing you present your badge like that... ...reminds me of when I used to investigate cases alongside Mr. Nick. Apollo: You used to help Mr. Wright all the time, I hear. Pearl: That I did! Doing so helped me expand mu horizons beyond this tiny little village. So please, Mr. Apollo! If there's anything I can help you with, you just let me know! Apollo: I will. (What I'd really like is her help with cleaning the office again.) Glowing Moss Apollo: Pearl, do you have any idea where this moss might grow? Pearl: That looks like... Mitama Moss. It grows on Mt. Mitama, and gives off a soft glow in the dark. Apollo: Mt. Mitama? Pearl: See that mountain over there? That's Mt. Mitama. Dhurke: And how would one get there? Pearl: You can take a bus from that bus stop over there. ...Um, may I ask why you're so interested in that moss? Apollo: Well, Dr. Buff was supposed to give us something. But it seems he hid it somewhere last night. Pearl: H-He did? Maybe that's why he, um... Apollo: Pearl? Do you know something that might help us? Pearl: Um, well... Apollo: (Sounds like I'd better find out what she knows.) Anything else Pearl: Oh, um... Sorry, I wish I could help, but... Apollo: No, don't worry about it! I'm sorry I wasted your time like that. Pearl: Um... At least let me offer you some tea. I mean, you must be tired from all your investigating. Pearl: Oh, no, you don't have to do that. We'll be just fine, thank you. (She's so polite, it's hard NOT to feel rude around her.) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: Well, we should get going now, but thanks for all your help, Pearl. Pearl: You're welcome, Mr. Apollo. Please take care. Dhurke: What do you say we go find that cave, son? I sense that the orb might finally be within our grasp. Apollo: This treasure hunt is shaping up to be the real deal. Dhurke: Hah hah hah. Really gets the blood pumping, doesn't it?! Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go! May 16Mt. Mitama - Cave Entrance Apollo: Whew, I'm all out of breath. Dhurke: Aw, come on, that was nothing. And you're so much younger than me. Apollo: I, uh... *huff* *puff* ...don't normally get this much exercise... *cough* *sputter* Dhurke: Need a break? Apollo: N-No, I'm fine. *huff* *puff* Dhurke! Look! There's Mitama Moss growing in that cave over there. Dhurke: This must be where the doctor was last night. Let's take a look inside. May 16Mt. Mitama - Cave Apollo: ............ I can't see a thing. Dhurke: Relax. Your eyes will adjust eventually. Now, follow me. Apollo: I-I really think we need a flashlight, Dhurke. Dhurke: Should've brought one along then, son. ???: ...Here, use mine. Apollo: Thanks! Wait, were you holding out on me? Dhurke: Um... who are you talking to, Apollo? Apollo: ...You...? Whoa! (Someone just pushed me!) Dhurke: Apollo? What the--?! Apollo! Ah... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Apollo: Oww... Dhurke: Are you all right, son? Apollo: Y-Yeah... Looks like someone got the drop on us. Dhurke: Quite literally. Apollo: But who--? I mean, we could've died from that fall! Dhurke: I don't know... Hmm... But I don't think we'll be getting out the way we came in. Looks like we're in a pretty deep cave. Nothing to do but press on, son. Apollo: How can you even see in here? Dhurke: ...Come on, let's go. Apollo: H-Hey, wait! (One false step and we're dead... What in the world should we do...?) Wait here Apollo: How about we wait for help to come? Dhurke: And how are we to call for said help, hmm? Apollo: With my phone, obviously. I'll just-- Argh...! Of course we're in a dead zone... *sigh* Dhurke: Guess that's that. Apollo: (Just great...) Leads back to: \"What in the world should we do...?\" Go forward Leads to: \"I guess we keep going.\" Climb back up Apollo: Let's try climbing back up. Dhurke: Can you even see the wall in front of you? Apollo: ...No... Dhurke: Well, I can tell you it's far too steep. Apollo: You never know until you try! Here goes nothing! Hrrrgh... Annngh... Dhurke: Your loud voice may move mountains... ...but you've barely moved an inch, son. Apollo: (Argh!) Leads back to: \"What in the world should we do...?\" Apollo: I guess we keep going. There must've been some path for Dr. Buff to follow when he came to hide the orb. Dhurke: Right. By the way, it looks like our attacker left us with this useful parting gift. Apollo: From lawyer to spelunker... How do I always get myself into these situations...? We're never going to make it out alive, I hope you know. Dhurke: Don't tell me you're scared, son. We're just getting started. The greatest treasures are only ever found at the point of a blade, or the edge of a cliff. Apollo: Yeah, sure... If I'd known I'd wind up at the bottom of some dark, damp cave... ...I would've never taken your request, Dhurke. Dhurke: Save your breath, Apollo. Just keep putting one foot ahead of the other. Apollo: There'd really better be a way out of here. Dhurke: We'll find one before you know it. You'll see. .................................................................. May 16Mt. Mitama - Cave Apollo: *huff* *puff* We've been walking for over an hour. It's like a maze in here. I couldn't go back to where we started if I wanted to. Dhurke: Y-Yeah... This cave goes deeper than I thought. Apollo: Wait, don't tell me there really is no way out... Dhurke: ...Where there's a will, there's a way. Apollo: Ever the optimist, aren't you... (Maybe we should cut our losses while we still can...) Forge ahead Leads to: \"Even if we were to turn back, we wouldn't make it up that wall of solid rock.\" Turn back Apollo: I seriously think we're going to get completely turned around if we go any further, Dhurke. I mean, we don't even know if there's a way out up ahead. Dhurke: But we DO know we can't climb up that wall. Apollo: Yeah, but... Dhurke: I still know the way back from here. Don't worry, son. We can always go back there any time we want. Apollo: I-If you say so. (Famous last words if I've ever heard some...) Leads back to: \"Maybe we should cut our losses while we still can...\" Put my foot down Apollo: I'm not taking another step, Dhurke! Dhurke: Come on, now... Be reasonable... Apollo: No! I'm done, and that's final. Dhurke: I remember when you used to throw tantrums like this. Apollo: W-Well, I'm not a child anymore! Dhurke: There, there! It's okay. Daddy'll buy anything you want once we get home, son. Apollo: (...I'd better quit while I still have some manhood left to salvage... But it doesn't seem like Dhurke's about to quit any time soon. Even still...) Leads back to: \"Maybe we should cut our losses while we still can...\" Apollo: (Even if we were to turn back, we wouldn't make it up that wall of solid rock. So, I guess we keep going.) ............*sigh* How did I get stuck wandering around in a dark cave again? It's definitely not in my job description. Dhurke: Heh heh. Listen, son. Only the truly accomplished have the luxury of being so choosy. When I was just starting out, I did everything from street performing to yak milking. Apollo: And... that helped you become an accomplished attorney, how? Dhurke: It didn't. But when you need to make a living, you'll take on any job just to survive. ...Say, how IS your career going, by the way? Apollo: Well, it's been a harrowing adventure so far, to say the least. My first trial really put me through the wringer. And my next case had me investigating a pair of stolen panties. And just when I was hitting my stride, this one prosecutor branded me as \"Herr Forehead.\" Oh, and there's this other, ridiculous prosecutor who wields a samurai sword. Dhurke: ...Sounds like you've, um... seen quite a bit. Apollo: You're telling me. Dhurke: ...Listen, Apollo... I'm, uh, I'm sorry I didn't contact you for so long. Apollo: ............It's fine, Dhurke. What happened, happened. Dhurke: ...Hm? Careful, the ground doesn't feel as solid here. Apollo: What? Yikes! The cave floor's collapsing! Dhurke: Argh! Not agaaaain! Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH! May 16??? ???: Hey, Apollo. Can you hear me? Apollo: ...Unngh. (.........Dhurke?) Huh? Where are we? Whoa! What is this place?! Dhurke: I was shocked, too. These ruins look really old. Apollo: It's not exactly something you'd expect to find in the middle of a cave system, that's for sure. Maybe the doctor hid the orb here? I mean, those look like footprints over there. Dhurke: Son, I think our little adventure is about to pay dividends! Time to find that orb! Examine Plastic bottle Apollo: What's a plastic bottle doing here? Dhurke: There's seaweed stuck to it, which means it probably came from the ocean. Hmm... It's possible this cavern is connected to the sea somehow. Driftwood Apollo: Driftwood? How'd that get in here? Dhurke: By drifting on in, I'd assume. The only question is, from where? Cavern wall near stone altar Apollo: So that's the hole we fell through. Doesn't look like we'll be going back that way. We're lucky we survived the fall from way up there. Dhurke: Indeed. If that hole hadn't been above the lake, we'd be history. You passed out the moment you hit the water. Apollo: Yeah, well, water's not really my thing. Dhurke: Hmm, this cavern is solid rock all around. Looks like we either go back through that hole... ...or find some other way out. Apollo: Ugh. Why am I always between a rock and a hard place? Stone altar Apollo: It's a big stone altar. One false move, and some god might come and smite us. Dhurke: Oh, come on. It's not all doom and gloom. Apollo: ...I dare you to look at our surroundings and say that again, Dhurke. Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! You've got me there, son. Apollo: (Dear gods, please smite me now.) Water Apollo: This lake looks really deep. I can't even see the bottom. (A bottomless lake in the depths of a mountain cave system. My blood runs cold at the thought of falling in there.) Dhurke: The water... It's salty. This lake may very well lead to the ocean. Apollo: Didn't Pearl mention something about the ocean? ...Like how it's on the other side of the mountain? Can't imagine she meant it literally. Footprints Apollo: These have gotta be the doctor's footprints. They match the bottoms of the boots we saw in his study. Dhurke: So he made it all the way down here. Hmm... The water's washed and most of them away, but his footprints are everywhere. Apollo: Really? 'Cause these are the only sets I see. Dhurke: He must've been looking for something. ...Ah. Those prints... They're coming out of that lake. Apollo: Hey, you're right. But that would mean Dr. Buff came walking out of the water. Box on altar Apollo: This box looks pretty new. I'm guessing... the doctor's the one who brought it down here. Dhurke: It's no good. It's locked tight. Apollo: There's no way to open it? Dhurke: Doesn't look like it. There isn't even a keyhole. Which means... there must be a trick to opening it. We'll have to figure it out if we want to see what's inside. Talk Any ideas? Apollo: I wonder what this place was for before it was... well, ruins. Dhurke: I'm guessing it was a place for spirit mediums to perform their rites. But earthquakes and the changing landscape eventually buried it. Apollo: If you're right, that would mean that it hasn't been used in ages. After examining cavern wall near stone altar, water, footprints, and box on altar: Dhurke: Let's sum up what we know so far. The orb is almost definitely inside this box contraption that we can't open. As for this cave, there doesn't seem to be any way out. Apollo: Nnrgh... We're THIS close to the orb... Dhurke: Aww, come now, son. Don't be like that. It's just a bit of bad luck. That's all. Apollo: A bit? Murphy called. He wants his law back. Dhurke: What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger, right? Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (How can he laugh at a time like this?) Dhurke: We're stuck here for now, so we might as well try to open this thing. Apollo: Okay, let's see what we're dealing with. Examine button Apollo: There's a big button here. ...Huh. Nothing happened. Examine pictures Apollo: This thing is covered with pictures. And, hey! Each section also rotates! Dhurke: Take a look at this, son. See the picture of a dragon battling a tiger? And this green and purple one... ...is of a Khura'inese butterfly and a mitamah. Apollo: ...I wonder if they're clues for figuring out how to open this box. After examining button and pictures: Dhurke: It appears this box uses a picture-based combination lock. We'll have to arrange the pictures on each side in the correct sequence. Apollo: Let's see... There's the dragon and tiger fight, a Khura'inese butterfly with a mitamah... Dhurke: ...And a number of pictures, too. Apollo: Dhurke, I was thinking... Maybe we should check the evidence we've collected so far. I think we have something that just might help us open it. Dhurke: You read my mind, son. Apollo: I think this will help us open the puzzle box. Present Research Notes Apollo: Leads to: \"Dr. Buff's research notes mention the Song of Ceremony.\" Present anything else Apollo: Dhurke: I don't see how that would help us. Apollo: Really? (Guess that wasn't it.) Dhurke: There's a dragon and tiger fighting, and a Khura'inese butterfly with a mitamah. We've gotta have something related to those things, don't we? Apollo: Hmm... Leads back to: \"I think this will help us open the puzzle box.\" Apollo: Dr. Buff's research notes mention the Song of Ceremony. Maybe its lyrics and the pictures on the box correspond somehow. Dhurke: I think you're on to something, son. Apollo: Okay, let's give it a shot. Each dial has six pictures... ...and there are four dials in all. The box should open once the pictures are arranged in the right order. Funky puzzle box... here comes Justice! Input tiger and dragon picture on top row, Khura'inese butterfly and mitamah picture on middle-top row, praying people and Holy Mother picture halves on middle-bottom row, and Holy Mother's spiritual blessing picture on bottom row Leads to: \"It opened!\" Input any other combination Apollo: It won't open. Dhurke: Maybe the pictures aren't in the right order. The case should open if the pictures are arranged properly, but... Apollo: I know. I should carefully consider which part of the song corresponds to which picture. Apollo: It opened! So this is the Founder's Orb... Dhurke: We did it, son! The orb is finally ours! Founder's Orb updated in the Court Record. Dhurke: At last, the Founder's Orb is ours! And it's all thanks to you, son! Well done! Then again, I'd expect nothing less from my boy! Apollo: Oh, uh, ha ha. It's no big deal. Dhurke: Don't sell yourself short! You may think it's nothing... ...but your insights and reasoning led us here. And I'd say that's truly impressive! Apollo: I don't know about that, ha ha ha. Dhurke: All those battles you fought in the courtroom have shaped you into the man you are today. And I couldn't be prouder! Apollo: ...W-Will you cut it out, already? (...Before I turn into a sun-ripened tomato.) Dhurke: With this orb, I can finally deliver a fatal blow to the Ga'ran regime. Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: So, how exactly do you plan on using it? You're not going to try to become a spirit medium, are you? Dhurke: Don't be ridiculous. I don't need supernatural powers like that. Apollo: So then, are you going to use it as a bargaining chip with Queen Ga'ran? Like demanding she abolishes the Defense Culpability Act? Dhurke: Well, the thought had crossed my mind, but... ...the main thing is returning this to the Kingdom of Khura'in. After all, as a sacred relic of Khura'inism, that is where it belongs. Apollo: Really? That's all you wanted to do? Dhurke: Mm-hm. Because my true objective has always been... ...to find out who asked Dr. Buff to study it and why. Apollo: I'm not sure I follow. Examine Box on altar Apollo: That was one fancy puzzle box. Dhurke: The fact that he chose to use such an elaborate box... ...makes me think that Dr. Buff must've had a rather playful side to him. Apollo: I can almost imagine him saying, \"Go ahead. Open it if you can.\" Talk The orb's significance Dhurke: The official story is that the orb was stolen from the Tehm'pul Temple treasure room. Apollo: Yeah, I heard about that on the news. They also said your group was behind the theft. Dhurke: That's not good... We're probably on an international most-wanted list now. ...Let me ask you something, Apollo: Who do YOU think really stole the orb? Apollo: Umm, I really haven't a clue. Dhurke: Well, I think it was one of the royals. Apollo: Really? Someone from the royal family? Dhurke: Yeah, and I've got a pretty good idea which one it was. Apollo: (He knows who it is?) Care to share your hunch? Dhurke: All I'll say at this point is this: Security is pretty tight, but the royals have unfettered access to the treasure room. Plus, they seem to be turning a blind eye to the orb's loss. Apollo: But why would a member of the royal family do that? Dhurke: ...That, I haven't figured out yet. But whatever the reason, it can't be good. I mean, a Khura'inese royal stealing a national treasure of such religious significance? And then pinning the crime on us, the Defiant Dragons? Apollo: Sounds like a conspiracy or something. Dhurke: I agree. And if the truth were to come to light, it would be a scandal of epic proportions. To allow a foreign national to study a treasure so sacred that it's off limits to the public... It would be seen as an utter sacrilege to those who truly revere the Holy Mother. Apollo: So if this were to go public, support for the Ga'ran regime would weaken. Dhurke: But that's not all. This is just a hunch, but I believe there's something even bigger here. Something that would explain why the orb was being studied in the first place. Something that would shake the Kingdom of Khura'in to its very core. And I'm going to find out what. Apollo: (.........He's probably right. His intuition is usually spot on.) Dhurke, why are you so bent on revolution, anyway? Is it to reform the legal system in Khura'in? Dhurke: There's that. But I'm  also doing this for my children... I want to save Nahyuta. Apollo: What do you mean? Dhurke: ...This is for your ears only. It's the other reason why this revolution needs to succeed. Nahyuta (appears after \"The orb's significance\") Apollo: Nahyuta... I never thought that our reunion would take place in a courtroom. Dhurke: Oh, so you've run into each other already. Apollo: Yeah, but it was like he was a different person. He used to be such a kind, cheerful kid -- always smiling and stuff. But now... He tried to convict Trucy for a crime she didn't even commit. Plus, he kept telling me I had a \"putrid mind\" and to \"let it go, and move on.\" Dhurke: Has it really gotten that bad? It must be Ga'ran's influence. He wasn't like that when he first stepped into the courtroom. Back then, he still had a keen sense of justice. \"I vow to bring the Ga'ran regime down and reform the legal system.\" Dhurke: That's what he swore to do... but that was also five years ago. He'd been the shining star of the Defiant Dragons, and our greatest hope. Apollo: Wait, Nahyuta was a Dragon? Dhurke: He was. But these days, he's more like Ga'ran's lapdog. Apollo: Talk about a complete about-face. Why would he do that? Dhurke: Something must have happened to him. Something that sparked a radical change. Still... I don't think he truly believes in the new path he's taken. It's not conviction that fills his heart; it's resignation and despair. Apollo: I-I see... Dhurke: ...The only thing I know for sure is... Nahyuta is suffering... and he is suffering in silence. Apollo: Nahyuta... is suffering...? Dhurke: Yes. He knows the rightful state of Khura'in's legal system... ...but something forces him to bend to Ga'ran's will, and it's tearing him apart. Apollo: But it's been five years. Do you really think he even still wants to reform the legal system? Dhurke: ...As long as he carries what I've taught him in his heart, I do. Dhurke's teachings (appears after \"Nahyuta\") Leads to: \"\"A dragon never yields.\" ...That's what you always told us.\" Present Founder's Orb Dhurke: The orb is ours at last! Apollo: I'm just glad we were able to make what you said in your broadcast a reality. Dhurke: Me, too. I didn't want to admit it before, but I was starting to have second thoughts about making such a big, bold move. I kept thinking, \"What would happen if we failed to get the orb?\" Apollo: Just another example of how a bluff can be the starting point in the quest for the truth. Dhurke: And what a hard-won truth it was. But I couldn't have done it without you, son. Apollo: \"A dragon never yields.\" ...That's what you always told us. Dhurke: That I did. It's a belief I've held since back when I was lawyer. [sic] The dragon stands at the pinnacle of the natural world. Nothing and no one can bend its will. Apollo: That's why we lawyers must pursue the truth like an unyielding dragon, right? We must fight for truth to the bitter end, no matter what it takes... (Dhurke and Mr. Wright... they have that much in common.) Dhurke: That's why I've held onto this badge, even though there are no more lawyers in Khura'in. I believe that one day, our legal system will return to its former glory. And this badge here is a testament to that belief. Apollo: ...Hmm... I wonder if Nahyuta still believes in what you taught us? Dhurke: He does. That much I'm sure of. A dragon never yields. Dhurke: I know that belief is etched deep in his heart. ...I'd bet my life on it. After all, he is my flesh and blood! Apollo: ............ (This unshakable faith and confidence... It's what draws people to him, whether they like it or not. ...Even people like me.) You know, I remember back when we were kids... ...Nahyuta used to say with great pride, \"I have the blood of the dragon within me.\" Dhurke: Yes, and that's why I want to free him. Free him from the poisonous clutches of the Ga'ran regime. Apollo: So that's your other reason for starting a revolution... Dhurke: Yes. I need to smack some sense into that boy of mine. I mean, what else are fathers for? Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: ...I... I wouldn't know.) Dhurke: Now that we have the orb, on to the next problem -- getting out of here. Apollo: Well, we're not going back the way we came. That's for sure. That hole we fell through is way too high to climb back up to. Dhurke: Actually, I have an idea. That lake water tastes salty, which means it must connect to the ocean. Apollo: W-Wait a second. You're not suggesting we SWIM our way out of here...? Dhurke: That's exactly what I'm suggesting. Apollo: But we have no idea how deep that lake goes. It's pitch black down there. Dhurke: Not a problem. Apollo: How is that not a problem? I mean, how do you even know if there's really a passage to the ocean? Dhurke: Well, one of us has to try, and I'm the better swimmer. Time's a wastin'! I'll be back before you know it, son. Apollo: Dhurke! ...He's gone. I sure hope he knows what he's doing. May 16Mt. Mitama - Kurainese Ruins Apollo: ......... (It's been twenty minutes. I hope he's okay.) What's going on? Uh-oh. Th-The water...! It's rising! And fast! Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! (N-Need... air...) *cough* *sputter* *cough* *cough* ...Ahhh! I don't know how to swim! If I don't grab onto something that floats...! .................. *cough* *sputter* *cough* *cough* ...This is bad! I-I better think of something -- quick! Examine Plastic bottle Apollo: Hey, maybe I can use this like an oxygen tank! ...Wait, what am I thinking?! I need to stay calm and be more rational about this! Driftwood Apollo: I've got it! As long as I hold onto this, I should be able to stay afloat! Stone altar Apollo: This is not good. The water's almost up to the top of the altar. It won't be long before it reaches the roof of the cave. Box on altar Apollo: The puzzle box is still at the base of the altar. It must've been designed to stay put, even at high tide. Wait, that's it! Dr. Buff must've gotten in here from some ocean-side entrance at low tide. That's why his footprints were leading OUT of the lake. So it really DOES connect to the ocean. Not that that helps. I'd drown before I made it out. Top of cavern Apollo: Nnrrgh... It's no use! The hole's still too high up! I'll have to find another way -- and quick -- before I drown! After examining plastic bottle, driftwood, box on altar, and top of cavern: Apollo: The water won't stop rising! Aaaah! I-I'm getting swept away! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh! Please...! STOPPPP! Examine Plastic bottle Apollo: If only that bottle were a little bigger, it'd store that much more air... No, it wouldn't make that much of a difference... I need to stop with these harebrained ideas, and come up with a real way to escape! Cavern ceiling Apollo: The water's almost to the top now. At this rate, I'll run out of breathing room! I'm a goner if I don't find a way out quick! Hole in cavern Leads to: \"The water's just high enough for me to reach the hole!\" Apollo: The water's just high enough for me to reach the hole! I'm saved! All I have to do is go back the way we came! The water might even lift me all the way back up, over that wall of rock! Here goes! ...Huh? The hole! It's full of rubble. The tunnel collapsing above must've filled it in after we fell through it. Nngh... This... This can't be happening! No, I can't give up now. I refuse to die here! Th-The water...! I can't--! *cough* *sputter* I can't... I can't... breathe... .................. (Is this... the end?) .................. (Dhurke... I wonder if he made it out.) .................. (So this is what it feels like to drown. I would've eaten that sushi if I'd known it would be my last meal. ...I feel like I've been through this before. ...Ah, now I remember. It was back when all three of us were living in that shack in the mountains. Nahyuta and I were playing by the riverside when we got swept up in the rapids.) Apollo: AAAAAAHHH! Nahyuta: AAAAAAAGH! Apollo: (I thought we were goners, but then...) Dhurke: Nahyuta! Apollo! Hold on! I'm coming! Apollo: ...*sniffle*... *sniffle*... *sniffle*... Wahhhhh!!! Nahyuta: Waaahhhh!!! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! That was a close one! Thought I'd lost you two! Apollo: I-I'm sorry, Dhuuuuuuurke! Dhurke: All right, that's enough now. Didn't I teach you that boys don't cry? Nahyuta: ...Thank you, Father. Apollo: *sniffle* *hiccup* *hiccup* Nahyuta: You... You could've been killed... But you risked your life... to save us... Why...? Dhurke: What a silly question. What father wouldn't risk his life to save his own children? Nahyuta, Apollo... Don't you ever hesitate to call when you need me. Understand? Apollo: ...Hey Dhurke? This isn't forever, right? You'll bring me back from America someday, right? Dhurke: Of course... I'll come pick you up as soon as things settle down here. Promise. Apollo: Okay! You promised! Apollo: ...Dhurke. I waited and waited. For the day you'd come and take me home. But you never came. That's why I tried to forget about you... ...and my life back in Khura'in. ...Dhurke... Why...? Why... didn't you...? .................. ..................... ???: A... ...lo... A... pol... lo...! Apollo! Can you hear me?! Apollo: *cough* *sputter* *cough* .........D-Dhurke? Dhurke: Still can't swim, eh? Apollo: You... You came back? But why? Dhurke: I said I'd come for you, didn't I? Apollo: Yeah... But you can't hold me and swim...! We're both going to...! Dhurke: Stop talking. You'll bite your tongue. Apollo: What? Whoa whoa whoa! (We're being pulled under! What's going on?! Why is this happeniiiiing?!) .................. May 16??? Apollo: *cough* ...Uuuuugh. Wh-Where...? ???: Ahh, you finally came to, son. Dhurke: Get your fill of seawater? Good thing your name's not Neptune, huh! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: D-Dhurke... Datz: Har har har har har har! You're telling me! Check it out, snot's coming out of his nose! Trucy: What a miraculous escape! Not even some of the escape-artist greats could pull that off! Apollo: ...Wh-What on earth happened? Dhurke: Sorry it took me so long, son. I made it to the ocean, but I figured you still couldn't swim. So I found a local fisherman and had him take us out near the undersea cavern. He tied a rope to me, and I came and grabbed you. Then he yanked me back. Apollo: Oh, so that's what pulled us under with such force. Trucy: Don't forget about me! I assisted in your escape act, too, Polly! Dhurke: I've helped compatriots escape from all sorts of places -- mountain jails, island prisons... But an undersea cavern? Now that was a first! Apollo: ......... (Dhurke... He risked his life for me.) .........Dhurke. I'm only alive because of you. ...Thank you. Dhurke: Oh, uh... Y-You're welcome. I, uh... just did what any father would do for his son. Apollo: (.........He saved my life yet again.) *growl* ...Um... Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! I guess seawater doesn't make for much of a meal! Trucy: It's 'cause Polly didn't have any sushi! Apollo: (Oh, yeah. I haven't eaten anything since this morning.) Datz: ...Oh, that's right! Hey, AJ! Dhurke had me buy this for ya. Apollo: ! Dhurke: Thought you might be hungry. Ready to have some this time around? Apollo: .........Yeah. Thanks! *chomp* *nom nom nom* Oh wow, this is delicious! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Glad you approve! I'd better get some before you eat them all! *chomp* *chew chew chew* Apollo: (Just like old times. Dhurke used to slice up the fish he caught, and we'd all eat fresh sashimi together. He used to talk about all the vitamins and minerals packed in the raw fish.) Datz: *chomp* *munch munch munch* Hey, by the way! Lemme see that orb, AJ! Apollo: Here you go. Datz: Hoa, so that's what it looks like! Trucy: You found the legendary treasure! Nice work, Polly! Apollo: Thanks. ...Guess you could say, mission accomplished! Dhurke: With the orb, our revolution can take a big step forward. Let's celebrate the eve of our revolution! We'll all get dressed up and feast till dawn! Datz: Yeah! Now you're talkin'! Time to party! Apollo: ......... (After all that? I just want to go to bed. Sure wish Nahyuta was here. Maybe one day, we'll enjoy times like these together again. ...The revolution. If it can bring back those happy days... ...you can sign me up for--) ???: Sorry to interrupt your little party, but I'm here for my crystal. Staff: Right, left, right, left, HALT! Apollo: Ah! It's him again! Atishon: Heh heh heh. Well done. Then again, I always knew you could do it. After all, we politicians must be excellent judges of character. Still, I'm impressed you both made it out of there alive. Apollo: ...W-Wait a second. YOU'RE the one who shoved us into that pit? Atishon: It sounds so bad when you say it like that. All I did was give you a little nudge in the right direction. Dhurke: ...So... it was you... ............................................................... You no good, son of a--! Atishon: ...EEP! D-Don't look at me like that! The Crystal of Ami Fey is mine! Now, hand it over! Dhurke: Over my dead body! Atishon: EEK! Detective! Help! Ema: Yeah yeah, I know. Apollo: Ema? What's going on here? Ema: He filed a police report. He claims you're trying to steal his family heirloom. Atishon: Th-That's him! The one with the long hair! Arrest him this instant! He's the thief that made off with the Atishon family's most precious heirloom! Ema: Well, I suppose I should ask you to come in for questioning. Dhurke: Down at the police station? I... think I'll pass. After all, Mr. Atishon seems bent on having me arrested on theft charges. Apollo: (This is not good! If Dhurke gets arrested, he'll be sent back to Khura'in to face execution!) Ema: Sorry, but now that I know you have the crystal, or orb as you call it, I must insist. Will you please come with me, sir? Apollo: Apollo: Ema! I'm afraid I can't let you take Dhurke in! He received the orb from Dr. Buff in a perfectly legal transaction. Ema: Is that so? Can you prove it? Apollo: Of course. This should sufficiently prove that the orb now belongs to Dhurke. Present Orb Transfer Agreement Apollo: Leads to: \"Take a look at this agreement.\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: Look at this! It's proof that the orb is Dhurke's. Ema: Umm... All this proves is you're completely our of your mind. Apollo: Oops... (I guess that wasn't it.) But the doctor definitely transferred it over to us. Leads back to: \"This should sufficiently prove that the orb now belongs to Dhurke.\" Apollo: Take a look at this agreement. Ema: What do we have here? Let's see... \"I agree to hand over the Founder's Orb to the Defiant Dragons if I will come to no harm.\" Hmm... It appears to be a perfectly legal agreement. Atishon: Not so fast! That's not the Founder's Orb! It's the Crystal of Ami Fey, which means their agreement is null and void! Ema: Hmm, this is going nowhere fast. Apollo: You can say that again. ???: Then it will just have to go to trial. Right, Apollo? Apollo: M-M-Mr. Wright? Trucy: Daddy! Phoenix: What's with you two? You look like you just saw a ghost. Apollo: (...Oh yeah. Ema mentioned she had seen him around.) ...Um, what're you doing in Kurain Village, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Mr. Atishon has retained me as his lawyer. Apollo: Wait, you're his... lawyer? Examine Mountains Apollo: You can see Mt. Mitama from here. We're lucky we found the Founder's Orb, and even luckier we got out of there alive. I hope I never have to go through anything like that again. Talk Legal advisor Apollo: Mr. Wright, why are you serving as Mr. Atishon's lawyer? Phoenix: Because he hired me. He needed my help in getting a family heirloom back from Dr. Buff. And it seems he correctly foresaw that something like this might happen. Atishon: It's because those shifty insurgents were harassing poor Dr. Buff. So I knew I might need a lawyer if things went south. I figured with a celebrated lawyer like Phoenix Wright, I couldn't go wrong. Apollo: Is this what you came back from Khura'in for, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: It was just good timing. My work over there just happened to wrap up, so here I am. Plus... Mr. Atishon is a very important client. Apollo: (They know each other? But I've never heard Mr. Wright mention his name before.) The Crystal of Ami Fey Apollo: Mr. Wright, are you sure this is Mr. Atishon's family heirloom? Phoenix: That's my client's assertion. He says it's the Crystal of Ami Fey. Apparently, it's the crystal she once used when channeling spirits. Apollo: Who's Ami Fey? Phoenix: She brought Khura'inese channeling to Japan, and her descendants brought it here. Her true origins are still rather murky... ...but what's clear is she is the founder of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Apollo: Oh, so she's like the one they call the founder in Khura'in -- the Holy Mother. Present Anything Phoenix: I'd think you would have more pressing things to ask me about. Apollo: Y-Yeah... (I'd better ask what I can while I can.) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ...Apollo, I don't plan to betray my client's confidence. I may not know all the facts yet, but I do know we won't be handing the crystal over to you. Apollo: What? Are you saying...? Phoenix: .................. I'm really sorry it's come to this, but... Apollo: Mr. Wright? I don't understand. Phoenix: Let me spell it out then. If you continue to claim that the crystal belongs to your client... ...then I will be seeing you in court. Apollo: Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! Trucy: ...Wh-What's gotten into you, Daddy? Phoenix: Nothing. This is strictly business. Atishon: Heh heh heh. Two lawyers from the same firm facing off? What are the odds! Lucky for me, I believe I have the \"right\" man for the job! What ever are you going to do? Remember, he IS your boss. Apollo: Ngrrrgh... (How did it come to this?!) M-Mr. Wright! Please! Don't do this! Phoenix: Apollo, there's no point in arguing about it here... ...when it's now clear we're headed to court. That's where we'll find out who the crystal really belongs to. Apollo: (I don't believe it. Am I really going to face Mr. Wright in court?) Trucy: Daddy! Apollo! No! We can't have our agency's talent competing against each other! Phoenix: It's too late, Trucy. The die has been cast. We each have to fight for our clients' best interests. Trucy: B-But... Phoenix: So, what's it going to be, Apollo. Are we going to have to take this to trial? Apollo: (I have to battle Mr. Wright in court? THE legendary Phoenix Wright? No matter how many trials of his I've watched... ...no matter how dire the situation, he's always pulled out a win in the end. Can I do it? Can I really take on the man whose footsteps I've been following in...? I owe it to Dhurke to at least try. I... What should I do?) Battle Mr. Wright Leads to: \"There's no turning back now.\" Throw in the towel Apollo: (I can't do this. I mean, how can I go up against a man like him? I couldn't possibly win! ...But do I really want to give up without a fight? If I do, I'll be forever walking in his shadow! Plus, I'd be letting Dhurke down! And I can't let that happen!) Leads to: \"There's no turning back now.\" Apollo: (There's no turning back now.) If it's a trial you want, Mr. Wright, I'm more than happy to oblige! I'm ready to fight for my client... ...even if it means facing off against you! Phoenix: .................................... .................. ...All right. I won't be pulling any punches, either, Apollo. The kid gloves are officially off. May the best attorney win. Apollo: You got it! Trucy: Whoa whoa whoa! First Daddy, now you! Polly! You're not seriously... Apollo: ...Sorry, Trucy. But I have to do this. Phoenix: .................. Apollo... All right, then, I'd better go prepare for tomorrow. See you in court. Trucy: Daddy, no! Wait! Dhurke: A fine mess I've gotten you into, son. I mean, of all the lawyers we could've faced, it had to be him? He's practically a celebrity in Khura'in now. They're calling him the Fighting Phoenix. Apollo: ...I-I'll be fine! (After all, I've come a long way, too! Who knows? I could even end up winning. There's always a chance...... right?) Dhurke: You know, this may be a blessing in disguise. If the trial proves what we found is indeed the Founder's Orb... ...then whoever asked Dr. Buff to study it may be revealed, too. This is our chance to finally pull them out of the shadows! Apollo: ...The first step of your revolution, huh? Dhurke: Yes. The revolution to restore Khura'in to its former glory, and save Nahyuta's soul! Apollo: Dhurke... I swear to fight as hard as I can in court to make that a reality. We're going to win this one. You'll see. Dhurke: I know you can do it... son. Apollo: (It doesn't matter that I'll be going up against Mr. Wright. I have to win this for Dhurke... ...and for Nahyuta. His salvation, along with all of Khura'in, depends on it!) To be continued Nothing to examine during investigation Apollo: Nothing particularly interesting here. Area already examined Apollo: We've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around. Nothing to examine during fingerprinting session Apollo: Doesn't look like there are any prints here. Examine insignificant area on evidence Apollo: (Nothing particularly interesting here.) Consult (while opening puzzle box) Apollo: Hmm, this is harder than I imagined. I thought all we had to do was arrange the pictures according to the song. Dhurke: It's times like these you have to think outside the puzzle-box. Sometimes the truth can only be found when you look at things from a different angle. Apollo: A different angle? (Come to think of it, one of the pictures from the song is missing. Does this mean the pictures don't line up exactly one-to-one?)

Apollo: Message received, loud and clear. Trucy: Good, because I don't like this one bit! You and Daddy should be on the same team! Apollo: S-Sorry, Trucy... (Wow, she's really mad.) Dhurke: I'm sorry, too, little lady. This is all my fault. Trucy: I'm just worried things will never be the same between Daddy and Apollo... ...if they go through with this. Dhurke: Is that all? Well, I wouldn't worry about that. That's the way it is with us men. We may fight, but we don't burn bridges. Trucy: Really? Dhurke: Sure. One minute we're trading blows, and the next, we're having drinks together. We're simple creatures at heart. Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Trucy: I sure hope you're right... Athena: Sorry I'm late, Apollo! Apollo: Athena! There you are! What happened with you and Mr. Wright yesterday? Athena: O-Oh, about that... I ended up going to the wrong airport. I was waiting there, thinking his flight was really late... and before I knew it, I dozed off. By the time I woke up, it was already dark. Apollo: I figured something like that had happened. Being late and dozing off are the two things you do best. Athena: Ugh. Guilty as charged. Apollo: So then, I take it you have no idea what today's case is about? Athena: Not a clue. Sorry... Um, what IS today's case about, if I might ask? Another locked-room mystery? A suspect with a flimsy alibi? Ooh, or a dying message? Apollo: Sorry, strike three, you're out. It's a civil case. Athena: ...A civil case? Apollo: You act like I'm speaking Swahili here. Athena: It's just, the Wright Anything Agency specializes in criminal law, or so I thought. In civil cases, there are no prosecutors, right? Instead, both parties retain an attorney. Apollo: Right. And the other attorney is someone you know very well. Athena: Really? Who? Bailiff: The trial will begin shortly. Please proceed to the courtroom at once. Apollo: (...Okay, let's do this!) Athena: Apollo, wait. Who's the other attorney? And where is Mr. Wright? Apollo: No time to explain. Let's go. Athena: O-Okay! Right behind you! May 17, 10:30 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 6 Judge: Court is now in session. Oh, um... Uh, is this some sort of practice session? A mock trial, perhaps? Apollo: Um... no. No, it's not, Your Honor. Phoenix: It's the real deal, Your Honor. Judge: Hmm... So then you two have had a falling out? I won't have you use my courtroom for that, you know! Apollo: I-It's nothing like that, Your Honor! Phoenix: Exactly. It just so happens that we have different clients in this case. Judge: I see... Well, here's to hoping this has no adverse effect on your working relationship. Athena: You can say that again! I had no idea we'd be going up against the boss today! Ugh... You sure this is a good idea, Apollo? Apollo: ...What? Do you want to switch sides? Athena: Honestly, I'd rather be anywhere but here right now. Apollo: (Well, at least she IS here. I'm really going to need her help.) Phoenix: ...Mr. Justice. Apollo: Yes?! Phoenix: Don't expect me to pull any punches just because you're the opposing lawyer. As I said, the kid gloves are off, and come what may, they'll stay off. Apollo: ...Same here, Mr. Wright! If it's a fight you want, it's a fight you'll get! Phoenix: .................. Apollo: .................. Athena: Yeesh, you guys are really chomping at the bit, aren't you? Judge: Hmm... I don't mind a good fight between co-workers. Just keep this civil case civil. Now then, if the plaintiff would take the stand, we may begin. Staff: Right, left, right, left, HALT! Atishon: Noble judge, members of the gallery! Good day to you! I am Paul Atishon! This is but the start of my epic campaign! And you all have the honor of witnessing it! I believe the youth of this country are our very future. Too long have they been looked down on and given the cold shoulder! So, to them I say! Ask not what you can do for your country! Ask what you can do for me! Judge: M-Mr. Atishon! What is that crazy contraption you're riding in?! Atishon: Heh heh heh. It's my custom-made, election-winning campaign mobile. Beautiful, isn't it? Judge: You're at a witness stand, not a campaign podium. So come out of there this instant! Atishon: Feh... Judge: All right. Now, would the plaintiff's attorney, Mr. Wright... ...please explain the complaint filed against the defendant. Phoenix: Mr. Atishon's complaint against the defendant is simple. The defendant, one Dhurke Sahdmadhi... ...stole my client's family heirloom -- the Crystal of Ami Fey. Mr. Atishon merely seeks its return. Atishon: This wouldn't have happened if that archeologist hadn't kicked the bucket. Judge: ...I see. Well, Mr. Justice, let's have your opening statement, if you would. Apollo: The defense asserts the item in question is the Founder's Orb, a sacred relic from Khura'in. Judge: Hmm... Go on. Apollo: It seems someone asked an archeologist -- Dr. Archie Buff -- to study the orb. Dr. Buff determined that it was a Khura'inese national treasure known as the Founder's Orb. The very orb that was stolen from a treasure room in Khura'in several weeks ago. Judge: Why yes, I saw a news report about that! The theft of a Khura'inese national treasure caused quite an uproar in the kingdom. Apollo: Well, we believe it was not, in fact, a theft in the traditional sense. But rather, that it was spirited out of Khura'in by someone for Dr. Buff to study. Judge: You don't say... And...? Apollo: Around that time, an acquaintance of the defendant learned of Dr. Buff. He made contact with the doctor, who agreed to hand over the orb. Apparently, the doctor wanted nothing to do with it once he'd learned it had been stolen. Judge: Hmm... It seems you even have a transfer agreement between both parties. Apollo: Mr. Sahdmadhi also agreed to return the Founder's Orb to the Kingdom of Khura'in... ...once the doctor verified it was the real thing. Judge: I see... So this dispute centers on... ...whether the item is the Founder's Orb or the Crystal of Ami Fey. That, in turn, will determine the object's rightful owner. Apollo: (I'd better bring my A game. Going up against Mr. Wright won't be a walk in the park.) Judge: Hmm... Come to think of it, the name Dhurke Sahdmadhi sounds awfully familiar. But I can't recall where I've heard it. Apollo: ...Oh. umm, it's probably your imagination, Your Honor. He's just a tourist, after all. Judge: Hmm... My imagination, you say? Athena: Are you sure about this, Apollo? He's a wanted criminal in Khura'in, isn't he? Apollo: ...In Khura'in, yes. Here, he's just a tourist. Judge: Very well, let's begin the proceedings. Bailiff, would you bring in the first witness? Apollo: ...Ema? Ema: Show some manners. We're in court. Apollo: I know, it's just... This is a civil trial, so I was surprised to see a detective take the stand. Phoenix: I had her do some digging on Dr. Buff. Apollo: (What for?) Ema: You disappoint me, Apollo. First, you know I'm not just a detective. I'm a forensic scientist. Do try to remember that. Second, you owe Mr. Wright an apology. After all he's done for you, you have some nerve! Apollo: First, I'm sorry. And second, I'm really just trying to do my job. Ema: You'll never get anywhere with that attitude. Take some advice from someone who's been there. Apollo: Why do I feel like I'm on trial here? Judge: Detective Skye, your testimony, if you please. Witness Testimony -- The Doctor's Dark Secret -- Ema: The police have had their eye on Dr. Buff for some time. And just today, a number of stolen artifacts were discovered in his study. Among them were a priceless urn and a statue that were stolen from the Fey clan. It seems the doctor would do anything to study artifacts, including steal them. As for the relic at the center of this dispute, he likely stole it from the Atishon residence. Apollo: The doctor... is a thief? Why am I just hearing about this now? Ema: Well, \"cat burglar\" isn't something he'd put on his résumé. He was more careful than that. But the fact is, he was a classic treasure hunter. Athena: A treasure hunter, huh... Like people who have thrilling adventures in exotic places, risking life and limb for glory? Apollo: I doubt Dr. Buff was the star of his own hit movie series, Athena. Phoenix: Out of respect for the dead, I will say that Dr. Buff wasn't doing it to get rich. Apparently, he only wanted to borrow artifacts to study them. He would then return them as soon as his research was finished. Ema: According to the doctor's child... ...he would even repair or restore some of the artifacts he stole before returning them. He believed he was honoring the dead by discovering their history through artifacts. But whatever lofty ideals he had, it makes no difference. Larceny is larceny. Judge: Yes, he certainly sounds no different than a regular thief to me. Apollo: So, let's say for a moment that the doctor really did moonlight in stealing artifacts... Might he not have stolen the Founder's Orb in Khura'in and brought it back here himself? Phoenix: Nope. There's no records of him traveling overseas over the past few years. Plus, he couldn't very well leave his reclusive child at home all alone. Judge: Hmm... Then this really must be the Crystal of Ami Fey. Phoenix: Yes. He stole it from the Atishon residence, probably so he could study it. Apollo: ......... (This is the left hook I did not need.) Athena: I bet you never saw that coming, Apollo. Apollo: Yeah, when Mr. Wright said the kid gloves were off, he wasn't kidding. Phoenix: ......... Judge: Mr. Justice, you may proceed with your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- The Doctor's Dark Secret -- Ema: The police have had their eye on Dr. Buff for some time. Press Apollo: Apollo: How exactly did Dr. Buff arouse the suspicion of the police anyway? Ema: Chalk it up to good, old-fashioned sleuthing. After investigating countless artifact thefts over the years... ...the police finally zeroed in on him, and the doctor became their prime suspect. Phoenix: A number of those artifact thefts occurred in Kurain Village, too, if I might add. And they started right around the time the doctor moved there. Apollo: But he was never arrested. I take it there was nothing concrete linking him to a crime? Ema: No. Which is why we were never able to get a search warrant in the first place. It's hard to arrest artifact thieves unless you catch them red-handed. Still, the police had him under constant surveillance. Ema: And just today, a number of stolen artifacts were discovered in his study. Press Apollo: Apollo: Are you sure these allegedly stolen artifacts are the real deal? Ema: They're not fakes, that's for sure. Take the urn, for example. Apparently, it's an extremely intricate work of art. Its design, cracks, and other features would be impossible to replicate perfectly. Phoenix: Actually, I've had a few run-ins with that urn myself. So I was shocked to see it there in the doctor's study. I can say without a doubt, that that urn was stolen from the Fey clan. Apollo: I-I see... Judge: Detective Skye, please continue your testimony, if you would. Ema: Among them were a priceless urn and a statue that were stolen from the Fey clan. Press Apollo: Apollo: Were any other stolen artifacts found besides those belonging to the Feys? Ema: Yes. For instance... Remember the large relief on the wall? It was chiseled out some ancient ruins in the Kingdom of Khura'in several years ago. Apollo: Ch-Chiseled out...? Didn't that damage it? Ema: Well, he did restore the parts that were so faded you could barely see them anymore. It seems he intended to return it someday, so one could say his intentions were good. But good intentions are no get-out-of-jail-free card. That's a fact. Phoenix: If I might add, with respect for the deceased... ...the quality of the restorations was apparently exceptional. It seems the doctor invested a lot of money in hiring an extremely talented specialist. Athena: He sounds like a good man... who took a wrong turn somewhere. Apollo: (I guess Sarge takes after him in that way.) Ema: Any further questions? If not... Ema: It seems the doctor would do anything to study artifacts, including steal them. Press Apollo: Apollo: Had these alleged thefts been going on for some time? Ema: At least five years, as far as we can tell. All the recent thefts had been local... ...but before moving to Kurain Village, he had been stealing from ruins around the world. Apollo: (Dr. Buff was an international criminal?) Ema: This data lends itself to but one conclusion: Dr. Buff was a thief. Ema: As for the relic at the center of this dispute, he likely stole it from the Atishon residence. Press Apollo: Apollo: You claim he stole a family heirloom from the Atishon residence. But claiming something doesn't make it true. Ema: Unfortunately, it IS true. Apollo: How can you be so sure? Ema: A police report was filed concerning the theft -- one year ago, in fact. Apollo: What?! A whole year ago? Ema: August 25 of last year, to be exact. The report state, and I quote... \"The Crystal of Ami Fey was discovered to be missing... ...from the Atishon storehouse at 10 AM. The storehouse lock had been picked. Signed, Paul Atishon-Wimperson.\" Judge: Well, a year-old report certainly lends the the plaintiff's claim credence. The doctor could really have stolen the Crystal of Ami Fey. Phoenix: Not only that, Your Honor... ...but the Founder's Orb was only found to be missing several weeks ago. That is nearly a year after the crystal's theft was reported. Therefore, I believe we must consider the orb and the crystal to be two separate items. Apollo: ......... Athena: Paul Atishon-Wimperson? Not the most awe-inspiring tail end, is it? I see why he cut it. Apollo: Not that he inspires confidence without it. Still, I'd probably do the same in his shoes. Robbery Report added to the Court Record. Press (subsequent times) Apollo: Apollo: This police report say say the \"Crystal of Ami Fey,\" but... ...how do you know it's this relic right here? Ema: Because Mr. Atishon has stated as much. Apollo: (...Well, I'm not buying it.) Athena: Apollo, I was thinking... The plaintiff's legal name is pretty distinctive. Paul Atishon-Wimperson... Do we have any evidence related to his initials or his name? Apollo: We just might. It might even point out a flaw in something Ema said. Athena: You think her logic's faulty? Apollo: Yeah. If the doctor stole the relic from Mr. Atishon... er, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson... ...then there's one thing the doctor did that doesn't make any sense. Athena: Especially if Paul Atishon-Wimperson was desperately searching for his stolen relic. Apollo: (Okay, time to go over the evidence again.) Present E-Mail (after pressing fifth statement) Apollo: Leads to: \"The doctor stole the relic from the plaintiff?\" Before pressing fifth statement Athena: The trial's barely started and we're already backed into a corner. Apollo: To make matters worse the judge seems to agree with the plaintiff's case. But we've still got to give it our all. After pressing fifth statement Athena: A police report was filed about the crystal's theft a year ago. Apollo: But the theft of the Founder's Orb was only reported a few weeks ago. So the crystal's report was filed way before the orb was found missing. Athena: That suggests the stolen relic is the Crystal of Ami Fey, as Mr. Atishon-Wimperson asserts. Hmm... I doubt the police report is a fake. After all, Ema is the one who submitted it as evidence. Apollo: (Still, I feel like something we learned in the police report is important somehow...) Apollo: The doctor stole the relic from the plaintiff? Are you sure? Because that statement doesn't agree with a certain piece of evidence. Ema: What do you mean? Apollo: Take a look at this. Ema: What about it? Apollo: This contains an e-mail from the doctor's computer. Judge: ...E-mail? In that little piece of plastic? ......... I'm afraid I don't understand. Apollo: Oh, umm... This stick here can store all sorts of computer data. Judge: I still don't get it. Apollo: H-Here, just look at this! Apparently, the doctor was reporting his research findings to a certain individual. Now, take a look at this. It's the police report that Detective Skye presented to this court. You can see the plaintiff's legal name on it. Paul Atishon-Wimperson. Judge: I can see why'd he drop \"Wimperson\" from his name, but that's hardly breaking news. Apollo: Look closer, Your Honor. Phoenix: .........Ah! H-His initials! Apollo: Right. The plaintiff's full legal name is Paul Atishon-Wimperson. Now consider this... The e-mail's recipient address starts with three letters. Ema: P-A-W...? Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Don't tell me--! Apollo: Oh, but I will anyway. The individual who hired the doctor to study the disputed item... ...is none other than Paul Atishon-Wimperson. Ema: Wait, th-then that means... Apollo: Exactly. He wouldn't have asked the man who stole his family heirloom to study it. Therefore, how could this possibly be the Crystal of Ami Fey?! Ema: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! ...We never checked the doctor's e-mails. We couldn't even figure out the password to his computer. Apollo: The plaintiff willingly left the orb in the doctor's care so he could study it... ...at the behest of his \"benefactor\"! Ema: ...Wait. Then what about the police report? I have all the details of the theft right here! Apollo: It's probably for another relic -- the real Crystal of Ami Fey. He's just using the report as a way to claim that our orb is actually his stolen crystal. Phoenix: Phoenix: And how are you certain that \"PAW\" refers to my client's initials? Maybe the e-mail's recipient was a dog lover. Apollo: Perhaps. So let's get to know your client a little better, shall we? Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson! Atishon: Feh. I suppose shutting down detractors is all part of a politician's job. Apollo: Answer me this, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson: what is... Your shoe size? Apollo: What's your shoe size? Atishon: How should I know? Apollo: Wait, you don't know your own shoe size? Atishon: I have all my shoes handcrafted in Italy. And the shoemaker comes to my residence to take the necessary measurements. I have better things to do than memorize trivial information like that. Apollo: (Makes we wish I'd memorized the Italian for \"entitled jerk.\") Judge: Maybe this will help you memorize what happens to those who waste the court's time. Apollo: (I really put my foot in it this time.) Athena: Apollo, no matter what his shoe size is, there wouldn't be enough digits. We're looking for a three-digit number. Apollo: Oh, right. Let's see... Leads back to: \"Answer me this, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson: what is...\" Your favorite food? Apollo: What's your favorite food? Atishon: Curry rice. It's an old family favorite. Apollo: Really? As in, boil up some rice and dump some curry sauce on top? THAT curry rice? Atishon: Heh, I bet you assumed I would say French cuisine... ...just because I'm a member of the political elite. But nothing beats the delectable curry recipe my ancestors bright over from Japan. And I'm the kind of representative who upholds the value of such traditions! Apollo: (Is his entire strategy really just to pander to \"traditional values\" voters?) Judge: Your penalty is served, Mr. Justice. Let this be some food for thought! Athena: Apollo, why don't we take another look at the e-mail address? Apollo: No, it's fine! I just need another crack at this. Leads back to: \"Answer me this, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson: what is...\" Your birthday? Leads to: \"What is your birthday?\" Apollo: What is your birthday? Atishon: My birthday? It's July 11th, but what's it to you? (Changed from [My birthday? It's July 11, but what's it to you?] in the original release) ...Oh, I see. You can address birthday gifts to my office. But, full disclosure... I only accept gifts valued at one thousand dollars or more. (Changed from [But, full disclosure... I only accept gifts valued at $1,000 or more.] in the original release) Phoenix: ......... Judge: ......... Atishon: ...Hm? Why has everyone gone silent? Apollo: (How can anyone be that self-centered? Oh, right... politician.) Did everyone hear that? He said, \"July 11th.\" (Changed from [He said, 'July 11.'] in the original release) July 11 -- or rather, \"711\" -- matches the numbers in the e-mail address. Both the name and birthday are a match! I hardly think that's a coincidence! Atishon: .........Wait... Why you sneaky little--! Apollo: (Looks like someone finally decided to join the conversation.) Would the plaintiff care to explain? Atishon: I-I would like to say... that is q-quite... Apollo: Quite what? Atishon: Q-Quite... a thing... you've said. ......... Apollo Um... Any other thoughts? Atishon: No further comments. I stand by my previous statement. Apollo: Apollo: You can't just walk away. Even politicians have to explain themselves in a court of law! Atishon: ...I'm afraid I simply don't know how it happened. I can't possibly explain matters out of my purview. Perhaps it was a mistake on the part of my secretary? Apollo: (Oh no you don't, you slippery eel.) Mr. Wright, would you care to respond? Phoenix: ...I won't argue your assertion. My client lent the treasure in question to the doctor and asked him to study it. It seems that much is a fact. Apollo: (Now we're getting somewhere!) Phoenix: However, it has no bearing on the issue of ownership. Apollo: ...How so? Phoenix: Mr. Atishon, I fully understand your position here. You HAD to hide the fact that you sent the crystal out to be studied. Your family would've been very upset if they had found out. It's a family heirloom, after all. Apollo: You've got to be kidding me! Atishon: Mr. Wright is, well, right, of course. But then, he always is. That's why he's my lawyer. The crystal is a precious Atishon family heirloom, and has been for centuries. But Dr. Buff was so eager to study its proud heritage, I just couldn't say no. I didn't even tell my grandfather. Apollo: Apollo: But in order to win the backing of your so-called \"benefactor\"... ...you were going to give what you claim to be the Crystal of Ami Fey to that person? You were going to give a precious family heirloom away, just like that? Atishon: ...I-I was going to explain everything to grandfather later! Honest! Phoenix: My client's grandfather is very proud of his grandson for following in his footsteps. And if refusing him would've meant dashing the dreams of his darling grandson... ...I doubt the kindly old man could've said no. Judge: Well, grandchildren ARE meant to be spoiled. That's what grandfathers are for. Apollo: Your Honor... Please. (I mean, it's been in the family for centuries.) Atishon: My grandfather thinks highly of my talents as a politician. That's why he entrusted me with this very important name placard today. So I'm sure he would've been okay with me using the crystal as I saw fit. Apollo: (Grrr... Grandpa's spoiled little brat.) Athena: I think the judge is buying it, Apollo. Apollo: No surprise there. He's always going on and on about his own grandchild, after all. Ema: ...Excuse me. Can I leave now, Mr. Wright? I believe my work here is done. Phoenix: By all means, Detective Skye. Thank you for your assistance. Ema: You're welcome. It's nice to testify at a civil trial once in a while. See you around. Judge: Hmm... It seems the facts have changed somewhat. Mr. Atishon-Wimperson apparently lent his family heirloom to Dr. Buff. Mr. Justice. How would the defense like to proceed? Apollo: Oh, umm... (All right, now what?) Athena: Apollo, let's hear what what they know about this so-called \"Crystal of Ami Fey.\" Maybe we can find some inconsistencies in their statements. Apollo: Right... Okay then, Mr. Wright. If the item in question really is an Atishon family heirloom... ...then let's hear all your client knows about it. Phoenix: ...Of course. Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Please tell the defense everything you know about the crystal's origin. Atishon: All right. Now then, listen and learn. This is the tale of the Crystal of Ami Fey, and the illustrious history of the Atishon clan! Are you ready? Our story begins back in the old country, when the Atishon family reigned supreme... Witness Testimony -- The Illustrious History of the Atishon Clan -- Atishon: My ancestor was praised as a benevolent ruler. He protected the spirit mediums, a minority back then, from the rest of the locals. Some discriminated against them, you see, while others tried to abuse their power. As thanks, Ami Fey gave the crystal she had specially made as a gift to him. I am a descendent of that great lord. As such, my political power and influence is backed by centuries of history! Apollo: (Well, that devolved into a great load of self-aggrandizing propaganda fast.) Phoenix: As you can see... ...the Crystal of Ami Fey is an heirloom of the esteemed House of Atishon. Apollo: And you have proof that it has always been in the Atishon family? Phoenix: ...I have someone who gave a statement to that effect. My client's neighbor -- one Ives Shineto, age eighty-five -- gave the following statement: (Changed from [My client's neighbor -- one Ives Shineto, age 85 -- gave the following statement:] in the original release) \"The Atishons showed me the Crystal back when I was but a lad.\" Apollo: Apollo: Can we really trust the memory of an old man? Phoenix: ...Mr. Justice. Would you care you to explain that statement to the judge? Apollo: Oh... Er, I didn't mean-- What I'm trying to say is, um... Judge: Never underestimate the memory of your elders. I may forget my verdicts the next day, but the memories of my past are clear as day! Therefore, I find Mr. Ives Shineto's statement to be perfectly credible. Athena: Wow, did you see how Mr. Wright got the judge on his side? That's definitely a trick I want up my sleeve. Apollo: *sigh* You're not helping, Athena... Judge: You may cross-examine the witness, Mr. Justice. Cross Examination -- The Illustrious History of the Atishon Clan -- Atishon: My ancestor was praised as a benevolent ruler. Press Apollo: Apollo: Um, that object you set down there... Is it something of importance to you? Atishon: It's a name placard. This one here belonged to my grandfather, Abraham Atishon. He had it custom-made during his distinguished political career. It's special because it was crafted from the finest Italian plastic. Apollo: (I wasn't aware the Italians were famous for their fine plastic...) Atishon: Heh heh heh. You can touch it if you want. Apollo: No, I'm fine. Atishon: Very well. I'll just continue with my testimony. My ancestor was praised as a benevolent ruler. But he was also an eminent politician. Atishon: He protected the spirit mediums, a minority back then, from the rest of the locals. Press Apollo: Apollo: So I take it the relationship with the Fey clan was a close one. Atishon: A smooth and open line of communication with my entire electorate... That is the Paul Atishon way. Apollo: Huh...? Oh, sorry. I was asking about your ancestor. Atishon: Heh. Whether it's about me or my ancestor... ...feel free to ask me anything you'd like. Transparency in government! That's the Paul Atishon way. Apollo: (More like: Dodging questions! That's the Paul Atishon way.) Thanks. I'll be sure to ask when I have something you'll actually answer. Atishon: As I was saying, the Atishon family protected the Fey spirit mediums back then. Atishon: Some discriminated against them, you see, while others tried to abuse their power. Press Apollo: Apollo: Spirit mediums were targets of discrimination? Atishon: Yes. Some people even treated them like they were monsters. The transformation the mediums underwent when channeling spirits frightened the locals. And then there were those who tried to use them. Apollo: You mean they sought to control the channeling powers of the mediums? Atishon: Discriminating against a minority is absolutely despicable. A vote for me is a vote to end discrimination. I vow to root it out wherever it may be! That is my promise to you! Athena: He's totally ignoring your questions. It's like you're a moderator at a political debate. Apollo: Yeah, and only HE cares about his talking points. As thrilling as your campaign is, could we please get back to your testimony? Atishon: Feh. As you wish. Now then, as for the Crystal of Ami Fey... Atishon: As thanks, Ami Fey gave the crystal she had specially made as a gift to him. Press Apollo: Apollo: You said she had it made. So then it was made in Japan? Atishon: That's right. They say she hired a famous craftsman to make it. And they say it's quite valuable, too. Apollo: And you were going to take such a priceless family heirloom... ...and just give it to your patron? Atishon: Feh. That's so typical of you ignorant, common types. Making difficult decisions when the chips are down is what being a politician is all about. Apollo: (But only when it's in service of your own political career, you mean.) Atishon: The crystal is a testament to my ancestor's remarkable achievements. And furthermore... Present Research Notes Apollo: Leads to: \"You stated that Ami Fey had the crystal made for your ancestor.\" Atishon: I am a descendent of that great lord. Press Apollo: Apollo: So tell me, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, are you famous in Kurain Village? Atishon: You could say that. But I find my popularity to be rather bemusing. Apollo: Bemusing? Atishon: Yes, my campaign posters keep going missing as soon as I put them up. My avid supporters and female fans are likely taking them home to hang in their bedrooms. Apollo: (...I guess ignorance really is bliss.) Atishon: Heh heh heh. All this only proves my fine lineage. Atishon: As such, my political power and influence is backed by centuries of history! Press Apollo: Apollo: I'm sorry, but is any of that relevant to the issue of the relic's rightful owner? Atishon: ...Have you never heard of kingcraft? Apollo: Kingcraft? Atishon: It's the art of ruling as a king. My father drilled it into my head from a young age. And one of its precepts states: \"Ruin awaits a ruler who responds to every single issue posed by the masses.\" Apollo: (Well, that answered my question about what he meant by \"king of this nation.\" Progress.) Athena: Apollo, who is this Ami Fey, anyway? Apollo: I believe she was the founder of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Athena: The plaintiff claims she had the crystal made for his ancestor. That would mean it was made in Japan, right? Apollo: Yes, I suppose it would. Apollo: You stated that Ami Fey had the crystal made for your ancestor. So, am I to assume it was made in Japan? Atishon: That's right. The craftsmanship is unbeatable! Apollo: Well, that's strange. I don't see how your so-called crystal could've been made there. Atishon: What are you talking about? Apollo: It's quite obvious if you take a closer look at this. Present motif on Founder's Orb pedestal Apollo: Leads to: \"Take a look at the distinctive design here. According to Dr. Buff...\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: See this part right here? Doesn't it exude a mysterious, exotic charm? Judge: Hmm... I don't know about that. Phoenix: What I do know, Mr. Justice, is your assertion exudes a mysterious amount of nonsense. Apollo: ...Oops. Judge: And I assure you there's no mystery behind a penalty for aimless speculation, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Nope. No mystery there, Your Honor. Athena: Apollo, let's go over everything we have on the orb once more. Maybe there's something that can help us prove it wasn't made in Japan. Apollo: Your Honor, I can prove the orb wasn't made in Japan. Leads back to: \"It's quite obvious if you take a closer look at this.\" Apollo: Take a look at the distinctive design here. According to Dr. Buff... ...it's a mitamah motif dating back to the early days of the Kingdom of Khura'in. Judge: The Kingdom of Khura'in, hmm? And you base this on...? Apollo: Here, this piece of evidence, Your Honor. These are the doctor's research notes on the Founder's Orb. This is the box in which the orb was originally stored. It features the same pattern as the one found on the orb. Judge: Hmm... They do look like the same pattern. Apollo: Therefore, I assert that... ...the disputed item must have been made in the Kingdom of Khura'in! Atishon: AAAAAAAAAHHHH! Eeeeeeek! M-My placard...!!! Phoenix: Phoenix: The Kurain Channeling Technique originated in the Kingdom of Khura'in. And Ami Fey is known to have traveled there to train. With that in mind, what's to say she didn't bring that pattern back with her? Apollo: Apollo: But since this is CLEARLY a Khura'inese design... ...not even you can deny... ...the possibility that it was made there -- in the Kingdom of Khura'in! Phoenix: Phoenix: Anything is possible to some extent. That doesn't make it true. So you can't conclude that the orb is from Khura'in based solely on that pattern. If it were that simple... ...I could just as easily say it's Japanese. Judge: I have to agree with Mr. Wright. The pattern alone proves nothing. But that also means there's no basis to claim that the item in dispute was made in Japan, either. Hmm... At this rate, we're going nowhere fast. Apollo: (...Argh. He's right -- we're just spinning our wheels here.) Athena: I wonder if we have any evidence that could break this stalemate. Apollo: (Hmm... Evidence that could break this stalemate...) Exists Apollo: The defense would like to present a piece of evidence to the court. A piece that will finally break this stalemate! Phoenix: Oh? Well, you've sure piqued my interest. Let's see what you've got. Apollo: ...All right. I will now prove that this is, in fact, the Founder's Orb! Present anything Apollo: Phoenix: And just how does that piece of evidence prove that the relic is the Founder's Orb? Apollo: .........It doesn't, does it? Phoenix: Not by any means I can fathom. Athena: Sorry, Apollo, but I have to agree with the boss on this. Apollo: ...Me too, actually. Judge: Me three, defense! Apollo: Yikes! Judge: Time to think that one over again, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Y-Yes, Your Honor... Leads back to: \"Hmm... Evidence that could break this stalemate...\" Does not exist Leads to: \"There doesn't seem to be anything we can use. At least, not at this point.\" Apollo: There doesn't seem to be anything we can use. At least, not at this point. Athena: Well, unless we can find something, this trial won't be going anywhere. Atishon: ......... *whew* That's much better. Apollo: (What's his deal?) Phoenix: ...I have a suggestion. Why don't we consider this from a different angle? Apollo: I'm listening... Phoenix: What if... ...the Defiant Dragons really were authorized to take possession of the relic? Judge: Hmm... I'm afraid I don't know where you're going with this, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Consider the Orb Transfer Agreement, which states: \"I agree to hand over the Founder's Orb to the Defiant Dragons if I will come to no harm.\" What if, as the last part suggests, this was written under duress? That would render the agreement null and void. Apollo: ...What are you suggesting, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: While you were on your little cave expedition, I was investigating Dr. Buff's accident. And there was something you overlooked, Mr. Justice. Namely, that his \"accident\" might have actually been murder. Apollo: What?! (M-Murder?) Judge: M-Mr. Wright! You do realize such statements are not to be made lightly? Are you suggesting the doctor was murdered by the Defiant Dragons? Phoenix: Yes, but follow me on this for a sec. The books that came tumbling down were from the archeology shelf. However, among that mountain of books was a single volume on psychology. What's more, there was blood on it. Apollo: And you feel this is important because...? Phoenix: The took that came tumbling down were from the top shelf -- the archeology books. We know this because the doctor's books were meticulously organized by subject. Archeology took up the entire shelf, so that psychology book is completely out of place. Apollo: (Come to think of it, the shelves were arranged quite carefully.) Phoenix: It's also worth noting that psychology books only take up a tiny part of the bottom shelf. You might wonder why a book on psychology was found amid the pile of archeology books. But I believe I can explain what that single out-of-place book was doing there. The doctor was struck from behind while selecting a psychology book from the shelf. Apollo: And that's when the blood got on the book? Phoenix: Precisely. And to make it look like an accident... ...he was buried under a mountain of archeology books. Apollo: Apollo: W-Wait a second. This is all just speculation, right? Or do you have proof it was murder? Phoenix: Of course I do. Apollo: Y-You do? Phoenix: On a hunch, I had Detective Skye examine the doctor's head wound. She found that he'd been struck by the corner of some object or another. Apollo: Wait, what?! Phoenix: A would like that couldn't have resulted from a fall to a floor, you know. Do you understand what this means, Mr. Justice? The wound makes it crystal clear that Dr. Buff was murdered! Apollo: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Athena: Well, THAT was unexpected! Who'd have thought we'd break out of the stalemate like this! He pulled the ladder right out from under us. Apollo: (Still, if he thinks that's enough to make me back down, he's got another thing coming!) Even if the cause of death was murder, what makes you think it was the Defiant Dragons? You should know better than to hurl baseless accusations! Phoenix: Phoenix: Did you forget who you were up against, Mr. Justice? Apollo: Huh? Phoenix: You didn't actually think I'd come to court without witnesses and evidence, did you? Apollo: Wh-What are you talking about? Phoenix: I would like to request further testimony from the plaintiff. Specifically... ...I would like the court to hear how he saw one of the rebels leaving the crime scene! Apollo: He-- He-- He saw whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! Athena: If he can prove it was murder, that's the end of our client's right to the orb! Did he have this up his sleeve the whole time?! Apollo: Grrr... How could Mr. Wright do this to us? (He was just waiting to spring this trap!) Phoenix: ...Heh. Judge: Hmm... This trial has taken another unexpected turn. But I must mention, Mr. Wright, that you have yet to identify the murder weapon. Phoenix: The object used to commit the murder was not located at the scene of the crime. The murderer likely disposed of it elsewhere. Dr. Buff's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Judge: Well, I never thought we'd be deliberating the issue of murder at a civil trial. All right, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, your testimony, if you please. Atishon: Heh. Prepare to be dazzled! Dazzled by charismatic oration forged in the crucible of campaign battles! Witness Testimony -- The Rebel's Crime -- Atishon: That evening, I was walking alone, lost in thought. I passed by the doctor's house... and that's when I saw Mr. Are'bal. He was running out the front door. It was around 10 at night. Surely that must've been him fleeing the scene of his crime. A vote for me is a vote to end such violence. That is my promise to you! Judge: So the plaintiff saw a possible suspect fleeing from the doctor's residence? And it was within the window of the estimated time of death? Apollo: ......... (Datz Are'bal! What in the world were you doing there then?!) Study Photo updated in the Court Record. Phoenix: It seems that Mr. Are'bal was loitering about Kurain Village that day. There's evidence that he was in the doctor's study as well. Isn't that right, Mr. Justice? Apollo: ......Ah! You mean the suitcase? Phoenix: Exactly. He must have been in quite a rush to leave that behind. Oh, and by the way, Your Honor... ...Mr. Are'bal just so happens to be sitting in the gallery today. Datz: Ack! Phoenix: See? That's him trying to escape as we speak. Judge: Bailiff! Don't let that man get away! Datz: Wright, you backstabber! Why are you doing this to meeee?! Judge: All right. The... counsel-slash-defense may question the plaintiff-slash-witness once more. ...Ahem. Please proceed, Mr. Justice. Cross Examination -- The Rebel's Crime -- Atishon: That evening, I was walking alone, lost in thought. Press Apollo: Apollo: Why were you taking a walk? Atishon: Society is inundated with serious problems that must be solved. And as a politician... ...I'm always on the job, thinking hard about possible solutions, even on my walks. Apollo: Umm... (Thanks for the non-answer.) Atishon: While we live out our comfy lives... ...there are starving children who suffer in the back alleys of our major cities. It's not in me to ignore such suffering! A vote for me, is a vote to end hunger. ...And for world peace! Phoenix: Yes, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, we are well aware of your outstanding character. Now, please continue with your testimony. Atishon: Heh heh heh. I can practically hear my poll numbers surging. Now, on with my speech. After all, the voting public must be informed of the magnificence that is me! Atishon: I passed by the doctor's house... and that's when I saw Mr. Are'bal. Press Apollo: Apollo: Where exactly were you when you saw Mr. Are'bal? Atishon: Right here, under this tree. I saw him dashing out of Dr. Buff's front door. Apollo: And he didn't notice you? Atishon: No. I was hidden by the tree. Judge: Is it really all that important to know from where the plaintiff saw Dr. Buff? No, it isn't Apollo: No, I don't believe it bears any relevance to this case. Judge: All right, then. Will the witness please continue with his testimony? Leads back to cross-examination Yes, it is Apollo: Yes, I believe it matters a lot. I ask that it please be added to the witness's testimony. Adds statement \"I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal.\" if not already added Atishon: I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal. Press Apollo: Apollo: What were you doing under that tree? Atishon: A lack of lateral thinking... That is a politician's downfall. Apollo: What? Atishon: That is why, if I'm elected... I promise to think outside the box! Apollo: Um... uh... The question was, what were you doing under the tree, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. Atishon: Feh... I suppose I can't expect a plebeian such as yourself to understand my grand design. Apollo: (Oh, yeah? Try me, O Lord of Plebs.) Phoenix: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. I believe the court is well aware of your grand political vision. Now, let's have the rest of your testimony, if you please. Atishon: Heh, I can hardly wait for the upcoming election. Atishon: He was running out the front door. Press Apollo: Apollo: Did you notice anything unusual? Atishon: Yes, his behavior was incredibly suspicious. His eyes were darting all around as he ran off in total panic. As soon as I saw that, I knew he had done something, and it probably wasn't good. Apollo: Despite that, you still didn't report it to the police? Atishon: Who would've thought he had killed Dr. Buff? Not me. That's why I didn't report him. Judge: So the witness didn't notify the police. Is that an important statement, Mr. Justice? No, it isn't Apollo: No, it's not important. Judge: Hmm... All right, then. Let's have the witness continue with his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Yes, it is Apollo: Yes, it's important. I request that the witness add it to his testimony. Atishon: ...Feh. Sure, why not. Adds statement \"I had no idea Dr. Buff was dead. That's why I didn't call the police.\" if not already added Atishon: I had no idea Dr. Buff was dead. That's why I didn't call the police. Press Apollo: Apollo: You had no idea he was dead. In other words, you knew nothing about what had happened? Atishon: I am truly ashamed of myself. Apollo: What? Atishon: There's been a gruesome murder in my beloved village. What a fool I've been! I was thinking only of the village's future and world peace! It seems my earnest attitude and industrious nature have come back to haunt me! Apollo: (Only a politician would try to pass off self-aggrandizement as self-deprecation.) Athena: Apollo, you think this is how all politicians will be from now on? Apollo: We're all doomed if they are... Atishon: If you don't mind, I'd like to continue with my testimony. Present Study Photo or Study Diagram (after adding statement \"I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal.\") Apollo: Leads to: \"Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, rather than Mr. Are'bal...\" Atishon: It was around 10 at night. Surely that must've been him fleeing the scene of his crime. Press Apollo: Apollo: But at the time, you didn't know the doctor was dead. Is that correct? Atishon: ...It's true that I've been known as a prodigy from a very young age. Apollo: Huh? Atishon: I graduated high school and college with exceptional grades. As class president... ...I reformed stale old school traditions. My exploits were even covered in local papers. But as exceptional as I am, I can't possibly be expected to know everything at all times. Apollo: (This isn't working. He keeps bending the questions to serve his own needs.) Athena: Hang in there, Apollo! Phoenix: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. I believe the court is well aware of your exceptional nature. Now, would you please continue with your testimony? Atishon: Heh heh heh. I have the upcoming election in the bag. Atishon: A vote for me is a vote to end such violence. That is my promise to you! Press Apollo: Apollo: So, how do you actually intend to end such violence? Atishon: Elite politicians such as myself never reveal their strategies. Did you really think I would divulge such sensitive information to the likes of you? Apollo: Yeah, but, surely you have some sort of campaign platform you're running on? Atishon: ................................... ...No comment. Apollo: (Clearly, his is a platform, told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.) Before adding either statement Athena: They're accusing the Defiant Dragons of murder. If this sticks, we'll lose the orb! Apollo: Yeah, we need to sink Paul Atishon's testimony before it's too late. (Mr. Wright is pulling out all the stops. Then again, I'd expect nothing less from him.) After adding statement \"I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal.\", but before adding statement \"I had no idea Dr. Buff was dead. That's why I didn't call the police.\" Athena: He saw Mr. Are'bal from under that tree? Apollo, maybe there's some sort of an inconsistency there. Apollo: Hmm, I wonder... Athena: Why don't we review the evidence? Apollo: (Yeah. Maybe there's something we overlooked.) After adding statement \"I had no idea Dr. Buff was dead. That's why I didn't call the police.\", but before adding statement \"I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal.\" Athena: He didn't know the doctor was dead? Well, I guess that makes sense, considering the body was inside the study. Apollo: Right, how could he have known? (Guess I could find out where our weaselly witness was when he saw Datz.) After adding both statements Apollo: He said he saw Datz from under the tree. If that's true, then... Athena: Did you figure something out? Apollo: Yeah, I think he's hiding something. Let's take another look at the evidence, Athena. Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, rather than Mr. Are'bal... ...wasn't there's something else that should've had your undivided attention? Atishon: Like what? ...Oh, yes, of course! A politician must also keep his finger on the electorate's pulse, and focus on the nation's-- Apollo: Sorry, but you're way off. Atishon: I am? Hmm... Judge: Would you care to explain, Mr. Justice? Apollo: If the witness saw Mr. Are'bal from his position here... ...then he should've also been able to see the doctor's body. After all, it was right next to a huge window. Judge: Why, I believe you have a point there! Apollo: With the body THAT clearly visible to the witness... ...it's unthinkable that he wouldn't have reported it to the police! Phoenix: Ah! Judge: Hmm... Would the witness care to respond? Atishon: ........................... Apollo: ......... (Did he... fall asleep?) Judge: ...Um, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Atishon: ........................... Judge: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson!!! Atishon: Huh?! Oh, um. Hmm... There are many sides to any issue. Apollo: (What did I ever do to deserve this?) In any case, I'd like the court to acknowledge in the inconsistency in the witness's testimony. Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, did you really see Mr. Are'bal? Atishon: Yes! .................. Apollo: Apollo: Where do you think you're going?! Atishon: Oh, I thought I would return to my seat, seeing as I had already answered the question. Apollo: This isn't some small town hall debate, so you just stay right there until I say we're through. Atishon: I-I'll have to run that by my campaign manager before I... Apollo: Apollo: .........*glare* Atishon: *gulp* Phoenix: ...Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. I think it's time for you to come clean. Atishon: Huh?! Apollo: ...So then, does this mean he DIDN'T see Mr. Are'bal? Phoenix: As your lawyer, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson... ...I advise you divulge that matter we discussed. Silence is no longer an option. Atishon: ...Err, are you sure about this? I'm in the midst of running for office! I can't afford to let any strange rumors get out. Phoenix: Don't worry. You won't suffer any blowback for what you're about to reveal. Judge: \"Blowback\"? I'm not sure I like the sound of that, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Not to worry, Your Honor. Nothing untoward will come of this, I promise. Now then, Mr. Justice. Remember how it was an anonymous caller that reported the doctor's death? Apollo: Come to think of it... Apollo: Ema, who was the first one to discover the body? Ema: About that... Whoever it was, it seems they wanted to remain anonymous. Apollo: What? Ema: It happens now and then. Some people would rather not get involved with the police. Apollo: Wait... You're not saying that... Phoenix: Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. The anonymous source who contacted the police after discovering the body was... ...my client, Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson. Apollo: Wh-What?! (Y-You don't say...) Phoenix: So you see, he played his part as a concerned citizen -- quite admirably, if I may say so. Isn't that right? Atishon: .........Y-Yes, indeed... In our society today, there are too many who choose indifference over righteous action. But I don't number among them. That's why I did my duty as a concerned citizen. One might call me THE model citizen -- one worthy of standing above all the rest! Apollo: (What a real standard-bearer he is, reporting it anonymously.) Phoenix: ...Oh, and by the way, Mr. Justice. Wasn't there someone else at the scene of the crime when my client discovered the body? Apollo: ...Oh, um, you mean Mr. Are'bal? He would have been leaving the doctor's house right around then... Wait, th-that means...! Phoenix: Yes, it does. In short... ...what my client witnessed was Mr. Are'bal fleeing the scene of a heinous murder! Apollo: ...Aaaaaaah! Phoenix: And that's not all! Based on what we've heard so far... ...Mr. Are'bal looked exceedingly suspicious, and that's putting it mildly. We already know the Defiant Dragons threatened the doctor with bodily harm. And now that they've killed him, the so-called Orb Transfer Agreement is null and void! Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Athena: A-Apollo! If we don't come up wit with some sort of counterargument...! Apollo: A-And what sort of evidence do you have? Can you actually prove that it was Mr. Are'bal who killed the doctor? Athena: That move had \"desperate\" written all over it. Apollo: It's all I've got, so I'm going with it! Phoenix: ...Evidence? I suppose it's true that I don't have any... Apollo: I-I knew it! Phoenix: But I do have another witness. Apollo: You do? Phoenix: You should know I always come fully prepared, Mr. Justice. And my new witness will provide testimony proving Mr. Are'bal's guilt. Apollo: ...Gnrggh! Athena: A new witness? I wonder who it could be. Judge: ...Very well. Bailiff, please summon our new witness. In the meantime, the court will take a brief recess. I would like both sides to use this time to prepare properly, understood? May 17District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Apollo: Wow. I knew Mr. Wright would put up a tough fight, but... Athena: Yeah! Just when I thought we had him, he'd turn the tables on us. He really is the Turnabout Terror. Apollo: (We can't let him blindside us again.) Datz: Looks like they've got me again! Three times in one year! \"Datz\" a new record! Har har har har har har! Apollo: Datz, please... No more new records -- or bad puns, while you're at it. It's hard enough trying to help you as it is. Datz: Roger that. I'll be more careful next time! Dhurke: Datz, is what Mr. Wright said true? Did you really pay a visit to Dr. Buff that night? Datz: Sure did. Can't remember the exact time, though. All I know is he wouldn't hand over the orb. Someone put it in his head that we rebels were dangerous. That's why he threw me out. Apollo: So the doctor was still alive when Datz last saw him. Athena: We'll still have to prove it, though. Dhurke: ...Better brace yourself, son. The next witness's testimony could make or break this case. Apollo: Yeah, I know. Hey, where's Trucy? Athena: She went to go see her dad. Apollo: Hmm... Maybe she's still mad. Athena: More like worried. Worried that this trial will create a rift between you two... ...and that you might then leave the agency. Apollo: Ha ha ha. She has an active imagination. Bailiff: Excuse me. The trial will be resuming shortly. Apollo: Well, let's go see what new testimony awaits us. May 17District Court - Courtroom No. 6 Judge: All right, court is back in session. Mr. Wright, you said you had a witness...? Phoenix: Your Honor, I would like to call the lone survivor of the doctor's murder to the stand. Apollo: (Wait.. He can't mean... that Sarge is here?) You mean Dr. Buff's reclusive son? How did you get him to cooperate? Phoenix: ...Nothing a little persuasion couldn't handle. The poor child only agreed to help if it meant catching the killer. Apollo: (Getting a kid like that to overcome his fear... Now that's impressive.) Athena: This must be really important testimony for the kid to come out in public like this. Judge: Very well, Mr. Wright. Please call your witness to the stand. Judge: .........Oh, my! Sarge: Sergeant Buff at your service, sir! Apollo: ...He's here as the drone? Really? Judge: ...Um, Mr. Wright? What exactly is the meaning of this? Phoenix: Past trauma has rendered it impossible for the witness to venture into public. Leaving home was hard enough. And it seems leaving the witness lobby was just too much. But I would still like to continue with testimony delivered via this drone. Judge: Hmm... I understand it must be terrible to lose one's father like that... ...but testimony via a remote control toy? .........Well, let's take things for a spin and see how it goes. Apollo: (Just who's piloting this trial, anyway?!) Athena: The judge sure warmed up to the idea fast. Apollo: I think the phrase you're looking for is \"gave up.\" Sarge: You disappoint me, Corporal Justice! To think I once called you comrade! Apollo: AAAAAAAAAGH! Sarge: Defending the man who killed Papa?! That's full-on treason, soldier! I hereby demote you back to \"private\"! Athena: \"Corporal\"? \"Private\"? What's he talking about, Apollo? Apollo: It's... a long story. Judge: Now then, are you ready to testify, youngster? Sarge: Locked and loaded, sir! Ready to rain lead down upon the perpetrator! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Witness Testimony -- What Happened That Evening -- Sarge: Papa met with someone the night he died. I didn't have eyes on the ground, as I'd already mounted my siege defense, but... ...I did hear him arguing with someone in his study! From my window, I saw the one designated \"Datz\" getting ejected from the premises. After that, the man lingered around the perimeter for some time. He must have regrouped and killed my papa in the study later -- I just know it! Judge: Hmm... So he was thrown out, but later returned and committed the murder, did he? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. So the man my client saw... ...really must have been the fleeing Mr. Are'bal. Datz: Datz: Objeeeeection! Wright, you backstabbing, no good--! I-I didn't kill no one! Sarge: It's the enemy! Ready all missiles! And... FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRE!! Datz: WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA!!! Sarge: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Capitalist pig! I'll turn you into pork stroganoff! And that's just a taste of my ultimate anti-swine weapon! Apollo: (Whoa! It fires missiles, too?!) Judge: ...Yes, well, the witness is all yours, Mr. Justice. Cross Examination -- What Happened That Evening -- Sarge: Papa met with someone the night he died. Press Apollo: Apollo: Your father met with \"someone\"? Could you be more specific? Sarge: No. I was in the midst of a crucial defensive siege operation. Apollo: Right... You're referring to how you don't leave your room, correct? Sarge: You never know where the enemy might be lurking outside the siege perimeter. Apollo: What about, you know, school? Sarge: Oh, uhhh... I don't go to boot camp! I'm a soldier! A sergeant doesn't associate with rookies still too green to fight! Apollo: (With a kid like this, I bet Dr. Buff won't be getting any rest in the afterlife, either.) Judge: Hmm... It was very brave of you to come to the courthouse today. But what was that you said about a siege defense? Sarge: Oh, that? Well... Sarge: I didn't have eyes on the ground, as I'd already mounted my siege defense, but... Press Apollo: Apollo: Um, Sarge? I've always wondered... ...who or what are you battling? Sarge: ! Th-That's... classified. Apollo: Even so, it may be relevant to this case. Phoenix: Phoenix: Umm... I don't know if YOU'RE the right person to be asking things like that... Athena: That's right. Such matter need to be handled with a certain delicacy. Apollo: Oh, ha ha ha. I guess curiosity got the better of me. Sarge: You're all talk and no action, soldier! Out on the battlefield, it ain't the number of pretty words in yer repertoire... ...but the number of bullets in yer gun belt that counts! Apollo: (Easy for you to say. You're the one with all of them. Judge: Would the witness please tell the court what he saw and heard that night? Present Sarge's Drone Apollo: Leads to: \"Sarge, are you hiding something from me?\" Sarge: ...I did hear him arguing with someone in his study! Press Apollo: Apollo: What was the argument about? Sarge: I heard things like, \"Where's the orb?!\" and \"Are you Defiant Dragons really criminals?!\" It sounded real volatile, like a war might break out any second! Apollo: (So the two of them had an argument when Datz came to get the orb.) Did you see or hear anything else? Sarge: Yeah. I heard them arguing, and then, silence. Sarge: From my window, I saw the one designated \"Datz\" getting ejected from the premises. Press Apollo: Apollo: How was Mr. Are'bal acting? Sarge: Like a conquered trooper retreating with his tail between his legs. Apollo: A \"trooper\"...? Well, I guess he does dress like he's in the military. Athena: I bet those two would have really hit it off had they met under different circumstances. Apollo: Yeah, I can see that. Sarge: And so, the defeated soldier was expelled. But that wasn't the end. Sarge: After that, the man lingered around the perimeter for some time. Press Apollo: Apollo: That... does seem suspicious. Sarge: He kept hiding behind trees and telephone poles, and stealing glances at our house. Apollo: Well, he couldn't exactly leave without the orb...) Sarge: I bet he was angry that he'd been kicked out. Sarge: He must have regrouped and killed my papa in the study later -- I just know it! Press Apollo: Apollo: But don't you keep your front door unlocked? If so, anyone could've gotten in.. Sarge: That's true. Papa didn't keep our house locked up. He said there was no need because there were only good people in Kurain Village. Apollo: (Yet he ended up dead, anyway.) Sarge: Only a monster could do what they did to my kind, trusting Papa! There will be no mercy! I vow swift and terrible vengeance! I'll carpet-bomb the killer with everything in my arsenal! FIIIIIIRE!!! Judge: While I sympathize with you, witness, you will refrain from firing Gatling guns in this court. Athena: So Sarge saw Datz, too. Apollo: And just when I thought things couldn't get any worse. I wonder why he hung around after getting thrown out? Athena: I hate to say this, but if Datz is proven to be the killer... ...we'll lose the orb to the plaintiff. So our only option is to prove the Defiant Dragons had nothing to do with the murder! Apollo: Sarge, are you hiding something from me? Sarge: H-How dare you question your superior officer like that! You wanna get in on this stroganoff action with pig-boy over there, soldier?! Apollo: Sorry, but I'm afraid lawyers are missile-proof. Sarge: Wh-What?! Judge: Would the defense care to explain? Apollo: It's simple, Your Honor. Just as he is able to see what is happening in court right now... ...Sarge was able to see what happening in the study then. With his cherished drone, of course. Judge: Ahhh! Now that you mention it... And to think, the answer was right before our eyes this whole time. Apollo: Sarge! You were perfectly capable of patrolling the study that night! So you must've seen something! Sarge: Aaaaaaaaaagh! I'm hit! What is this strange new weaponry you're using against me?! Apollo: Courtroom warriors don't use guns or missiles, because evidence is our weapon of choice! And the evidence has exposed your bald-faced lie! My truth bomb, Sarge... has stripped your defenses bare! Sarge: A t-t... truth bomb?! Noooooooooooo! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH! Mayday, mayday!!! I'm going doooooooown!!! Judge: Oh, my! Are you all right?! Sarge: *cough* *sputter* Evidence... Never have I seen such fearsome ordnance. Apollo: Tell it to us straight, Sarge. After all, you want to help your father, don't you? Sarge: Papa... Apollo: Yes. You want to find out who killed him, don't you? So please. Tell us what you saw that night. Sarge: ...It's... It's... It's not what you think. I-I... I... I didn't see anything. I swear...! Apollo: ...You sure? You seem awfully stressed for someone who didn't see anything. Sarge: ...Grrrrrrr! Apollo: UWAAAAAAHHH! ...S-Sarge. You need to answer my question. Sarge: Shut your piehole, maggot! It'll be a scorching day in Siberia before a lowly private like you orders me around! Apollo: (...What's with him and Siberia, of all places? But if a scorching day is what it'll take, then maybe it's time to turn up the heat.) Hey, Athena. You think a therapy session might help? Athena: Well, it could help alleviate some of his anxiety. NOISE LEVEL100% Athena: ...Plus, I'm picking up a lot of discord in Sarge's voice. That usually means the patient wants to say something, but can't for some reason. Apollo: And in Sarge's case, I imagine whatever's plaguing him is pretty severe. In that case, I leave it to you and your Mood Matrix magic! Athena: You got it! Your Honor, I believe I can be of help here. Judge: Time for a therapy session, is it, Ms. Cykes? Athena: Yes. It will help the witness with his anxiety -- maybe even enough to testify! Judge: Then by all means, please bring the poor child out into the light of day. ...Oh, but I assume this will be all right with you, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Why not? It's not like we all haven't been through this before. Sarge: Wh-What are you butting in for, lady?! There ain't a place on this battlefield for you! Athena: Athena: I beg to differ, Sarge. This G.I. Jane's always ready for a fight in the courtroom! And wait until you see what I've got in my arsenal -- analytical psychology! With it, I'm going to blow a big ol' hole in the armor you've built around your heart! Sarge: UWAAAAAAH! First evidence, now analytical psychology?! Where are these WMDs coming from?! ...W-Well, if it's a battle you want, bring it on! You may have started this war, but I'm going to end it, Corpswoman Cykes! Athena: You got it, Sarge. Time to seek out the agony buried deep in your heart. Widget: Brace yourself! Sarge: I stayed in my room with my drone that evening. Sarge: I heard Datz and Papa arguing with each other. Sarge: Datz got kicked out, but I saw him still hanging around outside. Pinpoint Surprised marker Apollo: Leads to: \"That's strange...\" Sarge: I was in my room, so I didn't know Papa was dead until the next day. Pinpoint Surprised marker Apollo: Leads to: \"That's strange... You reacted with shock when you discovered your father's body... \" Apollo: So I'm looking for unexpected emotions and unnatural reactions, right? Athena: Right -- emotions and reactions that don't fit the content of his testimony. When you find one, make sure you point it out to me. Also, remember not to view his emotional reactions in isolation. Sometimes, it's important to see how they change from one statement to the next. Apollo: Okay, I'll give it a try. Apollo: That's strange... You reacted with shock when you discovered your father's body... ...yet, you weren't nearly as shocked then as when you saw Mr. Are'bal. Normally, you'd expect the death of one's father to be much more impactful. Sarge: ...Enemy fire! Direct hit!!! Athena: That IS strange. I wonder what it could mean. Apollo: Well, we know he wasn't as affected by his father's death as he should've been. And I think I know why. Athena: Oh? Apollo: Sarge, you weren't as shocked at seeing your father's body as seeing Mr. Are'bal because... You're scared of Mr. Are'bal Apollo: Maybe you were scared of him? Sarge: Why you--! How could you even THINK I was scared of that capitalist pig! Apollo: So you weren't scared? Sarge: Listen up, trainee! You feckless amateurs don't even know what true fear is! Naïve little babies like you wouldn't last two seconds out there. So he's your first lesson, private! A heaping spoonful of true, battlefield terror! Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Athena: I think that means you were wrong. But there's no need to look so bitter about it, Apollo. Apollo: No, but that was some bitter medicine... (Ugh, the aftertaste of failure...) Leads back to: \"Sarge, you weren't as shocked at seeing your father's body as seeing Mr. Are'bal because...\" You'd already seen his body Leads to: \"Sarge...\" Something else shocked you Apollo: Did... something else shock you when you saw Mr. Are'bal? Something even more shocking than your father's death? Athena: Hmm, like what exactly, Apollo? Apollo: I don't know... Maybe a mouse or a cockroach? Athena: Eeeuuuwww, gross!!! Sarge: Foolish cannon fodder! Vermin are powerless in the fact of my deadly arsenal! I'll pump 'em full of lead! Apollo: Sounds kinda messy, don't you think? Sarge: ...Ah! Th-Then I'll develop new weaponry! Maybe a flamethrower'd do the trick... Apollo: S-Sure... As long as you keep it \"for vermin use only\"... Athena: Guess it wasn't something like mice or cockroaches after all, huh. Apollo: No, but it was worth a try -- especially to see your reaction. (*sigh* What else could it be...?) Leads back to: \"Sarge, you weren't as shocked at seeing your father's body as seeing Mr. Are'bal because...\" Apollo: Sarge... Maybe the truth is, you left your room that night. And that's when you saw it -- your father's body. Sarge: I-I saw no such thing! Apollo: Really? You didn't see his body? All right then, what DID you see? Sarge: Err... NOISE LEVEL70% Athena: Look, Apollo! We've lost some noise! Apollo: So, just as I suspected... he really did see something. Sarge! Please. Tell us what you saw. Sarge: Ooh... B-B-But... .................. ........................... I-I... The moment I saw it, ooh... ...I-I.. I couldn't bear it. I couldn't stand to lose yet another loved one. Apollo: Huh? (Am I missing something here?) Is that you weren't very shocked when you found out your father was dead? Because you had already sensed he was a goner somehow? Sarge: M-Maybe... Apollo: Please, Sarge. What was it you saw on the night of your father's murder? Sarge: Ooh... Gah gah gah gah. I-I... I saw... ...Agh. Gah. Hrgh. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! UHWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Apollo: Wh-What's happening?! (I don't like where this is going...) Sarge: YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH! NO MORE! NO MORE, PLEEEEEEAAASE!!! Athena: Eeeeeek! Widget: Help! Sarge: I've confiscated your little toy! The battlefield has no place for unauthorized equipment! Athena: W-Widget...! A-Apollo! I can't continue the rest of the session without him! Judge: C-Calm yourself this instant, witness! I hereby order you to submit to your therapy session! What in blazes...?! Sarge: Lookit me! I'm judge, jury, and executioner now! I hereby convene a military tribunal! Apollo: Whoa, whoa... This has gone way too far. Judge: B-Bailiff! Arrest that drone this instant! Sarge: RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWRRRRRR! Bailiff: Stop resisting! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGHHHHH! If you don't come quietly, I'll--! Sarge: FIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRE! Bailiff: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Athena: Give Widget back right-- EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEKKK!!! .................................................................. Athena: *huff* *puff* *cough, cough* Whew, finally got him back. Apollo: Nice work. Judge: Hmm... This witness is truly a handful. Sarge: Ooh... hup, two, three, four... Uwoooooooooooooooooooooooooooh! Phoenix: Ms. Cykes, what is the witness's current psychological state? Athena: Let's see... He's emotionally all over the map. Apollo: So his out-of-control emotions are in control of him, huh. Does that mean we can calm him down if we can figure out the root cause? Athena: Yes. So let's see what we can find. Sarge! Can you hear me? Sarge: Ooh... I-Is that you, Corpswoman Cykes? Athena: I'm here. Now, I want you to take a few deep breaths. Just try to relax. Try it with me. Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out. Sarge: In... Out... In... Out... Athena: And now... Let your emotions take you where they will. Go on, just let it all out! Sarge: UHWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!!! All forces, attaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack! Apollo: (...That's the LEAST relaxing breathing exercise I've ever seen.) Sarge: Datz was still hanging around after he got kicked out when... Sarge: ...I heard more fighting, and I got worried about Papa. Sarge: So I left my room, but suddenly... Sarge: ...I got dizzy and passed out. Sarge: I remember a flame lighting up the room... Probe Flames Apollo: Leads to: \"That's it!\" Sarge: ...and Papa grinning with delight. Probe Flames Apollo: Leads to: \"That's it!\" Sarge: That's when he must have been killed. If only I hadn't passed out! Apollo: So he has two out-of-control emotions, huh. And all we have to do is find out what's causing them to run wild like this? Athena: Yes. Whatever the cause, it should appear somewhere in the Mood Matrix. Let me know if you think you've found it. Apollo: Ugh... Easier said than done. Don't suppose you have any ideas on where to start? Athena: Well... I would think about Sarge's personality and his past. Those are the things that shape a person's emotions. You should be able to find something to work with from there! Apollo: That's it! Sarge... You were overcome with shock and fear when you saw those flames, weren't you? Sarge: Was I...? Apollo: Yes. Just six months ago... ...you and your mother were caught up in an arsonist's blaze. So it's no wonder you would be extremely scared of fire. Sarge: ...Y-Yes, that does make sense. Athena: And maybe, just maybe... ...your subconscious fear of fire was what caused you to withdraw from the world. Sarge: What do you mean, Corpswoman Cykes? Athena: In the outside world, you were bound to come across all sorts of fire. Candles, cigarettes... heck, even the grill at a diner. Even if it's not that often, just the idea that you might see them... ...grew bigger and bigger until you couldn't shut it out. Sarge: ...! I... I think you might be onto something. Candles, cigarettes... Just thinking about them sends a chill down my spine. Apollo: (Wow, the things I take for granted.) Sarge: Now I see. I was afraid... Afraid of the fire. Strange, I didn't even realize it myself. Apollo: About that fire, Sarge... Can you tell me what it was burning? Athena: Just stay calm and maybe something will come to you. Sarge: Oh, umm... ............. ..................Oh! I'm starting to remember! I-It was...! It was that relic! That relic Papa was studying... It was on fire! Apollo: The orb... was on fire? Sarge: Mm-hm. It's still kind of fuzzy...  ...but yes, the \"orb\" was burning right in front of Papa. And there... in the flames was... ...Mama? Yes! Now I remember... I saw Mama appear amid the dancing flames! Apollo: Wait... WHAAAAAAAAAT?! NOISE LEVEL30% Apollo: Wh-What's going on here? Athena: Maybe it's a memory from the fire that killed his mother. Hmm... He might be confusing it with what really happened when his father died. Apollo: So let me guess... More therapy? Athena: Yep. But this time, it seems there's an inconsistency in his statements. And I think we should be able to prove that with the evidence at hand. Apollo: (I hope this inconsistency is the key... ...to proving that the relic is really the Founder's Orb!) Sarge: Datz was still hanging around after he got kicked out when... Sarge: ...I heard more fighting, and I got worried about Papa. Sarge: So I left my room, but suddenly, I got dizzy and passed out. Sarge: I remember a flame lighting up the room, and Papa grinning with delight. Sarge: The relic was on fire, and I saw Mama's face inside. Sarge: That's when he must have been killed. If only I hadn't passed out! Present Founder's Orb Apollo: Leads to: \"Don't blame yourself, Sarge.\" Athena: I believe Sarge's fear of fire is triggering a past memory. As a result, the memory of what he really saw is being suppressed. When he tries to remember, the past memory is being overlaid onto the more recent one. Apollo: Wow, the mind sure is a tricky beast. So, I'll just have to find an inconsistency? Athena: Right. Once you find an inconsistent statement... ...present the evidence that proves it. Apollo: (The main issue here is when the doctor was murdered. Was he really killed while Datz was there?) Apollo: Don't blame yourself, Sarge. After all, even if you hadn't passed out... ...the outcome would've been the same. Sarge: What do you mean? Apollo: I'm talking about the time of death. Your father wasn't killed right after you left your room. Sarge: Wh-What?! Explain yourself at once, Private Justice! Apollo: You said you saw your father burning the orb, right? But that night, he went out to hide it in a cave. So, what you saw, Sarge... ...was something that happened before your father left to hide the orb. Sarge: Ah! Apollo: So you see, you didn't pass out right before he was killed. You passed out right before he left for the cave, to hide the orb in the ruins within. Sarge: S-So, even if I hadn't passed out... Apollo: That's right. The outcome would've been exactly the same. That's because your father, Dr. Buff, was killed after he returned from the ruins. And therefore, Sarge, there's no need to blame yourself. Sarge: Oh... I see... .............. ................................ Private Justice... Can... Can you really say I bear no blame in this? Apollo: ...Why do you ask? Sarge: .........Because... the truth is... ...if I hadn't engaged in my siege defense, Papa would still be alive. Apollo: Sarge... Sarge: Papa wished nothing more than for me to lead a happy, healthy life. That's why he quit his job and moved us out, away from the big city. But even then, I didn't have the courage to set foot into the outside world. And in the end... ...I failed to make Papa's wish come true. Sarge: ..................... ???: ...Um, Sarge? Athena: If you want to make your father's wish come true... If that's what you really want... ...then who's to say it's too late? Why don't you take the first step now? Sarge: ...My first step? Athena: That's right. You can cast off all your regret. You can stop standing still and start moving forward. You have the power within you. I know from experience. I know what's it like to feel like you do. But only you... only you can decide to take the first step! Sarge: ................................ Apollo: If you don't change your tactics now, Sarge... ...the victory you seek in the war you're waging will always lie beyond your grasp. Sarge: ................................................ Hmm... I think I understand now. I've... I've made up my mind! Apollo: ! Sarge: As of this moment... ...I will suspend my siege defense indefinitely! Apollo: ...............Huh? ???: S-Sergeant Buff, r-reporting for duty. Apollo: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! I-I-I thought you were a guy! Athena: You're DEFINTELY not the gruff drill sergeant I envisioned! ???: W-Well, my mama was in the Russian army. Phoenix: I was just as shocked, but it certainly explained a few things when I found out, too. May I introduce to you Miss Armie Buff, age twelve. (Changed from [May I introduce to you Miss Armie Buff, age 12.] in the original release) Apollo: N-No way... Armie: Careful, soldier! Don't forget I could blow you away at a moment's notice! Athena: S-She's just too cute... Apollo: So... Have you always been in a wheelchair, Sarge? Armie: Negative. Only since I was injured... in the fire. Judge: Umm... Your voice sounds awfully different from before. Armie: My drone features a voice modulation device. It's just one of my army's many technological marvels. Judge: Well, you fooled me. I thought some twenty-something military fanatic was at the controls. Armie: I-If it's all the same to you, troops, I'd like to continue my testimony! I've just remembered something! And it's as crisp and clear as a trumpet at roll call. Apollo: What did you remember? Armie: It wasn't my mother who appeared in the burning orb. It was some lady Papa had shown me a picture of a long time ago. He said it was the Holy Mother, the founder of Khura'inism. She appeared right there, right in the burning orb! Apollo: Huh...?! Phoenix: What did you just say?! NOISE LEVEL0%BYE BYE Athena: The Holy Mother of Khura'inism was in the burning orb? Wh-What does that even mean? Phoenix: ...I have a bad feeling about this. Apollo: Could it be...? Could this explain what Sarge means by the Holy Mother appearing in the burning orb? Present Research Notes Apollo: Leads to: \"Dr. Buff's research notes? What do they have to do with this?\" Present anything else Apollo: Armie: What's that? Apollo: A piece of related evidence. Wouldn't you agree? Although, to be honest, I'd have to plead the fifth if you asked me how certain I was. Sarge: Private! Did you really think such a cockamamie plan would rout out the enemy?! Apollo: Yiiiiiikes! {I'd better be more careful!) Athena: If the orb was burning, maybe the evidence you're looking for has to do with fire. Apollo: Yeah, I know. Leads back to: \"Could this explain what Sarge means by the Holy Mother appearing in the burning orb?\" Athena: Dr. Buff's research notes? What do they have to do with this? Apollo: Look at this! The burning orb, the appearance of the founder -- this part points to both! Present third stanza of Song of Ceremony Apollo: Leads to: \"There's a legend about the orb involving a mysterious riddle.\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: It's all... right here! Athena: Umm.. I'm not seeing it. Apollo: Well, it's... Maybe you can explain it, Athena. Athena: I'M not the one who's supposed to explain things when YOU'RE the one presenting! Apollo: (Yikes, she's really mad. I'd better come up with something before her anger burns me to a crisp.) Leads back to: \"Look at this! The burning orb, the appearance of the founder -- this part points to both!\" Apollo: There's a legend about the orb involving a mysterious riddle. And this song, in turn, is said to contain the key to solving it. If the legend is true, then I believe the answer lies in this part of the song: \"Offer thy prayers as fervent as fire Only then shall the Holy Mother return.\" ...Well? Anyone see where I'm going with this? Phoenix: Prayers as fervent as fire... ...Ah! You're supposed to... set the orb on fire? Apollo: The whole stanza seems to suggest that the founder will appear if the orb is set on fire. Athena: ...Wait! S-So the doctor! He...! Apollo: ...Yes, Athena. He had solved the ancient riddle of the Founder's Orb! Judge: Oh, my! Armie: Papa was a great archeologist. So I believe in him... and I want to believe... I want to believe he achieved his long-time dream of solving that riddle before he died. Apollo: Well, we won't know for sure... until we try it for ourselves. Armie: Yes, do it, Private Justice. Please! I want to see what Papa was searching for with my own eyes! Phoenix: Phoenix: The, uh... The plaintiff must object to this! Apollo: Apollo: The plaintiff will stand down and be quiet! Phoenix: Phoenix: Y-You don't have the right to set a precious relic like that on fire! Apollo: Apollo: Oh, but I do. All I needed was Sarge's permission. Since we still don't know if this treasure if the Founder's Orb or the Crystal of Ami Fey... ...any ownership rights the doctor had now belong to his daughter. Therefore, you have absolutely no right to stop us! Phoenix ...Gnrk! Judge: Very well, Mr. Justice. I never thought I'd be saying this, but you may burn the evidence. Apollo: All right, here we go! Apollo: Look! Athena: A-Apollo! The inside of the orb... It's melting! Apollo: There's something in there... Ahhhhhhhhhh! Dh-Dhurke! Isn't she...? Dhurke: Her garb leaves no room for doubt. It's the founder herself! Face and all... Dhurke: I-I don't understand. The greatest of taboos in Khura'inism... ...is the depiction of the founder's face. Yet here it is, hidden within this orb! Founder's Orb updated in the Court Record. Apollo: Sorry, Mr. Wright, but as you can see, the issue is \"crystal\" clear. This figure is the Holy Mother, founder of Khura'inism. And based on that, this must be none other than the Founder's Orb! Phoenix: Phoenix: B-Be that as it may, Mr. Are'bal still may have killed the doctor! If so, it would render the Orb Transfer Agreement null and void! Apollo: Don't play dumb, Mr. Wright. The truth of the matter has already been proven! Dr. Buff wasn't killed right after Sarge saw Mr. Are'bal. It happened after the doctor came back from hiding the orb. And you've no proof that Mr. Are'bal was still around at the time! Phoenix: ...Urrrrrrrgh. Apollo: Your claim that the Defiant Dragons were behind the crime doesn't hold water. And that means the Orb Transfer Agreement is still perfectly valid. Phoenix: ...Arrrrrrrgh. Apollo: Admit it, Mr. Wright. I just burned your whole case to the ground! Phoenix: Ooh... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Apollo: (I won? I actually won?) Judge: M-Mr. Wright! Would you care to respond? Phoenix: .........R-Respond? ...Um... Apollo: (I didn't think so!) Athena: Wait, did we just win? Did we actually beat the Turnabout Terror?! You're amazing, Apollo! Atishon: Don't just stand there, Wright! Do something! Phoenix: ...Umm, well... I don't think there's any digging out of this hole. Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, I think it's time for your concession speech. I have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that this is the Founder's Orb. The facts don't lie, but you obviously do. How's that for a campaign slogan? Atishon: Wh-Why you contemptuous peasant...! Judge: ...Hmmm. I think this is a good time to wrap up this trial. If both parties have no further objections, I will render my verdict. Apollo: No objections here, Your Honor. Phoenix: Err... Um... No ob-- Atishon: Atishon: You can't do this. The crystal is mine! I'll lose the election if I lose that crystal! Phoenix: I'm sorry, but there's really nothing more I can do. Atishon: ...You haven't forgotten about our little chat... have you? Phoenix: ! .......... Apollo: (What's going on here?) Phoenix: Phoenix: ...Y-Your Honor. I...I object to the defense's last claim! Apollo: What?! Phoenix: I don't believe they have truly proven that the relic is indeed the Founder's Orb. Apollo: Apollo: Mr. Wright. I don't think even you could bluff your way out of this one! What possible argument could you have to claim that this isn't the Founder's Orb? Phoenix .........Um, about that... ...................Oh, of course! Apollo: .......... (H-He can't possibly have hit on something...) Phoenix The defense's assertion is incomplete, and here's why. Their claim that this relic is the Founder's Orb is based on a legend. (Changed from [The defense is basing their claim that this relic is the Founder's Orb on a legend.] in the original release) And that legend claims that the founder will return when the riddle is solved at last. Apollo: Right. And that's what happened. The founder was revealed for all to see. Phoenix: But Mr. Justice, what about the rest of the legend? Apollo: Huh? Phoenix: According to the legend, once the founder returned... ...she would bestow spiritual power onto the person who solved the riddle. Apollo: ..........Y-You're kidding, right? Phoenix: Well, Mr. Justice? Do you feel great spiritual power coursing through your veins? Apollo: Um.......... no. B-But receiving spiritual powers and stuff... It's all just mystic mumbo-jumbo, right? Phoenix: Maybe so, but you're the one basing your claim on said legend. And what we saw here does not fully fulfill it, does it? Apollo: N-No, but... Phoenix: Consequently... You cannot rightfully claim that this is the Founder's Orb! Judge: .......... Atishon: .......... Apollo: .......... .......... Apollo: (What's gotten into him? Why is Mr. Wright doing this?) Judge: Hmm... It would appear that Mr. Wright has lost a few of his marbles. Phoenix: ...Th-That couldn't be further from the truth, Your Honor. Judge: In any case... I believe this a good time for a recess. Both sides will have twenty minutes to prepare. (Changed from [I believe this a good time for a recess. Both sides will have 20 minutes to prepare.] in the original release) I ask that all arguments be ready by then. Oh, and Mr. Wright? You'd do well to wash up and find your missing marbles by then, too. Phoenix: .................... May 17District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Athena: Mr. Wright is sure acting funny. I mean, he's famous for going out on a limb, but that last assertion was just plain crazy. Apollo: It's either a bluff or a Hail Mary. Either way, it doesn't make much sense. Trucy: ...Maybe there's something we're missing here. Although, he seemed perfectly normal when we spoke earlier. Athena: ...Apollo, I have a bad feeling about this. I'm going to go check up on him. Apollo: (What's going on with you, Mr. Wright...?) ???: Hey. Private Justice. Apollo: ...Oh, Sarge. Armie: I forgot to mention something. O-On the night of Papa's murder, a strange thing happened. Apollo: Oh? But why are you only telling me about it now? Armie: Well... I didn't say anything before because I thought Papa's death was an accident. But now that we know otherwise, I figured it might be important. Apollo: (There's still more to this case?) Armie: When I left my room and lost consciousness, I passed out right here. Apollo: That's right above the coffee bar. Armie: Mm-hm. But when I came to... ...someone was pushing my wheelchair. Apollo: What?! Armie: I was so scared, I beat a hasty retreat -- as fast as my wheels could take me! Apollo: Do you know who it was? Armie: No. It was pitch black. Plus, I fled to my room so fast, I didn't even have a chance to turn on the lights. Apollo: Maybe it was your father. Armie: No, he would have said something to me. Besides, I'd have known if it was him. Apollo: So then, it could've been... ...your father's real killer? Armie: My thoughts exactly. Apollo: But you didn't report this to the police? Armie: ...I-It didn't even occur to me. Apollo: It's okay. You were obviously still upset, so don't bear yourself up over it. Dhurke: Apollo, this could be really important information. I think the act of pushing Sarge's wheelchair could be part of some bigger scheme. It's hard to see why else the killer would do such a thing. Apollo: (Guess I should take her statement down as evidence.) Armie's Statement added to the Court Record. Apollo: Oh, welcome back, Athena. ...Hm? (What's with the long face?) Athena: .......... Apollo: How'd it go with Mr. Wright? Athena: .......... What should I...? Apollo: Athena? Athena: Oops, sorry! Zoned out there for a sec. The recess is almost over, so let's go! Ha, a-ha ha. Apollo: ........ (What was that all about?) May 17District Court - Courtroom No. 6 Judge: All right. Court is, once again, back in session. Now, umm... Mr. Wright. About that last objection you raised... Phoenix: We, the plaintiffs, still believe that the defense has yet to sufficiently prove its case. They claim that, according to legend, the Founder's Orb would bestow spiritual power... ...yet the relic in question has failed to do so. Therefore, it has failed its own test. Judge: I-I see... Apollo: (He's sticking with that ridiculous argument?) Phoenix: Furthermore... ...even if is the Founder's Orb, it can't be awarded to the Defiant Dragons. After all, they were the ones who killed Dr. Buff. Apollo: Apollo: What are you talking about? That was already proven to be false. There are no grounds for asserting that the Defiant Dragons murdered the doctor! Phoenix: Oh, but I'm afraid there are, Mr. Justice. ...Your Honor. I would like to present new testimony to this court. Testimony that will show that Datz Are'bal did, in fact, kill Dr. Buff! Apollo: What?! Judge: Very well. You may call your witness. Athena: I guess Mr. Wright found another new angle. Apollo: What new testimony could there be this late in the game? Atishon: Fellow citizens! It is I, Paul Atishon, the once and future representative of the people! Apollo: (Jeez, not him again.) Phoenix: My client divulged new information to me during the recess. He remembered something he saw, you see -- something crucial to this case. Apollo: (How very convenient...) Witness Testimony -- Datz's Crime -- Atishon: It was around 11 at night, and I was out on a mobile meet-and-greet around the village. That's when I saw Dr. Buff being murdered from outside his study window! Mr. Are'bal snuck up from behind and struck him on the head. His weapon of choice: a suitcase. A big, strong man like him could easily swing a heavy suitcase into someone's head. Apollo: You saw the murder as it happened?! And you're just telling us now because...? Atishon: Heh heh heh. I saved the best for last. It's a tactic known to all the political greats. Phoenix: The murder weapon was a complete mystery... ...but my client's eyewitness account has finally brought it to light. Judge: According to the autopsy report... ...Dr. Buff was struck in the head by the corner of some object. I suppose that could very well be the corner of a suitcase. Apollo: Apollo: But eyewitness testimony isn't the same as hard evidence! Phoenix: Oh, I wouldn't worry about that if I were you. Apollo: What's that supposed to mean? Phoenix: We have physical evidence, too. A luminol test revealed... ...the doctor's blood on Mr. Are'bal's suitcase. Apollo: R-Really?! But how does that prove that Mr. Are'bal used it as a weapon? Phoenix: Phoenix: You should know the answer to that, Mr. Justice. Since you know was well as I that the suitcase is covered in his fingerprints. Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! (I forgot we'd dusted it right in front of Ema!) Athena: The Turnabout Terror strikes again. Judge: Hmm... This is quite convincing testimony and evidence. Nevertheless, you may proceed with your cross-examination, Mr. Justice. Cross Examination -- Datz's Crime -- Atishon: It was around 11 at night, and I was out on a mobile meet-and-greet around the village. Press Apollo: Apollo: You were on a so-called \"mobile-meet-and-greet\" at 11 at night? Atishon: That's right. It's the perfect time because everyone is at home. You should have seen how the villagers' eyes teared up when they heard what I had to say. Apollo: (With tears of frustration, no doubt.) You weren't riding around in your palanquin? Atishon: That's right. Some village idiot reported me to the police. I've been banned from using it after dark. Athena: No wonder, what with all the noise he makes. Apollo: So, what exactly did you see, then? Atishon: That's when I saw Dr. Buff being murdered from outside his study window! Press Apollo: Apollo: Sounds like you witnessed something rather shocking. Atishon: Indeed. I didn't even believe it at first. I mean, a vicious murder, in Kurain? Apollo: There haven't been many murders there, I take it? Atishon: If I'm elected, I promise you that such a terrible tragedy will never happen again! A vote for me is a vote to banish murder forever from our beloved Kurain Village! Apollo: (Yeah, good luck with that.) Judge: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, please tell the court what you saw at the scene of the crime. Atishon: Mr. Are'bal snuck up from behind and struck him on the head. Press Apollo: Apollo: He snuck up from behind? So you're saying the doctor never even realized Mr. Are'bal was there? Atishon: That's right. He was utterly absorbed in a book. Apollo: ...I see. What did you see Mr. Are'bal do next? Atishon: He climbed up the bookshelf ladder and dumped a bunch of books down on the body. I believe he was trying to make it look like an accident. But that idiot didn't realize I could see everything from outside the window. Apollo: (One of those statements doesn't feel right.) Your Honor, I believe the witness made an important statement just now about how... The crime was clearly visible Apollo: If the crime was visible through the window, that's earth-shattering testimony! Judge: ...Is it? Because to my ears, it sounds like a rather obvious fact. Apollo: ...Oh, sorry. I'm good, then. Judge: Hmmm... Very well. Will the witness please continue with his testimony? Leads back to cross-examination The doctor was reading a book Apollo: The doctor was reading a book at the time of the murder...? That's vital testimony! Judge: Very well. The witness will please add that statement to his testimony. Adds statement \"The doctor was standing in front of the bookshelves, absorbed in a book.\" if not already added Datz is an idiot Apollo: The witness said Mr. Are'bal is an idiot. That's a key piece of information! Datz: Don't you jump on the bandwagon, AJ! I'm no idiot, you hear! Judge: Hmm... I fail to see how that is a key piece of information. Apollo: ...Yeah, I guess it's not, is it? Judge: Then it seems there is no need to add it into the witness's testimony. So let's get on with it, shall we? Leads back to cross-examination Atishon: The doctor was standing in front of the bookshelves, absorbed in a book. Press Apollo: Apollo: You watched a murderer commit his crime and did nothing to stop it? That doesn't sound like a good way to score points with the voting public. Atishon: I'm a politician, not a superhero! I'm under no obligation to risk life and limb. Athena: He's sure quick to deny his obligations when there's nothing in it for him. Apollo: I'm getting tired of listening to his endless campaigning and flimsy rationalizations. Phoenix: About your testimony, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson... You said Mr. Are'bal struck the doctor from behind when he was absorbed in a book. Atishon: Yes, that's exactly what happened. Present Doctor's Reading Glasses Apollo: Leads to: \"The doctor was standing in front of the bookshelves, absorbed in a book, you say?\" Atishon: His weapon of choice: a suitcase. Press Apollo: Apollo: Are you sure? Atishon: Positive. I saw it with my own two eyes. Apollo: Yet, despite your certainty, you kept quiet about it until now? Atishon: No, I was waiting. I knew there would be a perfect chance to talk about it later. Information must always be disclosed in a strategic manner. That is one of the lessons of kingcraft, as taught by the Atishon clan. Apollo: (Is there a lesson, by chance, in the Atishon Kingcraft Guidebook on being honest?) Atishon: Anyway, I saw Mr. Are'bal commit that heinous crime. Atishon: A big, strong man like him could easily swing a heavy suitcase into someone's head. Press Apollo: Apollo: I would have to agree, that suitcase is really heavy. ...Wait a second. How did you know it was so heavy? For all you knew, it could've been empty. Atishon: Gnrk! Phoenix: Phoenix: My client witnessed the crime in progress. So naturally, he saw Mr. Are'bal straining to lift what was obviously a heavy suitcase. I can't say I'm a fan of you trying to discredit my client by tripping him up, Mr. Justice. Apollo: (But I'm just doing what you always do, Mr. Wright!) Before adding statement Athena: Talk about new testimony. He's totally changed his story. Apollo: If he had really seen the murder taking place, you'd think he'd have said so from the start. Athena: Maybe he had some reason to hide what he really saw? Apollo: (If so, that might be our only opening.) After adding statement Athena: Dr. Buff was struck from behind while he was absorbed in a book? He must've been really into it. Apollo: Hmm... It doesn't add up. Athena: What doesn't? Apollo: (That Paul Atishon is lying. I'm sure of it.) Apollo: The doctor was standing in front of the bookshelves, absorbed in a book, you say? I'm sorry, but it seems your testimony is completely unreliable. Atishon: That's quite a bold statement. Well, let's hear you back it up. I challenge you to prove that I am anything but one hundred percent reliable. (Changed from [I challenge you to prove that I am anything but 100% reliable.] in the original release) Apollo: It would be my pleasure. Lately, it seems that the doctor's eyes had gotten so bad, he needed reading glasses. However, his reading glasses were over on his desk. So you see, there's no way he could've been reading a book in front of the bookshelves! Atishon: Hrrrrrrngh! Apollo: I'm sorry, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, but... ...I'm going to have to ask you to explain this discrepancy to the voting public! Atishon: Ngah, gah gah gah! I-I-I... Apollo: You what? Atishon: I-I'll explain it, you lowly cur! I simply made a mistake, you see. The doctor was actually sitting at his desk when Mr. Are'bal hit him over the head! Apollo: But then the doctor would have been facing him. Surely he would've seen him and tried to run? Atishon: D-Dr. Buff was nodding off! I could tell because he his eyes were closed, and he wasn't moving! Apollo: (Sounds more like what you would do.) Then how do you explain the back that he was struck in the back of the head? Isn't that something that should be impossible from the front of the desk? Atishon: ...Oh, um... About that... H-He... He bowed his head when he nodded off. That's when he was clobbered. Judge: Hmm... So that's what you saw. Well, Mr. Justice, that sounds like a perfectly reasonable explanation to me. Do you have a problem with the proposal that the doctor was struck while nodding off? No problem Apollo: No problem here, Your Honor. The doctor was probably dozing, just as the witness said. Athena: N-No, Apollo! Wait! If you accept that, then you might as well admit Datz killed the doctor. Apollo: ...Your Honor! I, uh, actually do have a problem with that statement... Judge: Very well. But let's avoid careless answers like that, or I will have a problem with you! Apollo: (Guess I blew that one.) Judge: Now, as you were saying, Mr. Justice? Leads to: \"There is a problem. A very big problem.\" A big problem Leads to: \"There is a problem. A very big problem.\" Apollo: There is a problem. A very big problem. The witness's statement doesn't hold up under the slightest bit of scrutiny! Judge: Is that so? Then will you please show this court what evidence you have to justify this? Apollo: Gladly, Your Honor. This shows the problem with the witness's claim that he saw the doctor nodding off! Present Study Diagram Apollo: Leads to: \"...A diagram of the study?\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: This shows the glaring problem with the witness's statement! Atishon: ...............Zzz... Apollo: See? The witness has passed out from the overwhelming power of my evidence! Phoenix: No, Mr. Justice. Your lackadaisical attempt to refute him put my client to sleep. That's all. Judge: I feel a yawn coming on myself. Perhaps giving you this penalty will wake me up. Apollo: Surely there are better ways to stay awake, Your Honor? Athena: Apollo, think about the relative positions of the witness and doctor again. Apollo: Right. That's where we'll find the contradiction. Judge: Now then, Mr. Justice. See that you avoid these snooze-incusing answers in the future. Leads back to: \"This shows the problem with the witness's claim that he saw the doctor nodding off!\" Judge: ...A diagram of the study? Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson allegedly viewed the murder from... ...here. And the doctor was allegedly nodding off... ...here. But from his vantage point, the bookcase would've blocked the witness's line of sight. Judge: Why, yes, I believe you're right! Atishon: B-B-But...! Arrrgh! Phoenix: Phoenix: The fact remains, my client knew that the suitcase was the murder weapon. So he definitely had first-hand knowledge of the crime scene! Apollo: I'm afraid I have to agree with you there, Mr. Wright. But then we have to ask ourselves, from what vantage point did he see the murder? Phoenix: What are you insinuating, Mr. Justice? Apollo: From what vantage point could Mr. Atishon-Wimperson have seen the dozing doctor? Once we determine that, I believe we'll finally see the truth behind this incident. The witness saw the murder from... right here! Present area between Bookshelf and Coffee Bar Apollo: Leads to: \"You've got to be kidding!\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Phoenix: How could he have seen it from there? Apollo: Oh, umm... He just did somehow? I mean, I just feel like it must've been from there. Athena: Um, Apollo? for some reason, I feel like you're wrong. Judge: Hmm... And for some reason, I feel like giving you a penalty. Apollo: (So much for that spot.) Athena: Hmm... Looking at it in another way... ...where must Mr. Atishon-Wimperson have been standing to see the doctor nodding off? Apollo: Someplace where the bookcase wasn't blocking his view, I guess. Judge: Now then. Will the defense please indicate where the witness saw the murder from? Leads back to: \"The witness saw the murder from... right here!\" Phoenix: You've got to be kidding! Judge: B-But that's--! Apollo: It is indeed. But everything only makes sense if the witness was there in the study. Athena: I-Inside the study? But that's the scene of the crime! Apollo: I know. Mr. Atishon-Wimperson -- the man who claims to be a witness to the murder... ...was most certainly in that very room. Athena: A-Apollo, are you suggesting...? Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson! Weren't YOU the one who actually swung that suitcase? Atishon: Gaaaaaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Phoenix: What you're proposing is ludicrous! My client is a small, thin man, whereas Mr. Are'bal had the musculature to pull it off. Apollo: ......... (He has a point... I gave up trying to lift that thing after one go.) Atishon: That's right. He's the only one who could've lifted such a heavy object. Now do you understand? The rebel Datz Are'bal is the doctor's killer! Athena: As long as the suitcase is the murder weapon, the suspicion falls entirely on Datz. You'll have to poke a hole in Mr. Wright's argument somehow, Apollo. Apollo: Oh, I will. And with his own technique, no less. If Mr. Atishon-Wimperson couldn't swing the suitcase around... ...we'll just have to consider another way he could've used it as a murder weapon instead. I'm going to turn this case on its head, Mr. Wright, just like you taught me. Phoenix: ...You talk big, Mr. Justice, but do you have what it takes? Judge: Well, this should be interesting... Apollo:: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson's testimony has been filled with one inaccuracy after another. First he stated Dr. Buff was in front of the bookshelves. Now he claims that the doctor was sitting at his desk. So where was the victim REALLY when he was killed? Also, where was his killer, and how was the murder weapon REALLY used? Judge: So the important thing here is the position of the victim and killer related to each other? Apollo: Yes, Your Honor. If they were positioned a certain way... ...it would be possible to use the suitcase as a weapon without lifting a finger. Phoenix: You can't mean...! Apollo: I would ask the court to recall the study's layout. It's quite distinctive, as you can see. Now, if Dr. Buff were sitting in a certain spot, and his killer was at a certain other spot... ...the suitcase would become a weapon ANYONE could use! Judge: Hmm... Very well, Mr. Justice. Where was Dr. Buff's killer at the time of the crime? Present balcony west of Coffee Bar Apollo: Leads to: \"Th-There...?!\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Judge: How could the murder have been committed from there? Phoenix: Yes, I would love to see a demonstration. Apollo: ...Um, well... I can't from here. Judge: Well, I have a demonstration for you from here... on how to give a penalty. Apollo: (So much for that spot.) Athena: If the killer didn't swing the suit case, there aren't many other ways to use it as a weapon. Apollo: I know. And there aren't that many places to use it from, either. Judge: Now then. I hope the defense is ready to try again. Leads back to: \"Where was Dr. Buff's killer at the time of the crime?\" Judge: Th-There...?! Phoenix: Oh... That's... Apollo: This should wrap things up nice and pretty for you, Mr. Wright. I would ask the court to recall the study's layout. But this time, instead of thinking in two dimensions... ...let's think in three. Only then can we clearly see the killer's method at work. The killer didn't have to swing the suitcase. ...If he used gravity to his advantage, that is. That's right. It was the plaintiff -- one Paul Atishon-Wimperson -- who used the suitcase. He pushed it from the second floor... ...and sent it hurtling down onto Dr. Buff, who was sitting at the coffee bar! Atishon: Yaaaaaaargh! Apollo: That psychology book had been at the coffee bar, no doubt. The doctor must have set it down there after he'd finished reading it, or the like. But his blood got on it, which is why the killer thought to hide it in that mountain of books! Phoenix: Phoenix: That's quite an entertaining theory you have there, Mr. Justice. But there's no evidence that the murder took place at the coffee bar. Apollo: ......... (I'm not so sure about that, Mr. Wright. I'd say that evidence of the murder occurring at the coffee bar...) Exists Leads to: \"The evidence does exist, and I'm going to show you.\" Does not exist Apollo: Obviously, there is none! Phoenix: Just as I thought. So, if the coffee bar isn't where the doctor was killed... ...the defense's little theory fails to bear fruit Judge: Hmm... Mr. Wright is correct, of course. Apollo: Urk! ...Umm... Athena: Don't just stand there, Apollo! If you don't do something quick, we're going to lose both the orb AND the creep, together! Apollo: I'm thinking... I'm thinking... Oh! (Wait a second... There IS a piece of evidence that proves the doctor was killed at the coffee bar!) Phoenix: So, such evidence never existed in the first place, did it? Leads to: \"The evidence does exist, and I'm going to show you.\" Apollo: The evidence does exist, and I'm going to show you. Phoenix: Y-You are? Apollo: This, right here, is proof that the murder took place at the coffee bar. Present stained book Apollo: Leads to: \"This brown stain was determined to be coffee.\" Present anything else Apollo: Judge: Hmm... I don't understand how that could be proof of anything. Apollo: You don't, Your Honor? Well, I believe Mr. Wright understands perfectly. Phoenix: All I know is, it's perfectly clear you don't understand what you're talking about. Judge: Now that is something I can understand. Apollo: (Me too... Oww.) Athena: Apollo, let's take another look at that crime scene photo. Maybe there's something in it related to the coffee bar. Apollo: I've got it this time! Leads back to: \"This, right here, is proof that the murder took place at the coffee bar.\" Apollo: This brown stain was determined to be coffee. What's more, it was still a bit damp when we saw it yesterday morning. Phoenix: Ah! Apollo: One look at this book speaks volumes, I'm afraid, Mr. Wright. It tells us the doctor was having a cup of coffee at the coffee bar. That's when the suitcase came hurtling down, striking him on the head... ...causing both his blood and his coffee to spatter onto it! Phoenix: Ack! Atishon: Aaaaaaagh! Apollo: Well, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson?! Atishon: .........Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh... What motive could I have possibly had to kill Dr. Buff?! Apollo: (And there it is. That final excuse cornered killers are so fond of.) Well, the doctor never returned your \"crystal\" to you, did he? Instead, he hid it in the cave ruins. Atishon: Nngh... Apollo: Telling him that the Defiant Dragons were a dangerous bunch was a huge blunder. All it did was make him hide the orb. Your lie came back to bite you in the end. Atishon: Uhhh... Apollo: Even worse, the doctor saw the news reports, so he knew the relic was the Founder's Orb. Being the conscientious researcher he was, he knew he had to return it to its rightful place... ...and that meant keeping it out of your hands. Atishon: Aaaaaaaaaaaaah... Apollo: You were so angry that he refused to return the relic to you... ...that you killed him with your own hands. Isn't that right, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Atishon: Arrrrrraaaaaagh! .........I-I-I... Th-That is... Phoenix: Phoenix: ...A-Apollo! Don't! Please don't accuse my client of murder! Apollo: .........Huh? What do you mean, \"don't accuse him\"? Why would you even say that, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: ...Er, what I meant was, um... He's a promising politician with a bright future ahead of him. It's in our nation's best interests to avoid burdening him with the taint of scandal. Apollo: Say what? Atishon: Wright! You'd better do something to change the current courtroom climate... ...or I'll be charged with murder! And you know what will happen to her if that happens. Phoenix: ...Arngh! Apollo: (What's he talking about? Well, I can ponder that later. For now...) Mr. Wright, you can't possibly believe that Mr. Are'bal is the killer. Are you really going to send an innocent man to prison? I thought you were better than that. Phoenix: Uhhh... Ummm... Apollo: Well, Mr. Wright? Answer me! Phoenix: Errr... Ummm... UUHWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH! Apollo: M-M-Mr. Wright? ...What in the world's going on here? Athena: ......... Apollo: ...If you won't say anything, then...! Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, the defense hereby accuses you of-- Athena: Athena: A-Apollo! Wait! Apollo: Not you, too, Athena! Athena: Umm... It's just, uhhh... I wasn't sure whether I should say anything, but... ...during that last recess, when I went to check on Mr. Wright... ...I overheard something I shouldn't have. Phoenix: I trust Maya is unharmed. Atishon: I can't really say. But just remember... If I'm arrested or fail to obtain the treasure... ...there will be consequences. Consequences of the worst kind, if you catch my drift. Phoenix: Augh! Atishon: Relax. All you have to do is ensure I get my hands on that relic. I must deliver it to my benefactor at all costs. Phoenix: What do they want that relic for anyway? Atishon: Heh heh heh. It's something to do with an old legend. My patron seeks the great power said to be granted to whoever solves its secret. Apollo: ....Maya? As in Maya Fey? Athena: Yes, the boss's legendary former assistant. Apollo: Ms. Fey's being held hostage? Athena: So it seems. Apollo: Why didn't you tell me as soon as you heard this? Athena: Sorry. It's just, Mr. Wright spotted me before I could slip away... ...and made me promise not to tell you. He said it would make things more difficult if you found out. Apollo: Arngh! As if things weren't already hard enough! (So that's why Mr. Wright was acting so strange. I had no idea. This must've been excruciating for him. Think, Justice... There's got to be something you can do!) Judge: Mr. Justice, about that last statement of yours... I believe you were in the middle of accusing the plaintiff of murdering Dr. Buff... Would you care to continue? Apollo: Ack! I-I... Phoenix: Nngh... I'm sorry, Apollo... I'm really, really sorry. Judge: What's gotten into you two? Apollo: ......... (If I accuse that slimebag, I put Ms. Fey's life in jeopardy.) Atishon: Heh heh heh. It seems you've finally caught on. I'm far too important to be accused of murder. After all, our nation's future rests squarely on my shoulders. Apollo: (Nnrgh... Either I give up, or...) Atishon: Once I present the crystal to my patron, my victory is assured! Then one day, I'll become president -- and then, king! I'll have every politician at my command! Now, retract your accusation! Apollo: Arrrrrrnnngh! (I can't kowtow to him, but... but...) The defense would... It would like to retract... the previous accusati-- ???: Dhurke: ...Apollo. Apollo: Dh-Dhurke? Dhurke: I don't know what's going on here... ...but a lawyer should never look the way you do right now... ... with \"defeat\" and \"resignation\" written all over your face. Apollo: ! .........A dragon never yields. Dhurke: Even when wounded, a dragon bites down hard, and never lets go till its dying breath. It glares, it roars, and it latches its jaws firmly onto its prey till the bitter end. That's what lawyers do to get to the truth! Apollo: ...Dhurke. (A dragon never yields... ...He's right. It's all over if I give up now! If Mr. Wright's hands are tied, it's up to me to do what must be done! He's saved my neck so many times. Now... it's my turn to save his!) ...Dhurke, thanks for that wake up call. Dhurke: Heh, now that's the face of a lawyer you've got there, son. Apollo: (Where there's a will, there's a way. And I'm going to find the way to save Ms. Fey AND see that justice is served!) Apollo: That scumbag is holding Ms. Fey hostage to ensure he gets the orb for his patron. And it seems said patron believes in the orb's legend. Thing is, the founder DID appear when the orb was exposed to fire, as the legend said. If the legend is true, then we've already solved the riddle, right? Yes, we have Apollo: Yes, we've definitely solved the riddle! ...And yet... ...we still don't understand what the part about \"bestowing power\" is talking about. I need to rethink this! Leads back to: \"If the legend is true, then we've already solved the riddle, right?\" No, not yet Leads to: \"We have not solved the riddle yet\" We have not solved the riddle yet Apollo: The legend says that the founder will bestow great spiritual power when she returns. But if that's true, it means we haven't solved the whole riddle yet. But how can that be? Are we missing something? ...Wait, maybe... Maybe the part about the founder returning should be taken literally. But how would it be possible for a dead person to return to the world of the living? Cloning Apollo: Oh, I know! Cloning technology! I bet some of the founder's DNA is hidden somewhere in the orb. ...Argh, what am I talking about? They didn't know about DNA and cloning back then. I'd better think of something else. Leads back to: \"But how would it be possible for a dead person to return to the world of the living?\" Channeling Leads to: \"The founder can return though channeling\" Time travel Apollo: Oh, I know! Time travel! We could go back to the past and bring the founder here to the present. ...Wait, what am I saying? Maybe I should cut back on the sci-fi movies. I'd better think of something else. Leads back to: \"But how would it be possible for a dead person to return to the world of the living?\" The founder can return though channeling Apollo: Oh, I know! here IS a way for the dead to return -- spirit channeling! Of course, you'd have to know what he founder looks like first... ...but the orb has revealed her face to us, so what if it's a sign that we should channel her? Given the facts, in order to solve the riddle and receive the founder's power, I'd need... A spirit medium Leads to: \"A MEDIUM IS NEEDED TO OBTAIN THE POWER\" To practice channeling Apollo: All I have to do is train as a spirit medium, so I can channel spirits myself! ...Wait, it can't be that easy. And if I ever did become a medium, I wouldn't need the founder's power anymore anyway. Leads back to: \"Given the facts, in order to solve the riddle and receive the founder's power, I'd need...\" A MEDIUM IS NEEDED TO OBTAIN THE POWER Apollo: The ability of a medium to channel spirits is the final key to unlocking the orb's secret. That means Mr. Atishon-Wimperson's patron will need one, too. And once that slimy politician realizes that, he won't be able to lay a finger on Ms. Fey! Apollo: Everything is going to be okay, Mr. Wright. Because Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson can't afford to harm a hair on Ms. Fey's head. Phoenix: ............Huh? Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson! It seems you've chosen the wrong person to take hostage. Atishon: Wh-What do you mean? Apollo: Your patron seeks to solve the orb's riddle... ...and thereby receive great spiritual power. However, only Maya Fey can truly give them what they really want. Phoenix: She can? Atishon: What do you mean, \"only Maya Fey\"? Apollo: Think about what the return of the founder really means. We should have considered it more literally. After all, the orb was made in the Kingdom of Khura'in -- the birthplace of spirit mediums. Phoenix: ...Ahh, I think I see now. You need to know what the deceased looks like in order to channel them. But in Khura'inism, depicting the face of the founder is taboo. However, her true face was hidden in the orb. So maybe the orb is telling us... to try channeling the founder. Apollo: Exactly. Through a spirit medium, the founder can quite literally return. And if the legend is true... ...the founder just might bestow spiritual power on someone when she does. Phoenix: It's like when Pearls imbued my magatama with spiritual power. If a human could be imbued with such power in a similar manner... Dhurke: It is said the founder possesses immense spiritual power. Such a great feat would not necessarily be beyond her-- W-Wait a second! Th-Then the legend is true?! Apollo: Do you understand now, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? You are holding hostage the final key to unlocking the orb's secret. And if anything were to happen to her, the riddle would remain unsolved, forever! Atishon: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Atishon: Atishon: Th-Th-There's always Pearl Fey! I could simply ask her to help! If she wants money, I have plenty to offer! Apollo: She's not the kind of person to be tempted by material gain. And she certainly wouldn't help you if anything were to happen to her cousin. Atishon: Urhgk. Apollo: Or maybe you'd like to go ask the queen of Khura'in to channel the founder for you. Phoenix: He could, but he'd probably get executed for requesting such a thing. Apollo: ...It's over. Now, confess! You killed Dr. Buff, didn't you? Atishon: Ack! Hrrrrrrrrrrrrrngh! It wasn't supposed to end this way! Judge: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. Are you admitting to committing the crime? Atishon: Errr... Um, I-I-I... You're my lawyer, Wright! Do something! Phoenix: It's true that I'm your lawyer. And as such, it's my job to defend you. ...However, defending my client isn't the only job a lawyer has. There's something else that's equally as important. And that is finding the truth. Atishon: Wh-What? Phoenix Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, you have sought to twist the truth in the dirtiest of ways. I was complicit in your hostage-taking, but in a way, I was being held hostage, too. Even so, there's still time for me to make things right. And I owe it all to you, Apollo. Apollo: ! (Mr. Wright...) Phoenix: I can't allow a murderer to walk away scot-free! Therefore, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, I must resign as your attorney. Atishon: No no no no noooo! D-Does this mean... I'm under arrest? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! ........................ ............... .................................... ........................ Apollo: ...Well? Atishon: ...I've nothing to confess. Apollo: What?! Atishon: I said, I've nothing to confess! I don't and I won't, especially not to a plebeian like you! Apollo: (This guy doesn't know when to give up.) Atishon: Besides, there's no truth to these allegations! I mean, look at the suitcase. You won't find a single print of mine on it! Apollo: All that means is that you wiped them off, taking care to only leave Mr. Are'bal's. Atishon: Heh heh heh. As many a great politician has said before me: no comment. Phoenix: In that case, try switching things up, Apollo. Look at the situation from a different angle. Is there really nothing that points to the suitcase being dropped from up above? Apollo: Hmmm... Evidence that points to the suitcase being dropped from the second floor... Athena: Hmm... If the killer pushed the suitcase from the second floor hallway over the coffee bar... ...that would place him right around here. Apollo: Ah! Maybe... Just maybe...! Phoenix: Thought of something, Apollo? Apollo: I believe this piece of evidence to be connected to the dropping of the suitcase. Present Armie's Statement Apollo: Leads to: \"That... appears to be a statement. But how is that related to this case?\" Present anything else Apollo: Atishon: Wh-What is that?! Phoenix: Apollo, I don't see how that could possibly be related. Atishon: ...Oh, it's not? Tsk, I just wasted a perfectly good reaction! Your Honor! Penalize this pernicious peon! Judge: Hmm.. Yes, well, we all must be held accountable for our words and actions. Apollo: (What do you think I'm trying to do with Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, Your Honor?!) Athena: So the killer dropped the suitcase from above the coffee bar. Apollo: Right. Let's look again to see if we have any evidence related to that event. Phoenix: Come on, Apollo. I'm counting on you. Leads back to: \"I believe this piece of evidence to be connected to the dropping of the suitcase.\" Judge: That... appears to be a statement. But how is that related to this case? Apollo: On the night of the murder, Your Honor, Miss Armie Buff physically left her room. That's when she saw the doctor burning the orb, and subsequently passed out. ...Right above the coffee bar. But with her there in her wheelchair... ...the killer wouldn't have been able to drop the suitcase down onto the doctor. Phoenix: Good point! Apollo: However, according to Sarge... ...she woke up just as someone was trying to move her in her wheelchair. Phoenix: Ah! Armie: ...someone was pushing my wheelchair. Apollo: What?! Armie: I was so scared, I beat a hasty retreat -- as fast as my wheels could take me! Apollo: She must've been in the killer's way and had to be moved. Isn't that right, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Atishon: ...Agrk! Phoenix: And if the killer had pushed the wheelchair with his bare hands... ...we may yet find the conclusive evidence we need. Apollo: Exactly. Fortunately for us, that evidence slipped right through the killer's fingers. If only he'd been able to hold on to it just a little tighter. But now, he is neither able to discard nor alter it. Phoenix: Honestly, that piece of evidence wasn't even supposed to be here in this courtroom today. And yet... it looks like sometimes, things DO get better. Atishon: Unngh! B-B-B-B-But...! Th-This... This wasn't supposed to happen! Apollo: No? Well, too bad. Because the evidence that sped away from you that night... ...has come back to haunt you! Right here at this very trial! Atishon: ARGH! UHWAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! Apollo: Your Honor! The defense's final piece of evidence is on this person! Present Armie Buff profile Apollo: Leads to: \"Th-That's...!\" Present anyone else Apollo: Phoenix: ...Apollo? Apollo: Yes, Mr. Wright? Athena: Umm, I think he's saying that that doesn't jive with anything you've said so far. Judge: It seems Ms. Cykes is the more sensible of you two. Apollo: (Ugh... No need to compare the two of us...) Phoenix: What did the killer have to move in order to drop the suitcase? Consider that, and the rest should follow. Apollo: Okay, I'll get it for sure this time! Leads back to: \"Your Honor! The defense's final piece of evidence is on this person!\" Atishon: Th-That's...! Apollo: On the night of the murder, Sarge passed out... ...only to come to and find that someone was pushing her wheelchair. That's when she fled back into her room. Phoenix: She didn't physically see a single soul after that... Not until Athena drew her out through that therapy session, that is. Apollo: While the killer was able to wipe the prints on the suitcase off... (Changed from [While the killer was able to wipe the prints on the suitcase...] in the original release) ...the same can't be said for the prints that got away. Atishon: Ah. Ah. M-My fellow Kurainians... Apollo: Well, Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson? Try to explain your way out of this one! The podium is all yours! Atishon: Ah. Ah. P-Paul Atishon, savior of Kurain... I-I... I am not a crook... I... My political career...! It can't end like this! I-I'm destined for great things! Something's wrong... This isn't real! It's a dream! No, a nightmare! Ooooooooooooh. Huh? What? ...Wait? ...Really? Ah! Election ResultsWINNER Atishon: Ahhhhhh! Whoa, no waaaaaaaaay!!! BANZAI! BANZAI! BANZAI! BANZAI!!! Breaking NewsPaul Atishon arrested on murder charges and stripped of his electoral win. Atishon: ...Wait, what? ...............No, please. Wait. Don't go! No... No... Please...Whoa! Grandpaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! ........................ Judge: M-Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Are you all right? ...B-Bailiff! Get him to the first-aid station, on the double! Judge: Well, this was yet another unexpected turn of events. In light of everything that's been revealed, it seems that this relic is indeed the Founder's Orb. And it seems Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson can be considered a suspect in Dr. Buff's murder. Phoenix: Apollo, I want to thank you for everything. Apollo: ! Phoenix: Thanks to you, I didn't have to keep bending the truth. I don't know what I would've done without you. Apollo: Er, don't mention it, ha ha ha... Athena: You were amazing today, Apollo! Apollo: (Well, I couldn't have done it without Dhurke.) .........A dragon never yields. Dhurke: Even when wounded, a dragon bites down hard, and never lets go till its dying breath. It glares, it roars, and it latches its jaws firmly onto its prey till the bitter end. That's what lawyers do to get the truth! Apollo: (A dragon never yields... Every lawyer should take that to heart.) Judge: As it seems both sides have no further objections... ...would Dhurke Sahdmadhi please take the stand? Dhurke: .......... Judge: This court awards the orb to the Defiant Dragons per the stated transfer agreement. Should the Kingdom of Khura'in claim ownership... ...the matter may have to be deliberated in court all over again. I just hope, or shall I say pray, that I'm not the judge presiding over that one! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Indeed! A trial like that might spark an international incident. Still, there are bigger and more momentous things astir in the air! Apollo: (The revolution... Dhurke's really serious about this.) Judge: This court is adjourned! May 17District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Dhurke: Nice work, son! We've finally broken through the last obstacle on the road to revolution! Apollo: Revolution... It just doesn't seem real. Dhurke: Yes, well, to think you actually defeated the Fighting Phoenix... All I can say is, that's my boy! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (Well, Mr. Wright did have his hands tied. Who knows if I'd have won if he'd been able to fight me head-on.) Athena: I see it more like you saved Mr. Wright. Apollo: ...Saved him? Athena: Yeah, remember what he said? He didn't have to bend the truth anymore, and it was all thanks to you! Apollo: I don't know about that. (Still, I guess it IS kinda nice to be appreciated.) Trucy: ...Um, Mr. Dhurke? Now that the Holy Mother's face has been revealed... ...are you going to have a spirit medium try channeling her? I, for one, would love to see the return of the legendary founder! Apollo: Yeah, just think about it. Being able to speak to someone right out of the history books... Dhurke: Unfortunately, it's not that easy. Apollo: What? Why? Dhurke: A face isn't enough. You also need the true name of the one you're attempting to channel. Apollo: Oh, right. Pearl mentioned something like that. Dhurke: And the founder's name is only known to the priestess who's been crowned queen. In short, the only living person who knows it is the current queen of Khura'in, Ga'ran. Apollo: Oh, so without her help, we won't be seeing the founder anytime soon? Trucy: Tsk, that's no fun. Founder's Orb updated in the Court Record. Apollo: So, Dhurke, what will you do now? Dhurke: First, I'll start by tracing the route by which the orb came into Dr. Buff's hands. Apollo: Since we now know it was Paul Atishon that asked the doctor to study it... ...isn't he the one who stole it? Dhurke: No, a political nobody like him couldn't get anywhere near the orb, let alone steal it. He must've had inside help. My money is on someone connected to the royal family. Apollo: Oh, right. You said something to that effect back in the cave. Dhurke: Whoever it may be, we need to expose their dirty scheme to the light of day. Apollo: Well, I'm sure Mr. Wright has plenty of information, courtesy of his dirty client. He might be able to shed some light on this. ???: Private Justice! Sarge: That was fine work you did at the trial today! You did your sergeant proud! Apollo: Back at you, Sarge! It took real courage to leave your room like that. Armie: It's all thanks to you and Corpswoman Cykes. With my siege defense over, I can finally sally forth. Sarge: But the battle's only just begun! One for me, and me alone, to fight! Athena: To lose your mother, and then your father... What a terrible thing to endure. Apollo: Yeah... (And being wheelchair-bound doesn't help.) Armie: ...Private Justice! I've been thinking... It's about time I stood on my own two feet. After all, I no longer have Papa to coddle me! Apollo: Huh? I'm afraid I don't follow. Armie: ...Take a good look, soldier. This is one small step for man... ...and one giant leap for me! ......... Hold my drone for me, would you, Private Justice? Apollo: Y-Yes, sir. (What she is up to?) Armie: .........Hrgh! Wh-Whoa... Apollo: Sh-Sh-She's... standing?! Dhurke: Wh-What's this?! Sarge! You mean your legs... They're...?! Armie: The doctor told me that I was ready to walk again months ago. But if I admitted I could walk, I knew I would have to leave the house. So I... I faked it. Apollo: (Makes sense, but...) Armie: I kept pretending I couldn't walk. But I know Papa is watching over me now, and I'd hate to disappoint him. So, from this day forth, I'm going to march forward on my own two feet! Apollo: (What a brave kid, trying to move forward like this. But it must be so hard this soon after her father's death.) Dhurke: Don't you ever stop. You just keep on walking... comrade. Stay brave, because there will be days when you want to stop... ...but I have faith you'll find a way to muster the strength to push through them. Apollo: Yeah, you can do it. Trucy: Hey, Daddy's back! Phoenix: .................. Apollo: Mr. Wright! (What's that look on his face for?) Phoenix: Oh, Apollo! Apollo: Um, is everything all right with Ms. Fey? Phoenix: She's safe... for now. Athena: Well then, we'd better go save her, quick! Where is she, anyway? Phoenix: ...I'm afraid I have some bad news. Apollo: Huh? Phoenix: Maya's... not here in the States. She's still in Khura'in. And she's still being held hostage by the mastermind behind this whole thing. Apollo: The mastermind? Phoenix: ...That's right. Paul Atishon-Wimperson was nothing more than a pawn. Maya's true abductor is in the Kingdom of Khura'in. Apollo: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaat?! I-I don't understand, Mr. Wright! What in the world's going on over there?! Apollo: But as shocking as that news was... ...it was only the beginning. The beginning of something big -- big enough to shake Khura'in to its very core. ...Revolution. I was being swept up in a mighty wave that nothing could stop. Of course, at the time... I had no idea what the days ahead had in store for us... To be continued Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: Please take a look at this piece of evidence. Judge: I'm looking... But what am I supposed to see? Apollo: Oh, um... Uhhh... Phoenix: As your boss and mentor, here's a bit of advice: Never present evidence before you have a good grasp of the situation at hand. Apollo: R-Right... Sorry... Judge: And as the presiding judge, here's a penalty. Apollo: (Ouch. Double-teamed for doing what Mr. Wright always does anyway.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: That statement contradicts with this piece of evidence! Judge: Hmmm... And just how does it contradict with the evidence, Mr. Justice? Apollo: Um... Could I have about five minutes to figure out the answer to that? Judge: The defense will figure it out before he presents his evidence next time! Apollo: (Sounds like a plan...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: There's... something off about that statement... Judge: Hmm... It seemed perfectly reasonable to me. Apollo: No, something's definitely not right if you listen really carefully! Phoenix: A gambler once sang, you've got to know when to hold 'em, when to fold 'em... Judge: Oh, I love this one! ...Know when to walk away, know when to run! Apollo: (I don't know which penalty hurts more: the judge's or their singing.) Consult (when evidence must be presented) Athena: Is it just me, or does that statement sound a bit dubious? Apollo: You know what... you're right. Thanks, Athena! Athena: Anytime! Apollo: (Now to take another look at the evidence...) Consult (when statements must be pressed) Athena: You look like you've hit a brick wall, Apollo. Apollo: Yeah. It feels like I have, too. Athena: Maybe you just haven't brought all the facts to light. Why don't you try pressing a little more? Apollo: Good idea. (Okay, time to turn up the pressure!) Pinpoint wrong emotion (during Mood Matrix segment in the chapter \"Cross-Examining Sarge\") Apollo: Athena: Hmm... This emotion isn't that out of place, given this statement... Apollo, are you just looking at his emotions as they relate to only a single statement? It's really important to look for emotional fluctuation between different statements, too. Apollo: Oh, right. Thanks for the reminder, Athena. (All right, let's try that again.) Probe wrong area (during Mood Matrix segment in the chapter \"Cross-Examining Sarge\") Apollo: Athena: That doesn't seem to be the cause of his current emotional state. Apollo: I could sure use a clue or two right about now. Athena: A person's personality and past shapes their emotional responses. Consider everything you know about Sarge. That's where you'll find the clues you need. Apollo: (Everything I know about Sarge...) Presenting wrong evidence during the Mood Matrix Apollo: Apollo: There's an inconsistency in Sarge's testimony! Judge: Is that so? Would you be so kind as to point it out to the court? Apollo: ...Well if you're going to put me on the spot like that, I admit my confidence is waning. Judge: ...I could say the same about my confidence in you, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Ugh. (I wish you wouldn't, Your Honor.) Athena: Say, Apollo... Sarge is saying that his father was burning the orb when he was killed... ...but doesn't that seem funny to you? Considering what the doctor was up that night, it doesn't add up. Apollo: Well, now that you mention it... (All right, I'd better look through the evidence one more time.) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The Defiant Dragons have failed to sufficiently show their right to the item in question. Therefore, ownership is hereby awarded to... ...the plaintiff, Mr. Paul Atishon. Apollo: That creep Paul Atishon stole the Founder's Orb right out of our hands. The dream of revolution in the Kingdom of Khura'in died that day. And we returned to our daily lives. As for my relationship with Mr. Wright... The word awkward comes to mind. Let's just say it was never really the same. Turnabout Revolution Image Gallery Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 May 17District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Apollo: What do you mean Ms. Fey is still being held hostage? And who's this \"mastermind\"? Phoenix: ...Paul Atishon-Wimperson was nothing more than a puppet. His benefactor was the one pulling the strings. But I have no idea who they are. Apollo: So all we know is it's the person he was trying to give the orb to? Phoenix: Right. He was just following orders. Whoever it is, it seems they really want to get their hands on the orb. Apollo: So then, Ms. Fey's abduction is the work of this so-called \"benefactor,\" too? Phoenix: Right again. Whoever they are, they're in Khura'in... ...along with Maya. Apollo: I wonder who they could be. Dhurke: Wright, this Maya -- the spirit medium you've been talking about... She wouldn't happen to be that bun-haired young lady you defended back in Khura'in? Phoenix: That's her. Why do you ask? Dhurke: I see... I think I know what's going on here.  I've got good news for you, Wright. Maya is somewhere safe. That much I'm sure of. Phoenix: ...I'm afraid you've lost me. Dhurke: Heh heh heh. So that's who the little snot's patron is. It's all starting to make sense. That fool has no idea I'm here in the States with you all. Apollo: Dhurke, you mind filling us in? Phone: .......................................... Phoenix: ...! ...No caller ID. I wonder who's calling? Phone: *beep* Phoenix: Hello? Phone: Mr. Phoenix Wright, yes? Let me start by thanking you... ...for taking such good care of my subordinate. Phoenix: Wh-Who is this? Phone: I believe you know me as Mr. Atishon's... \"benefactor.\" Phoenix: Ah! Apollo: (Sounds like they're using a voice changer or something to disguise themself.) Phoenix: Where's Maya?! Is she safe?! Phone: ...I had my ears on today's proceedings. What a shock it was to hear that the key to solving the orb's riddle is a spirit medium. I admit, I did not see that coming. Apollo: (Wait, did they plant a listening device in here somehow?) Phone: Nevertheless, don't think for a minute that it will guarantee Maya Fey's safety. She is not the only medium within my reach, you see. Phoenix: You harm a hair on Maya's head and you'll have to answer to me! Dhurke: ...Wright, give it here a sec. Phoenix: Wait! Dhurke: Hey, there. How's it going, stranger? Phone: ...Who is this? Dhurke: Why, it's your friendly neighborhood dragon. I just happen to be in the U.S. on a little trip. ...Minister of Justice Inga Karkhuul Khura'in. Phoenix: I-Inga?! Apollo: What?! Phoenix: Maya's kidnapper... Apollo: ...Is Khura'in's... Minister of Justice? Inga: Dh-Dhurke?! Is that you, ya dirty turncoat?! How in the--! What in blazes is going on here?! Dhurke: Oh, you know, just popped over to the States for a little R&R. But enough about me, Inga. That was a poor excuse for a bluff you pulled just now. We both know your threats are as empty as your head. You can't lay a hand on Maya Fey, and I do mean that literally. Inga: Ugh! Apollo: (What is he talking about?) Dhurke: You can kiss your chances of getting the orb goodbye. Inga: ...Heh heh heh. Maya Fey ain't my only... how shall I say... insurance, you know, Dhurke. Dhurke: What? Inga: I've got someone dear to you right in the palm of my hand, see? Now that one, well... You can imagine what kinds of things I could do, right? Dhurke: ! ............ Inga: Heh heh. Glad you're seeing things my way. Meet me at Amara's Tomb tomorrow, 3 PM sharp. And you better come alone, got it? If all goes well, the orb is all you'll need to get Maya Fey back. Dhurke: ......... Apollo: Dh-Dhurke, what's going on? Dhurke: You heard him. I have to get back to Khura'in at once. Apollo: What?! Why?! Dhurke: No time to explain. Apollo: But are you even going to make it? What if there are no seats left on the next flight? Plus, you're a wanted man. They're not just going to let you get on a plane. ???: Let me worry about that, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Ch-Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth? What are you doing here? Edgeworth: Taking care of the hostage situation. Apollo: Oh, now that you mention it... ...Pearl did say that she saw you around in Kurain Village. Phoenix: I had him look into a few things while I was on my way back from Khura'in. ...Including Maya's situation, of course. Edgeworth: I was astonished to hear she was still in Khura'in earlier... ...but it explained why I found no connection between her and Mr. Atishon. Apollo: Sorry to interrupt, but going back to the plane situation... Edgeworth: I've taken the liberty of chartering one for us. It's ready to take off at any time. And I will do what's necessary to hide the fact that Dhurke Sahdmadhi is onboard. Apollo: ...Wow. (Must be nice to be chief prosecutor...) Edgeworth: Wright, we have no time to lose. We must head for Khura'in at once. Phoenix: ...Right. Athena: I'm going, too! After all, you're bound to need my help! Trucy: No fair! I wanna go, too! Phoenix: This isn't a vacation, Trucy. Besides, I'll need you to hold down the fort. Trucy: But Daddy! Apollo: (Guess I should also only bring what's necessary.) ...Sorry Trucy, but would you mind holding on to this stuff for me? Unnecessary evidence foisted onto Trucy. Trucy: Fine. But you'd better bring me back something besides just more evidence. Dhurke: Excellent. Now, let us make haste... to Khura'in! Apollo: And that's how our sudden trip to the Kingdom of Khura'in began. I never imagined I'd return to the country of my youth under such circumstances, though... May 18, 2:30 PMTehm'pul Temple Apollo: That was a long flight. It's already 2:30 in the afternoon. Talk about cutting it close. ........... (The Kingdom of Khura'in... This is no time to reminisce, but... ...I gotta say, this place sure brings back memories.) Phoenix: Hurry up, Apollo! Apollo: Right behind you! Dhurke: Amara's Tomb is located in the courtyard of Ga'ran Palace. We should have just enough time to get there. Athena: Then let's sprint there! Think you can keep up, Apollo? Apollo: S-Sure, no sweat! Edgeworth: I'll contact the royal family and the local police, and inform them of our arrival. Phoenix: Thanks, Edgeworth. Examine Athena: Apollo. I'm sure this place brings back memories, but could you reminisce later? Time's running out! Apollo: You're right. We have to find Ms. Fey before it's too late. Talk Any ideas? Athena: I know you probably want to reminisce and all, but there's no time for that right now! Apollo: You're right. We've got to get to Amara's Tomb with Ms. Fey is being held captive! Present Anything Athena: Apollo! Don't go showing me stuff for no reason! We have to find Ms. Fey before it's too late! May 18, 2:45 PMGa'ran Palace - Royal Residence Apollo: *huff, puff* *huff, puff* I wasn't made for all the running and climbing and near-drowning I've done this week. Phoenix: It's 2:45... Only fifteen minutes left. (Changed from [It's 2:45... Only 15 minutes left.] in the original release) Dhurke: See that cylindrical building rising in the distance? That's Amara's Tomb. Phoenix: Amara... Wasn't that the previous queen? The one who was assassinated? Dhurke: Yes. And I'm the one they pinned it on. Apollo: It will take a few minutes to get to the tomb from here. ???: So, you have returned... Barbed Head. Phoenix: Ah...! Apollo: (I've seen her before on the news. If I remember correctly, this is the crown princess Rayfa Padma Khura'in.) Rayfa: What are you people doing here? This is the Royal Residence! Commoners are not allowed entry without permission. Phoenix: A prosecutor from the States... ...should've already called and requested permission for us to enter. As to why we're here, Your Benevolence... Have you seen Minister Inga? Rayfa: If you seek my father, I just saw him heading toward Amara's Tomb. Phoenix: Was he with anyone? You know, like some shady-looking underlings or something? Rayfa: No, he was alone. Why do you ask? Apollo: (Looks like she has no idea about Ms. Fey's abduction.) Athena: You hear that? I think we have company. *stomp, stomp, stomp* Royal Guard: Bow down before her glooooooory!!! Her Eminence Queen Ga'ran, grand priestess of Khura'in approooooooooaches!!! Apollo: Huh? ...Ga'ran? Ahhh! I-It's--! Phoenix: ...Q-Queen Ga'ran! Ga'ran: ............... Guards... Surround Amara's Tomb at once! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence! Ur di'hara Ga'ran! Apollo: (What's she doing? Is she going to help us?) Phoenix: Excuse me, Your Eminence... Ga'ran: So, our \"Barbed Head\" lawyer returns. May we presume you are here for Maya Fey, the spirit medium who has been abducted? Phoenix: Y-Yes, you may! Ga'ran: Allow us to apologize for the criminal actions of our husband. Phoenix: Oh, um... no need to apologize for him! Ga'ran: Honestly, Inga... Abducting a guest in our country? How could you? Rayfa: Father... abducted someone? Phoenix: Your Eminence, what about those soldiers over there? Ga'ran: They are the Ga'ran Royal Guard, soldiers who serve the crown and no other. Apollo: Royal guard? Ga'ran: They are an elite force selected from only the most loyal and outstanding of our subjects. Apollo: And why have you ordered them to surround the tomb? Ga'ran: The police will not come if it is my husband who is committing the crime. We shall have to storm the tomb and take Minister Inga into custody ourselves! Apollo: Whaaat?! Y-You mean...? Dhurke: Ga'ran! No! His hostage is in there! Ga'ran: Dhurke! How dare you set foot in the palace! Have you come to turn yourself in?! Dhurke: Listen, we need to call a truce for now! Ga'ran: Ga'ran Royal Guard! Seize this traitor of the crown! Royal Guard: As you wiiiiiiish, Your Eminence! Resist and you diiiiiie! Apollo: W-Wait a second! Dhurke: Dhurke: Slow down there, Ga'ran. I'm here to conduct a hostage exchange. But if you take me in now, Maya Fey is as good as dead. Ga'ran: ...A hostage exchange? And why would he choose to do such a thing with you? Dhurke: We can talk about that later. Right now, I need to get in there before it's too late. If I can't resolve this in twenty minutes, you can storm the palace. Now then... if you'll excuse me... Ga'ran: Dhurke, wait! ... *sigh* Guards, allow the insurgent Dhurke Sahdmadhi to pass. Rayfa: Barbed Head, you have some explaining to do! Phoenix: Right... Well, while we're waiting here... ...Apollo, why don't you explain the situation? Apollo: Whaaat?! M-Me? Rayfa: Leave nothing out, Horn Head, or I'll dehorn you where you stand! Apollo: (Horn Head? She doesn't waste any time coming up with nicknames. And what's with the attitude? Her father is the one who abducted Ms. Fey!) Examine Amara's Tomb Apollo: (Dhurke's in there right now.) Guards Athena: The Ga'ran Royal Guard has the tomb surrounded. Apollo: Yeah, and it looks like they might storm the place at any moment. Phoenix: If Her Eminence gives the order, they'll have no choice but to follow through. And I have the feeling she's about ready to do so. Apollo: All we can do is wait and hope for the best, huh... (I hope Dhurke and Ms. Fey both come out of this in one piece.) Any other point of interest Apollo: (This is no time to be looking around. Not until Dhurke gets back.) Move Rayfa: Where do you think you are going?! Apollo: (Oh, right. We're supposed to wait for Dhurke to return.) Talk Hostage taking by Inga Rayfa: Do my ears deceive me, or did I hear talk about my father abducting someone? Apollo: Oh, um, you heard right. He abducted Maya Fey, and... Rayfa: I-Insolent fool! Apollo: P-Pardon my rudeness! Rayfa: A gentle soul such as my father could not possibly have committed such a crime! Phoenix: \"Gentle\"? You think he's gentle? Apollo: I'm afraid it's true, Your Benevolence. He's holed up in that tomb as we speak. Rayfa: Really? I find this difficult to believe. Why would he do such a thing? Inga Karkhuul Khura'in Apollo: Umm, Your Benevolence? You saw your father heading toward the tomb? Rayfa: I did. I was over on that veranda, deep in thought... ...when I saw him hurrying toward the tomb. I'd say it was about ten minutes ago. (Changed from [...when I saw him hurrying toward the tomb. I'd say it was about 10 minutes ago.] in the original release) Apollo: (Why was he rushing? Maybe he was worried he'd be late?) Did you see anyone else heading for the tomb? Rayfa: I saw no one else after he entered. Apollo: So Minister Inga and Ms. Fey are the only ones in there besides Dhurke? Phoenix: Who knows? But I wouldn't be surprised if he had a minion or two with him. Apollo: Dhurke... I sure hope he's all right. Present Anything Rayfa: Horn Head! Stop wasting time and explain what's going on here! And make it quick, or I'll yank those horns right off your head. Apollo: Nngh... How about we keep our hands to ourselves and I'll explain everything...? (Guess I'd better start talking...) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: ...It's only been five minutes? (Argh, it feels like an eternity.) Phoenix: Patience, Apollo, patience. Ga'ran: ................. May 18, 3:20 PMGa'ran Palace - Royal Residence Apollo: It's been almost twenty minutes. What's taking Dhurke so long? Ga'ran: ...The appointed time has come. Our royal guard shall now storm in. Apollo: Umm, can't you wait just a little longer? Ga'ran: No, we cannot. Every second we wait puts the hostage's life in even more danger. Therefore, we see no alternative but to order our guards to storm in. Apollo: (But that'll put Ms. Fey's life in danger, too!) Ga'ran: Guards! Storm the tomb and seize Minister Inga, along with the insurgent Dhurke Sahdmadhi! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence! Apollo: What?! Dhurke's under arrest, too? Ga'ran: Naturally. That traitorous snake assassinated my predecessor, Queen Amara. Now go! Seize them both! Royal Guard: Raaaaaaaaah! We're going in! Follow me, men! For Her Eminence! Ur dihara Ga'raaaaaaaan! Apollo: ............ (I hope no one gets hurt.) Royal Guard: Ah! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Your Eminineeeeeeeence! Apollo: What the--? Why are they running back out?! Ga'ran: What is the meaning of this? Royal Guard: S-Something terrible has happened! Dhurke...! Th-Th-The minister...! H-H-He's dead! Ga'ran: What's this?! Apollo: WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Phoenix: Apollo, quick! Apollo: I'm right behind you! Ga'ran: No one enters without our--! ...Hmph! Come, let us see what has transpired! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence! May 18Ga'ran Palace - Amara's Tomb Apollo: Wh-Where's Dhurke?! Phoenix: Apollo, over there! Apollo: .........Dhurke? Dhurke: ................ Apollo: Dhurke! Wh-Wh-What... What have you done? Dhurke: ..........Apollo? Phoenix: L-Look! Ga'ran: So it is... Minister Inga who has fallen? ...! Guards! Seize this murderous man at once! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence! Surrender or peeeeeeerish, rebel scum! Dhurke: N-No, wait! Aaaaaaaaargh! .............................. ............................................................ Apollo: Dhurke! (They're taking him away...) *thud* Apollo: Oww! (Dhurke just threw something at me.) Wait, this is the... (Is he telling me to keep it safe?) ???: ......Nick? ...Is that you? Phoenix: M-Maya! Are you all right?! Maya: Dh-Dhurke, he... he saved me. ...I feel... exhausted. I can't keep my eyes... open... Phoenix: Maya! Apollo: (Minister Inga -- the man behind Ms. Fey's abduction -- had been killed. And Dhurke was arrested for his murder. So it was that the abduction of Maya Fey came to a sudden and unexpected resolution. With this, the curtain fell on the minister, but things were far from over.) May 18Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence Athena: Apollo! What happened?! Apollo: ......I can't say for sure. But from what I can tell, it seems Dhurke has killed Minister Inga. Athena: Whaaaaaaaaaaat?! You think he did it to save Ms. Fey? Apollo: Most likely... But who knows? I'm really confused right now... Rayfa: M-My father... He's...? This cannot be! I must see for myself! Royal Guard: Your Benevolence! We cannot allow you to pass! Rayfa: Fools! Stand aside! Royal Guard: Forgive us! But we have direct orders from Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran! Rayfa: Uuuuuuuuuuuh! Father... Oh, Father...! Dhuuuuuurke! You will pay for this! Phoenix: ...Apollo, let's go regroup somewhere. Apollo: Y-Yeah... (Dhurke... It wasn't really you that did it... right?) May 18Tehm'pul Temple Apollo: ......... Athena: Are you okay, Apollo? Apollo: ...Y-Yeah. Phoenix: Edgeworth's speaking with the local police... ...so let's sit tight until he returns. Apollo: ...O-Okay. ............... Phoenix: ...I know you must be in a state of shock right now, but I need you to stay with us, Apollo. Apollo: (He's right. I can't go to pieces now!) Thanks, Mr. Wright. I'll be fine! May 18Tehm'pul Temple Edgeworth: Wright, Mr. Justice... I'm afraid I have some bad news. It looks like things will only get more complicated from here. Apollo: Prosecutor Edgeworth... What's happening with Dhurke? Edgeworth: As I understand it, he has been officially charged with the murder of Minister Inga. Apollo: H-He has? Edgeworth: However, I did manage to get us permission to investigate the crime scene. And I expect we'll be allowed to visit Mr. Sahdmadhi shortly. Apollo: ...Thank you. (I'm sure glad Prosecutor Edgeworth is here with us.) Edgeworth: Also, it just so happens that Detective Skye is here in Khura'in... ...so I have asked her to assist us with our investigation. Apollo: What?! What's she doing here? Edgeworth: It seems Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has grown quite fond of her. He's been ferrying her around all over the place. A few days here, a few days there... They've almost become a team of sorts. Apollo: (Despite what Nahyuta says... ...it seems he thinks highly of Ema's skills.) Athena: So what now, Apollo? Apollo: I think I'll go pay Dhurke a visit at the Detention Center. Phoenix: I... want to go check in on Maya at the hospital. What about you, Athena? Athena: Well... If there's footwork to be done, I'd better stick with Apollo and give him a hand. Edgeworth: Very well. Then I will accompany Wright. Apollo: Okay, we'll go our separate ways for now. Phoenix: All right. If anything comes up, you have my cell number. Athena: Do you know your way around here, Apollo? Apollo: It's been over ten years since I left... but I'll try not to get us hopelessly lost. Examine Temple Athena: Mr. Wright stayed there the entire time he was here, apparently. Apollo: Why would he stay at a temple instead of a hotel? Athena: He says it helped to cut costs. Long stays at a hotel really add up, you know. But he had to sleep on the floor with a load of strangers. There weren't any showers, either. Apollo: Wow, that's worse than staying at a youth hostel for backpackers. Spring Apollo: (This is said to be a sacred spring, and a pathway for souls to follow. The people of Khura'in believe the spring draws souls to the temple... ...and by the truth gained in the Hall of Justice beyond, they are memorialized. It seems that legal trials and funeral rites are inseparable in this country.) Background temples Apollo: (There sure are a lot of temples around here. In fact, it looks like most of the buildings around here are related to Khura'inism.) Talk Any ideas? Athena: Queen Ga'ran sure has a lot of personal attendants. Apollo: Yeah. The Ga'ran Royal Guard... They're like her own private army. Athena: More like an elite fan club made up of carefully selected soldiers who adore her. That's how I see it anyway. Apollo: That's... a pretty blunt way of putting it. What to do Athena: Dhurke Sahdmadhi -- the charismatic leader of the Defiant Dragons -- arrested. This is going to deal a major blow to the rebels. Apollo: Yeah. I can already see Datz having a heart attack when he finds out. Athena: Speaking of Datz, he was on the plane with us... ...but I haven't seen him since we landed. Apollo: Dhurke said he wanted Datz to go to him before he caused any more trouble. Athena: ...Yeah, he strikes me as a troublemaker. Apollo: ...I just hope he doesn't do anything crazy, like trying to break Dhurke out of jail. Present Attorney's Badge Athena: I thought that attorney badges were the same around the world. But I just realized this type is only used back home. Apollo: You've had your badge for a while now, and you're JUST noticing that? Athena: Hey, I'm still getting used to things after all the time I spent in Europe. But as they say, when in Rome! Apollo: Wait, what are we even talking about anymore? Founder's Orb Athena: The orb... It was a real surprise to find out that it's hollow on the inside, wasn't it? Apollo: Yeah, and an even bigger surprise to find that the founder's face was hidden within. Athena: But now that the orb's secret has been revealed... ...how are you supposed to restore it to its original state? Apollo: ...Well, it was probably wax or something that melted to reveal the figure inside, so... ...if we turned it upside down and heated it up again, it should go back to the way it was. Athena: Ohhh, I get it! That's one clever little contraption. Photo of My Father Athena: I've been thinking about that photo. Your father was quite the manly man, Apollo. Apollo: Ha ha ha. I sense a compliment in there somewhere. Athena: Huh? Where'd you get that idea? Apollo: Oh, um... N-Never mind. Athena: Never mind what? Apollo: ......... Er, nice weather we're having today. Athena: ......... Aww... Is there something you wanted to hear me say, Apollo? Apollo: L-Look! Just forget I said anything, okay?! Royal Residence Examine Inga's residence Apollo: (Somebody got a little carried away decorating this place. There's a golden lion keeping watch at the entrance.) ...That frog looks like it's cowering under the lion's glare. Athena: Really? 'Cause to me, it looks like the frog is glaring at the lion. Apollo: Come on, Athena. How does that make any sense? Athena: Huh? I just call 'em as I see 'em. Apollo: (I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.) Ga'ran's palace Apollo: The palace of Queen Ga'ran is built to impress. Its white walls and gold ornamentation lend it an imposing air. Athena: It makes Minister Inga's residence look downright humble by comparison. Apollo: Yeah. It shows the difference in their tastes... and which one wears the pants, so to speak Amara's tomb Apollo: The previous queen, Amara, was laid to rest in her own private tomb. Pretty impressive. Athena: They say it cost $800 million to build, and took 400 workers five years to complete. Special memorial rites were also conducted at various points of its construction. Apollo: That's quite an undertaking. Athena: It was built with donations from her devoted subjects and royalty of neighboring countries. It ended up giving a huge boost to the national economy. Apollo: Wow, Queen Amara must've been one charismatic lady... Rayfa's residence Athena: Ooh, look at those flowers! They give the whole house such a cute vibe! I wonder if this is where Princess Rayfa lives. Apollo: ...I doubt it. She doesn't look like the type to decorate with cute flowers. I mean, I may not know her well, but she seems awfully serious and snobby. I bet she uses nothing but roses and peonies - stuffy old people flowers, you know? Athena: ......Apollo. I guess it's too much to ask that you not judge a book by its cover, huh. Apollo: What's that supposed to mean? Footprints Apollo: Are these... Inga's footprints? They appear to be heading toward the tomb. Athena: Didn't Princess Rayfa mention something about that? You know, something about him rushing over to the tomb before we arrived? Apollo: I wonder if he had accidentally dozed off before the exchange or something. Pond or bridge Apollo: Vibrant lotus flowers floating on still waters... Butterflies dancing about... It's almost supernatural in its beauty. Athena: And at the center of it all rises the tomb where Amara's soul slumbers.  It makes you wonder if that bridge there is a getaway to the hereafter. Apollo: Yeah... Especially after both Dhurke and Inga crossed that bridge earlier. Urns Apollo: This overturned urn has spilled water everywhere. Everything around it is soaking wet. Athena: D-Don't look at me! Apollo: (Rightly or wrongly, I'm guessing Athena's the type who gets blamed for a lot of things. And the more people accuse her, the more defensive she becomes. Even to the point of preemptively denying any wrongdoing.) Athena: I said, it wasn't me! Apollo: I never said it was. Amara's Tomb Examine Athena: Apollo, I know you can't help but want to start investigating, but... Apollo: I know. We should pay Dhurke a visit over at the Detention Center. May 18Detention Center - Visitor's Room Dhurke: Apollo! Here to see your old man, are you? Apollo: Dhurke. Are they done interrogating you? Dhurke: Nope, the fun hasn't even started. I imagine they'll really take me over the coals though. Athena: I don't even want to think about how harsh their interrogation method will be. Apollo: ...Yeah, but that's nothing compared to what they'll do if they find him guilty. Dhurke: They've branded me a terrorist who killed the previous queen, and now the justice minister. If found guilty of these crimes, I'll be facing a very public execution. Apollo: P-Public execution...?! (This is worse than I thought!) Dhurke: Come on, son. Turn that frown upside down! You'll jinx us. As soon as I get out of here, I'll take you to this tasty hash house I know. Apollo: .........I'd like that. (I really need to find out what happened. Time to switch to work mode.) Dhurke, can you tell me what happened? ...Oh, and there's also something I want you to take a look at. Examine Bell Athena: .................. Apollo: ...Don't do it, Athena. Don't ring that bell. Athena: Ack! Wh-Who, me...?! Perish the thought. I mean, would I ever do something so childish? Apollo: .................. Athena: All right, all right! Put your bracelet away already. Talk about unfair! Guard Apollo: That guard's standing so still, and with such great posture... I wonder if he spends his days just watching the dust dance in the sunlight. Wait a second. Don't you do that in court sometimes, Athena? Athena: Eep! You mean you noticed? Apollo: Don't think you can take it easy just because I'm the lead lawyer on this one. Talk The incident Apollo: Dhurke, what happened in there? You didn't really kill Minister Inga, did you? Dhurke: Well, the thing is... ...I really don't know. Apollo: Huh? Dhurke: I remember seeing the mural of the founder right as I entered the tomb... ...but I got all dizzy immediately after that. The next thing I knew, I was standing there with a bloody knife in my hand... ...and covered in Inga's blood. Apollo: So you don't remember meeting with him? Dhurke: No. The last thing I remember after entering the tomb is feeling really dizzy. Athena: There's no way he can explain what happened if he can't remember anything. Apollo: Y-Yeah... Dhurke: .........Hmm. I suppose there's no getting out of this one. Apollo: But we can't give up yet! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! I was just messing with you, son. Apollo: Well, stop. It's not funny. Dhurke: S-Sorry. Apollo: (Sheesh. Nothing seems to faze him. Not even being arrested for murder.) Dhurke: This is going to be one tough case, Apollo. Not only have I been charged with Inga's murder... ...but I've also been charged with Amara's assassination from twenty-three years ago. Apollo: You're on trial for two charges? Dhurke: Ga'ran is practically licking her chops just thinking about my public execution. Guess it means we can't afford to lose our heads, huh. Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: I... I don't know how you can laugh at a time like this. Dhurke: ...So, son, I take it you'll be defending me at my trial? Apollo: ...Of course. You can count on me. Dhurke: That's my boy! Looks like your nerves are as steely as those vocal chords of yours! After all, you've got the Defense Culpability Ace to contend with, too. Apollo: ...Oh, right... So if you're found guilty... ...then I'll be charged with the same double homicide, huh. Dhurke: Don't tell me you forgot about that...! Apollo: I'll-- I'll be fine. I-I just have to make sure we win this one. Dhurke: You sure? Because you don't sound very fine. Athena: ...Um, Apollo? What was that about an assassination twenty-three years ago? 23 years ago (appears after \"The incident\") Apollo: About that incident twenty-three years ago... That was when the previous queen, Amara, was assassinated, wasn't it? Dhurke: Yes. Someone set her private residence on fire. She lost her life in the ensuing blaze. Apollo: And you were arrested for the crime? Athena: Why would they arrest you, Mr. Sahdmadhi? Weren't you just a lawyer back then? What relation could you have had with the queen? Dhurke: Um, about that... Amara was... well... she was my wife. I may not look the part, but I was once husband to a queen. In short, I was royalty. Athena: What? No waaaaaay! Are you saying you won the heart of the reigning queen? Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! C'mon, you're talking to a guy who hones his prowess against witnesses on the stand. Even a queen is no match for this dragon's glare! Athena: W-Wow, you're really something else. Apollo: So was a verdict ever reached, Dhurke? Dhurke: I acted as my own attorney and won. ...Until I was accused of fabricating evidence, that is. Then it all went south. Apollo: (...Now where have I heard a story like that before?) Athena: What happened after that? Dhurke: I, uh... I made a run for it. Athena: You ran?! But why? Dhurke: I didn't kill Amara, and I didn't fabricate any evidence. But if I had stuck around for a retrial, I'd have been found guilty for sure. I couldn't allow that to happen; Amara's true killer would never face justice if I did. So I left my law practice behind and went underground. Apollo: But that was twenty-three years ago. ...Are you telling me that after all these years... ...you still haven't discovered the truth? Dhurke: Yeah... The fact that it was arson means that the crime scene was reduced to ashes. There is little in the way of evidence left. It's just been brick wall after brick wall. Apollo: (I guess that means it's all up to me to figure it out, huh. Along with Minister Inga's murder, of course. ...I think I'm going to be sick.) Dhurke: Come on, son. Don't look so down. With you on the case, it'll work out somehow. Apollo: (I hope he's right.) Dhurke: Say, son, do you remember my office? Apollo: ...Sure. (I remember that messy, dimly lit room.) Dhurke: The file I've amassed on Amara's assassination is kept there. I think it might help you on this case. Do you remember how to get there? Apollo: (Let me think... I recall going in through a manhole...) How can I not, Dhurke. I hated how I always got so dirty getting there. And that stench... (That old case is important, too, but I should probably focus on the minister's murder first.) Present Attorney's Badge Dhurke: I'm proud of you, son. You've really become a fine lawyer. Apollo: Well, at least it means I'm qualified to defend you. Dhurke: ...To think the day would come where you'd come to my defense. I'm one lucky man. Now I can die in peace. Apollo: Whoa, slow down! I'm going to prove you innocent, so...! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Just pulling your leg, son! Apollo: (...Even when he's in the slammer, Dhurke is Dhurke.) Founder's Orb Dhurke: I see you got it safely out of the tomb! Apollo: Why did you throw it at me like that? Dhurke: I want you to listen carefully, son. The orb must not fall into Ga'ran's hands... Not ever. Apollo: I thought Minister Inga was the one who was after it. He was the one who lent it to Professor Buff to study, after all. So haven't you exposed his crime now? Dhurke: I have, but... ...there's more connected to this relic than meets the eye... Much more. And whatever it is, I can't help feeling that it could turn this entire kingdom upside down. Apollo: You said something like that before. (Looks like Dhurke's intuition is at it again.) Dhurke: Ga'ran will do anything to retrieve this... ...so guard it well, son -- at least until tomorrow's trial. Photo of My Father Dhurke: That's the only remaining photo of your father. Take good care of it. Apollo: I will. ...I'm just surprised to see it after all these years. Dhurke: I had a tough time tracking it down and retrieving it. It was taken by some European tourists who just happened to be watching your father. I had one of my men go to Europe to look them up and ask whether we could have it. Apollo: Y-You went through all that trouble? Dhurke: ...I did. So don't go losing it or anything. Apollo: I said I'd take good care of it, didn't I? After clearing \"23 years ago\" Talk option and presenting Founder's Orb: ???: I'm afraid your time is up. Apollo: ! N-Nahyuta. Nahyuta: It's time for the prisoner's interrogation. So begone, you putrid-headed, criminal-abetting lawyer. Apollo: Wait! Don't tell me... you're the prosecuting attorney? Athena: What?! But that would mean... Nahyuta: ...Is there a problem here? Apollo: You bet there is. He's your father! Nahyuta: ...And your point is...? My relation to the accused is irrelevant. The fact remains, I am a prosecutor. Apollo: N-No, that's not what I... (I don't think I'm getting through to him.) Dhurke: .........Nahyuta. Long time no see, son. How've you been? Nahyuta: ......... Dhurke: Look... I hear you've been serving Ga'ran -- rather faithfully, in fact. Whatever happened to our dream of taking her down and changing this country, son? Nahyuta: .........The past is the past. Dhurke: What do you mean? Why are you doing this? Nahyuta: .........It's simple. People change. The Nahyuta you knew exists no more. Dhurke: Listen, son, I don't know what made you change like this... ...but you're still my boy, even if you prosecute my case. The rest of the Defiant Dragons and I eagerly await your return. Whenever you're ready, we'll welcome you back with open arms. Nahyuta: ........Ngh! .........As I said, I've moved on. Now, let us waste no more time; for flowers do not blossom simply from talk of the past. Apollo: ......... (Nahyuta... Why do I get the feeling there's something he wants to say, but can't?) Nahyuta: ...Guard, move the accused to the interrogation room. Guard: Yes, sir! This way, you rebel scum! Dhurke: Ow! Watch it! Not so rough, will you! Apollo: (...Nahyuta. Is he seriously going to prosecute his own father?) May 18Ga'ran Palace - Amara's Tomb Apollo: So, this is the tomb of Amara, the previous queen of Khura'in. It's really lavish. I guess you could say it's fit for a queen. Athena: Is the faceless woman in that mural over there Amara? Apollo: No, that's the Holy Mother. She's the one who brought spirit channeling to Khura'in. Athena: Oh, right. The woman in the orb. ???: Oh, it's you two. Getting right down to business, I see. Apollo: Hi, Ema. We heard you'd give us a hand if we needed it. Ema: Yep. Mr. Edgeworth asked me to help where I could. So, it's been quite a while since you've been back in Khura'in, I hear. Apollo: Yeah, more than ten years, in fact. Ema: Well, you sure didn't waste any time. I mean, you're already mixed up in a murder. You're as big a trouble magnet as Mr. Wright. Apollo: P-Please don't say that. My luck's already bad enough as it is. Athena: Ema, I hear Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has requested your services again. He seems to have really taken a liking to you. Ema: You mean His Ephemeral Holiness? MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. I don't mind that he approves of me and my abilities. It's just, his people skills need some serious work. But when he manages a smile and compliments my work, it's hard to say no. Plus, working on investigations overseas is a priceless experience. But flying back and forth between here and home every few days with no days off... That's been tough, and the lack of sleep has been brutal on my skin. To make matters worse, the defendant in this case is someone I know. I mean, how could this get any worse?! MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. Apollo: (Sounds like they've got one complicated prosecutor-detective relationship going on.) Examine Apollo: (We better get Ema's okay before we start snooping around.) Talk The incident Apollo: Ema, have you determined the cause of death? Ema: Blood loss from a stab wound. A single stab in the back was enough to cause the victim to bleed to death. The estimated time of death is 3 PM, which is when Dhurke came onto the scene. Inga's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Apollo: Any suspects besides Dhurke? Ema: No. He, Maya, and the minister were the only ones here. And Maya had been tied up until she was freed by the queen's royal guard. Apollo: Could someone have been hiding somewhere in here? Ema: Not likely. I was told this tomb was searched from top to bottom right after the murder. And during that time, the royal guard set up a perimeter to prevent anyone from escaping. Athena: In other words, the crime scene was completely sealed off? Ema: It would appear so. Apollo: Hmm... No way for a third party to escape without being spotted, so... (Great. It's another one of those convoluted locked-room mysteries.) The incident (subsequent times) Apollo: Ema, have you determined the cause of death? Ema: Blood loss from a stab wound. A single stab in the back was enough to cause the victim to bleed to death. The estimated time of death is 3 PM, which is when Dhurke came onto the scene. Apollo: Any suspects besides Dhurke? Ema: No. He, Maya, and the minister were the only ones here. And Maya had been tied up until she was freed by the queen's royal guard. Apollo: Could someone have been hiding somewhere in here? Ema: Not likely. I was told this tomb was searched from top to bottom right after the murder. And during that time, the royal guard set up a perimeter to prevent anyone from escaping. Athena: In other words, the crime scene was completely sealed off? Ema: It would appear so. Apollo: Hmm... No way for a third party to escape without being spotted, so... (Great. It's another one of those convoluted locked-room mysteries.) The victim Apollo: About the victim, Minister Inga... He was the kingdom's Minister of Justice, correct? Ema: Yes. Inga Karkhuul Khura'in was the second most powerful figure in Khura'in. Plus, he was married to the queen. Apollo: Seems strange that someone of his status would abduct someone. Ema: Apparently, he only told a few of his most loyal subordinates about his plan. That way, there was little chance of the police or even the queen finding out. Apollo: What was Inga hoping to gain by getting his hands on the orb? Ema: That I don't know. But I'm working on it. Apollo: (...I wonder if it really was for what Paul Atishon-Wimperson said...?) Atishon: I must deliver it to my benefactor at all costs. Phoenix: What do they want that relic for anyway? Atishon: Heh heh heh. It's something to do with an old legend. My patron seeks the great power said to be granted to whoever solves its secret. Apollo: (A great power that is said to be bestowed on whoever solves the orb's secret. In Khura'in, only those who can channel spirits are said to be fit to rule. Was that why Inga wanted such power? Did he want to be king?) Amara's tomb Apollo: So this is the tomb of the previous queen? Ema: Yes, Queen Amara was laid to rest here. She lost her life in an arsonist's blaze. What a tragic end. I heard this tomb sits on the actual site of her residence before it was burned down. They built it on the same spot so her soul could rest in peace. Apollo: (So this is where the fire happened, huh.) Athena: Why do you think Minister Inga was holding Ms. Fey captive here? Ema: It's the perfect spot, if you think about it. It's close to his private quarters, which made it easy to keep an eye on his prisoner. And the courtyard is only open to the royal family, so he had little fear of prying eyes. Plus, the tomb is normally locked, and only the royal family is allowed access. Athena: So that's why he picked this place. Apollo: How long had Ms. Fey been held captive? Ema: About six days. Apollo: Really?! That long?! Ema: It appears that she was severely weakened by her prolonged confinement. She passed out as soon as she was freed, and is now on an IV drip at the hospital. She's been asleep ever since. Athena: Poor Ms. Fey. I hope she gets better soon. Present Attorney's Badge Ema: Your attorney's badge? Huh... Apollo: What, that normally gets a better reaction from you. Ema: I'm tired of collecting your fingerprints. It's kind of lost its luster. Apollo: Yeah, but who knows? There could be other people's prints on it. Ema: Ooh, that's true! Hand it over, buddy! Apollo: Ah! Ema: ............Hmph. The only prints I found were yours. Apollo: (Argh, it's all dusty now.) Anything else Ema: Oh, you must need my forensic expertise! Just leave it to me! Apollo: Oh, um... Actually, I was wondering if you see anything strange about this. Ema: ...Oh. .................................... Apollo: (Why isn't she saying anything?) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: Ema, do you mind if we start looking around? Ema: Sure, I've already got the okay. Knock yourselves out. Oh, and here. It's a diagram the police drew of the tomb. I thought I'd give you a copy to help your investigation along. Apollo: Thank you. Tomb Diagram added to the Court Record. Ema: Oh, and let me know if you need my forensic expertise. Don't you dare keep all the fun to yourselves, you hear?! Apollo: You don't need to worry about that. (Besides, I'd hardly classify this as \"fun\".) Examine Front of Amara's sarcophagus Apollo: So this is Amara's sarcophagus. Let's take a closer look. Sarcophagus curtains Athena: Hey, these curtains open, Apollo. Sarcophagus keyhole Apollo: ...That's one big sarcophagus. Ema: They say the mummy of Amara, the former queen, rests inside. Apollo: A mummy, huh? ...Rats, it's locked. Ema: Hey, don't touch that! Apollo: You mean we can't search inside it? Ema: Not a chance. Besides, it's not something anyone'd try opening, anyway. Apollo: What if the real killer's hiding inside? Athena: Hey! Anyone in there? Ema: D-Don't do that! You're going to get us cursed! Athena: C-C-Cursed? Ema: The queen likely bears a grudge toward the living after such a violent, painful death. So no one dares touch the sarcophagus for fear of incurring her wrath. Athena: .........Oh no, Apollo. What am I going to do? Apollo: Don't look at me. Ema: ...In any case, the sarcophagus is temperature controlled. It's kept really cold to preserve the mummy. So even if someone did decide to hide inside it, they would eventually freeze to death. Apollo: I see... (Still, if they bundled up, I bet a person could hide in there for a little while.) Sides of Amara's sarcophagus Apollo: The sarcophagus is surrounded by a curtain. I bet someone could've hidden behind it. Ema: True, but that's one of the many places the royal guard checked after storming in. Athena: Wow, they were really thorough. Ema: Yes, well, apparently, one of their members loves mystery novels. He peered into every nook and cranny with an almost frightening amount of gusto. And when he was done, he said: \"Very interesting. It's like one of those locked-room mysteries.\" Apollo: Sounds like he's in the wrong line of work. Bloodstain on Amara's sarcophagus Athena: Wow, it's covered in blood. Apollo: With a blood spatter this large, it must've gotten all over the killer, too. Come to think of it... There was blood on Dhurke's clothes. Athena: The circumstantial evidence points to Dhurke being the killer. Apollo: That's what I'd conclude if I were a cop, too. (Why are things always so bleak for me...?) Holy Mother mural Apollo: It looks like the Holy Mother was painted here to watch over Amara's sarcophagus. Athena: So it's like, this tomb is protected by the founder? That must be so reassuring to those she left behind. Apollo: Only one problem: they didn't paint the eyes she needs to do said watching. Athena: Come to think of it, she doesn't have a mouth to smile down on the tomb with, either. It's actually kind of creepy. I wonder if being watched over by something like that gives the queen nightmares. Apollo: ...Hey, hey. Keep that up, and the founder just might come and \"watch over\" you, too. Broken statue (while facing Holy Mother painting) Apollo: Look, one of the statues is broken. Athena: Yeah, but it's kind of hard to see from here. Apollo: Let's check it out when we get a little closer. Front of broken statue Apollo: One of the statues is broken. Let's take a closer look. Broken statue Apollo: This thing's more splinter than statue now. Ema: The bullet from the victim's gun did a real number on it. Athena: It seems like something you'd get cursed for, you know? Apollo: In Minister Inga's case, I'd say getting your ticket punched is curse enough. Athena: Yeah, but don't curses extend to the afterlife? Apollo: You need to stop taking what Nahyuta says so seriously. Athena: I-I'm perfectly capable of thinking for myself! Brown magatamas Apollo: It's a magatama... I think. Did it come from the broken statue? Athena: Look, Apollo, there's another one. But the other statues only have one each. Apollo: Hey, you're right. Maybe this statue was special or something. Bullet Apollo: Look, there's a bullet here. Ema: It's from the pistol the victim was carrying. My guess is he tried to shoot his attacker, but missed, and the bullet ended up here. We've already determined the rifling marks to be a match to his gun. Athena: Rifling marks? Aren't those...? Ema: Oh ho! Shall I explain? The science behind it is absolutely fascinating. Apollo: No, no, we're good. Ema: Hmph, lawyers... Think they're so smart. Apollo: You do realize we can hear you. Sparkling object Apollo: Hm? There's something shiny down there. It's a pendant... Athena: There's blood on it. I wonder who it belongs to. Ema: All we know is it's not the victims. No one in the royal family recognized it. Apollo: ...Ema, did you lift any fingerprints from it? Ema: I did, but... ...I wasn't able to get a clean one. Apollo: That's too bad. Ema: But the blood turned out to be the victim's. Apollo: That means it must have fallen here in the course of the murder. (It might be Dhurke's. I should ask him about it later.) Pink Butterfly Pendant added to the Court Record. Body outline Apollo: Guess this is where Inga collapsed when he died. Better take a closer look. Body outline Apollo: They've already taken the body away. It's kind of sad how familiar I've become with body outlines. Ema: I have a photo of the body if you're interested. He was stabbed right in the back; the poor guy was practically skewered. Athena: What's he wearing on his arms? Ema: Those are the Cuffs of Justice. Seems to be a tradition here for the Minister of Justice to wear those forearm cuffs. Apollo: They look like they're made of a thick fabric, so I guess they aren't for protection. Athena: Maybe they're for keeping his sleeves out of the way when handling documents. Apollo: Yeah, that's probably their original purpose. But over the years, the reason for wearing them was probably forgotten. So now, they're just one of many traditional things that people do without knowing why. Athena: ...Oh, I get it. Kind of like the way you roll up your sleeves, huh? Apollo: ...Or your psychology, if we're going there. Athena: I happen to know why I started, thank you very much! Tomb Crime Photo added to the Court Record. Body outline (subsequent times) Apollo: These white lines indicate where the minister's body fell. Athena: Hey, didn't Ema give us a photo of the crime scene before they took the body away? Apollo: Looks like he was stabbed in the back. Athena: Those things on his arms... They're called the \"Cuffs of Justice,\" right? Apollo: Yeah, they're supposedly a traditional part of the minister's outfit. Knife Apollo: So, this is the murder weapon. Ema, did you find any prints on it? Ema: Yep, and they were super clear. They belong to one Dhurke Sahdmadhi. Apollo: That's not good. Were there any others? Ema: There was one more print from another individual... ...but it was too smudged to identify. It's probably an old print from someone else who had handled the knife. Apollo: Oh... (Yet another piece of unhelpful info to add to our ever-growing pile... *sigh*) Knife (subsequent times) Apollo: The murder weapon... Athena: Apparently, Dhurke's prints were found on it. Apollo: That's not very helpful, is it. Cell phone Apollo: I wonder if this is Inga's cell phone. Ema: It should be. His fingerprints are all over it. Apollo: Do you know if he talked with anyone recently? Ema: There were a few calls logged between him and his underlings. They're all members of the secret police, who were directly under the minister's control. Athena: You mean like spies? Apollo: I don't think that's quite it. Pistol Apollo: So the minister was armed, huh. Ema: Mm-hm. That's a four-shot pistol. He had it for self-defense, apparently. But it won't be firing anything any time soon. Apollo: Huh? Athena: He was carrying a broken gun around for show? Ema: No, we recovered a bullet here. Which means the gun probably broke as the minister fired its last round. Thing is... the gun's chambers are all empty. Yet, that one bullet is the only bullet we could find. Apollo: That is strange. Where did the other three go? Athena: ...Maybe Dhurke ate them. Apollo: We can ask the next time we see him. Just be ready for his predictably \"shocking\" answer. Pistol (subsequent times) Apollo: Inga's pistol... He used to carry it for self-defense. Athena: Apparently, he fired all four rounds. Apollo: Yeah, but only one slug was recovered in this tomb. Rows of statues Apollo: It's like a small army of monks, all neatly lined up. It looks like they're facing the sarcophagus in prayer. Athena: If you look carefully, each one has a slightly different expression. Apollo: I wonder if they used real people as models. Athena: Some are frowning, some are smiling... Hm? There's one that looks like he's trying his hardest not to burst out laughing. Apollo: ...Really? Hmm, I wonder why. Athena: Maybe it's like those times when things are so intense, you can't help but laugh. You know, like at funerals and stuff. Apollo: They went through all the trouble of depicting that? Talk about going overboard... Right incense burner Apollo: It's full of ash. My guess would be this is an incense burner. Athena: Hey, look, Apollo. There's something in the ashes. Apollo: ...Let's see what it is. Ash Apollo: It's full of ash. They must burn incense in here. Athena: So, I was wondering, Apollo... Did the ash come from the incense sticks that were burned in this? Or do people put their incense in after there was already she in here to hold them up? Apollo: Don't be silly, Athena. The answer's simple. The ash is the product of prayers from countless visitors who came here. It's not a chicken-or-the-egg kind of thing. Apollo: Oh, that's an interesting take on it. It's so much more poetic than mine! Gemstone Apollo: Is that... a gemstone? Wonder what it's doing here. Athena: Heh heh heh, I've got this one covered, Apollo. Would you like to hear my brilliant theory? Apollo: Well, I guess it wouldn't do any harm. Athena: You know how people make wishes by throwing coins into a fountain, right? Well-- Apollo: You know, on second thought, I'm good. Athena: Whaaat?! Y-You sure you don't need to hear my theory? I was just about to get to the good part! Apollo: Let's just ask Ema. That'll be much quicker. Excuse me, Ema? What's this gemstone doing here? Ema: Oh, that... It's not a gem, it's a button -- albeit a very expensive one -- from the victim's jacket. Must've fallen off and gotten in there somehow. Apollo: See? Every puzzle has an answer, Athena. Athena: Well, I thought my idea was pretty good... Wait... What's with this soot? See here, on the gemstone. Apollo: ...Hey, you're right. Gemstone added to the Court Record. Right incense burner (after examining gemstone) Apollo: It's full of ash. My guess would be this is an incense burner. Grape juice Apollo: This is the grape juice Inga was drinking. He was probably nervous before his meeting with Dhurke. Athena: So he drank grape juice? I'm not seeing the logic here. Apollo: Mr. Wright told me all about it when he was hospitalized a few years ago. He said grape juice has something in it that helps you relax. Athena: Really? ...Um, are you sure he was talking about regular, plain old grape juice? Because it sounds like he was talking about the fermented variety. Apollo: No, he couldn't have meant that. I mean, we're talking about a medical facility. They wouldn't have allowed something like that in. Athena: R-Right... Let's just leave it at that. Side paintings (while facing Holy Mother mural) Apollo: There's a painting up there, but I can't see it very well from here. Paintings right of Holy Mother mural Apollo: A baby on a lotus blossom? That's one strange painting. Ema: Apparently, that's part of a mural depicting the life and times of Queen Amara. You know, like a storyboard or something. Apollo: So that baby's supposed to be Amara? Athena: This one depicts Amara preaching to the faithful. Apollo: It's hard to put into words, but I've never seen anything like it. Let's see, the next one is... I-Is that... Dhurke? Why does he have horns? Athena: My best guess is... ...it depicts the first time Amara and Dhurke met. Apollo: So he's supposed to be some kind of demon who's seducing her? Athena: Well, he WAS successful since they got married after that. Apollo: ...The mural continues on the opposite wall. Paintings left of Holy Mother mural Athena Is this supposed to be Amara channeling a spirit? Apollo: It looks like the spirit of some country's sultan or something. And she seems to be conveying something to his retainers. Athena: ...Sh-She's on fire. Apollo: This must be Amara's assassination as allegedly carried out by Dhurke. They really made him look evil. Athena: ...This is the weirdest one of all. Apollo: Is that supposed to be Dhurke facing his punishment in the afterlife? Anyway... Hm? I guess that's the last one. Athena: I guess we're supposed to see this as a happy ending. Apollo: Yeah, except nobody came out of this story happy. Chair Apollo: Ms. Fey was apparently tied to this chair. Let's take a closer look. We should try to cover every angle possible here. Let's use [left analog stick / WASD] to change our perspective and take a careful look around. (Changed from [Slide the Touch Screen...] in the original release) * (Line [...or use the Circle Pad ([Circle Pad]) to look around carefully in this area.] removed in the Trilogy release) Seat, rails, or legs of chair Apollo: (...Poor Ms. Fey. She must've been tied up to this chair.) Athena: I can just imagine how much her backside must've hurt after sitting here for so long. Apollo: It would've been torture for you, I bet. I mean, you don't know how to sit still. Athena: If by that you mean I like to stay active, then I have to agree with you. Rope Athena: I bet you didn't know, but I happen to be a bit of an escape artist myself. Trucy showed me how to do her rope escape trick. Apollo: Uh-huh. And why would you bother learning something like that? Athena: Because we're always getting into trouble when working cases with Mr. Wright. So I thought it might come in handy someday. Apollo: Well, I guess you're right about that. Ms. Fey could've definitely used that knowledge. Athena: That's right! So now, you just sit right here and we'll get started. Apollo: What in the world gave you the idea I wanted to learn?! Bloodstain on chair leg Apollo: Look, there's a bloodstain on one of the chair legs. Ema: Really?! Hey, you're right. I completely missed that. Apollo: Let's move the chair so we can check under it. ...There's more blood under the chair leg. Ema: Hmm... I wonder what it's doing there. I have some luminol here. Why don't you do some testing around it? Spray floor near rope Leads to: \"Look!\" Apollo: Look! The bloodstain leads all the way to the sarcophagus! Athena: Ema, is this Minister Inga's blood? Ema: Hold on one second... .........Huh? That's strange. I didn't get a match. Apollo: So then... whose blood is it? Dhurke and Ms. Fey weren't wounded as far as we know. Athena: And the blood's been wiped up by someone for some reason. Apollo: Yeah, that's strange, too. Mysterious Bloodstain added to the Court Record. Bloodstain on floor (after examining bloodstain on chair leg) Apollo: There's a bloodstain on the floor. Athena: It's already been mostly wiped up, but the stain leads all the way to the sarcophagus. Apollo: I wonder whose blood it is. Wall curtains Apollo: Someone could have hid behind these curtains. Athena: Here, I'll go give it a try! Well, can you tell I'm hiding here? Apollo: No, I can't tell at all. That's it! That's the perfect hiding place! Athena: We did it, Apollo! We solved the case! Ema: Sorry to burst your bubble, but... ...the royal guard searched the tomb high and low right after they stormed in. And they said no one else was in here besides Minister Inga, Dhurke, and Ms. Fey. Apollo: ...Well. Back to the drawing board, I guess. Athena: My brilliant deduction -- destroyed in three sentences. After examining sarcophagus keyhole, sides of Amara's sarcophagus, bloodstain on Amara's sarcophagus, Holy Mother mural, broken statue (zoomed in), brown magatamas, sparkling object, body outline (zoomed in), knife, cell phone, pistol, gemstone, bloodstain on chair leg, and wall curtains: Apollo: I think we've covered just about everything. Maybe we should go over what we've learned so far. Athena: Umm... For starters, we're dealing with a locked-room murder. But instead of the tomb being locked, it was being cordoned off by the royal guard. And after the murder, no one was found to be hiding inside. Apollo: Right. In addition... ...we also know that Dhurke's fingerprints are all over the murder weapon. Athena: The curtain around the sarcophagus was drenched in the victim's blood on one side. The blood must've also gotten on the killer when they stabbed the minister from behind. Apollo: Dhurke had blood on him when the crime was first discovered. Unfortunately, he doesn't remember what happened. .................. Athena: ............ Apollo: (This is not good.) Athena: So, what we know so far is... ...things couldn't be worse for our case. And that's still and understatement somehow. Apollo: Yeah, it's looking pretty grim. Ema: Oh, uh! If you two are done here, I'll have to ask you to leave. Go on, scoot! Apollo: Something wrong, Ema? Why are you trying to give us the boot? Ema: ...It's just easier if you're not here when His Ephemeral Holiness arrives. ...Ah! Apollo: (Speak of the devil.) Ema: P-Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... Nahyuta: Detective Skye... It seems you've spoken at length with these two lawyers. I do hope you've also kept an eye on them. Ema: Y-Yes, of course! Like a hawk! They didn't touch a single thing! Ha, a-ha ha ha! Nahyuta: ...Give a lawyer an inch, and they'll take a mile. Never forget that. Apollo: (There's that look of distrust again.) ...Hey, Nahyuta. Do you really believe that Dhurke's guilty? Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: And are you seriously going to prosecute this case? I mean, he's your father. You were once part of the Defiant Dragons, weren't you? Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: Hey! Nahyuta! Wait! I said wait! Come on, Athena, after him! Athena: Huh? ...Oh, uh, right behind you! May 18Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence Apollo: Nahyuta, would you stop already?! Nahyuta: .........What do you want? Apollo: It's about Dhurke. Would you please hear me out? Nahyuta: ...I fail to see why I should. Now, if you'll excuse me... Apollo: Apollo: Nahyuta! ...Are you afraid of what I might have to say? If not, there's no harm in listening, right? Nahyuta: .........Very well. Speak. But make it quick. There is much I must do. Apollo: (Why does everything have to be so difficult with you?) Talk Prosecuting Dhurke Apollo: So, I know you'll be prosecuting Dhurke's case, but... ...aren't there any other prosecutors in this country? Why does it have to be you? Nahyuta: ...Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran, personally requested that I serve as prosecutor. Apollo: Sh-She did? That WOULD make it hard to say no. Nahyuta: Her Eminence thinks highly of my prosecutorial skills. Apollo: Still, she didn't have to ask you to handle a case against your own father. Be honest. You really don't want to do this, do you? Nahyuta: ...Ahh. You speak of love and sentiment. Apollo: Er, I guess so. Nahyuta: I do not deny such human emotions. But... the law is the law. And placing personal feelings above it is beyond reprieve. ...Do you disagree? Apollo: W-Well... No, I don't disagree, but... Nahyuta: Civilizations only exist due to the confines of the law. Without them, love and sentiment would lack the fertile they need to flourish. Do you disagree? Apollo: No, but... Nahyuta: The law must be obeyed. This truth sits above all else, including personal feelings. Therefore, whether or not I am the son of the accused is of no consequence. It is that simple, or would you say otherwise? Apollo: Nnnngh... B-But... Athena: Come on, Apollo! Tell him how wrong he is! Apollo: B...But don't you... you know... wish it wasn't that way...? Nahyuta: ............... Athena: ......... Nahyuta: It appears I've wasted my breath on you. Athena: And the winner is... Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! Nahyuta: ...Hmph. Still spewing empty words devoid of meaning or consequence, I see... ...you putrid red pepper. Apollo: Argh! ........ (I know I'm right... But did he have to be so eloquent about his point? It's like he's trying to cover something up with his pretty words.) Athena: Apollo, I'd cut back on the debates with him if I were you. Just stick to questions, like the one you wanted to ask. Who Dhurke cares about (appears after \"Prosecuting Dhurke\") Leads to: \"Nahyuta, I wanted to ask you about that hostage situation.\" Present Attorney's Badge Nahyuta: Why is that badge before me? Apollo: Remember how we used to talk about what we wanted to be back when we were kids? I wanted to be a lawyer, and you, a prosecutor. You said you wanted to prosecute bad guys to make sure they got punished. Nahyuta: Yes, passing judgment upon evil... That is my calling. And it is why I have taken this case. Apollo: Are you saying Dhurke is evil? Nahyuta: He who goes against what is righteous and holy... ...I shall reap his soul with all my power, whoever he may be, for that is my role. Apollo: (Then I'll just have to defend his soul with all MY power, Nahyuta.) Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Nahyuta: Alas... Another soul has departed this world, and must now be guided to the Twilight Realm. Apollo: You would even hold last rites for a kidnapper like Minister Inga? Nahyuta: Criminals, too, must be given funerary rites. Deny that, and their soul will turn malevolent, bringing woe upon the living. That is why all who pass on must receive a proper requiem. Apollo: Makes sense. I mean, if I were murdered, I'd probably be pretty keen on revenge, too. Anything else Nahyuta: The putrid-minded lawyer seeks information from me? Apollo: Come on, throw me a bone here. Nahyuta: I think not. Apollo: Well, aren't we stingy? Apollo: Nahyuta, I wanted to ask you about that hostage situation. Inga said he had someone dear to Dhurke in the palm of his hand. And he was using that person, along with his hostage, as leverage in obtaining the orb. Nahyuta: ...! That's news to me. Apollo: Well, that's what Inga said. Dhurke: You can kiss your chances of getting the orb goodbye. Inga: ...Heh heh heh. Maya Fey ain't my only... how shall I say... insurance, you know, Dhurke. Dhurke: What? Inga: I've got someone dear to you right in the palm of my hand, see? Now that one, well... You can imagine what kinds of things I could do, right? Dhurke: What? Inga: I've got someone dear to you right in the palm of my hand, see? Now that one, well... You can imagine what kinds of things I could do, right? Dhurke: ! ............ Inga: Heh heh. Glad you're seeing things my way. Apollo: I got the impression Dhurke had no choice but to follow Inga's demands after he heard that. So who do you suppose this special person is? Nahyuta: .........I wouldn't know. BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: ! (My bracelet's reacting!) Hey, Nahyuta, about what you just said-- Nahyuta: Apollo: Ack! Ow-ow-ouch! M-My bracelet is crushing my wrist! Youch! That really hurts! Wh-What the heck's going on?! Nahyuta: ...I'm wise to your tricks, you putrid pepper. That bracelet reacts to the anxieties around you by squeezing your wrist. But now that I know how it works, I can make it tighten around your wrist any time I wish. Consider this a warning. Apollo: Argh... (I don't know how he did it, but this renders my bracelet useless.) Nahyuta: Such devilry is powerless in the face of the Holy Mother's blessings. Athena: Looks like your special power won't work against Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, Apollo. We'll have to try something else. Apollo: Argh, you're right. We'll just have to ask Dhurke about this. Nahyuta: .........It appears... Apollo: ? Nahyuta: ...You intend to go through with a trial you have no hope of winning. Grow up, Mr. Justice. We are no longer children, you and I. Apollo: I'm not the one who needs to grow up, Nahyuta. In case you didn't hear, I won my last case against none other than Mr. Wright. Nahyuta: ! Athena: You tell him, Apollo! Nahyuta: ............... Apollo: (Is he mad? I can never tell with him.) Nahyuta: ...This trial is different. Your foolishness will only earn you a death sentence for aiding and abetting a criminal. And those who die as criminals... ...are doomed to be reborn in the next life as something lower than a bug or vegetable. You would be lucky to return to this realm as a patch of mold. Apollo: M-Mold? That's pretty harsh. Nahyuta: If you wish to avert such a fate, abandon this folly before it is too late. Apollo: ...I don't care if I end up as a dollop of blue cheese dressing in my next life! I'm going to defend Dhurke in court! Nahyuta: .........You fool. Know this... I intend to prosecute the accused with all my might -- no matter what you say or do. Consider yourself forewarned. ...Now, if you will excuse me. Athena: Prosecutor Sahdmadhi knows his father will be publicly executed if he's found guilty. Yet he won't show even an ounce of mercy. Apollo: ............... (...Nahyuta. Is this the real you? Have you really changed? Do you really plan on sending Dhurke to his death? Do you even hear me? Don't Dhurke and I matter to you anymore?) To be continued May 18Tem'phul Temple Phoenix: (Maya passed out right after we found her in the tomb.) Maya: ...I feel... exhausted. I can't keep my eyes... open... Phoenix: (She's been out cold ever since. We haven't been able to get a word out of her. The doctor says it's just exhaustion, but I can't help but worry...) Edgeworth: What is it, Wright? Are you all right? Phoenix: ...Yeah. Just thinking is all. I'm glad you're here, Edgeworth. We wouldn't have gotten the permissions we have without you. Edgeworth: ...Well, I didn't come all the way to Khura'in to be useless. Speaking of the investigation, I received a few things from Detective Skye. These should prove to be useful to us as well. Inga's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Tomb Diagram added to the Court Record. Tomb Crime Photo added to the Court Record. Phoenix: I can't thank you enough, Edgeworth. (Honestly, I'd have been so lost without him these past few days.) ???: You there! The \"Barbed Head\" lawyer, Phoenix Wriiiiiight! Phoenix: Huh? .........You're... from the Ga'ran Royal Guard, right...? Royal Guard: I am Lah'kee, royal guard member and Her Eminence's shoooooulder rubber!!! Phoenix: That's... very specific... And what does the royal shoulder rubber want with me? Wait, come to think of it, my shoulders ARE a bit stiff-- Royal Guard: Don't be absuuurd!!! I am here for one purpose ooonly!!! I am to bring you before Her Eminence... ...Queen Ga'ran, grand priestess of Khura'in!! Will you complyyy?!!! Phoenix: The queen? What could she want with me? (And why does he have to shout like that?) Edgeworth: Hmm... I can't fathom why Queen Ga'ran would summon you... ...but I advise you to accept Her Eminence's gracious invitation. .........Royal shoulder rubber Lahkee, was it? May I join Mr. Wright in his audience with the queen? Royal Guard: The name's Lah'kee! L-A-H apostrophe K-E-E!!! And...! All praise the omnipotent Queen Ga'raaan!!! For she has already foreseen and approved your request, Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth!!! You are both to come with meeeee!!! Edgeworth: You mean to say that Queen Ga'ran sees our every move? Royal Guard: Yes indeeeed! Her Eminence's spiritual power is immeeeeeeense!!! She can even see what's going on thoooousands of miiiiiiiiles away!!! Edgeworth: .........Wright. I fear I'll lose my hearing next if we don't hurry. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Me, too... Why would the queen herself summon me personally? What could she possibly be up to? Examine Temple Phoenix: There weren't any hotels available, so this is our home for tonight. It's a bed to sleep in and a roof over our heads. Phoenix: Sorry to disappoint, but... there aren't any beds here. We'll have to sleep on the floor next to a bunch of strangers. Edgeworth: Wh-What? ...Tell me there's a shower at the very least. Phoenix: The kitchen sink works just fine, I hear. Edgeworth: Of all the-- Wright, you will work to bring this case to a swift resolution. The sooner the better. Edgeworth: .........I suppose it will do. Spring Phoenix: The water's so clear, it's like a window into the soul. Edgeworth: I wouldn't stare too hard into it, Wright. Or you may find all your bluffs staring right back at you. Phoenix: No pool-gazing in front of a client. Got it. Temples in background Edgeworth: There appears to be many temples in this area. Phoenix: Yeah, there are always a lot of monks and worshippers praying around here. And then there's tourists like us. Edgeworth: It's unfortunate that we have more pressing matters to attend to. Then again, sightseeing with you of all people isn't exactly at the top of my list. Phoenix: (As if you have the luxury to be so picky, Edgeworth.) Talk Any Ideas? Edgeworth: So you'd been here all this time. I wondered where you had gone. Phoenix: ...Don't tell me you missed me, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: As if. The courts have been so peaceful without you around. Phoenix: You make it sound like I leave legal devastation in my wake. Edgeworth: Heh... Well, don't you? What to do Edgeworth: Well, Wright, what do you intend to do now? Phoenix: I was thinking... I want to help Apollo win this case. So why don't we try to gather whatever information we can? Edgeworth: You're quite the considerate boss. Phoenix: Well, I kinda forced him to take care of the office in my absence, so... ...it's the least I can do. Present Attorney's Badge or Tomb Diagram Edgeworth: Still at it, I see. I guess borders mean little in the face of your incurable habit. Phoenix: Well, I heard you used to present evidence left and right during your investigations, too. Edgeworth: That was a long time ago. ...Besides, who did you hear that from? Phoenix: Oh, I have my sources. Edgeworth: Oh? Well, tell your \"source\" that I look forward to his next salary review. Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Edgeworth: It's ironic that the man tasked with upholding the law should end up breaking it. Phoenix: Well, it's not like we don't have our fair share of that back home. Edgeworth: Hmph, that is a thing of the past. The worst offenders have already been removed. Phoenix: Now that you mention it, wasn't Gaspen Payne expelled from the prosecutor's office? Edgeworth: Yes, he was a particularly troublesome individual. I was shocked to see him resurface here in Khura'in, and with considerable sway, no less. I just hope he doesn't end up making a mess of things here as well. Royal Residence Examine Ga'ran Palace Phoenix: Ga'ran Palace, the heart of the kingdom's government and religion. Edgeworth: Yes, the two are inseparably intertwined here in Khura'in. The religious beliefs of its people touch every aspect of their lives, including legal affairs. Phoenix: Right. Like how they commune with spirits in court. I suppose Khura'inism is the glue that binds their faith, law, and politics together. It may seem strange to foreigners like us, but for them, it's perfectly natural. Landscape Phoenix: What a beautiful place this is. But I'd be enjoying this a whole lot more if we weren't investigating a murder. Edgeworth: Commoners aren't normally allowed access to the royal residence, you know. Under ordinary circumstances, it would be impossible to take in such a spectacular view. Though murder is certainly a unique reason to be offered such a rare opportunity. Rayfa's residence Phoenix: This place is decorated with all sorts of colorful flowers. And that view from the veranda looks like it would be amazing. If I had to guess, I'd say Rayfa must live here. Amara's Tomb Phoenix: Amara's Tomb -- the scene of Inga's murder. Poor Maya was held captive in there. Edgeworth: To think she was actually being held here in Khura'in. If only we had found out sooner. Phoenix: ...No point dwelling on that now. All we can do is to keep moving forward. Edgeworth: Yes, of course. Footprints Edgeworth: There are footprints coming from this residence. Phoenix: Too bad they just kinda end. I wonder who made them and where they went. Urns Phoenix: This overturned urn spilled its water all over the place. It was already knocked over when we got here earlier this afternoon, so... ...we can rule out Athena at least. Edgeworth: .........Wright. What does it say about you if your first suspect is your own subordinate? Inga's residence Phoenix: ...What a gaudy building. Looks like something you'd appreciate, Edgworth. Edgeworth: ...For the record, Wright, I have absolutely no interest in such ostentatious things. Phoenix: (Says the man who rides around in a red sports car, wearing that frilly cravat thing.) Amara's Tomb Examine Anywhere Phoenix: Apollo and Athena are already working this area. Edgeworth and I should try someplace else. Detention Center Examine Bell Edgeworth: This bell must be for summoning the guard. Phoenix: I bet one of your detectives would come running if you rang it. Edgeworth: Let's find out, shall we? Phoenix: Th-They're not seriously going to show up, are they? Guard Phoenix: Oh, the guard's asleep. And here I thought he was stoically doing his duty. Impressive. May 18Ga'ran Palace - Audience Chamber Ga'ran: Ah, the \"Barbed Head\" lawyer has arrived. We bid you welcome. And you, as well, Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth. Phoenix: Th-Thank you. (This place is still as magnificent as last time.) Ga'ran: We have heard much about you, Barbed One. It seems your bluffs and tomfoolery tend to leave our court devastated in their wake. Phoenix: Uh... Is that what people have been saying about me? Edgworth: ...Wright! Where are your manners?! Your Eminence. I am both humbled and delighted to be in your presence. Phoenix: Oh, umm... Your Eminence... Um, glad to be here. Looks like you're doing well. Ga'ran: ...Heh. It is all right. There is no need to keep your head bowed all day. Edgeworth: Yes, Your Eminence. Rayfa: ............ Phoenix: (Rayfa's not looking too good. I guess even she can't just bounce back from her father's murder...) ...So what can I do for you, Your Eminence? Ga'ran: We wish to question you about something related to the case at hand. Phoenix: (Perfect. Because I have a few questions of my own.) Examine Throne Phoenix: That's one swanky throne. I wouldn't mind taking a seat there myself. Edgeworth: The jester and the crown. I imagine it'd make quite the interesting picture. Phoenix: You know Edgeworth... I hate to say this, but you're absolutely right. Guards Phoenix: It's the Ga'ran Royal Guard. The one who came for us earlier said that he's the royal shoulder rubber. ...Um, excuse me. But are each of you charged with your own specific task? Royal Guard: I'm the royal teeeeeaaaa server! Royal Guard: I'm the royal taaaaaaster! Royal Guard: I'm the royal bed maaaaaaaker! Royal Guard: I'm the royal fitness traaaaiiiiine-- Phoenix: All right, all right... I'm sorry I asked. Edgeworth: At this rate, one has to wonder if there is no task left unassigned by Her Eminence. Talk Inga's crime Ga'ran: We fear we do not fully comprehend what has transpired. So it is that we summoned you here to further elucidate the situation. Is it true that our husband Inga had been seeking the Founder's Orb? Phoenix: That's right. He wanted to trade a hostage for it. That's why he abducted Maya Fey. Rayfa: Insolent fool! *ka-tonk!* Phoenix: Oww! Rayfa: That is a lie! A lie, I say! Father would have never done such a thing! Phoenix: B-But he did abduct Maya. That much is-- Rayfa: I will not stand here and listen to this nonsense! You will pay for this, you... you...! *ka-tonk!* *ka-tonk!* *ka-tonk!* Phoenix: Ow-Ow-Oww! P-Please, Your Benevolence! Ga'ran: That is quite enough, Rayfa. We understand your feelings, but we fear he speaks the truth. For we believe we know why your father would do such a thing. Rayfa: Huh? Ga'ran: We believe he was seeking the orb as a means of obtaining spiritual power. And with it, he intended to usurp the throne. Rayfa: .........M-Mother... Phoenix: What do you mean, Your Eminence? Ga'ran: Inga was planning a coup, for he was dissatisfied with the current administration... ...and his secret police was the primary instrument of his treason. Phoenix: The secret police... They came up during the high priest's murder trial, too. An elite force under the direct command of the Minister of Justice -- in this case, Inga. The man who was hunting down rebels as Lady Kee'ra was a member of that group. Ga'ran: Indeed. Inga turned that once proud force into his own private army. And he intended on using them to launch a coup and assassinate us. Edgeworth: So Your Eminence had no control over them? Ga'ran: As much as it shames us to admit it, Khura'in is not the unified realm it would appear to be. We are truly sorry you have had to witness the dirty underbelly of our kingdom. Rayfa: H...How could Father...? Ga'ran: But know that Inga could not have become king simply through our assassination. For in Khura'in, only those who possess spiritual power may sit on the throne. Edgeworth: I see... That explains why Minister Inga was seeking the Founder's Orb. Ga'ran: Barbed One, do you recall the man known as Pees'lubn Andistan'dhin? Phoenix: ...What about him? Ga'ran: He, too, was involved in Inga's machinations. Inga had bought his loyalty, ordered the man to steal the orb, and covered up the theft. Phoenix: And then, he sent the orb to the U.S. for Dr. Buff to study... It's all coming together... Dhurke the criminal Ga'ran: The capture of the infamous villain Dhurke Sahdmadhi... It may prove to be the crowning achievement of our reign. Now, perhaps, the kingdom may return to the peace it once knew. Oh, what a joyous day. Royal Guard: Hail to Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran, Grand Priestess of Khura'in! Her Eminence's spiritual power invoked a blessing straight from the Holy Mother! Phoenix: (I could see how her cronies would be elated at the prospect. But the queen herself seems almost giddy for someone whose husband was just murdered.) Rayfa: Father... Phoenix: (Rayfa, on the other hand, doesn't appear to be taking it so well.) About that incident that occurred twenty-three years ago... The one in which Dhurke was accused of assassinating Queen Amara. Ga'ran: Yes, he set fire to her private residence, burning my dear sister alive. Phoenix: Murder by arson... Ga'ran: ONly a demon would be capable of such a heinous crime. Phoenix: (But that event also set the stage for you to become queen...) What did you do before you were crowned queen, Your Eminence? Ga'ran: As part of our training to be queen, we served in many different governmental positions. The longest of which was as the previous Minister of Justice. It was in that position that we were best able to support our elder sister, Queen Amara. Phoenix: (Interesting... That's her husband's position, or at least it was.) And when you ascended to the throne, you passed the Defense Culpability Act. Defense Culpability Act (appears after \"Dhurke the criminal\") Phoenix: \"...those who would support criminals will be deemed just as guilty.\" What prompted you to pass something like the Defense Culpability Act, Your Eminence? Ga'ran: ...The assassination of our dear sister Amara. When the infamous villain Dhurke Sahdmadhi was apprehended... ...he announced that he would act as his own lawyer. Phoenix: (That's right... Dhurke used to be a lawyer.) Ga'ran: Dhurke had been an extraordinarily talented lawyer, and highly esteemed by the people. But he falsified evidence in an attempt to win his own case. Phoenix: I see... Ga'ran: But when the truth of his fabrications and the assassination of the queen came to light... ...the people were devastated. And trust in the legal system plummeted. Edgeworth: .........Now why does that sound so familiar? Phoenix: Yeah, I wonder, aha-hah-hah... Ga'ran: In Khura'in, the Hall of Justice is a sacred space where victims receive their last rites. Should the people lose their faith in it, the kingdom would be shaken to its very core. That is why the Defense Culpability Act had to be passed. It was the only way to keep our legal system from tumbling into the abyss. Phoenix: So that's how you sought to eliminate the use of perjury and phony evidence, huh. But that law is what made lawyers go extinct in your kingdom. Now there's no one left to defend those who have been accused. Ga'ran: .........We see how you could take issue with such a reality. However, we have not banned the act of lawyering itself. Those who are confident that they can prove their client's innocence... ...are always welcome to mount a vigorous defense, as you yourself have shown. Phoenix: W-Well, I guess so, but... Without lawyers, there's the possibility of false charges being filed and prosecuted. Ga'ran: So long as our prosecutors continue to run nothing but perfect trials... ...there needn't be fear of such nefarious dealings. Do you disagree? Phoenix: (Perfect prosecutors and their perfect trials, huh...) Edgeworth: Let's not get started down THIS path... Ga'ran: Furthermore, here in Khura'in, we have the Divination Séance. And so it is we no longer need lawyers, for the dead do not lie. Phoenix: Well, in the short time I've been here, I've beaten back false charges twice. And I've found that cases built on the memories of the dead are less than perfect. So yes, I do take issue with the Defense Culpability Act, to say the least. Ga'ran: ...Ho ho ho. Such relentless rhetoric. Your reputation precedes you, Barbed One. It feels as if we ourselves were being cross-examined. Phoenix: O-Oh, no, that wasn't my intention. Ga'ran: ...It is true that some feel that the Defense Culpability Act is a necessary evil at best. But it is a small sacrifice upon which the peace of our kingdom has been forged. Phoenix: (If you consider executing innocent lawyers a small sacrifice, then sure.) Ga'ran: The fact is that following its passage... ...the crime rate here in Khura'in dropped markedly. Therefore, we have no regrets concerning the enactment of the Defense Culpability Act. Phoenix: (Really? None at all?) Edgeworth: Wright, why don't we leave it at that? This isn't a court of law, after all. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Present Anything Phoenix: Um, please take a look at this... Ga'ran: ...That reminds us of when Dhurke was still practicing law. So, we see that lawyers in your country also present evidence... ...simply to gauge the other party's reaction when all else has failed. Do not presume to use such simplistic methods upon us. Phoenix: S-Sorry. After clearing all Talk options: Ga'ran: About the Founder's Orb that was to be exchanged for the hostage... It went missing after the murder. Would you happen to know anything about that? Phoenix: It's missing? I'm sure Dhurke had it when he went into the tomb. If it wasn't there, I have no idea where it could be, Your Eminence. Ga'ran: ...In that case, then perhaps Dhurke has hidden it somewhere. ...Incidentally... there is the matter of that horned youth you were with. Phoenix: Oh, you must mean Apollo. Ga'ran: From his odd hairstyle, may we assume him to be a relative? Perhaps, your younger brother? Phoenix: N-No, no! You've got it all wrong. He's Dhurke's son. Well, more like foster son -- they're not actually related by blood. Ga'ran: Dhurke's...? .........Royal guard! Royal Guard: Your Eminence! Phoenix: Hm? (What's she whispering in that one guy's ear?) Ga'ran: .........Thank you for your time. The two of you may go now. Edgeworth: Yes, Your Eminence. We'll be on our way. Phoenix: (Okay, now what? Apollo and Athena have the murder scene investigation covered, so... ...maybe we should go speak with the locals over at the bazaar.) May 18Khura'in - Bazaar RAWWWRRR! Edgeworth: Wh-What... Was that a lion? Phoenix: Oh, that? Caught me by surprise, too, when I first heard it. It's the cry of a local bird known as a warbaa'd. Edgeworth: A bird? That sounds like that? Warbaa'd: RAWWWRRR! Edgeworth: Sounds more like a beast than a bird, if you ask me. Phoenix: It's a form of mimicry. You know, to help protect them against predators and stuff. Edgeworth: Yes, well... Can't say I've heard one quite like that before. Phoenix: Oh, it's more than unusual -- it's endangered. It's extremely rare to encounter one in the wild these days. Edgeworth: ...If it's so rare, then what's one doing out here in the middle of the bazaar? Phoenix: You got me. Maybe it's got something to do with it being their national bird. *BANG* Phoenix: Aaahh! (Was that a gunshot?!) ???: Har har har har har! Startle ya, PW? Phoenix: Wh-What was that, Datz?! Datz: The Defiant Dragons' newest weapon. I call these puppies... Dragon Snot Snaps! Phoenix: Uh, huh... And you need those... why? Datz: Because our hard work is starting to pay off! Thanks to our TV signal hijacking and stuff, more and more people are joining our cause. But on account o' that, the regime's been cracking down on us real tough-like. Phoenix: Yeah, there's been a lot going on lately. Datz: You can say that again. I mean, what with the high priest's fake-murder-slash-suicide. People are calling it the \"DCA Tragedy,\" and it's causing a real public uproar. Phoenix: (Hopefully this means Tahrust's death won't be in vain after all.) ...So how exactly is a handful of firecrackers going to be of help to you guys anyway? Datz: Simple. First, I supply 'em to our fellow rebels. Then we use 'em as a diversion when we need to shake Ga'ran's goons. Phoenix: Huh? Datz: Like this! *BANG!* Phoenix: Whoa! W-Will you cut that out?! I'm not with the regime, and I'm not chasing you! Datz: Har har har har har har! Haaaar har har har har! Your reaction! That was priceless, PW! Warbaa'd: RAWWWRRR! Datz: Har har har har har har! Guess I startled that warbaa'd, too! Phoenix: (It's a miracle no one's trying to arrest him while he's too busy laughing.) ???: You there. Datz: ! Rayfa: You are one of those insurgents, are you not? Datz: Yikes! ...Take that! *BANG!* Rayfa: Eek! Phoenix: Aaand he's gone. Those firecrackers are more useful than I thought. Rayfa: Barbed Head! Phoenix: Your Benevolence. What can I do for you? Rayfa: I... I wanted to speak with you. .........About what my mother said... I do not believe a word of it. My father could not have been planning a coup. Phoenix: Well, I can understand why you'd feel like that, but... Rayfa: It was a setup! Someone must have been plotting against him. Phoenix: Um, and how do you know that? Rayfa: I just do. Because the Holy Mother guides me. And as the royal priestess, I must uncover the truth for all to see. Phoenix: (Hmm... Maybe this is just how Rayfa expresses her sense of duty.) Rayfa: You're investigating this matter, are you not? Then rejoice, for I shall accompany you, and bestow upon you the royal priestess's wisdom. Phoenix: Ha, a-ha ha. That's the best news I've heard all day, Your Benevolence. (No one would dare get in our way with Rayfa by our side.) We humbly accept your offer, don't we, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: As you wish, Wright. Rayfa: Excellent. Then let us begin with my father's private quarters. We should be able to find some clues there. I shall expose this false charge for what it is, if it is the last thing I do! Phoenix: (Could it be? Is the reason she's so defensive about Inga because she's a daddy's girl?) Rayfa: Barbed Head! Let us not waste any time! My father's private quarters are located within the royal residence. Now, follow me! Phoenix: Wait! She's sure in a hurry. Edgeworth: Wright, the minister's private quarters may hold evidence related to his murder as well. Phoenix: Yeah, maybe we can kill two birds with one stone. (Rayfa's awfully fired up. I just hope she'll be ready for the truth we find. After all, it's hard to believe that Inga was not in full control of the whole affair.) Examine Any point of interest Edgeworth: I never thought the day would come when we'd be investigating a case side by side. Phoenix: Oh? 'Cause I never thought the day would come when you'd get sentimental on me. Edgeworth: Nghrk! Come on, Wright! Time's a wasting! Phoenix: Wait, exactly which one of us was wasting time here? May 18Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence Phoenix: Now, if we could figure out which of these buildings houses Inga's private quarters... That's where we'll find Rayfa. Examine Inga's residence Phoenix: Now that's what I call an extravagant exterior. Is this where Inga's private quarters are? Edgeworth: Watch your step, Wright. That urn's been knocked over, spilling water everywhere. Phoenix: Yeah, the ground's soaked. I wonder who did this? ???: .........*sob* Phoenix: Hm? ...I think someone's in there. ???: *sob* Father... *sniffle* Phoenix: Is that... Princess Rayfa? Rayfa: There were still so many things I wished to tell you... Phoenix: (...She always puts on such a brave face. But hearing her crying all alone... I... I can't help but think of Trucy.) Rayfa: *sob* Father... ............... Phoenix: ...Um, Princess Rayfa? Are you in there? Rayfa: Ah! J-Just a moment! I'll be right out! .........I see you are finally here. Well, let us commence our investigation, shall we? Phoenix: ...Um, Your Benevolence? Maybe you should rest for a minute first. Rayfa: ...! You were eavesdropping on me! Weren't you?! Phoenix: Um, no! I mean, yes... Sorry. I couldn't help overhearing... Rayfa: .........Grrrr. Phoenix: I-It wasn't like I was spying on you or anything! Rayfa: ...You stupid... stupid... Barbed Head! *ka-tonk!* Phoenix: Yeowch! Edgeworth: ...You could've feigned ignorance. It's as if your brain-to-mouth filter shuts off the moment you step out of the courtroom. Phoenix: Ugh... I'm not THAT bad, Edgeworth. Rayfa: ...Anyway, what took you so long? I thought you would never get here. You have a lot of nerve, keeping the crown princess waiting. Phoenix: Oh, um... sorry? Rayfa: This was my father's residence. I have already unlocked it, so you can go right in. Oh, and... Be careful. Some dingbat dog in the courtyard and spilled water over there. Phoenix: A dingbat dog? Rayfa: That's right. The yappy mutt spilled a whole urn's worth. Phoenix: I wonder how it got into this area. Do you know what it looked like? Rayfa: Hmph. I have better things to do than to memorize what some stray dog looks like. Anyway, it is not worth talking about. Let's search my father's room, shall we? Phoenix: (...I really hope she's all right.) Inga's residence (subsequent times) Edgeworth: The Minister of Justice used to live here. Phoenix: Yeah, the decor looks like something he'd choose. After examining Inga's residence in Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence: May 18Ga'ran Palace - Inga's Private Quarters Phoenix: (What a mess. You can definitely tell a guy used to live in this room. I guess Inga and I had at least that much in common.) Rayfa: ...Bah, this staff keeps getting in the way. Nayna! .................. ...Oh. Phoenix: (Huh? Where's Nayna? Normally... ...she comes running whenever Rayfa calls.) Rayfa: ...That's right. Nayna is... Phoenix: (Nayna is... what?) Rayfa: Oh, well. You, Barbed Head! Come, hold this staff for me. Phoenix: Wh-Why me? Rayfa: Just take it! It's too heavy, and I am tired of holding it! Phoenix: (*sigh* How does Nayna put up with this day in and day out?) Um... I'll just set it over here for now. Examine Shoeprints Phoenix: There are some muddy shoeprints here. (Come to think of it... There was some spilled water by the entrance. Somebody must've stepped in it before coming in here.) Edgeworth: They're already dry. That means they're at least several hours old. Rayfa: Then someone must have been in here today in the early afternoon... ...for our servants clean this room each day. Here in Khura'in we have a saying: \"Leave not today's untidiness to the morrow.\" Phoenix: (Mine is: \"Why clean up today what you can leave for tomorrow?\") Hair dye bottle Phoenix: What's this? ...\"Je suis L'Belle!\"? Never thought I'd see THIS brand again... Edgeworth: It appears to be a sample of some sort of spray-on hair color. Phoenix: \"Color: Jet Black\"... I wonder if Inga was going grey. Here, Edgeworth. Maybe you can use it. Edgeworth: I like my natural hair color just fine, thank you very much! Desk Phoenix: His desk is crammed full of documents! Edgeworth: Hmm... They appear to be paperwork for executions. Phoenix: B-But for this many cases?! Edgeworth: Indeed. Something is rotten in the Kingdom of Khura'in. Hm? This one dates back to five years ago. Phoenix: Something tells me he simply kept putting them off because he hated doing paperwork. Bed Phoenix: That's one luxurious and comfy-looking bed. I've slept on nothing but hard floors since coming to Khura'in. Can't wait to sleep in a nice, soft bed again. Rayfa: Then take it. It's yours, if you wish. ......We'll have to clean this room out, anyway, now that my father's gone. Phoenix: But don't you want to keep these things as a memento of your father? Besides... I don't need his spirit haunting me late at night. Rayfa: .........Do you suppose if I slept on it, I could see my father once more? Phoenix: P-Princess Rayfa... (I honestly don't know how to answer that...) Bust Phoenix: Wow... That's one gaudy sculpture. Rayfa: My father sculpted it himself from a block of solid gold. Phoenix: (Why does it not surprise me that he was also a narcissist?) Ha ha ha. It's pretty detailed. He even included that personal stamp of his. Hey, the stamp's a little loose. Ah! Edgeworth: Look. There's a secret safe inside! Rayfa: Oh, my! To think such a thing was here all this time! Phoenix: Rats. Looks like we'll need the combination to get in. Bust (subsequent times) Edgeworth: To have a secret safe in his own bedroom... It seems the minister was a rather cagey man. Phoenix: Let's take a look inside. Who knows what we might find. Safe (after examining bust) Phoenix: We can't open this without the combination, but I doubt Princess Rayfa would know it... Edgeworth: Well, if we can't open it, we can't open it. For now, let's continue our investigation, and come back to this dilemma later. Syringe Phoenix: It's a syringe and a vial... Rayfa: Those were for my father's back pain. He said it really helped when the pain was particularly unbearable. Phoenix: It was that bad, huh. Edgeworth: He must've been injecting some sort of painkiller directly into his back, then. Rayfa: Yes, my father said his back pain could knock him off his feet. Phoenix: I know the feeling. I've experienced some pretty severe back pain of my own... Rayfa: Well, we can't have you throwing your back out in court, so why don't you take a vial? Phoenix: Oh, uh, no thanks. I hear your body builds up a tolerance to that sort of thing. Painkiller Shots ninja'd into pocket. Rayfa: I thought you didn't want them. Phoenix: (I'm going straight to a chiropractor as soon as I get home.) Syringe (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's a syringe and a vial... Rayfa: Those were for my father's back pain. He said it really helped when the pain was particularly unbearable. Phoenix: It was that bad, huh. Edgeworth: He must've been injecting some sort of painkiller directly into his back, then. Rayfa: Yes, my father said his back pain could knock him off his feet. Phoenix: I know the feeling. I've experienced some pretty severe back pain of my own... Backrest of chair Phoenix: This chair looks like it was modeled after Inga's suit jacket. Edgeworth: Hmm... The backrest even has those fancy buttons of his. I imagine they make the chair awfully uncomfortable to sit on. Rayfa: Actually, they served to massage the pressure points on his back. My father suffered from terrible back pain, you see. Phoenix: ...I wonder if it really works. Notepad Phoenix: This notepad must've belonged to Inga. Let's see... That's strange. Edgeworth: These appear to be notes detailing people's most prominent characteristics. Phoenix: Hey, there's even some stuff about me in here. Why would he bother doing this? Rayfa: Hmm... I am afraid even I can't answer that. Phoenix: (Whatever the reason, it's giving me a case of the heebie-jeebies.) Edgeworth: Hmm... It's as though he was taking down descriptions of people over the phone... That's what it reminds me of, anyway. Rayfa: What a brilliant deduction! One fitting of a chief prosecutor such as yourself. I commend you. Edgeworth: ...Heh, that's high praise coming from you, Your Benevolence. Phoenix: (Edgeworth's right. They do look like dictation notes, but... I don't know... I mean, why bother describing Nayna, who he must've seen every day?) Inga's Notepad added to the Court Record. Notepad (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's the notepad with those descriptions of various people in it. I wonder what Inga was using it for. Move Rayfa: Barbed Head. First you make me wait, and now you're simply going to leave?! Phoenix: (Guess I should stay put for a while.) Talk The kidnapping Rayfa: Barbed Head... I, the Royal Priestess of Khura'in, shall share my thoughts on the abduction. Phoenix: You will? Rayfa: ......Listen carefully, for such opportunities do not come often. Phoenix: Y-Yes, of course. We'd be grateful to hear anything you'd like to share. Rayfa: ...My father was very likely seeking to obtain the Founder's Orb. But it was not for the purposes of a coup d'état. It was all... for my sake! Phoenix: For your sake? Rayfa: The Founder's Orb is capable of bestowing great spiritual power. My father truly believed that. And he wanted that power to be mine. I haven't finished my training, and I still can't channel spirits! He was doing it for me! Phoenix: ......Right, I see. Rayfa: Well? Do you understand why he did it now? Phoenix: ............I do, but... ...it doesn't change the fact that Minister Inga was a kidnapper. Rayfa: Ah! Phoenix: But I guess you don't believe he is, do you? Rayfa: Ooooooh! New information is sure to surface upon further investigation. S-Suffice to say, he did this all for me. End of story! Phoenix: (Was he really trying to obtain the orb for Rayfa? Somehow, I doubt it. Speaking of powers... ...I wonder if Rayfa will be performing the Divination Séance tomorrow. I should probably ask her about that. Nayna Phoenix: Your Benevolence, I noticed Nayna isn't with you today. Rayfa: .........I know not where she has gone. I have not spoken with her since this morning. I assume she must be quite busy today. I did catch a glimpse of her a little after two o'clock. I tried calling out to her... ...but she went off somewhere again. Phoenix: A little after two? That's about an hour before the murder. Rayfa: ...Indeed. Of all the times for this to happen... She normally comes to me the moment I call her name. Phoenix: (I know it's hard to believe, but even nannies have lives, you know...) Edgeworth: Your inability to find her after the murder is slightly alarming. I wonder if her absence is related to today's incidents somehow. Rayfa: Do you think she was unwittingly caught up in them? Phoenix: Who knows... At the very least I don't think she was at the scene of the crime. Rayfa: Nayna... I hope she is all right. Phoenix: (Rayfa seems really worried for Nayna.) Tomorrow's Séance (appears after \"The kidnapping\") Phoenix: I take it you'll be conducting tomorrow's Divination Séance? Rayfa: Who else, if not I? Phoenix: Good point. (The thing is... ...Divination Séances are all about what victims experienced in their final moments. So, tomorrow... ...Rayfa will experience her own father's death, exactly as it happened. That's more than anyone should ever have to deal with.) ...Do you really have to go through with the Séance tomorrow? There's really no one else? What about just calling the whole thing off? Rayfa: ............It's not as if... ...It's not as if I'm doing this because I want to. Phoenix: No? Rayfa: Ah! N-Never mind. I misspoke! The Divination Séance is a very important duty of the royal priestess. And it is one I intend to fulfill. Phoenix: (There's that word: duty.) Maya: ...Your Benevolence. As crown princess, you are destined to rule this kingdom one day. That means there will be many things that you alone must determine. Things like how to keep your people happy, and what is true and what is false... And most importantly, what role you must play therein. Rayfa: .................. I wonder if I am even up to the task. Phoenix: (Performing the Divination Séance IS very important for a priestess... ...but duty or not, it's a heavy burden for someone so young. Even worse, she'll be forced to watch her father's murder. Will it be a weight too heavy for her to bear?) Nayna and Rayfa (appears after \"Nayna\") Phoenix: Your Benevolence, has Nayna served you long? Rayfa: Yes, she has been at my beck and call for as long as I can remember. I have heard she even cared for me as an infant, right down to changing my diapers. Phoenix: Your diapers? It almost sounds like she could be your mother. Rayfa: Indeed. But that is a simple fact of life when your mother is busy being queen. Nayna takes care of my every need. She is my teacher in all things, as well. Phoenix: (Rayfa's pool of knowledge seems rather lopsided in some respects. Could that be the result of Nayna's teachings?) Rayfa: Nayna... Could it be that my trusted attendant has come to dislike me? Now that I think about it, perhaps I've been acting rather spoiled as of late. Phoenix: Oh, I'm sure she'll be back. Rayfa: ...Yes, I suppose Nayna would never truly abandon me. Upon her return, I will do something nice for her. Perhaps she'd like a shoulder massage. Phoenix: (And yet, I can't shake the feeling that Nayna's connected to this case in some way.) Present Attorney's Badge Rayfa: Remove that vile badge from my sight! If you insist on tormenting me, I will take matters into my own hands! Phoenix: Hey, don't bite it! Rayfa: ............ Hmm, it's much harder than I thought. Phoenix: ...What did you think it's made of? Tomb Crime Photo Rayfa: ...! ............ Phoenix: Um, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: .........Father. Phoenix: Whoops, s-sorry! Didn't mean to hurt you like that. Rayfa: Hmph! Do not underestimate me! I am the royal priestess, and as such I will experience my father's death tomorrow. So hand it over! A photo of a corpse... will not... phase... Phoenix: Your Benevolence! Edgeworth: Wright, you fool! Put that picture away! Rayfa: ...Nngh. There is no need to worry. I simply lost my footing, that's all. Phoenix: (Now I'm REALLY worried about tomorrow.) Painkiller Shots Rayfa: My father's back used to cause him considerable pain. I would give him massages from time to time. He seemed to truly enjoy them. Phoenix: Hmm, I didn't peg you as the dutiful daughter type. Rayfa: But never again... will I... Phoenix: Your Benevolence... Um... I could stand in for your father if you'd like-- Rayfa: ............Rrgh! *WHAM* Phoenix: Youch! M-My back! I think you broke something! Rayfa: Hmph. That's what I call the royal treatment. Inga's Notepad Rayfa: These are notes my father took on the characteristics of those around him. I wonder what he wrote about me. Phoenix: Let's see... Pink raiment... Tattoos on face... Ch-Childishly cute?! Rayfa: Huh?! Phoenix: That last one's rather subjective, isn't it... Anything else Phoenix: Your Benevolence, I wanted to ask you about this. Rayfa: Nayna! Nayna! Where are you?! Phoenix: Um, I thought you said she wasn't around... Rayfa: ...Oh, yes, of course......... Well, you're sadly mistaken if you think questioning Nayna will clear things up. Phoenix: (But I'm trying to question you, not Nayna.) After clearing all Talk options and examining shoeprints, hair dye bottle, bust, syringe, and notepad: Phoenix: I'm really beginning to wonder what's inside that safe. Any idea what the combination might be, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: None whatsoever. Phoenix: (It looks like a four-digit combo lock, so maybe it's a date. But it's probably not anything that would be easy to guess.) Well, let's try some dates and see what happens. I wonder what date Inga would use as a combination? Date the DC Act was enacted Phoenix: How about the date the Defense Culpability Act was enacted? Do you know when that was, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: Nayna! Nayna! Edgeworth: Your Benevolence... *whisper, whisper*... Rayfa: Yes, of course... I believe the date would be: June 14! Phoenix: (Really, Edgeworth? Is whispering in the ears of elites the secret to your success?) All right, let's give 0-6-1-4 a try. Nope, that's not it. Time to try something else. Leads back to: \"I wonder what date Inga would use as a combination?\" Parents' anniversary Phoenix: How about your parents' anniversary? Rayfa: Hmm... I have not the faintest idea of when it is. Phoenix: Yeah, I guess you wouldn't, huh. Edgeworth: ...It's December 11. Phoenix: H-How in the world do you know THAT fact, Edgeworth?! Edgeworth: Hmph, I don't. I simply deduced it using elementary school-level logic. Though I doubt you'd grasp how I arrived at my conclusion, so I'll save my breath. Phoenix: (There's no way you didn't use some kind of superpower to come up with that...) Anyway, here goes... 1-2-1-1. ...No good. It won't open. Let's try another number, shall we? Leads back to: \"I wonder what date Inga would use as a combination?\" Rayfa's birthday Leads to: \"When's your birthday, Your Benevolence?\" Phoenix: When's your birthday, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: Hmph, you are wasting your time. It could not possibly be my birthday. Phoenix: Aw, come on. It's worth a shot. Rayfa: ...Fine. It's December 24. Phoenix: Christmas Eve? Well, let's give it a try. 1-2-2-4... Ahhh! ...I-It... It opened! Rayfa: It did?! Phoenix: Yep. And it looks like the bottom safe was a fake. Edgeworth: Something meant to mislead would-be thieves, no doubt. Still, it was rendered quite ineffective by his use of such an easily-guessed combination. Rayfa: Wh-Why, Father...? Why my birthdate...? Examine Open safe Phoenix: Okay, let's see what's in here. Hm? This looks like a letter or something. Let's see... \"Dear Father... I wanted to wish you a happy birthday. You're always so kind, and I love you very much. I hope you live to be a hundred years old! Love, Rayfa.\" ............... Rayfa: I-I wrote this to my father when I was eight years old. F-Father... Why would you hold on to... something so childish and stupid...? Phoenix: .........There are some other papers in here. Hmm... Ah! This... This is the plan for his coup d'état! Rayfa: Wh-What?! Give me that! .........I... I don't understand. Edgeworth: It seems Justice Minister Inga was plotting the assassination of the queen. Rayfa: This... This can't be true. Father would never harm Mother. Phoenix: (Poor Rayfa. This has to come as a terrible shock.) ...What's this? There's a photo in here, too. Hmm... It's of a woman and a baby. I wonder who they are. ...On the far left, there's a law book with the mark of the Defiant Dragons branded on it. Rayfa: .........Wait! Th-Th-That's...! Phoenix: Your Benevolence? Rayfa: ...How... How can this be? *thud* Phoenix: P-Princess Rayfa! Rayfa: ............... Phoenix: (She's looking incredibly pale.) Your Benevolence. Are you all right? Rayfa: .........All right? How can I be all right? Phoenix: Huh? Rayfa: .........All that I have believed... It was all lies. Phoenix: I'm afraid I don't follow. (What the heck's she talking about?) Um... Can I ask who the woman is in this picture? Rayfa: ...H-How should I know?! .........It seems I didn't know ANYTHING that was going on! Phoenix: (...Doesn't look like I'm going to get much more out of her while she's like this.) Woman's Photo added to the Court Record. Rayfa: .........Mother. Phoenix: Huh? Rayfa: I must ask my mother... about the secret she is hiding. Phoenix: Um, what secret...? Rayfa: ...I must go. Goodbye. Phoenix: Wait! ...What was that all about? It's like her mind was off somewhere else. Edgeworth: It appears this photo really upset her. Phoenix: (I wonder who the lady in this picture is.) ???: Stop! Shah'do! Come back here! ???: Ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff! Phoenix: Wait, that sounds like... Ahlbi and Shah'do. Edgeworth: That's odd. Commoners aren't normally allowed in this area. I wonder what's afoot. Any point of interest (after examining open safe) Phoenix: I better not touch anything without Rayfa's permission. Who knows what she might say... or do if she finds out. After examining open safe in Ga'ran Palace - Inga's Private Quarters: May 18Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence Shah'do: Ruff ruff ruff! Edgeworth: Nghoooooooooh! Phoenix: Ahhh! Edgewooooorth! Edgeworth: .........I hope one of you has a good explanation for this. Ahlbi: Ahhhhhh! I'm SO sorry! Phoenix: Hi, Ahlbi... Ahlbi: No, Shah'do! Bad dog! Leave the man's frilly thingamajig alone! Shah'do: Grrrrrrrrr... Edgeworth: If you would kindly detach your dog from my cravat. Ahlbi: R-Right away, sir! Just hold still, and... Edgeworth: And...? Shah'do: Grrrrrr... Ahlbi: Hrrrrrgh! Hrrrrrrrrrrrgh! Edgeworth: Nghoooh! Stop pulling like that! You'll only stretch the fabric! Ahlbi: Come on, Shah'do...! Let go of his... carava-chamacallit! Shah'do: Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! Ahlbi: Hmm... This isn't working. I'll just have to pull harder, then... One, two... Edgeworth: Wait! What are you--?! Ahlbi: THREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! RRRRRRRNNNNNNNNGH! .........Come OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON! Edgeworth: NNNNGHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH! AAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! I NEED AAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRRRRR! *huff... huff... huff...* Were you trying to kill me?! Ahlbi: I'm really sorry, mister. My dog has a habit of attacking frilly things like that. Phoenix: (Maybe for his sake, he should stick to more traditional targets, like cars, or his tail...) Ahlbi: What's worse, he snuck in here again today and stole some weird-looking hat. I don't know what to do anymore. Bad dog! You're a very bad dog! Shah'da: *whine* Phoenix: (Wait a second... I've seen that hat before.) Examine Urns (after clearing \"Ahlbi in the courtyard\" Talk option) Leads to: \"Ahlbi, you wouldn't happen to know how this urn got knocked over, would you?\" Talk The frilly hat Phoenix: Ahlbi, could I see that hat again? Ahlbi: Sure! Phoenix: (Wait... Isn't this... Isn't this Nayna's hat? But I thought she'd disappeared.) Ahlbi: Shah'do swiped it from someone. Phoenix: Um, Ahlbi? How exactly did Shah'do get this? Ahlbi: Allow me to explain! It all started while we were on a walk through the bazaar today. When, suddenly, Datz popped out of a manhole! Datz: Hah! Ahlbi: Whoa! Datz: The fangs of the Defiant Dragons... ...Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaah... ...Datz Are'bal is here! .........Say, you wanna join our cause, kid? Ahlbi: (Misattributed to Datz Are'bal in the original release) Huh? Ahlbi: Naturally, I was super startled by that weirdo's sudden appearance. Warbaa'd: RAWWWWWWRRRRRR! Shah'do: Ruff ruff! Datz: Back! Dog of the Ga'ran regime! Ahlbi: (Misattributed to Datz Are'bal in the original release) Huh? But this is my dog, Shah'do... Datz: Defiant Dragon secret weapon: Dragon Snot Snaps! ACHOOOO! *BANG* Ahlbi: WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOA! Oof! Datz: Har har har har har! Aw man, the look on your face! That was classic! Ahlbi: The sudden bang of the firecracker spooked Shah'do, and he ran off into the crowds. Shah'do: Ruff ruff ruff ruff! Ahlbi: Ahhhhhh! Shah'do, come back here! Datz: Har har har har har! That'll teach ya, Ga'ran's lapdog! Policeman: You there! What do you think you're doing?! Datz: ...Ack! Not good! Ahlbi: That's when a policeman came running over and hauled Datz away. That happened right around 2 PM, if I remember correctly. Phoenix: (...I'm not even going to pretend I know what Datz was trying to do.) Ahlbi: I chased right after Shah'do, and... ...when I finally caught up to him here in the palace courtyard, he had this in his mouth. Edgeworth: 2 PM, hmm? That's about an hour before the minister's death. Phoenix: Nayna supposedly went missing after the murder... ...but this would place her here at the palace at around two. (Changed from [...but this would place her here at the palace at around 2.] in the original release) Ahlbi's Statement added to the Court Record. Ahlbi: Actually! I just remembered I saw something pretty amazing around that time, too! Phoenix: Something amazing? The frilly hat (subsequent times) Phoenix: Ahlbi, could I see that hat again? Ahlbi: Sure! Phoenix: (Wait... Isn't this... Isn't this Nayna's hat? But I thought she'd disappeared.) Ahlbi: Shah'do swiped it from someone. Phoenix: Um, Ahlbi? How exactly did Shah'do get this? Ahlbi: Allow me to explain! It all started while we were on a walk through the bazaar today. When, suddenly, Datz popped out of a manhole! Datz: Hah! Ahlbi: Whoa!

Datz: Back! Dog of the Ga'ran regime! Ahlbi: (Misattributed to Datz Are'bal in the original release) Huh? But this is my dog, Shah'do... Datz: Defiant Dragon secret weapon: Dragon Snot Snaps! ACHOOOO! *BANG* Ahlbi: WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOA! Oof! Datz: Har har har har har! Aw man, the look on your face! That was classic!

(Changed from [...but this would place her here at the palace at around 2.] in the original release) Ahlbi: Actually! I just remembered I saw something pretty amazing around that time, too! Phoenix: Something amazing? Something amazing (appears after \"The frilly hat\") Phoenix: So, Ahlbi, what was it you saw that was so amazing? Ahlbi: I saw Her Eminence Queen Ga'ran channeling a spirit! Phoenix: Is it really that big of a deal to see her channeling someone? Ahlbi: You bet it is! Commoners are never allowed to behold the sacred rite. Phoenix: Oh? Can you tell me more? Ahlbi: Of course! I'm always happy to explain! Um... I believe it was around 2:10 PM today. I got lost on the palace grounds while looking for Shah'do. Ahlbi: Ooh... What is this place? It gives me the creeps. Where could Shah'do have gone? Ahlbi: In my search, I took a peek into a small room and... ...that's when I saw Queen Ga'ran! She was channeling a spirit for a neighboring kingdom's king! I saw her transform right before my eyes! I was so excited, I had to take a picture of it! Phoenix: You... You took a picture? Ahlbi: I know I shouldn't have... ...but I just couldn't help myself! Phoenix: (Between this and the treasure room, Ahlbi's not exactly the picture of self-restraint...) Ahlbi: Her channeling rite ended right after that, so I ran off before anyone could spot me. Phoenix: You could've been arrested again, you know. Ahlbi: ...Yeah, I know... ........................ Anyway, here's a copy of the picture. Just don't tell anyone I was the one who took it. Phoenix: (...I worry about his future sometimes.) Channeling Photo added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Come to think of it... ...how did you and Shah'do get into the royal residence anyway? It's not open to commoners, after all. Ahlbi: Allow me to explain! Something amazing (subsequent times) Phoenix: So, Ahlbi, what was it you saw that was so amazing? Ahlbi: I saw Her Eminence Queen Ga'ran channeling a spirit! Phoenix: Is it really that big of a deal to see her channeling someone? Ahlbi: You bet it is!

Phoenix: (...I worry about his future sometimes.) Come to think of it... ...how did you and Shah'do get into the royal residence anyway? It's not open to commoners, after all. Ahlbi: Allow me to explain! Ahlbi in the courtyard (appears after \"Something amazing\") Ahlbi: There's a way to get into the palace from the bazaar. It's a bit of a tight squeeze, though. Shah'do can easily fit, but anyone bigger than me is out of luck. Phoenix: You don't say... Ahlbi: Yeah, part of the palace wall is damaged, and there's a hole I can just make it through. Phoenix: Go on. Ahlbi: Heh heh heh. Betcha didn't know they have some really tasty food here! Phoenix: Oh? Then this isn't your first time in here, huh. ...Trespassing is illegal, you know. Ahlbi: N-No, it's not like that! I didn't mean any harm. It's just... I want to help change this kingdom. Phoenix: What do you mean? Ahlbi: Well, after Ms. Fey's trial, I started thinking. Like maybe... Maybe there was something I could do to help the revolution, too. Phoenix: (...Maya's trial, huh. That tragedy only happened because of how twisted Khura'in's legal system has become.) Nahyuta: How utterly foolish to cast away one's life for such a reason! There must have been other ways to cover up the crime! Tahrust: Yet, had I done so, my wife would rush to my defense. And when the case went to trial... ...she would suffer the same fate as I under the Defense Culpability Act. I could not have lived with myself had she been convicted because of that fiendish man! Rayfa: Th-This... This cannot be... All I have done under the laws of our kingdom... It has all been... Phoenix: (The DC Act led to the false charges against Maya and the high priest's suicide. But that trial also caused the public to start questioning the current state of things. And it seems even Ahlbi has some pretty strong feelings on the matter.) Ahlbi: I knew there had to be something I could do to help! That's when I remembered the hole in the palace wall, and started thinking... ...maybe I could sneak in and take a picture of one of the royals up to no good. I just want to do my part! Edgeworth: The spirit of revolution seems to be catching on, even with one so young. Wright, the momentum is steadily building, and the tipping point is fast approaching. It's just a matter of when. Phoenix: I agree. And the public's perception of the Defiant Dragons seems to be changing, too. But Ahlbi... You can't go trespassing like that. Even if it's for a good cause, it's not right. Ahlbi: Okay. I won't do it again. Phoenix: Ahlbi, is that really all you have to confess? You haven't been up to any other mischief? And when I say \"you,\" I mean Shah'do. Ahlbi: Huh?! Oh, um... I-I... I don't know what you're talking about. Aheh... heh heh heh... Phoenix: (Nice try, Ahlbi, but the proof is literally right in front of us.) Present Attorney's Badge Ahlbi: Oh, that's an attorney's badge from your homeland, right?! I've studied all about it. Allow me to explain! There's a reason why the badge is shaped like a sunflower. You know how sunflowers always turn to face the sun -- the source of their well-being? Well, lawyers are like that -- they will chase after anything that will make them money! Phoenix: Whaaat?! Ahlbi: ...I guess people hate lawyers in your country, too, huh. Phoenix: Umm... Where did you get your information from again? Ahlbi: A proud sermon Chief Prosecutor Payne gave in the middle of the bazaar the other day. Phoenix: Nngh... Lawyers already have a bad enough time here without his lies. Channeling Photo Ahlbi: I know I shouldn't have taken that picture... But it was the first time I'd ever seen a spirit medium at work! I couldn't help myself. Phoenix: (At least he knows what he did was wrong.) Ahlbi: .........100-- no, 400 dahmas per copy sounds about right. Phoenix: Ahlbi... You're not planning to sell this photo to tourists, are you? Ahlbi: ...! Ah-ha ha ha! Come on, Mr. Wright, You don't really think I'd do that, do you? Phoenix: (Now I REALLY fear for his future.) Anything else Phoenix: What do you know about this, Ahlbi? Ahlbi: .........S-Sorry. I don't know anything about that. I'm the worst tour guide ever. Phoenix: N-No, no, it's my fault for randomly whipping it out and asking you about it. Ahlbi: Don't worry. I'll study hard, so I'll be ready to answer all your questions next time! Phoenix: (Argh, now I feel like a jerk.) Phoenix: Ahlbi, you wouldn't happen to know how this urn got knocked over, would you? Ahlbi: Ah! Phoenix: Because Her Benevolence told me something rather interesting. Rayfa: Be careful. Some dingbat dog got in the courtyard and spilled water over there. Phoenix: A dingbat dog? Rayfa: That's right. The yappy mutt spilled a whole urn's worth. Phoenix: The \"dingbat dog\" she mentioned wouldn't happen to be Shah'do, would it? Ahlbi: ...Ooh...! ......... I guess the dog's out of the bag. Sorry I lied. But I was worried I'd get in trouble. I know I shouldn't lie to a lawyer like that. Phoenix: No, it's not good to lie to anyone like that. So let's try to only tell the truth. Okay, Ahlbi? Ahlbi: Oh, Mr. Wright! I almost forgot. I saw a couple of Americans a moment ago. They had really weird haircuts, so I thought they might be friends of yours. Phoenix: ...R-Really, now... Um... Edgeworth: It seems your little friend thinks all us Americans have strange hairstyles. I suppose we have you to thank for that, Wright? Phoenix: ......... So, what exactly did their hair look like? Ahlbi: There was a guy with two crops of hair sticking out of his forehead like antennae. Then there was this lady with a long bunch of hair that looked like a big, orange spider leg. Phoenix: Oh, that sounds like Apollo and Athena. What were they doing? Ahlbi: They were racing through the bazaar... ... with the Ga'ran Royal Guard in hot pursuit! Phoenix: Wait, whaaaaaat?! Edgeworth: Why were they being pursued...? Phoenix: I'm not sure, but I have my suspicions. I just hope they're all right. Ahlbi: S-Sorry for not mentioning it before. It just kind of slipped my mind, heh heh... To be continued May 18Khura'in - Bazaar Apollo: *huff, puff, huff, puff* Those... Those guys... sure are... persistent! Athena: *huff, puff, huff, puff* Yeah. They even wore ME out, and that doesn't happen often. Apollo: Why are they after us, anyway?! Athena: Ah, Apollo! It's the royal guards again! Apollo: Argh! Q-Quick, hide! Royal Guard: Hey! Where'd Horn Head and Spidey Hair gooooooo?!! Athena: ...Spidey Hair? They're not talking about me, are they? Apollo: I-Is that a trick question...? Royal Guard: We know you're hiding somewhere around heeeeeeeeeeere!!! RAWWWRRR! Athena: A-Apollo, that weird-looking bird over there... Did it just...?! Apollo: ...Yeah, it did. It's called a warbaa'd and... You know what? I'll tell you all about it later when we're not being chased by masked men! Royal Guard: Come out, come out, wherever you aaaaare!!! ...Hand over the Founder's Orb, if you know what's good for yooooouuuuuu!!! Apollo: (It figures they're after the orb.) Athena: I don't want to know what they'll do to us if we were captured. If they grill us in those obnoxious, loud voices... ...I'd cave after the first hour and confess to whatever they wanted, truth or no! Royal Guard: Come out now, you foreign deeeeevils!!! This has gone faaaaaar enough!!! You must not keep Her Eminence waiting any looooooonger!!! RAWWWRRR! Apollo: W-We've gotta get out of here! There must be a safe place to hide somewhere! Examine Manhole cover Leads to: \"Look, a manhole.\" Any other point of interest Apollo: Maybe we could hide here. Athena: No way! They'd find us in no time! Royal Guard: Stay where you aaaare!!! Athena: Th-They're closing in on us! Apollo: We've gotta find a place to hide! Talk Any ideas? Athena: Apollo! We shouldn't be standing around talking like this! Who knows what they'll do to us if they catch us! Apollo: You're right. Let's find somewhere safe to hide! Present Anything Athena: Apollo! Do you really HAVE to show that to me right this second?! Apollo: S-Sorry. It's just... something I do now when I'm stuck... Anyway, your shouting isn't helping, either. Royal Guard: That voice! It's Spidey Hair!!! Athena: Eeeeek! ...Hiii-yaaaaaa!!! Royal Guard: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!! Apollo: (Sh-She sent him flying!) Athena: L-Let's find somewhere else to hide before the other guards get here! Apollo: Look, a manhole. ...Ahhh! That's right! Dhurke: Say, son, do you remember my office? Apollo: ...Sure. (I remember that messy, dimly lit room.) Dhurke: The file I've amassed on Amara's assassination is kept there. I think it might help you on this case. Do you remember how to get there? Apollo: Athena! I know where we can hide! Follow me! Athena: Oh?! Where are we going?! Apollo: Hrrrrrrrnngh! Athena: W-Wait. You're not seriously thinking about going down there? It smells like rotten eggs. And are those rats I hear?! Apollo: We've got no choice! I can get us somewhere safe, but this is the only way in. Quick, before it's too late! Athena: Ugh. It's going to take forever to get this stench out of my hair. May 18Former Sahdmadhi Law Offices Apollo: .........Looks like we lost them. That was close. .................. (Dhurke's office... How long has it been since I last set foot in here?) At least we're safe now, but... (Why is Athena all huddled over in the corner like that?) Datz: Ah! Apollo: Datz? Datz: AJ! What the heck are ya doing here? Apollo: Ga'ran's royal guards are after us. Datz: Har har har! Once a rebel, always a rebel. Don't worry. The regime doesn't know about this place, so ya can relax now. Apollo: Good. But since when am I part of the rebellion? I don't recall signing up. ???: Apollo! Apollo: Mr. Wright? What are you doing here? Phoenix: We saw you two go into that manhole. Edgeworth: You narrowly escaped the guards' notice. Phoenix: It was like watching a pair of ostriches burying their heads in the sand. Apollo: (I guess that was a closer shave than I had thought...) Phoenix: Anyway, you're safe and sound now, and that's what really counts. Oh, I also have some evidence for you. Apollo: Thanks, Mr. Wright. Case evidence received from the boss. Edgeworth: So, what is this dubious hovel we've found ourselves in, anyway? Apollo: It's the Defiant Dragons' safe house... also known as the former Sahdmadhi Law Offices. Edgeworth: I see... Well. Though it might just be happenstance... ...here I am -- a chief prosecutor -- hiding out in a rebel base. Apollo: Um, please don't report this place to the local police, Prosecutor Edgeworth... (Might as well take a look around while we're waiting for the heat to die down out there.) Come on, Athena. Stop moping over there and help me check this place out. Athena: *shudder* Please tell me there's a shower here. Apollo: There's a sink in the kitchen. And if you're lucky, maybe even some soap. Athena: .........I'm sorry I even asked. Examine Picture of Ga'ran Apollo: There's a scary-looking knife sticking out of the queen's picture. If anyone saw this, they'd think the Defiant Dragons were a violent group. Datz: Oh, that? That was actually me trying to kill a fly. I threw that knife at it and whiffed, and the thing ended up stuck right between her eyes. Apollo: You mean this wasn't on purpose?! White flowers Apollo: Datz, what's with the altar? Datz: It's where we pay our respects to the victims of the Defense Culpability Act. The DC Act is a heinous law that puts innocent people to death! Apollo: (A law that's supposed to protect the people sends them to their graves instead... Talk about insane.) Ladder Athena: Wait... Don't tell me we have to go back through the manhole to get out of here... Apollo: The only reason this safe house is still safe is because the front door's been boarded up. Athena: Fine, then I'll just have to live here till the revolution begins! Apollo: ...What if I told you rats come out at night? Athena; Then we'll just have to start the revolution before sundown! Apollo: (I bet the revolution never thought it'd get a new ally this way.) Photos Athena: Hm? Who's the kid... Wait a second! That's YOU, Apollo! I'd recognize those horns anywhere! Apollo: Is that really the only way ANYBODY recognizes me?! Athena: Hee hee hee. You were so cute! ...And who's THAT fine-looking young man? Apollo: That's Nahyuta, back when he used to smile. Athena: ...Wow. His smile is absolutely angelic. Datz: Sure brings back memories! That was taken the day we all went out fishing. Athena: What was Prosecutor Sahdmadhi like when he was younger? Datz: He was kinda quiet, but passionate when it came to his convictions. When he finally made prosecutor, he was all fired up to change Khura'in for the better. But now he's nothing more than Ga'ran's lackey! Apollo: (Seems like Datz has a lot to say about Nahyuta. I'll ask him about his thoughts later. Photos (subsequent times) Apollo: These pictures sure bring back memories. Nahyuta is cheerfully smiling in this one. That quiet smile he gives in court now seems almost fake by comparison. Lizards Athena: Eeewww... Is that a newt? Apollo: Come on, Athena. Can't you tell a gecko when you see one? Athena: What's the difference? Apollo: Geckos like to live in houses, while newts prefer to be outside near water. They're totally different creatures. Athena: Well, how do you know this one wasn't caught outside near some water? It could very well be a gecko. Apollo: No, I'm pretty sure it's a newt. Athena: Oh, so then you agree it's a newt, Apollo? Apollo: Ack! (I fell right into her trap!) Phoenix: You're both wrong. It's just a plain old lizard. TV Apollo: I'm surprised to see so many appliances here. There's even a TV. Datz: Speaking of which, we gave the people of Khura'in quite a shock... ...when \"The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm\" was last on TV. Apollo: You mean that show where actors play the parts of Dhurke and Rayfa? You hijacked that in the middle of its broadcast, right? Datz: Yep. All their writers do each week is try to ruin the Defiant Dragons' good name. So we decided to hit 'em where it hurts! Har har har har har har! Apollo: That must've been real shocking, especially for the kids who'd waited all week to see it. I mean, the show's main villain was actually hijacking the very show he's in! Coat Athena: Dhurke's jacket... You should try it on, Apollo. It might actually suit you. Apollo: R-Really? Datz: There's also a spare eye patch here. Why not try that on, too? Athena: ...Pffft. ...*snicker* Hee hee hee! S-Sorry, sorry. Just picturing you in all that... Ha ha ha ha! It's just too funny! Apollo: (Oww... My pride...) Sign Apollo: Sahdmadhi Law Offices... That's the sign Dhurke used to display out front. Hey, Datz. I heard the office used [sic]do quite a bit of business. Datz: That it did. Dhurke was a famous lawyer with countless courtroom victories, after all. He was the Dauntless Dragon who turned trials upside down... ...snatching victory from the jaws of defeat! His fame as a lawyer spread far and wide across Khura'in back in the day. Apollo: ...I hope the day comes when he can proudly display this sign again. Spider Apollo: What's with all the spider webs, Datz? Don't you ever clean the place? Datz: Not the webs! We have what ya call a symbiotic relationship. They catch the bugs that get in here, and I don't clean 'em up! Apollo: You know... that actually makes a lot of sense. Law book Apollo: This is Dhurke's old law book. Athena: Look, there's a mark on the cover. It looks like it was branded with a hot iron. Apollo: Yeah, I think it was done in protest against the Defense Culpability Act. There's an entry on the DC Act right here. See? Athena: Oh, so this is the infamous anti-lawyer law you guys are always talking about... Dhurke's Law Book added to the Court Record. Law book (subsequent times) Apollo: This is Dhurke's old law book. Athena: Look, there's a mark on the cover. It looks like it was branded with a hot iron. Apollo: Yeah, I think it was done in protest against the Defense Culpability Act. There's an entry on the DC Act right here. See? Athena: Oh, so this is the infamous anti-lawyer law you guys are always talking about... File Athena: I wonder what's in this file. Oh, it's full of newspaper clippings. Apollo: It seems to be a collection of documents and information on Amara's assassination. (So this is what Dhurke was talking about.) Athena: We already know most of the stuff here on top. Let's see what else there is. Wow, where did he get all this? Umm... Anything important here...? Hmm, what about this... \"Apollo's roving musician father got caught up in this incident and lost his life.\" ...Whaaat?! Th-This is about your father, Apollo! Apollo: Looks like it. But I was never told much more than what's written here. Athena: Really? How come? Apollo: Dhurke always skated around the subject. Maybe he thought I was still too young. Plus, I always thought of Dhurke as my dad, so I never really brought it up. Athena: ...Oh, I see. Still... I feel kind of sorry for your real dad. Apollo: (My real dad... I was never really interested in learning about him. But after seeing his picture, I can't help but feel a little curious. I wonder if Datz could tell me anything about him.) Amara's Assassination File added to the Court Record. Athena: ...Apollo, this file looks like it might be useful. But there are so many pages, I can't tell what's important. Apollo: We need someone to help organize all of this. (And I think I know just the person to ask.) File (subsequent times) Apollo: This file has a ton of information on Amara's assassination. We should go over the important parts later. Talk Sahdmadhi Law Offices Apollo: So, Datz, you guys are still using this office, I see. Datz: Yep. 'Cept now it's the official HQ of the Defiant Dragons. But as Dhurke said, and I quote... \"We must keep it for the day when Khura'in needs lawyers once more.\" Phoenix: Restoring the legal system to its rightful form through popular uprising... You can tell how much Dhurke believes in his cause. Datz: Oh, and AJ. Dhurke said something else that might interest ya. He said he hopes you'll come back and take over this office someday. Apollo: T-Take over?! Me? Datz: Those were his words. He may've been half joking though. Datz: Dhurke! Guess what I heard from PW! AJ's become a lawyer! Dhurke: ...Yeah, I've been meaning to tell you. Datz: Must've been because of you, Dhurke! Dhurke: I'm not so sure about that. I imagine he's already forgotten about me. Datz: Whaddaya talking about? I bet he can't wait to follow in your footsteps. Dhurke: Hah, ha ha ha. Nothing would make me happier. Maybe one day he'll return to Khura'in and take over this office. ...Heh. It's just a pipe dream, though. Apollo: .........Dhurke really said that? Datz: Dhurke was never a hands-on kinda dad... ...but not a day went by that he wasn't thinking of ya. That much I'm sure of. Athena: Doesn't get more paternal than that. Apollo: (Dhurke... And to think, I really did spend my days trying to forget you. I'm looking forward to a nice, long talk once you're free.) Nahyuta (appears after examining photos) Apollo: Datz, wasn't Nahyuta once part of the Defiant Dragons? Datz: Yep. Yuty was a rising star in the resistance! He vowed to fight for the cause through the legal system. Said he'd become a prosecutor, and give Inga and Ga'ran the smackdown they deserved! Apollo: But now he's... Datz: Yeah... a puppet of the Ga'ran regime. Not only that, but now he's gonna prosecute his own dad. It doesn't add up! Athena: I wonder what happened to him. Datz: Me, too. But if I had to guess... ...I'd say Ga'ran has some serious leverage over him. Apollo: Leverage? Like what? Datz: Wish I knew. But it seems like Dhurke knows. I tried to press him about it, but he wouldn't say. Apollo: (Come to think of it, Dhurke did say...) Apollo: Nahyuta... is suffering...? Dhurke: Yes. He knows the rightful state of Khura'in's legal system... ...but something forces him to bend to Ga'ran's will, and it's tearing him apart. Apollo: (If that's the case... ...I bet Nahyuta doesn't really want to go through with Dhurke's prosecution.) My father (appears after presenting Photo of My Father) Apollo: Do you know what my biological father was like? Datz: Dhurke once told me about him. He was a modern minstrel, walking the world and making music in his travels. Athena: This file also has some information on your real dad. It says he died in the blaze at Queen Amara's residence twenty-three years ago. Datz: That's right. Dhurke had invited him over. Dhurke's the kinda guy who can become fast friends with just about anyone. And it seems your pops was like that, too, AJ. They hit it off at a bar... ...and the next thing ya know, Dhurke's asked him over to play some tunes. Apollo: And then the place went up in flames... Datz: Yeah. Dhurke had just stepped out for a sec when the fire broke out. .........Apollo. You were there, too, but you were still just a baby. Apollo: ...I remember hearing about that when I was little. Datz: Yeah, it was a crying shame. Your pops just happened to take you along that day. So you were there with him when the fire broke out. But Dhurke risked his life to save you! Apollo: (It's like Dhurke's done nothing but save me all my life...) Datz: All your pops's stuff got burned up. Including anything that could've helped us identify him. All we knew about him at first was his stage name, \"Jangly Justice\" or something like that. Dhurke did everything he could just to dig up what little we know now. Apollo: ...Um, what about my mother? Do you know anything about her? Datz: All we know is she was traveling with your pops. But that day, she was off doing something on her own. Apollo: So then, she probably didn't even know my father had been with Dhurke, huh. Athena: But she must've been desperate to find you and your father once you'd gone missing. Datz: No doubt. But the queen's assassination threw the kingdom into chaos. The police were so overwhelmed, they were probably hardly of any help to her. We searched and searched till our legs gave out, too, but we never found her. And with your father's stuff all burned up, we had zero leads -- not even a photo. Apollo: So that's how I became an orphan... Datz: Yeah... Who knows? Maybe your mom read about the details of the fire in the newspaper. And maybe she figured you'd died along with your pops. Athena: Wow, I had no idea you'd been through all that, Apollo. Present Photo of My Father Apollo: Datz, I wanted to ask you about this picture. Datz: That's the picture of your pops that Dhurke found. And he had a heck of a time tracking it down. He said he searched all over for it! Apollo: Why...? Why would he go through all that trouble? Athena: Datz, please tell us everything you know about Apollo's dad! Dhurke's Law Book Datz: The Mark of the Dragon... That's the symbol of our group, the Defiant Dragons. Apollo: Dhurke has the same mark tattooed on the palm of his hand, right? Datz: Yep. And I've got one, too. Apollo: Really? Where? Datz: On my heart! Apollo: ...Oh, you mean metaphorically. Like you're ready to die at any time for the cause or something like that? Datz: You got that right. Dead or alive, I'll always be a Defiant Dragon! Amara's Assassination File Apollo: Datz, about this file... Can you help me figure out whihc pages are the most relevant? Datz: Yup, sure can. I got the whole thing memorized. See this page? It's definitely worth a look. Athena: Oh, that's right! Prosecutor Sahdmadhi was part of the royal family, wasn't he! Datz: Yep. But he was expelled after that whole thing with Dhurke happened. He must've gone through hell once he entered the legal world though. Apollo: Because of the whole \"the sins of the father are visited upon his children\" thing? Datz: Yep. In the eyes of the people, Dhurke is not only a traitor to his kingdom... ...he's also the terrorist who assassinated the previous queen. So, as his son, Yuty no doubt got the cold shoulder at every turn. Apollo: That must've been really hard on him. Datz: Yeah, the ties between father and son aren't something you could break, even if you tried. No matter where he went, he was probably labeled the son of a criminal. But despite it all, he made a name for himself through blood, sweat, and tears. I mean, just look at him now. He's a star prosecutor working cases around the globe. He's become a hero! The pride and joy of Khura'in! Apollo: (Now that's the Nahyuta I know -- super smart and never willing to give in. He must've studied and fought like his life depended on it to get to where he is today.) Amaras Assassination File updated in the Court Record. Anything else Datz: Ahhhhhh! Apollo: What? Do you know something about this? Datz: Nope. Just felt like shouting is all. Apollo: (He had me going there for a sec...) After clearing all Talk options, examining law book, and presenting Amara's Assassination File: Old Man: So then you believe me? You believe in my son's innocence?! Beh'leeb: Your poor son -- imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit... Let's petition the government for his release and a declaration of innocence! Old Man: Oh, thank you, thank you! I'm forever in your debt! Apollo: Hm? Who's that? Datz: Hey there, Mrs. Inmee. Hard at work, I see. Beh'leeb: Yes, I have my own battle that I must wage. After all, there are many who suffer under the Defense Culpability Act. Rebel: Mrs. Inmee! Please don't forget about our case, too! Beh'leeb: I won't! I will look into it as soon as I am able. Phoenix: Um, Datz? What's Mrs. Inmee doing here? Datz: She's lending an ear to all those suffering under the regime's wrongful accusations. A lady whose husband's been imprisoned, parents whose son's been falsely charged... She's helping all those types of people. Phoenix: So she's trying to help the revolution along... ...in her own special way. Datz: Yep. And thanks to her, more and more folks are coming over to our side! All the people who've been unhappy with the regime have been waiting for just this chance! And they're starting to speak out in support of us! Apollo: (The people are responding... and a grassroots movement is growing... Dhurke's dream of revolution may finally come true.) Athena: What should we do about the Founder's Orb? We'll probably run into the royal guards again the moment we leave this place. Phoenix: Well, we can't stay here forever, so we'll have to think of something. Apollo: ...I've got it. Why don't you hold on to it, Datz? It should be safe here, right? Datz: You can count on me! I'll get it back to you in time for tomorrow's trial at the Hall of Justice. Founder's Orb left with Datz. Athena: What now, Apollo? Apollo: Well, we've got a handle on what happened twenty-three years ago. Maybe we should pay Dhurke a visit. There's something I want to show him. Phoenix: I'll join you. I want to talk to him before tomorrow's trial. Edgeworth: Maybe I should wait here, then. We'll attract undue attention if we go in too large of a group. Bazaar Examine Yak Apollo: It's a yak. They used to serve as a beast of burden here. Athena: They're actually kind of cute up-close. Hello there, big fella! Or are you a girl...? Apollo: Umm, if you stick your face that close to it, it's liable to-- *sluuuuurp* Athena: Eeewwww, gross! .................. Apollo: ...Need some tissues? Athena: I-I could use a handful of wet naps, if you've got 'em... Bird Athena: What's this bird doing here? Apollo: I wouldn't get too close to it if I were you. ???: RAWWWWWWRRRRRR! Athena: Eeeeeeeeek! Apollo: ...Athena, meet the warbaa'd. Its cry resembles a lion's roar to scare off predators. Athena: Wow... that's one gutsy little bird. But I bet it's not really all that tough. Apollo: How about we just leave the bird alone? Cart Apollo: (So many street stalls... And they all have stuff you can't find back home.) Athena: We should spend some time shopping here when this case is over. I'd like to buy Trucy a souvenir or something. Poster Apollo: There's a poster here... \"The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm\"...? Phoenix: It's a special-effects-driven action-here show that's become a huge hit here in Khura'in. Apollo: (Maybe it's a cultural thing, but she totally looks like a villain to me.) Steaming buns Phoenix: Khura'in's national delicacy, magatah'man -- or \"soul buns,\" if that makes it easier. Apparently, they're so delicious, they'll send your soul straight to the Twilight Realm. Apollo: \"Delicious\"? More like \"deadly.\" Phoenix: Actually, in one of the commercials, an old man literally drops dead after taking a bite. And at the very end, there's a warning that goes, \"Enjoy at your own risk.\" Apollo: Like I said: deadly. Manhole cover Apollo: (This is the manhole that leads to Dhurke's office-turned-safe house. It's the only way in or out. And for obvious reasons, there's no doorbell or welcome mat.) Souvenir stands Apollo: (The souvenir stands sure are popular with the tourists. I should check them out later.) Tehm'pul Temple Apollo: Tehm'pul Temple is just up ahead. When I was a kid, I used to race Nahyuta and my friends to the top. Present Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Athena: The victim was the Minister of Justice, the second most powerful person here in Khura'in. In Wright Anything Agency terms... ...I guess that would be you, Apollo. Apollo: Ha ha ha. Thanks, but... ...everyone knows it's Trucy. Athena: ...Yeah, you're probably right. On second thought, she might actually be number one. I mean, even Mr. Wright is no match for her. Apollo: .........Remind me not to forget to buy her a souvenir. Dhurke's Law Book Athena: I can't believe Dhurke's been fighting the good fight for over twenty years. Fighting for the truth and the repeal of the Defense Culpability Act... Apollo: Yeah. And being branded a traitor for it. That's got to be extremely hard on him. Athena: Whatever happens, we can't let them find him guilty! We have to help him achieve his life's dream! Anything else Athena: .........What? Are you just going to show that to me without a word? Apollo: (I guess she doesn't have anything to say about it.) Athena: W-Well?! Are you going to at least say SOMETHING?! Inga's Private Quarters Examine Phoenix: Edgeworth and I already searched this room. Apollo: Oh, okay. (I wonder if anything interesting turned up?) Hair dye bottle Athena: \"Je suis L'Belle! SAMPLE\"... Now THERE'S a brand I know well... Apollo: .........Yeah... Me, too. Athena: Let's see what it says on the back. \"The hair care sensation celebrities have been RAVING about! Guaranteed to make you WANT to proclaim, 'Je suis L'Belle!' to the world! This product is NOT FOR SALE. EVER. Even if you come to really like it, PEASANT.\" Apollo: I REALLY still don't get his sales strategy... Any other point of interest Phoenix: We already investigated that, Apollo. May 18Detention Center - Visitor's Room Dhurke: Hey there, son. Came to see your old man again? Apollo: Hi, Dhurke. Guess they're done questioning you? Dhurke: Yeah... You'd think Nahyuta might've cut his old man a little slack, but no. He really laid into me. Seems they're really keen on recovering the Founder's Orb. When I wouldn't tell them where it was, he confiscated what few possessions I had left. Apollo: (...Wait, Dhurke's not wearing his attorney's badge. They even took THAT from him? *sigh*) Talk Nahyuta Dhurke: He confiscated all my prized jailbreaking tools. Apollo: What did you expect? I mean, no prosecutor in their right mind would let a prisoner keep stuff like that. Athena: Did he take your attorney's badge, too? Dhurke: No. I thought it strange, but... ...just when it looked like he was going to take it from me, he changed his mind. Apollo: I wonder why. Dhurke: Indeed. I find it hard to understand anything he does these days. Your attorney's badge (appears after \"Nahyuta\") Apollo: Your Khura'inese attorney's badge... You've worn it all these years -- even though all the lawyers are gone. Dhurke: Yes, because the Dragon's Eye is the embodiment of my creed. Apollo: (To show the world that \"a dragon never yields,\" huh.) Apollo: Hey, Dhurke? Why do you still wear your badge? You're not a lawyer anymore, right? Dhurke: This badge is my heart and soul, son. I'll never stop trying to realize my dream -- not until my very last breath. Nahyuta: \"A dragon never yields,\" right?! Dhurke: Exactly. ...Nahyuta, Apollo, I vow to restore Khura'in's legal system to its rightful state one day. I want to pass on to you a world where you can live free from the fear of tyranny. Apollo: (He was always saying stuff like that to the two of us. Nahyuta... Is the reason why you didn't take Dhurke's badge... ...because you still remember those talks, too? I really hope that's what it is.) Dhurke: ...Son, would you keep my badge for me? Apollo: Are you sure?! I can't take something so important to you. Dhurke: That's exactly why I want you to hold on to it, Apollo. I'm placing my fate in your hands. Apollo: .........All right. I'll make sure it stays safe. Dhurke's Badge added to the Court Record. Your attorney's badge (subsequent times) Apollo: Your Khura'inese attorney's badge... You've worn it all these years -- even though all the lawyers are gone. Dhurke: Yes, because the Dragon's Eye is the embodiment of my creed. Apollo: (To show the world that \"a dragon never yields,\" huh.) Apollo: Hey, Dhurke? Why do you still wear your badge? You're not a lawyer anymore, right? Dhurke: This badge is my heart and soul, son. I'll never stop trying to realize my dream -- not until my very last breath. Nahyuta: \"A dragon never yields,\" right?! Dhurke: Exactly. ...Nahyuta, Apollo, I vow to restore Khura'in's legal system to its rightful state one day. I want to pass on to you a world where you can live free from the fear of tyranny. Apollo: (He was always saying stuff like that to the two of us. Nahyuta... Is the reason why you didn't take Dhurke's badge... ...because you still remember those talks, too? I really hope that's what it is.) Present Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Dhurke: Inga Karkhuul Khura'in... He was an entirely insufferable, unlikable fellow, but I never thought he'd wind up dead. Apollo: Why didn't you like him? Dhurke: He was the most hawkish one in the Ga'ran regime. He established the secret police to arrest us rebels without due process. Those they managed to capture were immediately executed. My compatriots in the Defiant Dragons came to call him \"The Executioner.\" Apollo: \"The Executioner\"? Pretty ironic, considering how he ended up. Dhurke: He's probably in Hell now, being tormented by those he wrongfully put to death. Pink Butterfly Pendant Apollo: I found this in the tomb. Look familiar? Dhurke: ...Ah! Th-That's... Apollo: Dhurke? Dhurke: Where did you find it? Apollo: Down between the monk statues in the tomb. Is it yours, Dhurke? Dhurke: .........Oh, um, it's... it's something I bought. Apollo: ? (Why's he suddenly acting all awkward?) Dhurke: Hmm... I wonder when I lost it. Let's have it. It's very important to me. Apollo: O-Of course... (I'll just make a note about it for future reference.) Pink Butterfly Pendant returned to Dhurke, but a record of it remains in the Court Record. Dhurke's Law Book Dhurke: Careful with that. Don't go showing it around town. You'll be branded a rebel. Apollo: But I'm not a rebel. Dhurke: Don't be ridiculous. You're a member of the Defiant Dragons simply by being my son. Or did you think that dragon tattoo on your rear end was just for show? Athena: Whaaat?! You have a tattoo on your butt, Apollo?! Let me see! Apollo: Relax, Athena. He's just jerking our chains again. Amara's Assassination File Dhurke: I prepared that myself. Use it well. Apollo: I'm surprised you were able to gather this much information. Dhurke: It wasn't easy. After all, all of the evidence from the assassination was lost in the fire. And the newly-installed Ga'ran regime was in full control of the media. Every lead I tried to follow led to a dead end. Apollo: So then how am I supposed to solve this case? Dhurke: ...You'll figure something out once tomorrow's trial is underway. After all, no one's looked into this assassination since my last trial. Apolo: (I hope I can turn things around enough to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.) Dhurke's Badge Dhurke: Ah, my attorney's badge. You don't see those around here anymore. Apollo: It's not exactly something you can wear publicly, is it? Dhurke: Yeah... And if you did, people would jeer and throw things at you. I've had tomatoes, cabbages -- even eggs thrown at me. Apollo: That sounds awful. But at least they didn't throw rocks. Dhurke: ...True. Plus, if you were good at catching things, you'd have the start of a good meal. Apollo: What?! Dhurke: It's true. An hour's walk can yield all you need for a nice, big hot pot! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (Dhurke... I'm sorry I never knew how bad things were when you were raising us.) Anything else Dhurke: Is that for me, son? Apollo: No, I was just wondering if you knew anything about it. Dhurke: What? You came to visit me and you didn't even bring a present? Apollo: (I'll take that as a \"no.\") After clearing \"Your attorney's badge\" Talk option and presenting Pink Butterfly Pendant: Phoenix: Apollo, remember how Inga said he had \"someone dear to Dhurke\"? Why don't you ask about that? Apollo: Oh, right. I'll give it a try. Talk Someone dear to Dhurke Apollo: What did the minister mean when he said... ...he had someone dear to you in the palm of his hand? Who was he talking about? Dhurke: Hm? Apollo: Nahyuta seemed to know, but he wouldn't tell me anything. Dhurke: W-Well, I've no idea, so... Phoenix: Well, you obediently followed his every word after he said that... ...so it seems to me the minister was in close proximity to someone you really care about. Dhurke: Oh, um... Apollo: Someone you really care about that isn't Nahyuta...? Wait, don't tell me--! Is there a new lady in your life, Dhurke?! Dhurke: Wh-What?! No! Don't be ridiculous, son! Apollo: .................. Dhurke: .................. The love of my life was Amara. But she's gone now and there will never be another. BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: (Ah! My bracelet! Wait, does this mean...? Dhurke... Have you REALLY not met somebody new?) Present Bracelet Dhurke: The love of my life was Amara. But she's gone now and there will never be another. Perceive twitching left forearm on \"But she's gone now\" Apollo: Apollo: ...Dhurke. You can't fool me. You tensed up when you said, \"But she's gone now.\" And you unconsciously moved your arm... ...causing something to press up against your jacket. Dhurke: Ahhhhh! ...H-How did you do that?! Apollo: ...Oh, so that's it! You're hiding a woman's photo up your sleeve. You don't have to keep secrets like that from me, Dhurke. You're an eligible bachelor now. But you'll... introduce her to me at some point, right? Dhurke: I keep telling you, there's no other woman! Apollo: Fine, then let's see it. What are you hiding up your sleeve? Dhurke: ...It's just this. Satisfied? Apollo: Huh? But that's the pendant we found in Amara's Tomb... Dhurke: See? I wasn't trying to hide anything. Apollo: (...Then why did he tense up?) Dhurke, let me take a look at that. Dhurke: Ah! Apollo: .........Hey, what's this button for? *click* Apollo: Whoa! I-It's...! Athena: It's a picture of Dhurke and some lady! And she's really young-looking, too! Mon Dieu! Are you into younger women, Dhurke?! Apollo: Heh heh. Dhurke, you old dog, you. You got yourself a younger lover. Dhurke: Will you stop with this nonsense! This is Amara before she died. If you look closer, you'll see that I was younger, too. Apollo: Hey, you're right. Athena: Aww. That's no fun. Apollo: ...Wait a second. Haven't we seen this woman before? Athena: .........Now that you mention it...! Apollo: Isn't this woman the same as the one in the pendant's photo? Present Woman's Photo Apollo: Leads to: \"The woman in the pendant is also the one in this photo.\" Present anything else Apollo: Athena: Apollo... I don't see how that has anything to do with the woman in the pendant's photo. Dhurke: Have you had your eyes checked lately, son? Apollo: (I'm wrong, not blind! Maybe I should compare the pendant's photo against the evidence again.) Dhurke, I know I've seen the woman in the pendant's photo before. Leads back to: Isn't this woman the same as the one in the pendant's photo? Apollo: The woman in the pendant is also the one in this photo. Dhurke: ! A-Apollo, where did you get this? Apollo: From the safe in Inga's room. Phoenix: ...Apollo. If this is Queen Amara, it had to have been taken at least twenty-three years ago. But that's just not possible. Dhurke: ! Apollo: Yeah, I just noticed the same thing. Here's why this photo couldn't be twenty-three years old! Present law book Apollo: Leads to: \"Take a look at the law book. It has the mark of the Defiant Dragons branded on it.\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Dhurke: I don't see how that proves anything. Apollo: Look closer. Doesn't that part look, you know, kinda modern? Athena: Hmm... I don't know about that. Maybe you just don't know what's considered new and hip these days, Apollo. Apollo: Nngh... Dhurke: This photo is at least twenty-three years old. I don't know how you could say otherwise. Apollo: That's where you're wrong, Dhurke. (There's something in this photo that couldn't have existed back then.) Leads back to: \"Here's why this photo couldn't be twenty-three years old!\" Apollo: Take a look at the law book. It has the mark of the Defiant Dragons branded on it. But that mark didn't exist until after you started your revolutionary activities, Dhurke. So, this photo must've been taken AFTER Ga'ran came into power. ...And that didn't happen until AFTER Amara was assassinated. Dhurke: Gnrk! Apollo: ...So then, how could Amara even be in this photo? ...............Wait a second. That would mean that Amara is... ...still alive? Dhurke: Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh! ............Looks like you found me out, son. Apollo: Wait... So it's actually true?! Leads back to Talk options Perceive wrong area Apollo: Apollo: You seem uneasy, Dhurke. Wait... Don't tell me you're ashamed because she's much younger than you?! Dhurke: D-Don't be ridiculous! I'm just getting tense because of your intrusive questions! Anyone would react the same way! Apollo: (Hmm, I guess that's not it... Still, my bracelet reacted... ...so I know he must be hiding something!) Leads back to Talk options Someone dear to Dhurke (after perceiving) Apollo: Dhurke! What do you mean, Amara's still alive?! I thought she'd been assassinated. Dhurke: .........So did I. But it seems she made it out alive, only to be held captive by the Ga'ran regime. Apollo: Why would they do that? Dhurke: When I fled from the law and went underground twenty-three years ago... ...I heard some shocking news from a Defiant Dragons spy. There were rumors of Queen Amara being sighted in the palace. Apollo: And those rumors turned out to be true? Dhurke: Yes. I snuck into the palace to see for myself. She was confined within the grounds, but otherwise, she was as fit as a fiddle. Phoenix: S-So then, the sarcophagus in the tomb... It's empty? Dhurke: Yes. That entire tomb is one big charade. Ga'ran had it built to stage Amara's death. Athena: So we're not going to be cursed by her vengeful spirit? That's a relief. Dhurke: She was being held under virtual house arrest. So I freed her, and we made a run for it. This photo was taken back then. Apollo: (Look at how they're both grinning from ear to ear.) .........Hm? (There's a fingerprint on the metal part. I guess Dhurke must've left it by accident.) Athena: Ooh, Mr. Sahdmadhi! I wanna hear ALL about how you ran away with Queen Amara! Pink Butterfly Pendant updated in the Court Record. On the run with Amara (appears after \"Someone dear to Dhurke\") Apollo: I'm surprised Amara agreed to run away with you. I mean, Ga'ran must've told her that you tried to kill her. Dhurke: I tried to convince her that I wasn't the one who set the blaze. Apollo: And she believed you? Dhurke: She said, and I quote, \"I shall accompany you so I may ascertain the truth myself.\" Heh, she always was a tough one to read. Athena: I bet she was thrilled you came to her rescue, Mr. Sahdmadhi. To be set free by your beloved... It's like something out of a fairy tale. Dhurke: Yeah, well... There was no \"happily ever after\" once Ga'ran's people caught up with us. They took Amara away to who-knows-where. I snuck back into the palace and searched high and low for her, but to no avail. They probably moved her to some remote mountain prison or the like. Apollo: Dhurke, does Nahyuta know about this? Dhurke: He knows she's his true mother. I told him as much. Apollo: Wait... Is that why Nahyuta is following Ga'ran's orders? Dhurke: .........Most likely. Athena: So then, do you think that deep down, he doesn't really want to prosecute you? Dhurke: Well, he's not one to show his feelings. And lately, I've had no idea what he's thinking. Phoenix: Apollo. We need to grill the queen about Amara when we have the chance. Athena: ...Um. I was wondering about something. The little baby the lady's holding... Is that Prosecutor Sahdmadhi? Apollo: Not necessarily. It could just as well be me. After all, we're only one year apart. Athena: I don't know. I mean, the kid in the picture is too cute to be you. Apollo: (...Let's settle this by asking Dhurke himself.) Something important (appears after \"On the run with Amara\", then presenting Woman's Photo) Apollo: So what's this \"something important\" you have to tell me? Dhurke: ........................ Listen son. Even if you manage to prove me innocent tomorrow... ............... ...I... I don't have long to live. Apollo: Huh? ............... Wh-What are you talking about? Dhurke: What I mean is, I can already hear the Twilight Realm calling my name. There is no escaping death now that it has its sights set on me. Apollo: What?! ............I-Is this another one of your jokes? Dhurke: I wish it was. Apollo: Ha... Ha ha ha. You can't fool me, Dhurke. (Hm? That's strange. Why isn't my bracelet reacting?) Dhurke: ............ Phoenix: ...Are you sick? Dhurke: I-It's something like that. Apollo: So you're not joking? Dhurke: .........I'm afraid not, son. Sorry. Apollo: I-Isn't there a cure? Or at least some sort of treatment? Dhurke: Unfortunately not. Not for what I've got. Apollo: If you need some kind of surgery, I'll work hard until I can pay for it! So... Please...! Dhurke: .........It's too late. There's nothing more to be done now. Apollo: B-But you always say, \"A dragon never yields.\" So why are you giving up now? Dhurke: ...Apollo, I'm sorry. I really am. Apollo: ............I don't understand. Why is this happening, Dhurke? Why? Dhurke: ..................Listen, Apollo. I've got a favor to ask of you. Would you keep quiet about this? I don't want my fellow Dragons to find out. They'd lose all hope if they knew I was dying. Would you do that for me? Apollo: ............Of course. (Why is this happening now? Just when I was finally starting to feel like you really are my... I thought that this time, we'd finally... But now...) ...Damn it... Why...? Athena: Apollo... Dhurke: Listen, son. I don't have much longer to live... ...but I'll never let them execute me. Not before I finish what I need to do. Apollo: ...I know, Dhurke. There's no way I'm going to let them prove you guilty. (Before he goes, I'm going to turn back time by righting the wrongs that have been done. I'm going to restore Dhurke's freedom... ...and return a real smile to Nahyuta's face! I'm going to win this case. I just have to!) Dhurke: ...Son. I have one more... big secret. Apollo: What? There's something else you've been hiding from me? Dhurke: I'm afraid I can't tell you what it is. I'd be betraying a certain someone if I did. Apollo: Huh? What's that supposed to mean? Dhurke: .........Forgive me. You'll just have to find out for yourself. That's the only way. Apollo: I don't understand, Dhurke. Dhurke: ..................... Apollo. In court tomorrow... ...you may find yourself faced with a truth that is difficult to accept. But I know you. And I know you can handle the truth, no matter what it turns out to be. I know that because I believe in you. You're my son, after all! Apollo: ...Dhurke. (What is he talking about? Wait... He's not going to reveal that he actually IS the killer, is he?) Phoenix: Looks like we've run out of things to discuss. Apollo? ...Are you okay? Apollo: ...I'm fine. ???: FREE HIM NOW...!!! RELEASE DHURKE...!!! Apollo: What's going on out there? Dhurke: Sounds like the party's getting started without me. Apollo: Huh? Athena: It's coming from the temple. Let's go, Apollo, and take a look! Something important (subsequent times) Apollo: So what's this \"something important\" you have to tell me? Dhurke: ........................ Listen son. Even if you manage to prove me innocent tomorrow... ............... ...I... I don't have long to live. Apollo: Huh? ............... Wh-What are you talking about?

Just when I was finally starting to feel like you really are my... I thought that this time, we'd finally... But now...) ...Damn it... Why...? Athena: Apollo... Present Pink Butterfly Pendant or Woman's Photo (after clearing \"Someone dear to Dhurke\" Talk option) Dhurke: Amara... I hope she's doing well. Apollo: I've been wondering, Dhurke... How could a commoner win the heart of a queen anyway? Dhurke: ...Hm? Wait, don't tell me... Have you fallen for Princess Rayfa, son? Apollo: Wait, what?! Athena: ...Apollo. I had no idea you liked your women so young. Apollo: No! I don't! Phoenix: She's barely in her teens. That's just not right, Apollo. Apollo: Listen to me! I never said anything about her! Dhurke: Aww, it's all right son. In a few more years, the age difference won't matter so much. Apollo: Would you guys just stop already?! Woman's Photo (after clearing \"On the run with Amara\" Talk option) Apollo: Dhurke, about the cute little kid in this photo... Is that me? Dhurke: ...Huh? What are you talking about? Apollo: .................. Athena: See? I told you it was Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. Dhurke: Hm? .........Oh, I see. Well, either way, it's not you, son. Apollo: So then... ...if it's Nahyuta, it was taken when he was about a year old, right? And that would mean... ...you ran away with Amara around twenty-two or twenty-three years ago? (Changed from [...you ran away with Amara around 22 or 23 years ago?] in the original release) Dhurke: Hm? .........You're pretty good with numbers, son! Impressive. Apollo: Huh? (What kind of answer is that?) Woman's Photo updated in the Court Record. Dhurke: .........Before you go, son, there is something else I need to tell you. Something important. Apollo: What is it, Dhurke? I've never seen you act so serious before. After clearing \"Something important\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: May 18Tehm'pul Temple Apollo: Wh-Whoa! What IS all this?! Anime cutscene Datz: Ow-ow-oww! Let go, will ya?! Policeman: W-What are they-- Datz: Huh? Well, look at that! The people are coming to take their courts back! Policeman: Don't hold back, men! Arrest them all! Rebel: Dhurke belongs to the people! Give him back! Rebel: Yeaaaaah! Where are you holding him?! Policeman: Quiet down, you! Child: Th-They have my big sister, too! But she didn't do anything wrong! Policeman: Ouch! YOUCH! Stop pulling my hair! Old Man: Release my son! Release him now...!!! Policeman: Aaaagh! Stop that! No biting! Apollo: This... is really something. Phoenix: And it looks like Datz and Mrs. Inmee are leading the charge. ???: ...You unenlightened fools. Do you honestly think this will change anything? Datz: Yuty! ...Why do you keep serving that witch Ga'ran?! Apollo: Ah! (It's...) Hey, Nahyuta! Nahyuta: ! You again? Apollo: What's going on here? Nahyuta: It would appear that the insurgents are fanning the flames of the rebellion. ...But I never thought it would grow so large. However, they will all be under arrest shortly. Reinforcements are almost here. Apollo: They'll be arrested? Just for protesting? Nahyuta: They are aiding and abetting a criminal by seeking his release. Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran, has ordered they be arrested and judged en masse. Apollo: B-But weren't you once a member of the Defiant Dragons, too? How can you go along with this? Nahyuta: ...I am simply following the orders that Her Eminence has handed down. Apollo: No, it can't be as simple as that. Listen, Nahyuta. There's something I want to talk to you about. Hey! You're not getting away this time! We need to talk. Nahyuta: .........*sigh* I see there is no reasoning with you. Very well, then. Speak. Examine Protesters Athena: Look at all these people! They've got the whole temple surrounded. Phoenix: And it looks like Datz is fanning the flames. The police are going to really have their hands full with this many protesters. Apollo: This whole thing is like a powder keg waiting to go off. We should keep our distance for now. Talk Dhurke Apollo: Nahyuta, do you really have to serve as prosecutor on Dhurke's case? I mean, prosecuting your own flesh and blood... It's just not right. Nahyuta: Again with this drivel? Your ethical standards are not the be-all, end-all of the world around you. Apollo: (I'm not getting into another debate with him.) .........Nahyuta, did you know that Dhurke is sick? Nahyuta: What? Apollo: He apparently doesn't have that much longer to live. If found guilty, he probably wouldn't even make it until his execution day. Nahyuta: What are you talking about? Apollo: Knowing this, are you still prepared to send an already dying man to his grave? Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: Well? Nahyuta: ...I... Apollo: Enough with the zen monk act, Nahyuta. Tell me how you really feel. Nahyuta: .........Mr. Justice. Each person is born with a role to fulfill. And I... must fulfill mine. Apollo; Well, I'm not convinced that taking Dhurke to trial is a part of your lot in life. Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: As for why you've been at Ga'ran's every beck and call... ...I think I might have the answer. Amara (appears after \"Dhurke\") Leads to: \"Nahyuta. You know the truth about your mother, don't you?\" Present Dhurke's Law Book Nahyuta: That's... Apollo: The rebels' \"Mark of the Dragon.\" It symbolizes a person's opposition to the Defense Culpability Act. Nahyuta: You seek to argue with me about the legal system? ...If so, you're wasting your breath. Lawyers and prosecutors do not lay down the law; they merely follow it. The laws decreed by our sovereign are absolute. There is no room for debate. Apollo: So \"let it go, and move on,\" right? Why is that your only answer to everything? Apollo: Nahyuta. You know the truth about your mother, don't you? About how the former queen is still alive and being held somewhere. Nahyuta: So Dhurke told you, did he... Yes, it's true. My mother was spirited away to some remote corner of this kingdom... ...to keep her safe from harm. Apollo: Safe from harm? But Dhurke said the Ga'ran regime is holding her captive. Nahyuta: No, they are keeping her safe. Apollo: So you don't know where Amara is being held? Nahyuta: I only know that it is some secluded hideaway where visitors are not allowed. I have heard she leads a simple life, akin to that of monastic disciples. Apollo: (Sure sounds like she's being held captive to me.) Listen, Nahyuta... Aren't you really doing the queen's bidding... ...because she's holding Amara captive? Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: And this whole thing with Dhurke... You know he didn't really kill Inga, don't you? Nahyuta: .................. Apollo: Dhurke doesn't have much longer to live, so I want to help him however I can. This time, it's our turn... Apollo: *sniffle* *hiccup* *hiccup* Nahyuta: You... You could've been killed... But you risked your life... to save us... Why...? Dhurke: What a silly question. What father wouldn't risk his life to save his own children? Nahyuta, Apollo... Don't you ever hesitate to call when you need me. Understand? Apollo: It's our turn to help Dhurke however we can. Nahyuta: .................. .................. .........What you speak of... is futile. Apollo: ! Nahyuta: .........Let it go, and move on. The guilty verdict... The hopelessness... You must resign yourself to it all. Clinging to false hope now will only serve to magnify your future despair. So let it go... and move on... Apollo: ...Nahyuta. (Are you really going to just roll over on this?) Nahyuta: ...I've no more time for idle chatter. I must prepare for tomorrow's trial. Now, if you'll excuse me... Apollo: ......... Athena: Apollo. I sensed a whirlpool of emotions coming from within Prosecutor Sahdmadhi just now. Anger, shock, bewilderment... ...and an icy sorrow, as deep and dark as an abyss. Apollo: Yeah, I picked up on that, too. Looks like Dhurke really won't be the only one who will need my help tomorrow. Phoenix: ...I think it's about time to pay Queen Ga'ran another visit... ...and ask her about her sister Amara. Talk Any ideas? Athena: I didn't know Dhurke was sick. What's wrong with him? I mean, he looked fine to me. Apollo: ...I really don't know. The Dhurke I remember would go out hunting in the middle of winter... ...while everyone around him was dropping like flies with the flu and whatnot. Athena: ............... Apollo: .................. Phoenix: ........................ Apollo: .........Come on everyone, cheer up! The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles, right? Phoenix: ...Apollo, you don't have to put on a brave face for-- Apollo: No! I'm fine! Besides, Dhurke will have his day in court. I won't let this get me down. What to do Athena: So you don't know Queen Amara at all, Apollo? I thought that since you used to live with Dhurke, that maybe you had met her. Apollo: Dhurke escaped with Amara twenty-three or so years ago, so I was still just an infant. Even if I had met her, I wouldn't have remembered it. Athena: I guess not. But that means you may have been cared for by a queen. And if you had been, then... Apollo: Th-Then what? Athena: You would've turned out... I don't know... better? Apollo: Wh-What's that supposed to mean? May 18Ga'ran Palace - Audience Chamber Phoenix: Hm? The royal guard isn't around. ???: That is utter... utter... hooey! You cannot continue to deceive the people like that! ???: ...Rayfa. Justice is much more than simply speaking the truth. Apollo: Is that Princess Rayfa and Queen Ga'ran over there? Rayfa: Y-You deceived me, too, Mother! How can I ever believe a word you say again?! You... You... nincompoop! .........Ah. Phoenix: Your Benevolence... ...I, uh, couldn't help but overhear... Rayfa: Nnnnnnnnnnnngh... You impudent--!! *ka-tonk!* Phoenix: Oww!!! Apollo: Are you okay, Mr. Wright? I can't believe she actually punched you... Phoenix: ...Yeah, I'm used to it by now. Athena: What's the matter with the princess? Apollo: It sounded like she was arguing with her mother. Phoenix: .........Maybe it has something to do with this picture. Rayfa said she had to ask her mother about some secret or another as soon as she saw it. Apollo: So then... ...does that mean that Princess Rayfa knows what really happened? That Amara wasn't assassinated, and is still very much alive? Phoenix: It would seem so. And she doesn't seem to be taking Ga'ran's lies very well. But that's no surprise, considering how much Rayfa reveres her mother. Athena: That would definitely cause her a great deal of anguish and sadness. ???: Eavesdropping, are we? How very rude. Ga'ran: Hm? You there. Are you not Dhurke's son? Apollo: Oh, um, nice to meet you, Your Eminence. We're actually here to speak with you, if you could spare a moment. Examine Throne Apollo: ............ Phoenix: Apollo? What are you doing? This is the queen's audience chamber. You can't snoop around in here. Apollo: Oh, right. Sorry! (I wonder what it'd be like to sit there with Athena and Mr. Wright groveling at my feet... No! Stop! I can't let myself think about that sort of thing!) Talk Amara's alive? Apollo: Your Eminence, Dhurke told me about Amara. About how she's still alive, that is. Ga'ran: ...We know not of what you speak. Apollo: After Dhurke learned Amara was still alive, he rescued her, and they ran off together. But she was captured and remains captive in a secret location to this day. As for Nahyuta doing your bidding, it's only because Amara's life's in your hands. Ga'ran: Ho ho ho. What an active imagination you have. Royal Guard: Ha ha ha ha ha ha! A lawyer AND a comedian! How droll! Apollo: (Wh-Whoa. Where'd THEY come from? Anyway! If she's going to play dumb, I'll just have to jog her memory with some evidence!) Amara's alive? (subsequent times) Apollo: Your Eminence, Dhurke told me about Amara. About how she's still alive, that is. Ga'ran: ...We know not of what you speak. Apollo: After Dhurke learned Amara was still alive, he rescued her, and they ran off together. But she was captured and remains captive in a secret location to this day. As for Nahyuta doing your bidding, it's only because Amara's life's in your hands. Ga'ran: Ho ho ho. What an active imagination you have. Royal Guard: Ha ha ha ha ha ha! A lawyer AND a comedian! How droll! Apollo: (Argh! If she's going to play dumb, I'll just have to jog her memory with some evidence!) Amara's alive! (appears after \"Amara's alive?\", then presenting Woman's Photo) Apollo: So then, you admit that Amara's still alive? Ga'ran: .........Yes. She is under our protection in a safe location. Apollo: (I think you mean \"being held prisoner.\") ...And where is she being kept? Ga'ran: Ho ho ho. Now why would we tell the son of a traitor that? Apollo: (Guess she has a point there.) Ga'ran: Now, heed our warning, Horned Devil. It would not be wise to inform the people that Amara yet lives. It would only serve to plunge public order into chaos. Apollo: I have no intention of doing that. (Besides, there are real terrorists out there who might try to kill her.) Ga'ran: ...Good. Now, there was something we have been meaning to ask you. Do you know what has become of the Founder's Orb? The Founder's Orb (appears after \"Amara's alive!\") Leads to: \"The Founder's Orb went missing after Dhurke took it into the tomb.\" Present Attorney's Badge Ga'ran: What have we here? Apollo: It's the attorney's badge used by lawyers like me back home. Ga'ran: Well, in this country, lawyers are a loathsome breed. And we would advise you not to needlessly advertise your place among their ranks. For even now, the bad karma Dhurke has engendered brings woe to your kind. It is a simple matter of cause and effect. Apollo: (Yeah, an effect you caused by enacting the Defense Culpability Act.) Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Ga'ran: His own ill will was visited upon him. So it is within the cycle of karma. Others might call it divine retribution -- the punishment of the gods. Apollo: You don't seem particularly sad, even though it was your own husband. Ga'ran: We were betrayed by the man we had called husband. Moreover, we are the Grand Priestess, summoner of spirits from the Twilight Realm. For us, death is not the end, for we can still speak with those who have passed. Apollo: (I guess being a spirit-channeling queen gives you a different take on life and death.) Woman's Photo (after clearing \"Amara's alive?\" Talk option) Apollo: Your Eminence, I ask that you take a look at this photo. Ga'ran: Why, that's--! Apollo: It's a photo of Amara. And here you can see a law book bearing the mark of the Defiant Dragons. I believe you know what that means. Ga'ran: .................. ..........Very well. Royal guard, stand down. Royal Guard: Yes, Your Eminence! Your wish is our command! Ga'ran: It seems there is no need to perpetuate this charade any longer. We shall speak... of all we know. Dhurke's Law Book Ga'ran: To burn such a mark upon a sacred text of the law... He will surely be visited by what he has wrought. And to think he once called himself a man of the law. Apollo: I think it's just his way of objecting to the DC Act. Ga'ran: Yet that act is but an objection to his falsified evidence. How appalling that even now he recognizes no responsibility and knows no shame. Anything else Apollo: So, I was wondering if... Ga'ran: We have no intention of bestowing any information upon you or any other lawyer. Apollo: (Guess someone doesn't like to play nice with others.) Ga'ran: The Founder's Orb went missing after Dhurke took it into the tomb. As his son, we thought you might know something of its current whereabouts. Apollo: I knew it. I suppose I should thank you for that free running tour of Khura'in. Ga'ran: ...That was the royal guards' own doing. Apollo: (Nice try, lady. But now you're definitely not getting the orb, ever.) Why do you want the orb so badly, anyway? Ga'ran: Because... it would be most dangerous in the wrong hands. It must be recovered. Phoenix: Is the legend true? Can the orb really impart spiritual power? Are you worried that someone could overthrow you with it? Ga'ran: The Holy Mother's power is without equal. Should Her Holiness once again return to our world... ...she could conceivably bestow great power upon the one who unlocked the orb's secret. Phoenix: I guess it makes sense, considering spirit channeling is a fact of life here. Ga'ran: ...So we ask you, Horned Devil. Did you receive the Founder's Orb from Dhurke? Apollo: ...Does it look like I did? Ga'ran: ...So you like to play games, do you? ...Royal guard! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Eminence! Ga'ran: Search this devil, and his belongings! Apollo: What? Royal Guard: At once, Your Eminence! Don't move!!! You're only making this haaaaaarder on yourseeelf!!! Apollo: Yikes! Hey, cut it out! Argh! What the--?! Athena: Eeeeeek! Apollo! Don't strip here! Royal Guard: Stop resisting!!! Just submit to our strip search alreeeeeady!!! Apollo: N-No, wait! Hey! Cut it out! Aaaaaaaaaaaaagh! .................. (Rest in pieces, my poor, tattered dignity.) Royal Guard: There's no sign of the Founder's Orb, Your Eminence! Ga'ran: .........So, you have hidden it somewhere. Heh. No matter. We shall recover it one way or another once you are found guilty of abetting the accused. Apollo: (Dhurke was right. She really is bent on getting the orb.) ???: Mother! Apollo: Looks like the princess is back. Rayfa: I took a stroll to try to calm myself, but... I still find this situation unacceptable. The people must be informed about Queen Amara! Apollo: ! (So she DOES know about that!) Ga'ran: Rayfa, you do not yet possess a clear grasp of how a government and its people interact. There will always be secrets that must be kept from the ignorant masses. Rayfa: You have little faith in our people, Mother. But it is the Royal Priestess's duty to always speak the truth. And as such I cannot remain silent! I will not! Ga'ran: Hah. The truth, you say? Your mind has been poisoned by the Barbed One. Phoenix: It was an honor and a pleasure, Your Eminence. Ga'ran: ...We must speak with our child. It is a mother's duty to discipline her child, after all. Now, if you would excuse us. Apollo: (Discipline? Coming from her, I don't like the sound of that at all...) Phoenix: Well, Apollo, let's head back to the safe house for now. Apollo: Good idea. We need to go over what we've found and collect our thoughts. May 18Former Sahdmadhi Law Offices Edgeworth: ...Ah, you're back. Athena: Thank you for holding down the fort, Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth. Sorry it took so long. Hope you weren't too bored. Edgeworth: ...I watched \"The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm\" while you were gone. And my verdict is... it's an outrage! Especially its theme song. Even worse, the people here believe it's an original, Khura'inese show. Can you believe it! I've already spoke about it at length with Mr. Are'bal here, and he... Apollo: (I'm not sure what he's babbling about, but at least it seems he wasn't bored.) Phoenix: Moving along to things that actually matter... We've gathered about all the information and evidence we can concerning this case. I think it's time we go over everything we've learned so far. Examine Any point of interest Phoenix: ...Apollo. We probably shouldn't search the place while Datz is gone. Besides, we need to go over the case for tomorrow. Athena: What's with you recently? It's like you want to spend every free minute we have snooping. Apollo: (But don't you get the urge to look at everything you can sometimes, too?) Talk About Inga's murder Phoenix: The orb trial... Maya's abduction... And the murder of the mastermind behind it all, Justice Minister Inga... It's a lot to consider. Think you have all the facts straight in your head? Apollo: Yep, I've got it covered, Mr. Wright. It's the truth about what really went down that's going to be the problem. Athena: Yeah, it's like the more we learn about this case, the less we understand. Phoenix: I agree. There's a deep darkness enveloping this case. I'm almost afraid of what we will find once we lift that black veil. Suffice to say, the real killer is certainly waiting underneath. Apollo: (The real killer, huh... Now that's the million dollar question.) Phoenix: Who killed Inga, and why? Think, Apollo. Who would you say had a motive to commit this crime? Apollo: Umm... Athena: I, for one, am drawing a complete blank. Phoenix: I want to know how the killer slipped into the tomb, killed Inga, and slipped back out... ...without ever being seen. That's a bona fide locked-room mystery right there. Apollo: Well, we've collected plenty of evidence and statements. I just hope the rest comes out in court. It'll be a thinner tightrope than usual, that's for sure. Amara's assassination Phoenix: This case has one big fly in the ointment. In order to prove Dhurke completely innocent... ...we'll also have to exonerate him of the crime committed twenty-three years ago. Apollo: Amara's supposed assassination... Athena: Right. We know Amara's still alive... ...but Dhurke could still be charged with plotting to kill her. Apollo: He couldn't discover the truth -- even after over two decades of investigating. So our biggest hurdle is going to be the complete lack of evidence. The fire made sure of that. Athena: Mr. Wright, have you ever won a case without any evidence? Phoenix: No, that's one thing I've never done before. Apollo: A trial unprecedented even in the decorated annals of the Wright Anything Agency... (Still, I can't help but wonder... Was there really no evidence left behind?) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: You flash that badge like a pro now. And with such confidence, too. I can really feel it. Apollo: R-Really? Phoenix: ...Sure. Take Trucy's case, or that civil trial yesterday. You really came into your own during both of them. Apollo: Eheh... Heh heh heh. (I can feel my cheeks betraying me...) Athena: You'd better not be thinking of starting your own firm, Apollo. Apollo: What? No, of course not. (I'm probably not ready for that, anyway.) Pink Butterfly Pendant, Woman's Photo, or Amara's Assassination File Phoenix: Amara... She's still alive. Apollo: But she's basically being held prisoner somewhere. Phoenix: This puts Dhurke at a distinct disadvantage. ...Not to mention us, too. Apollo: And Nahyuta is under Ga'ran's thumb because of all this as well. Phoenix: Yep. It's a problem all right, and it's not like we can just go and rescue Amara. There must be something we can do... Athena: We'll just have to pin our hopes on Dhurke's revolution! Apollo: So, basically, the fates of Amara and Nahyuta... ...depend entirely on our ability to beat the charges against Dhruke tomorrow. Dhurke's Law Book or Dhurke's Badge Phoenix: What would you do if the Defense Culpability Act was established back home? Apollo: What would I do? That's a good question. Athena: What are you worried about, Apollo? You'd always have a job as Trucy's assistant. Apollo: Uh-huh... And what about you, Athena? Couldn't you become a therapist? Athena: Hmm... I don't know if I could do it for a living... Phoenix: I'd probably go back to playing piano. Apollo: ..................... Athena: ............... Phoenix: Hey! What are those looks for?! Anything else Phoenix: Just because you don't know something, doesn't mean that I do, Apollo. That's an important lesson for you to learn. Apollo: (In other words, this didn't ring any bells.) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ...Oh, and we can't forget about the Defense Culpability Act. \"...those who would support criminals will be deemed just as guilty.\" In short, if Dhurke is found guilty, and is sentenced to death... ...we'll likely join him in a very public execution. Apollo: Y-Yeah... Athena: Beat the charges or die... What kind of crazy, upside-down legal system is this, anyway?! Phoenix: ...Don't worry. I can't ask someone as young as you to risk your life, Athena. So tomorrow, it'll just be me and Apollo on the courtroom floor. But you can support us by watching from the gallery. Athena: What?! No... I wanna help! I'm part of the agency, too, after all! Phoenix: ...Sorry, but this is a direct order from your boss. Plus, there's Prosecutor Blackquill to think of. He said he'd use me for sword practice if I put you in harm's way. Athena: Nrrgh... Simon... Well, at least promise me this, you two. Promise me you'll make it back alive! Apollo: Ha... Ha ha... Make it back alive... huh... Phoenix: What's with that face, Apollo? You'll never inspire confidence in your client like that. And it'll play right into the prosecution's hands. Remember, \"the worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles.\" Apollo: You're right! Even when it seems hopeless, or when there's not a shred of evidence to be found... ... we can never let it show on our faces... right? (But will I actually be able to do that tomorrow? When push comes to shove, will I be able to force my biggest smile?) To be continued Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Apollo Justice) Apollo: Nothing particularly interesting here. Area already examined (while playing as Apollo Justice) Apollo: We've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around.

Nothing to examine during investigation (during chapter \"Apollo's Narrow Escape\", while visiting Bazaar) Apollo: We've gotta find a place to hide!\n-- Channeling the Minister --Maya: Um... I don't have any idea what's going on, but...Press Apollo: Apollo: You've been asleep ever since you were rescued from the tomb, correct? Maya: ...Mm-hm. I was exhausted after being held captive for so long. Apollo: That must've been terrible. Phoenix: Maya, Minister Inga didn't do anything to you, did he? Maya: Oh, no, it wasn't like that. On the contrary, I asked him for all sorts of things. Phoenix: Like what? Maya: Like \"I'm really craving burgers!\" and \"I'll die if I miss an episode of 'The Plumed Punisher'!\" Acting like a brat netted me a TV and even a few burgers from someplace! He was surprisingly nice to me. Phoenix: Huh?! Um... are you sure we're talking about the same guy here? Ga'ran: Hmph. He may have loomed large, but he was unexpectedly easy to push around. Maya: Even though he's the one who was responsible for pushing those execution papers through? Ga'ran: Oh, that? Approving executions was simply his preferred method of stress relief. Apollo: (With a wife like her, he was probably really pushing them through out of fear.) Phoenix: I'm beginning to see why he wanted to stage a coup. Maya: ...In any case, my time in captivity wasn't so bad. But of all the things that happened...Maya: ...I know I didn't channel Minister Inga!Press Apollo: Apollo: Are you sure about that? Maybe you just don't remember channeling him. Maya: Don't remember?! I may be twenty-eight, but I'm not senile, you know! (Changed from [I may be 28, but I'm not senile, you know!] in the original release)] Apollo: (Something's not right here.) Ms. Fey, you were confined to Amara's Tomb the whole time. Is that correct? Maya: ...Umm, yes. But I wasn't conscious the whole time. Apollo: Okay, then let me ask you something. Did you ever see Nayna in the tomb... dressed as Dhurke? Maya: Huh? ...Is this some kind of joke? ...I think I'd remember if I saw something as crazy as that. Phoenix: Plus, I doubt anyone would carry out a crime like that right in front of a potential witness. Apollo: (...I hate when he's right.)Maya: I didn't even have the chance to do something like that.Press Apollo: Apollo: You didn't have a chance to channel him? Does channeling someone take a long time? Maya: Not really. Once you get the hang of it, it's pretty much instantaneous. But I was all tied up, literally! So there was no way for me to make the channeling mudra with my hands to do it. Apollo: R-Right... (I guess she really didn't channel Inga then.) Phoenix: Maya, when mediums are done with a session... ...they can send the spirit back to the other world themselves, right? Maya: Sure, unless they're still in training. Amateurs can get possessed by spirits sometimes... ...but full-fledged mediums can stay in total control of a session. And they can send the deceased's spirit away anytime they want. Apollo: So I take you can do that, too, Ms. Fey? Maya: Of course! It's a cinch for the new-and-improved Mystic Maya Fey, Ace Spirit Medium! Phoenix: That's strange. You seem like the same old childish Maya to me. Maya: Grr...! I'll show you childish, Nick!Maya: Besides, I'd never go quietly along with some criminal's plan.Press Apollo: Apollo: So you wouldn't channel spirits for unseemly purposes? Maya: Of course not. Spirit channeling is my bread and butter. And I take a lot of pride in my work. It's like, would YOU use your legal skills to commit a crime, Apollo? Apollo: Well, uh... Until finger pointing and objecting become deadly, I don't see how they CAN be used... Maya: .........Wow, you're a regular Mr. Smarty-Pants. Just like Nick. Always at the ready with some sarcastic comeback. Phoenix: I think I'll save my many objections for after the trial... Apollo: Yes, please. Maya: Anyway... I'd never go along with something like murder.Maya: Though, I guess there are some things I'd go quietly along with...Press Apollo: Apollo: It sounds to me like you're trying to hide something, Ms. Fey... Maya: .........Didn't anyone teach you about respecting boundaries, Apollo? It's really rude to pry into a person's private affairs. Apollo: Ah, s-sorry! I didn't realize... Um... .........Wait, we're in a court of law... Maya: Yeah, I know. Apollo: Then what was all that about me being rude? I'm just doing my job! Maya: ...! Apollo: ...So please, just tell me. What exactly are you hiding? Maya: Sorry, but... I promised Dhurke I wouldn't say. Apollo: You made a promise... to Dhurke? Maya: Mm-hm. A pretty big one... Phoenix: I think this is about all you're going to get out of her. Apollo: Y-Yeah...Phoenix: Maya seems really confused. But you can't blame her for not knowing what happened.Apollo: True... After all, first she was kidnapped, and now she's wrapped up in a murder case.Phoenix: We'll have to fill her in as she gives her testimony.After pressing second, third, and fifth statements:Ga'ran: Enough. The witness is denying that she channeled any spirits. Further questioning is pointless. It appears your little fiction has been soundly expossed for what it is.Maya: ...You should listen to her, Apollo. I don't even know why you suspected me in the first place. I mean, you don't have any evidence of me channeling Minister Inga, do you?Apollo: Oh, umm... (Evidence, huh?)Maya: There's no point in even thinking about it, really. I don't use anything special to channel spirits, so there wouldn't be anything left behind.Phoenix: That's true... Just like when she channeled the high priest, all Maya needs is her own body.Judge: If the defense has no evidence to offer, I will have to end this cross-examination.Apollo: (What now? Even if she doesn't use any special items to do the channeling itself... ...you'd think there would be SOMETHING to complete the deception.)Judge: Is there any proof that Justice Minister Inga was channeled?None at all Apollo: Nope, I don't see how there could be, Your Magistry. Maya: I see you've still got a long way to go, Apollo. Apollo: E-Excuse me? Maya: If it were Nick, he would've tried to bluff his way through that one. Apollo: (But I'm not Mr. Wright...) ...Um, I'd like to retract my previous statement. And as to whether there is any proof that Minister Inga was channeled?  Leads to: \"You bet there is!\"You bet there is Leads to: \"You bet there is!\"Apollo: You bet there is!Maya: Really?!Judge: Well, now!Phoenix: ...You're bluffing, I take it?Apollo: .........I'll be fine! (If we're right, then there must be some sort of proof to back us up. Time to do some serious thinking, Apollo Justice!) Okay, we know that when Rayfa saw her father... ...he wasn't dressed like Ms. Fey, right?Phoenix: Right, because if he was... ...Rayfa would've immediately known he was being channeled.Apollo: So that means... ...he was dressed in his usual suit when Rayfa saw him.Phoenix: ...Ah-hah! Good thinking, Apollo. This might be the perfect angle to attack from.Judge: All right. Let's have an answer from the defense. What proof do you have that Ms. Maya Fey channeled Justice Minister Inga?Present Gemstone Apollo: Leads to: \"Is that... a gemstone?\"Present anything else Apollo: Judge: Hmm... And how does that prove she channeled the minister? Apollo: Oh, um... About that... *psst* M-Mr. Wright.  Phoenix: Why are you whispering? Apollo: Help me before they call my bluff. Phoenix: What?! Ga'ran: And what makes you think your bluff wasn't called from the very start, Horned Devil? Judge: ......... Apollo: N-Nothing, Your Eminence... Judge: Keep this up, defense... and we'll be casting you off the bluffs of Mt. Poniponi! Apollo: Nnnagh! (Oww... I'd better think this through again. Even if Ms. Fey had channeled Inga... ...she still would've had to change into his clothes to complete her disguise. If so, where did Inga's clothes go after she changed out of them?) Judge: Now, would the defense care to provide an honest response this time? Leads back to: \"What proof do you have that Ms. Maya Fey channeled Justice Minister Inga?\"Judge: Is that... a gemstone?Apollo: We found this among the ashes of one of the tomb's incense burners. (Changed from [We found this among the ashes of one the [sic] tomb's incense burners.] in the original release) Does this gemstone ring any bells, Your Eminence?Ga'ran: Wh-What...! What was that doing in the tomb?Apollo: Ah, so you do recognize it. But then, as his wife... ...how could you not recognize this gemstone button from your husband's jacket?Maya: Hm? I don't get where you're going with this...Apollo: Channeling Minister Inga alone wouldn't be enough to fool someone like Princess Rayfa. Especially if he were wearing your clothes. So you would've had to change into the minister's clothes before channeling him.Maya: .........Ah!Apollo: Ms. Fey. You used the minister's clothes as cover while going from his room to the tomb... ...where you burned them once you no longer needed them!Maya: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaat?!Phoenix: Uh, oh... She seems genuinely surprised by that, Apollo...Ga'ran:Ga'ran: .........Ms. Fey?Maya: Y-Yes?Ga'ran: Do you know my husband's name?Maya: It was, umm... \"Inga Karkhuul Khura'in\"... right?Ga'ran: That is correct, in part. But there's more... Much more. Inga Karkhuul Haw'kohd Dis'nahm Bi'ahni Lawga Ormo Pohmpus Da'nit Ar'edi Iz Khura'in III. That is his true name.Apollo: Could it be any longer...?Ga'ran: Due to its length, only a portion of it was ever made public. So, Ms. Fey. Did you know his true name?Maya: N-No. I mean, how could I...?Ga'ran: Precisely. Yet a medium must know both the face AND true name of the one she seeks to channel.Apollo: Ah... Aaaaaaaaaagh! S-So then... Ms. Fey couldn't have channeled Minister Inga?Maya: That's what I've been saying this whole time! Why would I want to randomly channel some old guy I didn't know... ...and didn't like, thanks to that last trial.Apollo: I-I can't believe this...Phoenix: Apollo... I really don't think Maya's lying. However, your line of reasoning still seems credible to me.Apollo: I agree, but there's something tripping us up in the details. Maybe we're working off of some wrong assumption again.Maya: .........Um, Apollo? I was thinking...Apollo: Yes?Maya: Since I didn't channel Minister Inga... ...is it possible that someone else did?Apollo: Someone else? But who else could it have been?Maya: I... haven't thought that far yet.Ga'ran: Such chatter is without merit. Let us move on, shall we?Apollo: Urk. (I don't care what Ga'ran says. I'm going to figure this out. If it wasn't Ms. Fey, and the queen has an alibi, then...)Phoenix: Apollo, forget about who is capable of channeling spirits for a second.Apollo: I should consider the circumstances around the channeling, right?Phoenix: Right. We know Rayfa saw her father come running out of his private quarters. If he was being channeled at the time, who could it have been?Apollo: It had to have been... someone who was in Inga's private quarters.Ga'ran: Well, I'm waiting, defense. And you know how much I despise waiting.Apollo: Yes, but! There is someone else besides Ms. Fey who could've channeled Minister Inga! (There is just one more person... And they were in Inga's private quarters. That person is our only hope now!)Ga'ran: So the defense believes there was another. Let's have your very serious answer then.Apollo: With pleasure!Ga'ran: Horned Devil! Who could have channeled Minister Inga?Present Nayna profile Apollo: Leads to: \"Nayna...?\"Present anyone else Apollo: Ga'ran: .........Preposterous. Apollo: Augh! (A little warning would've been nice!) Judge: But I thought meting out penalties was my job... Apollo: (It can only be that one person. The person who entered Inga's private quarters just before they came back out!) Ga'ran: I command the defense to answer once more. Leads back to: \"Horned Devil!\"Ga'ran: Nayna...?Apollo: Your Eminence said it yourself...Ga'ran: That's right. Nayna never did go into the tomb that day. Instead, she entered my husband's private quarters.Apollo: How do you know?Ga'ran: It's quite simple. Shoeprints were discovered in Inga's private quarters. Shoeprints that belonged to Nayna.Apollo: And then there's Her Benevolence's statement. She said that Nayna disappeared right after she entered Minister Inga's private quarters... ...the room from which Minister Inga himself came running out of not long afterwards.Ga'ran: You are not seriously suggesting...Apollo: It's the only thing that makes sense. Nayna channeled Minister Inga and left his private quarters thereafter. That's why no one has seen her since... ...and why only the minister's shoeprints were found outside his residence!Maya: ...Ah! No waaaaaaaaay!Phoenix: That's got to be it! Nayna must've somehow channeled the minister...!Apollo: All of the circumstantial evidence has fallen into place. You can't ignore it anymore. You can't claim Nayna isn't connected to this case somehow! In light of this, the defense calls Nayna to the stand!Ga'ran: ...!Judge: W-Well, Your Eminence?Ga'ran: ............ Very well, then. Let us call Nayna to testify.Apollo: (...Yes! Now we can finally crack this case wide open!)Judge: Let us adjourn while the witness is summoned.Ga'ran: There is no need. Nayna is in the waiting lobby.Apollo: What? Nayna's here? I thought she'd gone missing.Ga'ran: It seems she was feeling unwell, and simply wished to rest undisturbed. But her concern for Rayfa brought her here today.Apollo: (She took time off without Rayfa's knowledge or consent?)Phoenix: .........I'm betting there's more to her disappearing act than meets the eye, Apollo.Judge: Ms. Nayna, do you understand why you have been summoned here today?Nayna: ........................ Yes, of course. Her Eminence has informed me that this man here suspects I have committed a crime.Apollo: (So this is Nayna... That's quite the hairdo.)Nayna: Though I will say......... Heh heh heh heh heh! I suppose I'm not as old as I had thought... ...if this horn-headed nincompoop would take me for a criminal.Apollo: N-Nincompoop...?Phoenix: Isn't that Rayfa's favorite insult? I guess Nayna rubbed off on her, what with all the time they spend together.Nayna: You there, young Horn Head.Apollo: Y-Yes?!Nayna: You're accusing me of slaying Minister Inga and channeling his spirit, yes? ...What an active imagination you have. Young folk are so wonderfully open-minded.Apollo: Ha ha ha. Thanks. (Just take the compliment, Justice.)Judge: ...Now, then. Will the witness please proceed with her testimony? This court wishes to know if you did or did not channel Minister Inga in his private quarters.Witness Testimony-- I'm No Spirit Medium, Sonny --Nayna: I was feeling under the weather yesterday, and decided to rest these weary bones. Besides which, a lowly servant such as I could not possibly be an honorable spirit medium. Only members of the royal family can learn the art of spirit channeling here in Khura'in. After Queen Amara's passing, Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran is the only spirit medium left. If you believe a medium to be the culprit, it would have to be that young lass Maya Fey.Ga'ran: And there you have it. It seems we have summoned her for nothing. Only those of the royal bloodline have the power of spirit channeling. That a servant such as Nayna could channel spirits is a most unamusing jest.Apollo: (On the surface, anyway. But our line of reasoning has led us to this end -- that Nayna channeled Inga's spirit.)Judge: All right, the defense may now question the witness.Cross-ExaminationCross-Examination-- I'm No Spirit Medium, Sonny --Nayna: I was feeling under the weather yesterday, and decided to rest these weary bones.Press Apollo: Apollo: Ahlbi's dog stole your hat when you were in the courtyard yesterday afternoon. Was it after that that you decided to take a rest? Nayna: I had been feeling unwell all day, and had pushed myself too hard. I kept feeling weak and dizzy, and that dirty mongrel only served to worsen my condition. Apollo: While I sympathize with you, Nayna... ...you took the whole day off without informing Princess Rayfa. She was very worried about you, you know. Nayna: How very kind of Her Benevolence. But she need not concern herself with the welfare of a mere servant such as I. Phoenix: Except, to Rayfa... ...Nayna's not just a \"mere servant.\" Nayna: To even think a mere commoner could channel spirits or slay a minister... What hogwash.Nayna: Besides which, a lowly servant such as I could not possibly be an honorable spirit medium.Press Apollo: Apollo: I hear you are the head servant. Isn't that right? Nayna: Are you suggesting that my position affords me the ability to channel spirits? Apollo: .........Since you're the head servant to a family of channelers, I'd say it's plausible. If you wanted to, it's not impossible for you to learn through exposure. Nayna: ...I think not. For that goes against the very underpinnings of the Kingdom of Khura'in. Ga'ran: To become a spirit medium requires a noble spirit and rigorous training. But most importantly, one must be a direct descendant of the founder. It is not simply some hobby one can take up in the manner of knitting or gardening. Apollo: So commoners could never become a medium, no matter how hard they tried? Nayna: That is common knowledge to all who are born and raised here, young Horn Head.Nayna: Only members of the royal family can learn the art of spirit channeling here in Khura'in.Press Apollo: Apollo: Okay, then... What if you actually have royal blood in your veins, Nayna? Like a distant relative or something? Nayna: I am from a line of humble fishermen, all the way back to my grandfather's grandfather. I've never heard talk of royal blood or noble ancestry. Phoenix: Apollo. If spirit channeling is a secret art passed down from mother to daughter... ...then even with a royal ancestor, it'd be impossible to learn without the right training. Ga'ran: It is as the Barbed One says. It also must be mentioned that this secret art... ...is only taught here in the Kingdom of Khura'in, and your country's Kurain Village. Apollo: (Why aren't things falling into place like I expected...?) Judge: I would ask the witness to continue her testimony.Nayna: After Queen Amara's passing, Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran is the only spirit medium left.Press Apollo: Apollo: ...Queen Amara was the victim of an assassination, right? Nayna: Yes. Oh, she was a beautiful, gentle soul. But she fell in love with a man of dubious origins... ...and was murdered in a terrible blaze. Fate can be so cruel. Apollo: (Except she's actually still alive.) Phoenix: Poor Nayna's yet another follower unwittingly praying over an empty sarcophagus. Apollo: (Amara -- the queen who's been locked away, and her existence in this world, erased. But the fact that she is still alive shackles Nahyuta to Ga'ran's will. Nahyuta... The only reason you're still standing there by that woman's side... ...is because you're afraid of what would happen to Amara otherwise... right?) Ga'ran: We need not recount such ancient history. Let us continue with the witness's testimony.Present Woman's Photo Apollo: Leads to: \"............\"Nayna: If you believe a medium to be the culprit, it would have to be that young lass Maya Fey.Press Apollo: Apollo: Ms. Fey was being held hostage. She was completely tied up, and didn't even know Minister Inga's true name... ...making it impossible for her to kill or channel him! Nayna: Bah, I know nothing of that. Ga'ran: Ga'ran: Listen, you horned devil. Were you not just insisting that it was Maya Fey who had channeled Minister Inga? My, how quickly you change your tune. Apollo: No, I'm just quick on my feet when new information presents itself. (I'm also quick to force my biggest smile when times like these demand it.) Phoenix: It's great that you're following my advice, Apollo... ...but try not to LOOK so forced while you do, would you?Phoenix: Nayna is right about one thing, though. Only those of the royal bloodline can be spirit mediums in Khura'in. Common folk like us are out of luck.Apollo: Yeah, I guess so. (Still... ...I think I'll finally be close to connecting all the dots, once I point one very big thing out.)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Trucy Wright\nDescription: A particular set of circumstances led to her being adopted by Mr. Wright.

    "cot": "Evidence 24 - Channeling Photo: A picture taken at around 2 PM of the channeling rite, showing Queen Ga'ran channeling a spirit.\n\nTestimony 2 - Nayna: \"Only members of the royal family can learn the art of spirit channeling here in Khura'in.\"\n\nThe contradiction here is that Nayna claims only members of the royal family can learn spirit channeling, implying spirit channeling is exclusive and secretive, while the existence of a photo taken by Ahlbi of Queen Ga'ran channeling a spirit is presented as a surprising or even forbidden act captured by a commoner, suggesting that spirit channeling is both rare and restricted. The contradiction is subtle but centers on the accessibility and awareness of spirit channeling outside the royal family. However, the biggest contradiction lies when Nayna denies any ability or participation in spirit channeling, while the photo (Evidence 24) implies that spirit channeling occurs and can be witnessed.\n\nThis pair is the most direct contradiction regarding who can channel spirits and the visibility/awareness of the practice.\n",

Rayfa actor: Aaah! Why me?! Dhurke actor: Mwahahahaha! It's time for a revolution! Rayfa actor: No! Let go of me! Plumed Punisher actor: That's far enough! Dhurke actor: Who's there?! Plumed Punisher actor: It is I-- The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm! Dhurke: Good people of Khura'in, we can't allow things to go on like this. The Defense Culpability Act has done nothing but produce countless victims of wrongful convictions. The time to act is now. For we, the Defiant Dragons, have obtained the ultimate weapon: the Founder's Orb! And to the Ga'ran regime: Make no mistake about it-- I will personally dethrone you! A dragon never yields. Nor will he rest until his revolution is complete. May 16, 11:00 AMWright Anything Agency TV: ...And this concludes our report on the recent television hijacking in Khura'in. But really, who could have anticipated a surprising turn of events? Trucy: Did you hear that, Polly? Someone hijacked the airwaves over there! It's like something out of a movie! Apollo: ......... Trucy: Apollo? Apollo: ......Um, yeah. Dhurke... What are you up to this time? Trucy: Wait a second... Do you know the TV hijacker or something, Apollo? Apollo: ......You could say that... but it was a long time ago. Trucy: ...And WHY do you know someone like that? I mean, they're calling him an \"insurgent.\" Apollo: Y-Yeah, about that... ???: Hey now. Is that any way to talk about the man who raised you? Apollo: Huh? Dhurke: Hey there, Apollo! Long time no see! How've you been, son? Apollo: I-I-It's-- Trucy: It's that guy that was on TV! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Guilty as charged! Surprised to see me, Apollo? I just beamed in from Khura'in, and boy are my arms tired! Apollo: Th-Th-This can't be happening! ...I must be dreaming... or hallucinating... or both... Trucy: No, you're not, Apollo! It's that TV hijacker-slash-insurgent in the flesh! Apollo: ........ (I'm so confused.) Trucy: Um! Mr. Hijacker! Sir! I have SO many questions, I don't even know where to begin! But let's start with that bit about \"the man who raised you.\" Dhurke: Wait, don't tell me you haven't told anyone about me, son? It's okay to brag about it. Tell everyone your old man's me, the rebel Dhurke! I mean, my face is all over TV these days! I'm practically a celebrity, hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: .........Trucy, what do you say we close up early today? Trucy: What?! Why?! Dhurke: ...Aw, come on, son. No need for the cold shoulder! Apollo: ......... (*sigh* I know I'm going to regret this, but...) What do you want, Dhurke? You just show up here without warning after all this time... What gives? Dhurke: I came all this way to see you, son! Come, rejoice! Apollo: Riiight... Why don't you tell me the real reason you're here. Dhurke: W-Well... Okay, so maybe there's a little something I need your help with, too, but... The fact is I came here to see you. That's the honest truth. Apollo: Yes, I think we've established that. (It figures... I haven't seen him in ten plus years and he's already asking for a favor. He really is a rebel in the purest sense -- he just does whatever he pleases.) Trucy: C'mon, Polly! I need details. Inquiring minds want to know! Apollo: Okay, okay. Hold your horses. First, I've got a few questions of my own. Examine Bookshelf Dhurke: Hm? Why, this is Apollo's journal. Apollo: Huh?! What's it doing at the office? Trucy: It's magic! Dhurke: Let's see what he wrote... Apollo: N-No, don't! Dhurke: Huh... There's nothing in here. Apollo: What? Trucy: This calls for a special spell! Presto diario! Dhurke: Why, there's writing appearing right before my very eyes! Trucy: Like I said, it's magic! Now go ahead, read to your heart's content! Apollo: Wow! ...Er, I mean, give me that! Charley the plant Apollo: That's Charley the houseplant. Dhurke: You know, my hideout used to have a houseplant, too. We called it \"Apollo.\" Trucy: I bet it was a cactus! Dhurke: How'd you guess? Trucy: Because Polly's hair's just as spiny! Apollo: Hey, leave my hair out of this. Trucy: And he has a prickly attitude, to boot! Apollo: (I better quit while I'm ahead.) Hula hoop Dhurke: More magic props... Oh! I've seen a ring like this before! I used to be quite good with these. Apollo: Really? Why don't you show us? Dhurke: Well, if you insist! I'll show you the act of daring-do I used to perform to supplement my income. First, I have to light the ring on fire, then I'll jump through it... Apollo: That's a fire hoop, this is a kid's toy, Dhurke... Magic props Dhurke: This is one seriously cluttered office. I mean, do you really need a piano here? Trucy: Well, it has sentimental value for Daddy, you see... Apollo: Yeah, but this office could use a little help with its bottom line. What if we sold it? Trucy: Apollo! ...You'd better give me a cut of the proceeds when you do. Dhurke: Money before memories, eh? This office's finances really must be in dire straits then. Magic split box Dhurke: This is one of those contraptions for cutting people into pieces! Trucy: How did you know that, Mr. Dhurke? Dhurke: Well, it just so happens I've been in one of these myself. Apollo: Really? Trucy: You have? Dhurke: Yes. Once, when I was being held prisoner by Minister Inga's secret police... ...they tried to torture me into revealing one of my compatriot's hideouts. Apollo: That's a torture device, this is a magic prop, Dhurke... Dhurke: Man, I barely escaped that thing alive! Trucy: Well, you have my respect as a magician for your death-defying spirit! Table Dhurke: What's with this bright red jacket? Who would wear such a garish thing? Trucy: Maybe one of our clients forgot it here. Dhurke: I'd love to get a look at the man who'd dare wear something like this! Trucy: Me, too! Apollo: (I know I don't wear it much, but... she has to know it's mine, right?) Talk Dhurke Dhurke: Pleased to meet you, little lady. My name is Dhurke Sahdmadhi. I'm a... well... a rebel by trade. Trucy: A rebel? But on TV, they were calling you an insurgent. So which is it? Personally, I vote for a rebel with a cause -- a real \"head\"-ache for anyone in your way! Apollo: Trucy...! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! You got me there. I'm the head of a resistance group. The Defiant Dragons. We're like the good, the bad, and the ugly... but without the good part. In Khura'in, I'm like the bogeyman -- a tall tale parents use to spook their kids straight! Trucy: That's too bad. You seem like you'd be a fun, cool guy to hang with! Dhurke: ...This little lady's a real catch, son. I'm talking bride material, if you get my drift. Apollo: Wait, what? Trucy: Oh! Stop it! You're embarrassing me... Dad. Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha. She's a plucky one, all right! Apollo: Someone pluck me out of my misery... Trucy: Now, about that \"man who raised you\" business... Foster father (appears after \"Dhurke\") Trucy: What did Mr. Dhurke mean when he said that he's \"the man who raised you,\" Apollo? Apollo: The truth is, I grew up in the Kingdom of Khura'in. Did I, uh... never mention that? Trucy: Oh, so you grew up in... Khura'in?! Wait, are you saying... ...you're not from around here, Polly? Apollo: No, it's just I was raised in Khura'in when I was really little. Trucy: Still, that's a shocker. It's like I hardly know anything about you! How come you never told me?! Dhurke: ...Apollo. You really haven't said a word about your past, have you? Apollo: What, that I was raised by a wanted criminal? It's like a bad joke. Trucy: It does sound rather melodramatic. I doubt anyone would even believe you. So you two haven't seen each other in a while, huh? Apollo: You could say that. I'd wager it's been at least ten years. Trucy: Wow... That's a really long time. Apollo: Yeah, well, I figured he'd forgotten about me. Dhurke: Not a chance! It's just, well... Starting a revolution takes time, and keeping it going even more so... And being a wanted man, I couldn't just hop a plane to come say hello. Apollo: ...I get it. It's fine. (Though, truth be told... ...it's weird having Dhurke suddenly show up acting all paternal. I'd even almost forgotten about Khura'in... No, that's not true. I probably tried to forget about it on purpose.) Trucy: Now then, Mr. Dhurke, what is it we can help you with? Request (appears after \"Foster father\") Dhurke: I need to get my hand on the Founder's Orb, the most sacred treasure of Khura'in. That's where you come in. Apollo: The Founder's Orb? Trucy: Wait, but didn't you say you already have it in that broadcast of yours? Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Don't go believing everything you see on TV, little lady. No one's seen hide nor hair of the Founder's Orb for some time. Trucy: No way! Apollo: S-So that was just a bluff...? What are you going to do if you DON'T find it? Dhurke: I don't know. Guess that just means we HAVE to find it, son. 'Cause I can't really back down now, can I? Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (*sigh* Different year, same old Dhurke. It's all coming back to me now.) Hold on. I think I read something about this in the newspaper a while back. Something about you stealing a sacred treasure from a temple's treasure room. Dhurke: That's a load of crock. We didn't lay a finger on the orb. Apollo: Really? Dhurke: Yes, Baseless allegations, all of it. Our enemy has really found a way to keep us all on our toes. Trucy: Ooh! So it's like a setup! Dhurke: That's the long and short of it. However, my compatriot has been hot on the orb's trail. And just the other day, his hard work finally paid off. We now know the Founder's Orb is in... Kurain Village. Apollo: Kurain Village? Dhurke: Yes. I hear there are spirit mediums there. They even have direct relations with Khura'in. Apollo: Spirit mediums... Right... Dhurke: Some doctor of archeology there supposedly has the orb. His name is Archie Buff. My Defiant Dragon compatriot has already made contact with him. Apparently, someone asked the doctor to study the orb. Apollo: So whoever asked him to do that is the real thief? Dhurke: Most likely. Apollo: And you think this guy will just hand the orb over to you? Dhurke: My compatriot, Datz, says Dr. Buff has already promised to do so. It seems he knew it was stolen, and wanted to do the right thing. Apollo: (Datz... I remember running around him when I was a kid.) (So he's here, too, huh.) Dhurke: Apollo, I want you to be present as my lawyer when I take possession of the orb. Would you do that for me? Fine Leads to: \".........Fine, but I'll charge my standard fee.\" Nope Apollo: I haven't seen you in years, and you waltz in here asking for a favor? You have a lot of nerve, you know-- Trucy: Of course we'll help! Right, Apollo?! Apollo: W-Wait, Trucy...! Trucy: Oh, come on. It's not like you have any work anyway. Besides, we're talking about rebels and legendary treasure here. It'll be fun! Apollo: (*sigh* Why is she always into the things I'm not?) Leads to: \".........Fine, but I'll charge my standard fee.\" Apollo: .........Fine, but I'll charge my standard fee. Now tell me about the Founder's Orb. The Founder's Orb (appears after \"Request\") Apollo: If I remember correctly, the founder is always depicted as a faceless spirit medium. Trucy: What do you mean \"faceless\"? Dhurke: Images of the founder, the Holy Mother of Khura'in, never show her face. To depict it is to commit the greatest taboo in Khura'inism. Apollo: The greatest taboo, huh? (I wonder why? I mean, what could she have looked like to make them hide her face like that? Dhurke: As for the Founder's Orb, it was discovered during an excavation eight years ago... ...and has an interesting legend that goes along with it. It's said that there's a riddle to the orb, and that any who can solve it... ...will receive immense spiritual power from the founder herself. Apollo: Sounds like one big fairy tale to me. Dhurke: In any case... ...it's just what us Defiant Dragons need to get our revolution started. With it, we can gain the spiritual power, and thus, the legal authority to rule Khura'in! Apollo: Wait, suppose I believe this legend. Then, anyone could become king or queen? And THAT'S why you think it'll help you overthrow the Gar'an regime? Dhurke: Only the rulers of Khura'in have ever laid eyes on the orb, Apollo. A legendary treasure that bestows immense spiritual power... Doesn't that sound like something you'd want to see with your own two eyes? Apollo: (...That does sound just a tiny bit intriguing.) Founder's Orb added to the Court Record. Dhurke: That should just about cover everything. Any other questions? Apollo: Not right now. Dhurke: Ah, I almost forgot. I brought you a present. Eat up, son! Apollo: ...Sushi? Dhurke: I figured you probably couldn't afford three square meals a day, so... Trucy: Yay! I was just thinking it was time for lunch! Dhurke: You dig in, too, little lady. After all, we're practically family, right?! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Trucy: Thanks, Dad! Ooh, that tuna looks good! *chomp* *nom nom nom* Dhurke: This salmon sushi's got my name on it! *chomp* *chew chew chew* Aren't you hungry, son? This is some of the best sushi you'll ever have! Apollo: .........I'm... I'm good. Dhurke: O-Oh, well... Okay then. ...Actually, I have one more present for you. Here. Apollo: What's this? Dhurke: A picture of your father. It's been twenty-three years since he passed away. Apollo: Huh?! This... This is my father? Dhurke: His name was Jove Justice. Apollo: Jove... Dhurke: I haven't talked to you about your real father in some time, but as you know... ...he was a musician -- a wandering minstrel, if you will -- and a talented one at that. Apollo: ............ Why... Why are you giving this to me now? Dhurke: I thought it was sad you didn't know what your old man looked like. I searched high and low to find that one picture. Apollo: ............ Trucy: What's wrong, Apollo? Don't you want it? Apollo: (I don't know. I mean, it's not like I ever met the guy.) Dhurke: Well, I went through all the trouble of finding it, so go on, take it! And don't ever let it go, you hear? Photo of My Father added to the Court Record. Dhurke: Well, now that our bellies are full, what do you say we hit the road? Apollo: One second. Hey, Trucy, any idea where Athena is? Trucy: She left early this morning to pick up Daddy from the airport. Apollo: Oh, I almost forgot. Mr. Wright is coming back today. Trucy: Yeah... but I wonder why he cut his trip short like that. Anyway, shouldn't they have been back by now? Apollo: Knowing Athena, she probably got lost. Well, there's no point sitting around here waiting. Let's get going. Trucy: I can't wait to see that super mysterious treasure! Dhurke: To Kurain Village, then! The Founder's Orb awaits! The Founder's Orb (subsequent times) Apollo: If I remember correctly, the founder is always depicted as a faceless spirit medium. Trucy: What do you mean \"faceless\"? Dhurke: Images of the founder, the Holy Mother of Khura'in, never show her face. To depict it is to commit the greatest taboo in Khura'inism. Apollo: The greatest taboo, huh? (I wonder why? I mean, what could she have looked like to make them hide her face like that? Dhurke: As for the Founder's Orb, it was discovered during an excavation eight years ago... ...and has an interesting legend that goes along with it. It's said that there's a riddle to the orb, and that any who can solve it... ...will receive immense spiritual power from the founder herself. Apollo: Sounds like one big fairy tale to me. Dhurke: In any case... ...it's just what us Defiant Dragons need to get our revolution started. With it, we can gain the spiritual power, and thus, the legal authority to rule Khura'in! Apollo: Wait, suppose I believe this legend. Then, anyone could become king or queen? And THAT'S why you think it'll help you overthrow the Gar'an regime? Dhurke: Only the rulers of Khura'in have ever laid eyes on the orb, Apollo. A legendary treasure that bestows immense spiritual power... Doesn't that sound like something you'd want to see with your own two eyes? Apollo: (...That does sound just a tiny bit intriguing.) Present Attorney's Badge Dhurke: What's that? Apollo: It's my attorney's badge. Dhurke: I can relate. I used to want to show mine off, too. But don't ever show it to anyone in Khura'in. They'll run you right out of town the moment they find out you're a lawyer. Apollo: I wonder how it went for Mr. Wright. Knowing him, he probably flashed his left and right... Founder's Orb Dhurke: The Founder's Orb... They say the Holy Mother will return when the riddle of the orb is solved. And she will bestow great spiritual power upon whoever accomplishes that feat. Apollo: (I wonder if I could channel spirits if I had such power.) Photo of My Father Dhurke: Brings back memories... He was a fine young man. So cheerful and fun to be around. His big, booming singing voice would captivate everyone in the tavern. But looks-wise, he was like a grownup version of you. Apollo: Um, that still doesn't give me a sense of what my real father was like. After clearing \"The Founder's Orb\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency: May 16Kurain Village Apollo: (So this is Kurain, the mystical village of spirit channeling... ... and where ancient traditions come alive. Looks like a really peaceful place.) Dhurke: Ahh, I love the air here! Nothing beats the mountains, huh, Apollo?! Apollo: (Come to think of it... We used to live way up in the mountains, too, just like this.) Dhurke: Sure brings back memories. Those were the days. The three of us living happily in peace. Trucy: ...I still can't wrap my mind around it all, you know. That Mr. Dhurke is not only Polly's daddy, but Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's as well. And the way you two talked about it like it was nothing the whole bus ride here! Apollo: (I guess it IS a lot to take in...) Trucy: So tell me, Mr. Dhurke, what was Apollo like as a kid? Dhurke: Oh, he was full of piss and vinegar, he was. A real rascal! He and Nahyuta used to run around in the open fields, naked as jaybirds. I've even got pictures of him posing in his birthday suit! Apollo: Whoa, whoa, Dhurke! Trucy: No way! Prosecutor Sahdmadhi used to be like that, too? Dhurke: The two of 'em would end up with leeches on their butts and cry like babies, hah-ha ha! Apollo: Dhurke! Don't you think you've said enough?! Dhurke: Aw, you're no fun. Trucy: Yeah! I wanted to hear more about the misadventures of Polly! ???: Hey, what are you people doing here? Apollo: Ema? Dhurke: You know this lady, son? Apollo: Yeah, this is Ema Skye. She's a detective. Ema: Technically speaking, I'm a forensics expert, but I'll let it slide. ...Anyway, I can't say I'm surprised to see you here. You always seem to pop up whenever there's trouble afoot. Still, what are the odds of running into you here in the boonies? Apollo: By \"trouble,\" you mean you're investigating a case? Ema: Does it look like I'm here to sightsee? .........Wait, don't tell me... You're not here to see Dr. Buff, are you? Apollo: Huh? How'd you know that? We're actually on our way to meet with him right now. Ema: Figures... Well, follow me. I'll show you the way. Apollo: ...Really? Dhurke: Don't look a gift horse in the mouth, son. Just follow the nice lady. Examine Phone booth Apollo: (A phone booth and a bus stop made of wood. They both look really old. You hardly ever see phone booths in the city anymore.) Dhurke: Apollo... what's this glass box for? Apollo: (I guess you hardly see them in Khura'in, too.) Kurain Boulder Apollo: There's a big boulder towering into the sky over there. According to the sign, it's called the \"Kurain Boulder.\" It also says that a spirit dwells within it. Hmm... A rock with a spirit in it? Dhurke: It's called animism -- the belief that spirits dwell within inanimate objects. They've probably enshrined this boulder as a sacred object. Their tradition of worshiping such objects is similar to our tradition in Khura'in. Apollo: I-Interesting... (Who knew Dhurke could make sense every once in a while?) Mountains Dhurke: Seeing those mountains really takes me back. I remember when we used to live high in the mountains to escape from the government. Apollo: So, you don't live there anymore? Dhurke: Nope. I needed a more convenient place to lead the revolution from. But that old mountain hut is still there. Apollo: (Man, I miss that hut...) Dhurke: What, are you getting homesick, Apollo? You can come on back to Khura'in anytime, you know? Apollo: N-No, no, I'm fine. Besides, I've got a lot on my plate here... Fey Manor Apollo: A thatched roof... First time I've ever seen one in real life. Dhurke: It looks just like the traditional thatched roofs they use in Japan. All we need now are some samurai with topknots, a few ninjas, and a cuddly mascot. Apollo: When was the last time you were in Japan? Talk Any ideas? Dhurke: Mass transit and electronic communications... This country's infrastructure is really advanced compared to Khura'in. Apollo: Why don't you see the sights once you have the orb? Dhurke: Well... I guess I could use a break. How about you show me around? Apollo: ...Oh, um, I'll probably be busy with work, so, uh... Dhurke: ...I-I see. Trucy: What are you talking about, Polly? Your only work right now is cleaning the office. What to do Dhurke: The Founder's Orb should be with the doctor right now. What do you say we go take a gander? Apollo: What if he doesn't have it? What if you came all the way from Khura'in for nothing? Dhurke: I'll cross that bridge if and when I come to it. Besides... even if I leave empty-handed, at least I got to see you, son. Apollo: ...Oh, ha ha. Thanks? Dhurke: N-No, no -- I really mean it. May 16Kurain Village - Doctor's Study Apollo: So this is Dr. Buff's study... Trucy: Wow, look at all those books! The shelves go from floor to ceiling! It's like a library in here! Dhurke: Yes, and lots of artifacts, too. A true archeologist's paradise. Look, son! There are so many relics, they're spilling onto the floor! What a delightfully amusing room! Apollo: All I see is a mess. (And what's with that white outline...?) ...Um, Ema, where's the doctor? Ema: Well the thing is... he died last night. Apollo: Wait, what? Ema: It seems an avalanche of books knocked him off his bookshelf ladder. We're labeling it an accidental death. Apollo: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Please tell me you're joking... Ema: As if I'd come all the way out here for a few laughs, Apollo. Apollo: ...Yeah, I guess not. Dhurke: A scholar killed by his own books... Apollo: Oh man. What do we do now? I mean, how can he transfer ownership of the orb to you if he's dead? Dhurke: Yes, that is a problem. Apollo: Ema, can you please tell us exactly what happened? Examine Ema: What do you think you're doing? You can't just poke around without my permission. Apollo: (Guess I should ask her what's going on first.) Talk The doctor's death Apollo: So the doctor died in an accident? Ema: I received a call this morning saying Dr. Buff had been found dead under a pile of books. Apollo: This morning? (Talk about bad timing...) You mentioned that he had fallen off a ladder. Ema: Right. We believe he fell from the top of that big ladder there. Apparently, he triggered an avalanche of books while fumbling to reach one. And that sent him headlong on a fatal fall onto the hard floor. Trucy: How sad... Killed by his own books. But at least he was doing something he loved. Dhurke: For a scholar, I suppose it's kind of like a soldier killed in the line of duty. You could say he died an honorable death. Apollo: Ema, who was the first one to discover the body? Ema: About that... Whoever it was, it seems they wanted to remain anonymous. Apollo: What? Ema: It happens now and then. Some people would rather not get involved with the police. Dhurke: I can relate to that. Apollo: (Yeah, being a wanted man and all.) What now, Dhurke? A dead man can't exactly hand over the orb. Dhurke: We'll just have to find it. It must be around here somewhere. Apollo: Just to fill you in, Ema, we're actually here to get something. The Founder's Orb (appears after \"The doctor's death\") Apollo: Pops here had an agreement with the doctor. The doctor was supposed to hand over a sacred relic known as the Founder's Orb. Dhurke: \"P-Pops\"...? Ema: Oh, I see. That could be a problem, considering he's dead. Do you have a plan B? Apollo: Umm... Dhurke: I have an agreement in writing. My compatriot Datz should have it. Ema: Well, there shouldn't be any problems, then. So, who IS this gentleman you're escorting? Dhurke (appears after \"The Founder's Orb\") Leads to: \"Oh, right, I haven't introduced you yet. This is Dhurke. He's from the Kingdom of Khura'in.\" Present Attorney's Badge Ema: Your attorney's badge? Huh... Apollo: What, that normally gets a better reaction from you. Ema: I'm tired of collecting your fingerprints. It's kind of lost its luster. Apollo: Yeah, but who knows? There could be other people's prints on it. Ema: Ooh, that's true! Hand it over, buddy! Apollo: Ah! Ema: ............Hmph. The only prints I found were yours. Apollo: (Argh, it's all dusty now.) Founder's Orb Ema: Scientifically speaking, ancient relics are highly fascinating. Apollo: Why's that? Ema: Because of all the tests I can run. CT scans, electron microscopy, chemical analysis... The list goes on and on! If you ever do find one, you'd better bring it to me straight away! Apollo: Can I count on getting it back intact? Ema: We'll see. Scientific advances don't come without sacrifices, you know. Apollo: (...I know someone who WON'T be seeing the orb anytime soon.) Anything else Ema: You sure like to shove things in people's faces, don't you? Apollo: What about you? You're always dusting around for prints. Ema: That's my job! Apollo: Well, it's not like I'm presenting evidence for the fun of it, either. Ema: Really? Because it sure seems like you enjoy it, Apollo. Apollo: Right back at you, Ema. Apollo: Oh, right, I haven't introduced you yet. This is Dhurke. He's from the Kingdom of Khura'in. Ema: All the way from Khura'in, huh? So, what do you do there? Dhurke: I used to practice law, but I'm taking a break from all that. I'm focused now on making Khura'in a better place through... volunteer work. Ema: Volunteer work, huh? How interesting... Apollo: (...Well, it's not technically a lie.) Ema: So, how do you two know each other? Apollo: Oh, um... He's sorta my foster father. Ema: Come again? Trucy: Yeah! And he's Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's real father, too! Ema: Whaaat?! You mean you... and Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... ............I'm so sorry. It seems you've had quite a life. Apollo: (...Guess she's put a few things together.) Ema: Actually, Dhurke, you look kind of... familiar. Have we met before? Dhurke: Um, not that I recall. Apollo: (Great... She must've seen that news report on TV. It will really complicate things if she figures out he's a wanted man.) There are lots of guys who look like him. Sure you're not mistaking him for someone else? Ema: Are there, really? I mean, a middle-aged man with long hair and an eye patch? You don't see that every day. Apollo: W-Well, I'm sure you're just imagining things. Ema: So what does that sacred relic you're searching for look like? I mean, there's lots of stuff in here that's old and relic-y. Dhurke: Indeed. Unfortunately, I've no idea what it actually looks like. Apollo: So then, how are we supposed to find it? Dhurke: That, I do not know, either. We'll just have to go through each candidate one by one. Apollo: Great plan of attack there, Dhurke. Well, Ema, do you mind if we give this room a once-over? Ema: ...I guess not. But in exchange, you're going to help me in my investigation. Apollo: Sure. It can't hurt. Trucy: Ooh, I can't wait to get started! It'll be like hunting for buried treasure! Examine Body outline or pile of books Apollo: So this is where Dr. Buff died. Ema: Poor man... He fell right on his head, and probably died almost instantly. Apollo: I see some blood on the book there, but what's that dark stain? Ema: It appears to be coffee. It's still damp, so it must have gotten on there recently, perhaps even last night. Dhurke: That's a mighty big window he's next to -- big enough for someone to see inside. Ema: Exactly. That's how the local resident who reported his death found him to begin with. The doctor's body was visible from outside the window. And a passerby called in earlier this morning to report what they'd found. Apollo: So you mean this case is still only a few hours old? Dhurke: That explains why your investigation is just getting underway. Study Photo added to the Court Record. Study Diagram added to the Court Record. Body outline or pile of books (subsequent times) Apollo: So this is where Dr. Buff died. Dhurke: Yeah, the police received a call this morning... ...so their investigation is still just getting started. Glasses Apollo: There's a pair of glasses on this little pyramid here. Ema: They belonged to the doctor. Scientifically speaking, they appear to be your ordinary run-of-the-mill glasses. Trucy: I guess they don't pique her interest, scientifically speaking. Computer Apollo: This PC is password protected. Trucy, you think your magic can do something about this? Trucy: Hmm... I don't think it can override a password. Now, a locked desk... That I can get into. Like yours back at the office, Polly! Apollo: (Yikes... I'd better watch what I put in there.) Trucy: What? Do you put weird stuff in your desk? Stuff you don't want anyone to see? Apollo: Jeez, are you a mind reader, too? Trucy: No, but unlocking your thoughts is a cinch! Ladder or bookshelves Apollo: The doctor fell from the top of that ladder. Dhurke: Hmm... From that height, a fall onto a hard surface would probably kill anyone. Apollo: I don't know why anyone would want to climb that high in the first place. Trucy: Guess you can say he climbed it all the way to heaven... Raincoat Apollo: It's a two-tone raincoat. Dhurke: It's still a bit damp. I think someone might've worn it recently. Shoe shelves Apollo: There are a few pairs of shoes here. I guess there must be an entrance on this floor, too. Ema: Yeah, there's a backdoor over that way. But it's usually locked from what I can tell. The visitor's entrance is up that spiral staircase. Apollo: (That's the way we came in.) Geoglyph Apollo: There are animal drawings on the floor. They look like those famous geoglyph things. Dhurke: They remind me of the chalk outlines detectives draw around bodies. And the doctor's has [sic] just joined them. Now that's what I call dedication to one's field. Apollo: I don't think it was on purpose. Window Apollo: What a huge window. I bet you could see the entire study from the outside. Dhurke: How could he concentrate in here? I'd feel so exposed. Apollo: Well... He does have a bookshelf positioned for some privacy around his desk. Mechanical statue Dhurke: There's some sort of machinery inside this clay figure. Apollo: Whoa, it's moving! EX-TER-MI-NATE. EX-TER-MI-NATE. DES-TROY ALL TAR-GETS. EX-T-T-TERRRrrr... *scrape* *grind* Apollo: D-Do I even want to know what that thing is for?! Notebook Apollo: Look, it's one of the doctor's notebooks. Dhurke: Maybe there's something about the orb in there. It's a photo of the treasure box! The one from Tehm'pul Temple's treasure room. These must be his research notes on the Founder's Orb. Apollo: What's that on the right page? It looks like a poem or something. Dhurke: Let's see... Oh, it's the song that's performed during the Dance of Devotion. It's been sung during Khura'inese rites of offering since ancient times. Apollo: Oh, I think I've heard of that. Dhurke: There's also a legend associated with the song. Some say the solution to the orb's riddle is contained therein. Apollo: It's a song everyone in Khura'in knows? Not much of a way to keep it secret. Trucy: It's called \"hiding secrets in plain sight,\" Polly. Us magicians know all about that. Dhurke: Huh. That's strange. Apollo: What is? Dhurke: Dr. Buff's notes contain the second half of the song. Only the first half is sung during the Dance of Devotion. Most people haven't even heard the second half. Apollo: The second half? As in the part that begins, \"Offer thy prayers\"? Dhurke: I'm impressed. That's some thorough research he was conducting. Research Notes added to the Court Record. Model plane Apollo: Is this a bird? Dhurke: It looks like an airplane to me. Apollo: No, there couldn't have been any planes back when this was made. Dhurke: Yes, but it has wings and both horizontal and vertical stabilizers. That makes it an airplane. Apollo: No, it's definitely a bird. Dhurke: Open your eyes, son... As a lawyer, your job is to see the true nature of things. Apollo: (I still say it's a bird.) Misty Fey scroll Apollo: There's a brown stain on this scroll. Hm? Why does it smell like... gravy? Dhurke: Why would there be a gravy stain on it? Apollo: Who knows? But it looks like it's meant to be there. Dhurke: Maybe the artist was trying to inspire a \"gravy\" new trend: food splatter art. Apollo: That pun wounded me \"gravy-ly,\" Dhurke. Coffee machine Apollo: A coffeemaker and a bunch of coffee cups... He must've taken his coffee breaks here. Oh, and there's a filter with old coffee grounds in here. *sigh* Guess I'd better clean this up. Dhurke: What are you doing there, son? Apollo: Ah! (What AM I doing, cleaning this office?!) Dhurke: Don't tell me they have you on coffee duty back at your office. Apollo: N-No, no... It's just, if I don't keep the place clean, no one will. Ami Fey statue Apollo: It's a golden statue. Looks pretty old, too. Dhurke: Hmm... I imagine it has great archeological value... Maybe too great for a private researcher of Dr. Buff's caliber. Apollo: I wonder how he got his hands on something like this. Sacred Urn Apollo: \"Ami\"... Hmm... Why's someone's name written on here? Trucy: Maybe it's so if it ever got lost, someone could return it to its owner. You know, like how school kids put their names on things. Apollo: Yeah, but this is just an urn. And the name is written so big. Trucy: Well, I wrote my name on my magic panties. It says W-R-I-G-H-T in super big letters! Apollo: (The less said about this, the better.) Spiral staircase Apollo: It's a spiral staircase... And it's connected to a hallway up there. Why'd they have to place the second floor so high up? Ema: Wait... You're not afraid of heights, are you? Apollo: Oh, um... Well... Trucy: Oh, Polly's hilarious around high places. He gets all wobbly, like a baby deer taking its first steps. And his face turns as green as a watermelon. Apollo: It's not nice to make fun of people's phobias, you know. Dhurke: Come to think of it, the visitor's entrance is on the second floor. What an odd layout for a house... Wall relief Apollo: What a huge wall relief. Hmm... It seems to depict a spirit channeling. Dhurke: Hey... this spirit medium looks like the Holy Mother of Khura'in. Apollo: Yeah, her face was left blank, but the rest is clearly detailed and well-crafted. Dhurke: Did you know some researchers claim that the Holy Mother had three eyes? And that her third eye was able to divine the truth, just like the gods above. It is said to be on her forehead. Apollo: Like you said, you shouldn't believe everything you hear. Suitcase Apollo: That's one big suitcase. Dhurke: It's locked. Is it the doctor's? Ema: No, someone left it here last night. Apollo: So the doctor might've had a visitor? But how can you tell? Ema: That sticker there. You only see those on airport luggage. Which means, its owner is likely from overseas. Dhurke: Is there any way to figure out who it belongs to? Apollo: Not unless we can open it to see what's inside. Dhurke: Guess not... ???: Heh heh heh. Ah-ha ha ha! Ema: That's because you're not me: Ema Skye, forensics expert extraordinaire! Try as you might, you won't find the word \"impossible\" in my forensics handbook! Dhurke: I-Is she okay, son? It's like she became an entirely different person. Apollo: Oh, that's just what happens when her forensics switch gets flipped. Ema: With this, identifying the suitcase's owner will be easy as pie! Apollo: Is that fingerprint powder? Ema: That's right. And there's no better time than the present to use it! Here we go! You remember how to do this, right? Apollo: I apply the powder to where I think some prints might be, and blow any excess off? Ema: Exactly. Well, have at it! Apollo: (Hmm... Now where would I expect to find prints on a suitcase?) Examine any fingerprint on stickers closest to keyhole Leads to: \"Hey Ema, I've got a pretty clear print here.\" Examine any fingerprint on handle Ema: This one isn't clear enough for a match. Apollo: Hmm... Where else could someone leave prints behind? Dhurke: Think, son. How might someone handle a suitcase? Start by considering what you do with them. Apollo: Well, besides being wheeled or carried, they can be opened and closed. So, I should look for prints that would be left at those times. Examine any incomplete fingerprint Ema: You'll need to use more powder than that to get a clear print. Examine excess powder Ema: There's still too much powder left. Try blowing some more off. Apollo: Hey Ema, I've got a pretty clear print here. Ema: Okay, now let me know who you think it could belong to. Apollo: (Hmm, who could it be? It would have to be someone who would've paid Dr. Buff a visit.) Compare Datz Are'bal profile Analyzing...Analysis CompleteMatch Found Leads to: \"We have a match!\" Compare anyone else Analyzing...No Match Found Ema: We didn't get a match. Trucy: Any other ideas, Apollo? Apollo: Hmm... Well, we can probably assume the print belongs to the suitcase's owner. (But who could that be? It would have to be someone who would've visited the doctor.) Leads back to profile selection Ema: We have a match! Apollo: Datz... Come to think of it, he did stop by to see the doctor, didn't he? To conclude the orb transfer agreement. Dhurke: So he's the one who forgot his suitcase here. Apollo: Where do you suppose he is now? Dhurke: Haven't heard from him in a while, and he's not answering his phone. Trucy: Wait, you don't think he left his phone inside his suitcase, do you? Dhurke: I wouldn't put it past that knucklehead. Ema: Actually, I think we may have run into him earlier. Apollo: Really? Ema: A suspicious man had been reported in the area, but when one of my officers approached to question him, he took off like a shot. Apollo: What?! Dhurke: Sorry about that. Khura'inese people aren't all like him... I swear. Ema: Well, he's probably still in the village somewhere. Apollo: Maybe he knows something about the orb. Suitcase (subsequent times) Apollo: So this suitcase belongs to Datz. Dhurke: How could he leave something so big behind? Apollo: Because, you know... it's Datz. Talk Dhurke Apollo: Oh, right, I haven't introduced you yet. This is Dhurke. He's from the Kingdom of Khura'in. Ema: All the way from Khura'in, huh? So, what do you do there? Dhurke: I used to practice law, but I'm taking a break from all that. I'm focused now on making Khura'in a better place through... volunteer work. Ema: Volunteer work, huh? How interesting... Apollo: (...Well, it's not technically a lie.) Ema: So, how do you two know each other? Apollo: Oh, um... He's sorta my foster father. Ema: Come again? Trucy: Yeah! And he's Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's real father, too! Ema: Whaaat?! You mean you... and Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... ............I'm so sorry. It seems you've had quite a life. Apollo: (...Guess she's put a few things together.) Ema: Actually, Dhurke, you look kind of... familiar. Have we met before? Dhurke: Um, not that I recall. Apollo: (Great... She must've seen that news report on TV. It will really complicate things if she figures out he's a wanted man.) There are lots of guys who look like him. Sure you're not mistaking him for someone else? Ema: Are there, really? I mean, a middle-aged man with long hair and an eye patch? You don't see that every day. Apollo: W-Well, I'm sure you're just imagining things. Present Study Photo Ema: Maybe it was Dr. Buff's wish to die under a pile of his beloved books. I know I could die happily under a big pile of forensic equipment. Apollo: Well, I'll pass on dying under a big pile of evidence from my past cases. It's all murder weapons and photos of dead bodies. Ema: So, what? Are you saying you don't love your job? Apollo: Being buried in the tools of one's trade is hardly a valid way to assess dedication, Ema. After examining body outline or pile of books, ladder or bookshelves, notebook, Sacred Urn, spiral staircase, and suitcase: Dhurke: It seems the orb isn't here. Apollo: That means Datz might be our only lead at this point. Dhurke: Detective Skye said he might still be here in the village. We should try to find him. May 16Kurain Village ???: Good day to you, citizens of Kurain Village! My name is Paul Atishon, and I want your vote! Apollo: Wow, that's REALLY loud. Trucy: Look, something's coming this way. ???: Paul Atishon, savior of Kurain, has come to-- Ahhh! It's you people! Dhurke: Apollo? What is that strange conveyance coming this way? Staff: Right, left, right, left, HALT! Apollo: (It's one of those... what-do-you-call-'ems? Palanquins...?) ???: So, you finally left Dr. Buff's house! What were you doing there?! ...What a bunch of shady-looking characters. Apollo: (And you aren't?) So I take it you knew the doctor? ???: Heh, what a foolish question. I've memorized the names and faces of the entire electorate here in Kurain. After all, I am the man who's destined to be king of this fine nation someday. Apollo: Um... who are you? (And what do you mean, \"king\"?) Atishon: Ignorant fools. I am THE Paul Atishon. I am a soon-to-be eminent politician -- a man whose name will go down in history. You should be ashamed that you've never heard of me before. Dhurke: Is he really that famous of a politician, Apollo? Apollo: Not that I know of. Atishon: I'm running for a seat on the local council right now. Apollo: (I guess even Jerk Q. Public has to start somewhere.) Atishon: But my election is a sure thing, I'm told. After all, my grandfather was a famous politician with untold influence. In short, I'm the chosen one, the golden boy, the powerhouse of politics! Trucy: ...And rider-of-his-grandfather's-coattails. Atishon: Heh heh heh. Are you blinded by my majesty? Go ahead! Bask in the resplendent glory that is me, the chosen one! Apollo: Um... Sure... Atishon: ...Ah! A pleasant day to you, good people of Kurain! I am Paul Atishon! It's time to reclaim the glory of Kurain, together! A convenience store on every corner, a karaoke bar in every home! A vote for Paul Atishon is a vote for a happier, hopey-er Kurain Village! Old Man: Turn off that infernal racket, you fool! You're a stain on your grandfather's good name! Atishon: Thank you, good sir! Your support is appreciated, as always! Trucy: I guess he's one of those people who only hears what they want to hear. Apollo: ...In other words, he's a model politician. Atishon: Now where was I? Oh right, you were in the doctor's house. Just what in the world were you doing in there? Hmm? Talk Paul Atishon Apollo: Is this what you ride around in when you're campaigning? Atishon: That's right. It's perfect for the narrow roads and steep hills here in this village. It has a top speed of five miles per hour, but it suffers from serious reliability issues. (Changed from [It has a top speed of 5 miles per hour, but it suffers from serious reliability issues.] in the original release) Namely, these imbeciles tire out too quickly. Staff: *cough* *huff, puff* We'll try harder next time, sir! Apollo: (Poor guys... They're exhausted and covered in sweat.) Atishon: The Atishon family has been in politics for generations, even back in the old country. Apollo: Really? Atishon: My grandfather, Abe Atishon, was a prominent member of Congress. And he was born right here in Kurain. There isn't a person here who hasn't heard of him. Apollo: (All I asked about was his palanquin.) Atishon: You must've heard of the Atishons. I'm even reviving our old country campaigning style. Apollo: ...Oh, um... politics aren't really my thing. Trucy? Trucy: I don't recall ever reading about them at school. Atishon: Feh... Young people today. You people really need to pay more attention to politics. The doctor's house Atishon: So, what business did you people have at Dr. Buff's house? Apollo: He was going to transfer ownership of the Founder's Orb to us. It's a sacred relic from the Kingdom of Khura'in. Atishon: The Founder's Orb? So you tried to get your hands on it, did you? Apollo: Wait, what do you know about the orb? Atishon: Heh. I know that it's mine, that's what. Apollo: How do you figure that? Atishon: Because I know it's not the Founder's Orb. Its real name is the Crystal of Ami Fey. Apollo: The Crystal of Ami Fey? Atishon: That's right. It's been passed down for generations in the Atishon family. Until it was stolen, that is. But just when I had zeroed in on the culprit... ...the doctor hid it away and then kicked the bucket. Apollo: So you're saying Dr. Buff stole your family heirloom? (That's not what Dhurke said. Strange...) But I've been told the doctor himself said that... ...he had the \"Founder's Orb.\" Atishon: It's all that weird foreigner's doing! He filled the doctor's head with nonsense! Nonsense like the Crystal of Ami Fey being the Founder's Orb. Apollo: \"Weird foreigner\"? (Could he mean...?) Is this the foreigner you're talking about? Present Datz Are'bal profile Apollo: Atishon: Yes, that's him! Apollo: I thought so. (Now we really have to find Datz.) Leads back to Talk options Present anyone else Apollo: Atishon: Who's that? Wait, I know everyone around here, so this must be a new eligible voter for me! Apollo: Yes, wouldn't that be nice. (Because I certainly wouldn't vote for you. It seems this isn't the person he's talking about. But I can't imagine the doctor had contact with that many foreigners way out here.) Leads back to Talk options Datz (appears after presenting Datz Are'bal profile upon selecting \"The doctor's house\" Talk option) Dhurke: Do you know where this man is now? Atishon: I imagine he's at the Detention Center by now. I called the authorities after I found him hiding in my dog's doghouse. Apollo: Whaaat?! Dhurke: That buffoon... Apollo: Well, at least we know where he is now. Dhurke: Let's head over to the Detention Center and see what he knows about the Founder's Orb. Atishon: So, you really are after my crystal. Apollo: No, we're looking for the Founder's Orb, and we have an agreement to prove it. Atishon: Well, just so you know, you're not going to lay a finger on it. It's mine. And I intend to give it to my benefactor. Apollo: Your... benefactor? Your benefactor (appears after \"Datz\") Athison: My benefactor is ready to support my rise to the pinnacle of the political world. They have immense influence here, you see, and I intend to harness that influence. Apollo: So you're just going to give your family heirloom away to this person? Atishon: That's right. It's a purely political decision. Apollo: And in exchange, your patron will get the people of Kurain to vote for you? Atishon: Heh heh heh. Eminent politicians are skilled at leveraging all of their connections. Apollo: ......... (Isn't it illegal to buy votes?) Well, good luck with that, I guess. Atishon: Heh, you just wait. Paul Atishon will reign supreme someday. Present Attorney's Badge Apollo: Actually, I'm a lawyer. Atishon: Heh heh heh. You're so shallow. Relying on your badge to impress people... What would you be without it? I petty men like you have no sense of self. Real men make their own mark in this world. Apollo: (Says the man who's riding on his grandfather's coattails.) Anything else Apollo: What do you think about this? Atishon: Paul Atishon is the \"squeaky-clean candidate.\" So if you're going to bribe me, try to be a little more subtle about it, would you? Apollo: Huh? I wasn't trying to bribe you. Atishon: \"Don't accept any bribes unless they come in unmarked bills.\" This is but a fraction of the political wisdom my grandfather shared with me. Better luck next time. Apollo: (After a spin cycle or two with those bills, I bet I'D be \"squeaky-clean,\" too.) Wright Anything Agency (after examining body outline or pile of books, ladder or bookshelves, notebook, Sacred Urn, spiral staircase, and suitcase in Kurain Village - Doctor's Study, then visiting Kurain Village) Talk Any ideas? Dhurke: About that Paul Atishon fellow... He's aiming to be a councilman and beyond, as his famous grandfather once was, right? No doubt some would vote for him on the merits of his grandfather's achievements. I see a grim future for Kurain Village if someone like that is able to climb the ranks. Apollo: I wouldn't worry about it. Who in their right mind would vote for him with the way he's campaigning? Dhurke: So the more aggressively he campaigns, the less people will want to vote for him? That makes me want to get out there and help him fail. What to do Apollo: We turned the doctor's study upside down, but never found the orb. Dhurke: Yeah, I didn't expect this to be so hard. Trucy: Well, I think it's fun. It's like a big old treasure hunt! Dhurke: That orb is the key to Khura'in's future, you know. Trucy: Yeah, and our office's future, too! Apollo: (She does realize it's not up for sale, right?) Present Anything else Dhurke: Ah, the old show-'em-and-see-what-they-say tactic. I used to try that whenever I had nothing else to say. Apollo: Who says I have nothing else to say? Dhurke: It's written all over your face. Apollo: Like you have anything to add right now. After clearing all Talk options with Paul Atishon in Kurain Village: May 16Detention Center - Visitor's Room Datz: ......... Dhurke: .........Hey. Datz: Yipes! Apollo: What's he doing under the desk...? Datz: Foul cogs of the corrupt regime! I've nothing to say to you! Dhurke: Datz, it's me, Dhurke. Datz: Oh! Dhurke! You're a sight for sore eyes! I knew you'd come save me! Dhurke: Well, this is another fine mess you've gotten yourself into. Datz: Har har har har har! My bad, my bad! 'Least the grub here's pretty good compared to that prison back home! Ya get three squares plus a place to sleep! Why don't ya join me, Dhurke?! Dhurke: No thanks. They'd just send me back to Khura'in where I'd face immediate execution. Datz: Yeah, I guess that wouldn't be such a good idea. Apollo: (Looks like he's still the same, too.) ...Long time no see, Datz. Datz: Huh? Hey, ya look... kinda familiar... A-A-A-Apollo?! Is it really you, m'boy?! A-to-the-J, all grown up and whatnot! How've ya been?! Apollo: Fine. And you, Datz? You look good, besides the incarceration and all. Datz: ...Pffffff! Haaaaar har har har har! Those horns, AJ! Apollo: Horns? Datz: They've grown up with ya, just like a stag's antlers! I can't take it! Apollo: *sigh* You really haven't changed a bit. Anyway, there's something we needed to talk to you about. Datz: Sure, pull up a chair. I've got all the time in the world. The slammer's like my second home. It's really not so bad once ya get used to it. Trucy: He's rather laid back for someone in police custody. Talk About the orb Apollo: Datz, was what the doctor had really the Founder's Orb? Datz: Absolutely positively! The doc was sure of it! Dhurke: Really? Because someone from the village is calling the Crystal of Ami Fey. He also claims you were filling the doctor's head with lies. Datz: That ain't true! The doc said he was sure it was the real deal. All his fancy research confirmed it was the Founder's Orb. Apollo: So then that Paul Atishon character was lying? Imagine that, a politician who lies... Datz: I bet he wants the orb all to himself! Trucy: Hmm... I wonder who's telling the truth? Datz: Well, take a look at this! It proves the doc believed he had the Founder's Orb! Dhurke: Let me see that. \"I agree to hand over the Founder's Orb to the Defiant Dragons... ...if I will come to no harm.\" Signed, Dr. Archie Buff. Datz: See, I got it all down in writing! Dhurke: But Datz... ...why does it say, \"if I will come to no harm\" at the end here? Trucy: Sounds like he was scared of you. Apollo: Datz, did you threaten the doctor in any way? Datz: No, ya got it all wrong! It was the doc's friend! HE told the old man us rebels were dangerous. It's his fault the doc thought I might hurt him! Apollo: Sounds like the work of that politician. He's really made a mess of things. Orb Transfer Agreement added to the Court Record. About the orb (subsequent times) Apollo: Datz, was what the doctor had really the Founder's Orb? Datz: Absolutely positively! The doc was sure of it! Dhurke: Really? Because someone from the village is calling the Crystal of Ami Fey. He also claims you were filling the doctor's head with lies.

He's really made a mess of things. Reason for arrest Dhurke: What have you done now, Datz? Datz: Nothing! I'm innocent, I tell ya! It all started when this dog-faced cop tried to question me! He looked so funny, I started laughing at him. That's when they came after me. But it was hilarious, I tell ya! I mean, a human police dog? How funny is that! Apollo: Right... So what happened after that? Datz: They caught me hiding in a doghouse. Dang pooch ratted me out! I guess that's what I get for laughing at one of his doggy comrades. Apollo: Sounds like the dogs got the last laugh. Dhurke: Datz, weren't you cleared of those jailbreak charges? And your capture by Lady Kee'ra deemed unlawful? Datz: Yeah, but... The cops here don't seem to like me anyway. Apollo: What are the charges this time? Datz: Unauthorized entry, or something like that. They think I'm an illegal alien! And I can't prove otherwise 'cause I lost my passport! Trucy: Is there any way they'd let you go? Datz: Not without my passport... If only I had it! Dhurke, AJ! You gotta find my passport! Apollo: ...All right, we'll find it. (One more thing to add to our to-do list. Now, where might Datz's passport be?) Examine Security camera Apollo: I hate the feeling of being constantly watched. Dhurke: Indeed. Considering my current situation, the less I'm seen, the better. Apollo: Well, it's not like there's an international arrest warrant out for you. Dhurke: True, but I seem to have made quite an international splash with that hijacking stunt. I had to sign a ton of autographs and take a load of selfies before I got to your office. Apollo: Wait, what? Dhurke: Maybe they thought the hijacking was part of some movie's promotion. Guard Apollo: He's completely uninterested in us. Dhurke: That suits me fine. It will only complicate things if I'm recognized. Apollo: Right... You're known as some sort of scary terrorist who fled from Khura'in. Though, in reality, no one would believe you're the real Dhurke of legend anyway. Microphone Apollo: Dhurke, why are you holding that mic? Dhurke: I get this strange urge to speak whenever there's a microphone before me. We, the Defiant Dragons, shall--! Apollo: No, stop! Stop...!!! Present Attorney's Badge Datz: Why, AJ! You've become a fine lawyer in your own right! Apollo: Nah, I still have a lot to learn. Datz: Aw, c'mon, don't be so hard on yourself. If I ever went to trial, I'd definitely want you on my side! Apollo: Knowing you, you'd probably skip town before the trial even started. Founder's Orb or Orb Transfer Agreement Datz: The doc agreed in writing to hand the orb over to me, but he kept stalling, like he didn't trust me or something. Dhurke: That scary mug of yours no doubt frightened him. Datz: Look who's talking! Trucy: Honestly, I think you're both about equally scary looking. Apollo: (Ouch... Both Dhurke and Datz look like they've been stabbed right in the ego.) Anything else Datz: Oh, is that for me!? Apollo: No, I was just showing it to you. Datz: Anything I could use here in the slammer is more than welcome! Apollo: Um, Datz, the guard is giving you some serious side eye. After clearing all Talk options: Datz: Oh! About the orb's whereabouts... Maybe the doc's kid knows something! Apollo: The doctor has a kid? Datz: Yeah... A bit of a shut-in, though. The poor thing's own bedroom has become like a self-imposed prison. Apollo: A shut-in? Sounds like it will be a challenge just to get a conversation going. Guard: Time for your questioning. Follow me. Datz: It must be lunchtime. Today is fried chicken, if I'm not mistaken! Guard: You'll get your lunch IF you behave yourself. Datz: Dhurke, AJ. I'll see ya guys around! Dhurke: Our only lead now is Dr. Buff's kid. But luring a shut-in out is... Apollo: ...Not going to be easy. I know. May 16Kurain Village - Doctor's Study ???: Oh, it's you again. Ema Looking for Mr. Wright? He was just here a second ago. Apollo: He was?! Trucy: What was Daddy doing here? Apollo: Good question. Ema: He said he was looking for something. Apollo: Did he say anything else? Ema: Let me think... Something about how his ride never showed up at the airport. Yes, that was it. Apollo: (I guess Athena really did get lost...) Trucy: But what's Daddy doing all the way out here in the first place? He can't be looking for us since no one told him we'd be here. Apollo: Hmm... Ema: Well, if you're here to take another look around, be my guest. I have other work to do, so if you'll excuse me. Apollo: Of course. Thanks, Ema. Dhurke: First and foremost, we'd better find Datz's passport. We should also have a word with Dr. Buff's child. Trucy: Hey, is it just me... or is there something new in here? Dhurke: ...Oh, you mean that thing? Yeah, we should take a closer look at it, too. Apollo: Let's not forget about Datz's passport. It should be around here somewhere. Examine Suitcase Apollo: Datz's suitcase... Maybe his passport's in there. Trucy: Annggh! It's no good. It's locked tight. Apollo: We should've asked him for the key. Drone Apollo: What's this? A model helicopter? Trucy: Don't you know anything, Apollo? It's a drone! They're all the rage right now. I bet it belongs to the doctor's kid. Dhurke: We need to ask them about the orb's whereabouts. Apollo: Yeah, but luring out a shut-in isn't going to be easy. Any other point of interest Apollo: Nothing new here. Let's go look somewhere else. After examining suitcase and drone: Apollo: What are we going to do about Datz's passport? It's probably right there inside his suitcase, but we can't get it open. Trucy: Why don't I take it over to Datz so he can unlock it? That way, you guys can continue looking for the orb. Apollo: Good thinking, Trucy! Trucy: Okay, here I go! ...Huh? What the...? Hrrgh...! This thing weighs a ton! Apollo: Let me try. ............Jeez, how can a suitcase be so heavy? Is it filled with bricks or something? Dhurke: Knowing Datz, he probably packed his dumbbells in there. It's certainly much too heavy to lug all the way to the detention center. Here, let me take a crack at that lock. Apollo: What, are you going to pick it? *click* *click, click* *click* *click* Dhurke: There you go. Apollo: That was fast. Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha! A lock like that is child's play to me. Especially after all the wrongly imprisoned compatriots I've busted out over the years. Apollo: You've sure seen a lot of action for an ex-lawyer. Dhurke: Aaand here we go. Datz's passport. Trucy: I'll take it over to him. Apollo: Thanks, Trucy. Trucy: No problem! Now you guys enjoy some quality father-son treasure hunting time, okay? See you later! Apollo: (There she goes. I wish she wouldn't make such a big deal out of our little \"family\" situation.) Dhurke: Father-son time, eh? Hmm... Been ages since we've had a father-son talk, huh, son? Apollo: Yeah, well over a decade. Dhurke: So, Apollo, um... how've you been? Apollo: Oh, uh... Fine. I'm fine, I guess. Dhurke: Is that so? Fine, you say? Well, fine is fine by me! Good to hear! Apollo: ...Um, okay. .................. Dhurke: ........................... Apollo: ............ (Umm... So what do we talk about now...?) Dhurke: ...Hm? Get down! Hit the dirt, son! Apollo: Huh? What the--? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! .........Unngh......Oof... ......... Dhurke: Speak to me, son! Say something! Apollo: ......Ooh... Th-that smarts... ???: Youuuu maggots! Whattaya think yer doin', invading Buff airspace?! It'll be a scorching day in Siberia before you get past me, ya yellow-bellied yahoos! Apollo: Whoa! ...It can talk?! What kind of drone is this, anyw... ...AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYY! ???: Drone, nothin'! That's Sergeant Buff to you, soldier! You got that, you lowly grunts?! Apollo: Oww... What the who now...?! Dhurke: Buff? Sounds like the doctor's son is behind the controls. Apollo: He's controlling this thing? Dhurke: Apollo, let's play along for now. At least until we can get the information we need out of him. Apollo: G-Got it. Um... Sergeant Buff? Sarge: Sergeant Buff, sir! You forgot to say, \"sir\"! Ain't you never seen a war movie before?! Apollo: Oh, right. Let me try that again. Sergeant Buff, sir! Sarge: Better. Much better. Now, state your name, unit, and rank, soldier! Apollo: Oh, um, I'm Apollo Justice. I serve at the Wright Anything Agency. And my rank is, um... fledgling lawyer? ...Sir! Sarge: Affirmative, Private Justice. Apollo: P-Private? Sarge: Listen up, diaper baby! Your commanding officer's orders are absolute! Disobedience means a one-way trip to the firing squad! Do I make myself clear?! Apollo: Oh, um... sir! Yes, sir! Sarge: Good, good, we might make a man out of you yet, private! Now for you, Cyclops! Dhurke: Huh? ...Oh, you want my name, unit, and rank, too? Um, I'm Dhurke Sahdmadhi. I command the rebel group the Defiant Dragons, and my rank is... um... leader, sir! Sarge: Excellent! Welcome aboard, Komandir Dhurke! Wait a second! What's with that ridiculous mop you call a head? Soldiers should be clean cut! Dhurke: S-Sorry, but this is my signature look. I'm not going to-- WHOOOOOOOOOA! Fine, fine! I'll get a haircut before we ship out! Sarge: Listen up, you! It's kill-or-be-killed out on that battlefield. No place for leave-in conditioners. All you've got is your life, and you're lucky to have that! Apollo: (He's oddly obsessed with field survival for someone who never goes outdoors...) Dhurke: This is going to be harder than I thought, son. Examine Anything Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Sarge: Don't let me catch you stepping out of line again. Apollo: (...Guess I'd better play along and ask what he wants.) Talk Sergeant Buff Apollo: Um, are you controlling that drone from your room, sir? Sarge: Affirmative! But I can see everything you do from here, so... Teeen-HUT, soldier! Wipe that stupid look off your face! I'm going to whip you sheltered peaceniks into shape! Apollo: (With what? Your \"charming\" personality?) Dhurke: Look, it's got a camera and speakers, too. Sarge: And that's not all, Komandir! With these arms, I can cook and clean, too! Speaking of which... Private Justice! You're on latrine duty! Snap to it, on the double! Apollo: ...*sigh*... As if I don't see enough of the toilet back at the office. Sarge's Drone added to the Court Record. Dhurke: That thing's pretty handy. Us Defiant Dragons could use one of those. Sarge: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Yes, it is a fine piece of hardware, isn't it? I modified it especially for siege defense! Apollo: Siege defense...? You mean how you won't leave your room? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! Sarge: Holing up in a stronghold to defend against an enemy is an age-old military tactic! A timeless strategy still applicable in modern warfare! I hope you're not trying to mock the wisdom of my forefathers! Apollo: I-I... I meant no offense. It was just an observation. Sarge: So the greenhorn who ain't even discharged a firearm's got something to say, does he?! Apollo: S-Sorry, sorry! It won't happen again, sir! Sarge: Darn tootin'. Now, state your intentions, soldier. Sergeant Buff (subsequent times) Apollo: Um, are you controlling that drone from your room, sir? Sarge: Affirmative! But I can see everything you do from here, so... Teeen-HUT, soldier! Wipe that stupid look off your face! I'm going to whip you sheltered peaceniks into shape! Apollo: (With what? Your \"charming\" personality?) Dhurke: Look, it's got a camera and speakers, too. Sarge: And that's not all, Komandir! With these arms, I can cook and clean, too! Speaking of which... Private Justice! You're on latrine duty! Snap to it, on the double! Apollo: ...*sigh*... As if I don't see enough of the toilet back at the office. Dhurke: That thing's pretty handy. Us Defiant Dragons could use one of those. Sarge: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Yes, it is a fine piece of hardware, isn't it? I modified it especially for siege defense! Apollo: Siege defense...? You mean how you won't leave your room? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! Sarge: Holing up in a stronghold to defend against an enemy is an age-old military tactic! A timeless strategy still applicable in modern warfare! I hope you're not trying to mock the wisdom of my forefathers! Apollo: I-I... I meant no offense. It was just an observation. Sarge: So the greenhorn who ain't even discharged a firearm's got something to say, does he?! Apollo: S-Sorry, sorry! It won't happen again, sir! Sarge: Darn tootin'. Now, state your intentions, soldier. Location of the orb (appears after \"Sergeant Buff\") Apollo: We had an agreement with your father. He had promised to hand over the Founder's Orb to us. Sarge: What?! Papa promised you that?! Dhurke: He did. But he died before he could tell us where it's hidden. Now we have no idea where it is. Sarge: .................. ...Oh. *sniffle* Apollo: Hm? Sarge: P-Papa... Why...? Why'd you have to die? Dhurke: It was an unfortunate accident. And I'm sorry for your loss. Apollo: If it helps at all, I know how you feel, Sergeant Bu-- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! What'd I do nowww?! Sarge: Y-You insignificant maggot! What would an unseasoned rookie like you know about how I feel?! First I lost Mama... and now I've lost Papa! Apollo: You lost your mother, too? Sarge: She's been gone for some time now. I'm... I'm all alone now. All alone... *sniffle* Dhurke: ...Sergeant Buff, would you tell us a little more about what happened to your mother? Your mother (appears after \"Location of the orb\") Sarge: Mama passed away about six months ago. We were still living in our apartment in the city. Back then, I had yet to engage in my siege defense strategy. Apollo: (In other words, something caused him to withdraw from the world.) Sarge: ...It was arson. It happened so suddenly... and before we knew it, our apartment was a sea of flames. Mama and I were trapped inside. But help never came. So Mama cradled me in her arms... ...kicked out a window... and jumped! Apollo: She did what?! Sarge: She was like a walkin', talkin' medal of valor, my mama was. She delivered me safely to terra firma with a perfectly executed PLF. It's a five-point landing technique used by paratroopers to land safely on the ground. Apollo: (She sounds like a superhero or something.) Sarge: But from that height, she suffered massive injuries in order to protect me. She... She died so that I could live! AHHHHHHHHHHHH! MAMAAAAAAAAAAAA!!! Apollo: I... I don't know what to say... Dhurke: And the person who started the fire? Sarge: He was immediately apprehended. They say he was standing outside laughing while the building burned. Dhurke: At least justice was served. I hope that brought you some solace. Sarge: I've lost both my parents now. You can't possibly know how I feel! *sniffle* *sob* Mama... Papa... Apollo: (Poor kid. It's hard losing both your parents at such a young age. He must really feel alone now.) Dhurke: Apollo... I imagine you know what he's going through. Apollo: I do? Dhurke: The road to recovery begins by talking to someone who's suffered the same hardship. I know you have something that shows you understand. Present Anything (before clearing \"Your mother\" Talk option) Sarge: What insubordination! Apollo: ARRRRRRAGH! Sarge: Petty trinkets have no place in Buff's army, soldier! Now drop and give me twenty! Apollo: (Sheesh... At least let me show the evidence before you shoot it down...) Photo of My Father (after clearing \"Your mother\" Talk option) Leads to: \"Um, sergeant, sir. Would you please take a look at this?\" Apollo: Um, sergeant, sir. Would you please take a look at this? Sarge: What do we have here? Apollo: It's a photo of my father. I wasn't even a year old when he died... in a fire. Sarge: What?! Dhurke: And like your mother, he died in an arsonist's blaze. But in his final moments, he managed to save his infant son. Sarge: P-Private Justice, you've suffered a loss just like mine. Apollo: I have... And that's why I know how you feel. Sarge: B-But... you still have your mother, don't you?! Apollo: No, I lost her, too. Sarge: What?! Apollo: She disappeared after the fire. I don't know if she's still alive or dead. Heck, I don't even know what she looks like. Sarge: Wow... Dhurke: Sergeant Buff, his experience is very much like your own. If anyone can understand the sadness in your heart, it's him. Sarge: Rrrr... Nnngh... .............................. ATTEEEEEENSHUN!!! I salute you, Comrade Justice! You are no longer a private in the Buff Army! Henceforth, you will be a corporal! Apollo: Corporal? Dhurke: Congratulations on your promotion, Corporal Justice! Apollo: ...I'm just glad that seemed to cheer him up a bit. Sarge: Now, comrade, let's toast to your new stripes! And call me Sarge! Don't be shy! We're a band of brothers now! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Dhurke: Now's our chance, corporal! Ask him about the Founder's Orb. Apollo: (Dhurke's getting waaaaay too much of a kick out of this.) Examine Ladder or bookshelves Apollo: Sarge, sir, do you ever read these books? Sarge: Why, of course! Soldiers must have extensive knowledge, as well as fighting prowess. I'm learning all I can each and every day in preparation for the big battle! Apollo: The big battle? Sarge: Um, you know... for when I go back to school. I'll need to be up to date on every subject. Stuff like... y'know, the latest comics and Hollywood gossip... Apollo: Oh, I see... (What about reading, writing and arithmetic?) Well, I'm rooting for you, Sarge! Sarge: Th-Thanks. I'll try my best. Computer Apollo: This computer could provide some useful information. Drat. It's password protected. Dhurke, you're good at getting into places you're not supposed to. Dhurke: Don't look at me. I don't know the first thing about computers. Sarge: Ha ha ha ha ha! Leave it to me! A modern day warrior must be well-versed in technology... and have a mean, mean pride! After all, he who controls information, controls the battlefield! *click clack click clack click clack* Sarge: Aaaaand I'm in! Apollo: Looks like modern day warriors have mean, mean keyboard skills, too. Dhurke: Okay, let's see what we can find. *click clack click clack click clack* Dhurke: Oh, what's this...? An e-mail message? Now this is interesting. It's a research report to whoever asked the doctor to study the orb. Sarge: Here, I put the data on this! Take it and use it well, soldier! E-Mail added to the Court Record. Computer (subsequent times) Apollo: The doctor's computer. It contains an e-mail detailing the progress of his research. Dhurke: I wonder who he prepared the report for. Glasses Apollo: Are these the doctor's? Sarge: Yes, those are Papa's reading glasses. He said he'd been having trouble reading lately. But those glasses seemed to help. Dhurke: Reading glasses, eh? I'll just hold on to these. Apollo: ...Dhurke. Don't tell me you're having trouble reading, too? Dhurke: Perish the thought! ...I-I just don't want to leave any stone unturned. Doctor's Reading Glasses added to the Court Record. Raincoat Apollo: It's a raincoat... Hm...? It's a bit wet, and there's fresh mud on it... That must mean someone wore it recently. Dhurke: Indeed. Maybe even as recently as last night. Apollo: Sarge, did it rain here last night? Sarge: Negative. There wasn't a cloud in the sky. Apollo: Hmm... Then how did this raincoat get all muddy and wet? Sarge: When I saw it last evening, it looked pretty clean and dry to me. Apollo: That means it got like this later at night. Dhurke: Good eye, son. This may very well turn out to be a vital clue. Raincoat added to the Court Record. Raincoat (subsquent times) Apollo: It's a raincoat... Hm...? It's a bit wet, and there's fresh mud on it... That must mean someone wore it recently. Dhurke: Indeed. Maybe even as recently as last night. Apollo: Sarge, did it rain here last night? Sarge: Negative. There wasn't a cloud in the sky. Apollo: Hmm... Then how did this raincoat get all muddy and wet? Sarge: When I saw it last evening, it looked pretty clean and dry to me. Apollo: That means it got like this later at night. Dhurke: Good eye, son. This may very well turn out to be a vital clue. Statue EX-TER-MI-NATE. EX-TER-MI-NATE. DES-TROY ALL HU-MANS. Apollo: What's this thing's problem...? Sarge: It's an OOPArt -- an our-of-place artifact. Papa won it in an online auction. Apollo: An online auction? Sarge: Yes, he said it's an alien weapon that destroyed an entire ancient civilization. Apollo: (...Where do I even start with an explanation like that?) Sacred Urn Apollo: This urn with \"Ami\" painted on it looks really old. But I don't think it's going to provide any info we need. Spiral staircase Apollo: Is your room upstairs, Sarge? Sarge: Yes, it's the one at the end of the hall. Dhurke: What do you say you come out, so we can enjoy a snack together? Sarge: B-But... Dhurke: I promise we won't bite! Sarge: ...............If you insist... ...then I'm not going to talk to you anymore! Dhurke: No, wait! Apollo: Dhurke, you'd better apologize quick. Dhurke: ...I'm sorry for pushing. Sarge: V-Very well. As long as you don't do it again, I'll let it slide this one time. Suitcase Apollo: It's Datz's suitcase. It's full of survival gear and questionable souvenirs. But we already got his passport, so we can leave it be for now. Shoe shelves Apollo: It's a shoe cubby. Hmm, these shoes look like they belong to Sarge and his dad. ...Ah, these boots here are a little damp! Dhurke: And it looks like there's something inside this one. Apollo: Maybe Doctor Buff wore them last night. Dhurke: They might lead us to where he hid the orb. Let's take a closer look. Examine outsole Apollo: There's a question mark on the bottom of this boot. Sarge: Papa had those custom-made for his archeological fieldwork. He had the soul of an adventurer. Dhurke: This boot had the \"sole\" of an adventurer, too. Examine residue on insole (before examining hook-and-loop fastener straps) Apollo: Something's giving off a soft glow inside this boot. But it's too dark in there to see what it is. Examine hook-and-loop fastener straps Apollo: We might get a better look inside if we undid these straps. Examine residue on insole (after examining hook-and-loop fastener straps) Leads to: \"It looks like some kind of glowing moss.\" Apollo: It looks like some kind of glowing moss. Dhurke: It could've come from wherever the doctor went last night. Must've gotten in with some of that mud. Apollo: It might be worth looking into... ...if it'll help us pinpoint where the doctor hid the orb. Glowing Moss added to the Court Record. Shoe shelves (subsequent times) Apollo: There's some glowing moss inside this boot. Dhurke: I'm willing to bet it got there from wherever the doctor went last night. Talk Location of the orb Apollo: Sarge, sir. Do you have any idea where the orb might be? Sarge: It was here in Papa's study until last night. But he said he was going to go hide it somewhere. He mentioned something about a shady character being after it. Apollo: Where do you think he could've hidden it? Sarge: Hmm... Somewhere in the village, I'd guess. He said he'd found a suitable hiding place for it. Apollo: So, it was here last night. That is, until he went out to hide it somewhere in the village. The only question is where? Dhurke: Maybe he left some clue here in his study. Let's search the place again. Apollo: (We should also find out more about Dr. Buff. It might steer us toward the hiding place.) Doctor Buff (appears after \"Location of the orb\") Apollo: So, Sarge, what was your father like? Sarge: Papa was as king as Mama was courageous. His whole reason for moving to the countryside was for me. Apollo: What do you mean? Sarge: I initiated my siege defense strategy after Mama died. Papa was so worried about me, he moved us here to the countryside. He thought the fresh air, blue skies, and natural surroundings might alter my tactics. Dhurke: What a fine father. Sarge: He even quit his position at the university to move here. Apollo: He did? Sarge: He did. He gave up his beloved research position just for me! \"A parent must be prepared to sacrifice everything for his child.\" That's what Papa said! Dhurke: ...Well, I'm feeling about two inches tall right now. Sarge: There's no one in the world I respected more than him. But that just makes his passing all the more devastating. *sniffle, sniffle* Papa, may you continue your beloved research up there with the angels! Present Attorney's Badge Sarge: What's that? Apollo: It's my attorney's badge, sir! Sarge: You mean like a medal?! What act of valor earned you such an honor? Apollo: I rescued my clients from those who would brand them as guilty, sir! Sarge: A heroic act, indeed! Apollo: Thank you for your kind words, sir! (This whole \"sir\" thing is getting real old, real quick.) Photo of My Father Sarge: Corporal Justice... you shoulder a bitter past. Apollo: You've been through quite a lot yourself, Sarge. Sarge: ...Corporal, if I may... um... Apollo: Yes? Sarge: ...Well... um... it doesn't have to be that often, but... W-W-Would you mind coming over from time to time? Apollo: You want me to visit you? Sarge: O-Only if you want to, of course! Apollo: ...Sure. I'll come by, and I'll even bring along my coworkers, Sarge. Sarge: R-Really?! Yaaaaaay! Our band of  brothers continues to grow in rank! Ha ha ha ha! Dhurke: ...Nice work, son. Glad to see you haven't changed one bit. Apollo: (What's that supposed to mean?) Study Photo or Research Notes Sarge: Why...? Why did Papa have to fall in battle? Apollo: (He's putting on a brave face, but he's still just a child.) Sarge: In honor of Papa's heroic sacrifice...  let us march on, comrade! To victory! Apollo: Huh?! I-I mean, sir! Yes, sir! Dhurke: Are you two seriously bent on waging war against that bookcase? Sarge's Drone Apollo: It looks like you can do everything by yourself. Sarge: Indeed! I can even cook and build things whenever I want! Apollo: So there's really no reason for you to leave your room, huh. Sarge: Yes, but there is still one gaping hole in my siege defense. ...Going to the bathroom. Apollo: When nature calls, it's best not to fight it. Sarge: Yes, all great tacticians will say never wage a battle you have no hope of winning. Anything else Apollo: Please take a look at this. Sarge: Let me ask you something, Corporal Justice! How does that aid you on the battlefield?! Apollo: Um, well, if you count the courtroom as a battlefield, it's a fairly useful weapon. Sarge: Good answer! A military man must know his weapons inside and out! Keep up the good work, corporal! Apollo: S-Sir, yes, sir! (I guess that's all he has to say about that.) After clearing \"Doctor Buff\" Talk option and examining computer, glasses, raincoat, and shoe shelves: Apollo: Okay, let's go over what we've learned so far. Wherever it was that Dr. Buff went, he needed a raincoat. And it was somewhere where this glowing moss grows. Any ideas where that might be, Sarge? Sarge: Negative, comrade. I hate to say my intel's a little thin on this one. I've been occupied with my siege defense strategy ever since we moved to the village. Dhurke: Well, son, it seems we have no other choice. We'll have to ask the locals if they know of a place like that. Wright Anything Agency Trucy: Ah! Apollo, Mr. Dhurke! Did you have some quality father-son time together? Talk Any ideas? Dhurke: That poor child... How is he going to survive all on his own? Apollo: Yeah, it's not like he can go out grocery shopping on his own. We should drop off some food later. Dhurke: No, that would only make it worse. We should be encouraging him to come out on his own. Once his food runs out, he'll have to leave the house if he wants to eat. Apollo: Talk about your old-school siege tactics. Sounds more like you want to starve him out... What to do Apollo: Um... Dhurke: Yes? What is it? Apollo: ............ Dhurke: ............ Apollo: (Talk about an awkward silence. I have no idea what to say.) ............ (Yeah... I've got nothing.) Dhurke: Aw, come on, son! Don't tell me you've got nothing! May 16Kurain Village Apollo: Ugh. It feels like somebody's watching me, and it's really creeping me out. Oh, it's just Paul Atishon's campaign posters. When did he put these up? (Whatever. I've got more important things to be paying attention to.) Dhurke: What great weather! It really lifts the spirits. I know! After our little treasure hunt, what do you say we go hunting, son? Apollo: Hunting? We used to do that a lot... didn't we? Dhurke: Just look at that mountain. I bet there are some feisty wild boars up there! Apollo: I... think I'll pass... but thanks. Dhurke: Oh, so hunting's a no-go. Um, well... I guess that wild boar stew will have to wait, then. .........Hm? Apollo, something seems different from the last time we were here. Apollo: Uh... You mean the posters? Dhurke: No, not those. Apollo: (What's he talking about...? Guess I should take a look around myself.) Examine Paul Atishon campaign posters Apollo: When did Paul Atishon have a chance to put up all these election posters? Old Man: That fool keeps stickin' 'em on our houses! He's a disgrace to his distinguished heritage! Apollo: He's doing this without permission? Fey Manor Apollo: A thatched roof... First time I've ever seen one in real life. Dhurke: It looks just like the traditional thatched roofs they use in Japan. All we need now are some samurai with topknots, a few ninjas, and a cuddly mascot. Apollo: When was the last time you were in Japan? Bus stop Apollo: (A phone booth and a bus stop made of wood. They both look really old. You hardly ever see phone booths in the city anymore.) Dhurke: Apollo... what's this glass box for? Apollo: (I guess you hardly see them in Khura'in, too.) Mountains Dhurke: Seeing those mountains really takes me back. I remember when we used to live high in the mountains to escape from the government. Apollo: So, you don't live there anymore? Dhurke: Nope. I needed a more convenient place to lead the revolution from. But that old mountain hut is still there. Apollo: (Man, I miss that hut...) Dhurke: What, are you getting homesick, Apollo? You can come on back to Khura'in anytime, you know? Apollo: N-No, no, I'm fine. Besides, I've got a lot on my plate here... Kurain Boulder Apollo: There's a big boulder towering into the sky over there. According to the sign, it's called the \"Kurain Boulder.\" It also says that a spirit dwells within it. Hmm... A rock with a spirit in it? Dhurke: It's called animism -- the belief that spirits dwell within inanimate objects. They've probably enshrined this boulder as a sacred object. Their tradition of worshipping such objects is similar to our tradition in Khura'in. Apollo: I-Interesting... (Who knew Dhurke could make sense every once in a while?) Canvas Leads to: \"What do we have here?\" Apollo: What do we have here? It looks like an unfinished picture... like something a little kid might paint. Dhurke: Hmm, you're right. But I can't quite tell what it's of. Apollo: I think it's supposed to be nighttime, but what's that thing on the left? Dhurke: Um... A monster, or some kind of alien, perhaps? In any case, it's a pretty poor excuse for a drawing. Apollo: Well, what did you expect from a little kid? ???: A... little kid...? Apollo: Huh? Oh, it's you, Pearl! Pearl: Why, Mr. Apollo, is that you? What a pleasant surprise! It's been quite some time. How have you been? Apollo: Fine, thanks. You're looking good, too, Pearl. Dhurke: Aren't you going to introduce me, son? Apollo: Of course. This is Pearl Fey. She's a spirit medium here in Kurain Village. Pearl, this is Dhurke, my umm... client. Pearl: Hello, sir. Pleased to meet you. If there is anything I can do to help, please let me know. Dhurke: Nice to meet you, too. And what a polite little girl you are! Pearl: ...Um, actually... I'm a high schooler. Dhurke: Whoops! Sorry about that! So, you're a spirit medium? Does that mean you can channel spirits, then? Pearl: Yes. I'm still in training, though. But I'm well-versed in the art of spirit channeling. Dhurke: Well now, isn't that something! I mean, back in my country, our little princess hasn't channeled a single spirit yet! Pretty impressive, young lady! Pearl: Oh, but compared to Mystic Maya, there is so much more I must learn! Apollo: Mystic Maya? Oh, right, Maya Fey... Mr. Wright's former courtroom assistant. He told me all about her. She's a spirit medium, too, if memory serves. Pearl: Yes, she's an amazing medium. And soon, she'll be the next lead of the Fey clan, too! Apollo: (Mediums and spirit channeling... I've heard all about it from Mr. Wright. He said that mediums will even physically become the person they're channeling. I wonder if even little Pearl would turn into a hulking giant if she hand to channel one...) Pearl: I hope you don't mind me asking, but what brings you all the way out here, Mr. Apollo? Apollo: Oh, just a small matter to take care of. Pearl: ...Wait, would it happen to be the matter Mr. Edgeworth is looking into? Apollo: Prosecutor Edgeworth? What's he doing here? Pearl: Oh, so it's a different matter, then? Because I just saw him a moment ago. He appeared to be searching for something. Apollo: Oh? Hmm... (Mr. Edgeworth is a friend of Mr. Wright's, and the district's chief prosecutor. Why would HE be here in Kurain? Well, no point obsessing over it.) Come to think of it, you live here in Kurain Village, don't you, Pearl? Pearl: Yes, I was born and raised here. Dhurke: This is perfect, Apollo. Let's ask the young lady if she knows where the doctor might have gone last night. Apollo: I was thinking the exact same thing. (Maybe I should show her what we found in the doctor's study.) Examine Paul Atishon campaign posters Pearl: Honestly! Why does he keep putting these up? And on people's houses, no less! Apollo: That's got to violate some campaigning law or something... Here, Pearl, I'll help you take them down. Apollo: Whew... Why did he have to put up so many... Pearl: Yeah... And it won't be long before he puts more up. It's really driving me crazy. Dhurke: Why don't you scribble something on them? You know, just some harmless graffiti? Pearl: ...Actually, that's just what I was thinking when I was sketching. Apollo: ...Why don't you join us for lunch at the office sometime? It'll get you away from all this. House Pearl: This is Fey Manor. Mystic Maya lives here. I hope she's doing well... Apollo: (Oh right. Ms. Fey's off studying and training in Khura'in.) Mountains Apollo: There's a lush, green mountain in the distance there. Pearl: It's home to a variety of animals. They sometimes come down to the village. I've seen foxes, badgers, and even bears. Apollo: B-Bears? Dhurke: Well, one would certainly never go hungry around here. Pearl: The poor animals! They are not for hunting or eating! Understand?! Dhurke: But badger and bear meat are so good... Canvas Dhurke: This picture looks like something you might've painted when you were little, son. Apollo: I think I would've done a little better than this. Pearl: ......... Canvas (after perceiving) Apollo: On closer inspection, there's more to this picture than meets the eye. Dhurke: Son, didn't you ever learn that honesty is the best policy? Apollo: Way to go, Dhurke! I was trying to get us out of the hole we dug ourselves into earlier! Talk Kurain Village Dhurke: What a peaceful place. Ahh... Nothing beats mountain air. Pearl: Many of the villagers have left for the city, but I just love it here. Blue skies, lush forests, star-filled skies at night, and fireflies in the summer. Plus, the big, beautiful, blue ocean is just beyond that mountain! Dhurke: The ocean?! What do you say we go for a swim, son? Apollo: ...Oh, um... I think I'll pass. (Besides, I can't swim.) ...Um, Pearl? Kurain Village is like, \"the home of spirit mediums,\" right? Pearl: Yes, and I'm a part of a long line of mediums. Apollo: I've never seen a channeling before, but... ...is it possible to channel the spirit of anyone who's passed away? Pearl: No, not just anyone. You must know their face and true name. Apollo: Really? You can channel a spirit just by knowing their face and name? That's an amazing ability. Pearl: It is, but it can only be learned by those with a gift occurring in certain bloodlines... ...and years of intense training. At present, Mystic Maya and I are the only ones in our village who can channel spirits. Dhurke: Looks like spirit mediums are highly valued here, much like they are back in Khura'in. Pearl: I heard there used to be many more of us a long time ago... ...but now, we are in very short supply. Most of the women nowadays don't want to stay; they want the thrill of the big city. Apollo: Yeah, well, you guys aren't exactly close to any shopping malls or nightclubs out here. But what about you? Are you NOT interested in things like that? Pearl: W-Who, me? Well, I... I wouldn't mind a new outfit or two, and, well... Oh, never mind. Apollo: It's okay, Pearl. You are at that age, after all. Paul Atishon (appears after \"Kurain Village\") Apollo: Oh! We met this weirdo earlier named Paul Atishon. Do you know anything about him? Pearl: Yes, he's been campaigning a lot around here lately. And the noise he's been making has become quite a problem. People are especially upset that he's campaigning at all hours of the night and day. Dhurke: Hmm, well... The local police should arrest him for disturbing the peace. Pearl: Unfortunately, there's little they can do because the Atishon family is so powerful. Apollo: (...Well, isn't HE the proverbial pampered provincial prince.) He seems pretty intent on winning here in Kurain. Is there some special reason why? Pearl: I'm not sure, but I have an idea. The spirit mediums of Kurain once held considerable sway in the political world. Judging by his slogan, maybe that's what he's after. Apollo: Great, so he's just another politician seeking powerful connections... Dhurke: The ability to commune with the dead gives comfort to those anxious about the future. Tiny Khura'in has preserved its independence by the queen's power of spirit channeling. It must play a similar role in this village. Pearl: Yes. Even today, many here revere those with spirit medium blood flowing in their veins. Apollo: So basically, as Paul Atishon's benefactor goes, so goes the whole village? (Who is this benefactor? Who could hold this much sway over Kurain Village?) Where the doctor went (appears after presenting Glowing Moss) Apollo: Pearl... Do you have any idea where Dr. Buff might've gone last night? Pearl: Umm... Well... Apollo: ......... Pearl: ...Uhh, about that... ...All I know is Dr. Buff was somewhere on Mt. Mitama. BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: ...! (My bracelet...! It's reacting! Which means Pearl is hiding something from me.) Present Bracelet Pearl: All I know is Dr. Buff was somewhere on Mt. Mitama. Percieve twitching left thumb on \"Mt. Mitama.\" Apollo: Apollo: Pearl, you seem anxious around the topic of Mt. Mitama. I could tell because you'd rub your thumb over a splotch of dried paint as you said it. Pearl: Oh! U-Um, well...! Apollo: That nighttime painting is yours, isn't it? Pearl: .........! ...This is so embarrassing. As you saw, I'm not a very good artist. But that picture has nothing to do with Dr. Buff! Apollo: I'm not so sure about that. In fact, I'm going to guess that while you were out here painting last night... ...you actually saw the good doctor heading out to Mt. Mitama from the bus stop. Pearl: N-No! I-I didn't see anything like that! I swear! Apollo: ...No, I'm positive you saw the doctor. After all, he's right here in your picture. Present human-like figure Apollo: Leads to: \"Y-You think that's the doctor?\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: See? Isn't the doctor right there? Pearl: Really? That doesn't look like him to me. Apollo: Well, I guess it IS pretty abstract. Pearl: Oh... Is it really that hard to make out? Er, what I mean is, it has nothing to do with Dr. Buff! After all, I never even saw him that night! Leads back to: \"...No, I'm positive you saw the doctor. After all, he's right here in your picture.\" Pearl: Y-You think that's the doctor? I may not be a very good artist, but at least I know how to draw a person! Apollo: Okay, if this isn't a person, then what is it? Pearl: Er... Th-That's a... a rain spirit! Apollo: ......... Pearl: .................. Apollo: ...Um, and what's a rain spirit doing at a bus stop? Pearl: Oh, umm, rain spirits have places to go, too! Apollo: ........ (This is getting ridiculous.) Sorry, Pearl, but you're not a very good liar. That is Dr. Buff, and this piece of evidence proves it! Present Raincoat Apollo: Leads to: \"This is the raincoat we found in the doctor's study.\" Present anything else Apollo: Pearl: The only thing I'm guilty of is being a terrible artist. But you're taking advantage of that to claim the picture is something it's not! Apollo: N-No no, it's... (...totally like that, but...) Pearl: That isn't a person! It's a rain spirit, I tell you! Apollo: No, Pearl, that isn't a rain spirit. Leads back to: \"That is Dr. Buff, and this piece of evidence proves it!\" Apollo: This is the raincoat we found in the doctor's study. It's still wet and muddy, so we know that someone wore it last night. Now, let's see how this pattern is the same as the \"rain spirit\" in your picture? Pearl: ...Ah! Apollo: You didn't see a rain spirit last night. You saw Dr. Buff wearing this raincoat! Pearl: Ah! ...I... I'm sorry. I know I'm not supposed to lie, but... Leads back to Talk options Percieve wrong area Apollo: Apollo: Pearl, you seem uneasy about something. Pearl: Anyone would feel uneasy being stared at like that! Apollo: Huh? But I...! Dhurke: I'd be unnerved, too. I mean, your eyes are practically popping out of your head. Apollo: I-I get it. I'll tone it down a little. (Guess I was wrong.) Leads back to Talk options Where the doctor went (after perceiving) Pearl: I'm sorry I didn't tell you before, Mr. Apollo, but I did see the doctor last night. Apollo: It's all right. Just, please, tell me everything you know. Pearl: ...Of course. I was painting out here last night... when the doctor came up to the bus stop. He was wearing a raincoat, even though it wasn't raining, and a helmet with a light on it. Apollo: Sounds like he was well-prepared for something. Pearl: I know. That's why I asked him if he was going off exploring again. He looked startled, like he hadn't noticed me there. And then, he suddenly said... \"Please don't tell anyone you saw me here.\" Apollo: Why would he want to silence you like that? Dhurke: Something must've happened to spook him. And he didn't want anyone to know where he was going to hide the orb. Apollo: But where could he have been going dressed like that? Pearl: My best guess is a cave somewhere on Mt. Mitama. I heard there's a cave there where mediums of the Kurain tradition went to train long ago. Legend has it, there are some sort of mystical ruins in there. Apollo: Mystical ruins? Sounds like the exact sort of place an archeologist might go. Present Attorney's Badge Pearl: Hee hee. Seeing you present your badge like that... ...reminds me of when I used to investigate cases alongside Mr. Nick. Apollo: You used to help Mr. Wright all the time, I hear. Pearl: That I did! Doing so helped me expand mu horizons beyond this tiny little village. So please, Mr. Apollo! If there's anything I can help you with, you just let me know! Apollo: I will. (What I'd really like is her help with cleaning the office again.) Glowing Moss Apollo: Pearl, do you have any idea where this moss might grow? Pearl: That looks like... Mitama Moss. It grows on Mt. Mitama, and gives off a soft glow in the dark. Apollo: Mt. Mitama? Pearl: See that mountain over there? That's Mt. Mitama. Dhurke: And how would one get there? Pearl: You can take a bus from that bus stop over there. ...Um, may I ask why you're so interested in that moss? Apollo: Well, Dr. Buff was supposed to give us something. But it seems he hid it somewhere last night. Pearl: H-He did? Maybe that's why he, um... Apollo: Pearl? Do you know something that might help us? Pearl: Um, well... Apollo: (Sounds like I'd better find out what she knows.) Anything else Pearl: Oh, um... Sorry, I wish I could help, but... Apollo: No, don't worry about it! I'm sorry I wasted your time like that. Pearl: Um... At least let me offer you some tea. I mean, you must be tired from all your investigating. Pearl: Oh, no, you don't have to do that. We'll be just fine, thank you. (She's so polite, it's hard NOT to feel rude around her.) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: Well, we should get going now, but thanks for all your help, Pearl. Pearl: You're welcome, Mr. Apollo. Please take care. Dhurke: What do you say we go find that cave, son? I sense that the orb might finally be within our grasp. Apollo: This treasure hunt is shaping up to be the real deal. Dhurke: Hah hah hah. Really gets the blood pumping, doesn't it?! Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go! May 16Mt. Mitama - Cave Entrance Apollo: Whew, I'm all out of breath. Dhurke: Aw, come on, that was nothing. And you're so much younger than me. Apollo: I, uh... *huff* *puff* ...don't normally get this much exercise... *cough* *sputter* Dhurke: Need a break? Apollo: N-No, I'm fine. *huff* *puff* Dhurke! Look! There's Mitama Moss growing in that cave over there. Dhurke: This must be where the doctor was last night. Let's take a look inside. May 16Mt. Mitama - Cave Apollo: ............ I can't see a thing. Dhurke: Relax. Your eyes will adjust eventually. Now, follow me. Apollo: I-I really think we need a flashlight, Dhurke. Dhurke: Should've brought one along then, son. ???: ...Here, use mine. Apollo: Thanks! Wait, were you holding out on me? Dhurke: Um... who are you talking to, Apollo? Apollo: ...You...? Whoa! (Someone just pushed me!) Dhurke: Apollo? What the--?! Apollo! Ah... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Apollo: Oww... Dhurke: Are you all right, son? Apollo: Y-Yeah... Looks like someone got the drop on us. Dhurke: Quite literally. Apollo: But who--? I mean, we could've died from that fall! Dhurke: I don't know... Hmm... But I don't think we'll be getting out the way we came in. Looks like we're in a pretty deep cave. Nothing to do but press on, son. Apollo: How can you even see in here? Dhurke: ...Come on, let's go. Apollo: H-Hey, wait! (One false step and we're dead... What in the world should we do...?) Wait here Apollo: How about we wait for help to come? Dhurke: And how are we to call for said help, hmm? Apollo: With my phone, obviously. I'll just-- Argh...! Of course we're in a dead zone... *sigh* Dhurke: Guess that's that. Apollo: (Just great...) Leads back to: \"What in the world should we do...?\" Go forward Leads to: \"I guess we keep going.\" Climb back up Apollo: Let's try climbing back up. Dhurke: Can you even see the wall in front of you? Apollo: ...No... Dhurke: Well, I can tell you it's far too steep. Apollo: You never know until you try! Here goes nothing! Hrrrgh... Annngh... Dhurke: Your loud voice may move mountains... ...but you've barely moved an inch, son. Apollo: (Argh!) Leads back to: \"What in the world should we do...?\" Apollo: I guess we keep going. There must've been some path for Dr. Buff to follow when he came to hide the orb. Dhurke: Right. By the way, it looks like our attacker left us with this useful parting gift. Apollo: From lawyer to spelunker... How do I always get myself into these situations...? We're never going to make it out alive, I hope you know. Dhurke: Don't tell me you're scared, son. We're just getting started. The greatest treasures are only ever found at the point of a blade, or the edge of a cliff. Apollo: Yeah, sure... If I'd known I'd wind up at the bottom of some dark, damp cave... ...I would've never taken your request, Dhurke. Dhurke: Save your breath, Apollo. Just keep putting one foot ahead of the other. Apollo: There'd really better be a way out of here. Dhurke: We'll find one before you know it. You'll see. .................................................................. May 16Mt. Mitama - Cave Apollo: *huff* *puff* We've been walking for over an hour. It's like a maze in here. I couldn't go back to where we started if I wanted to. Dhurke: Y-Yeah... This cave goes deeper than I thought. Apollo: Wait, don't tell me there really is no way out... Dhurke: ...Where there's a will, there's a way. Apollo: Ever the optimist, aren't you... (Maybe we should cut our losses while we still can...) Forge ahead Leads to: \"Even if we were to turn back, we wouldn't make it up that wall of solid rock.\" Turn back Apollo: I seriously think we're going to get completely turned around if we go any further, Dhurke. I mean, we don't even know if there's a way out up ahead. Dhurke: But we DO know we can't climb up that wall. Apollo: Yeah, but... Dhurke: I still know the way back from here. Don't worry, son. We can always go back there any time we want. Apollo: I-If you say so. (Famous last words if I've ever heard some...) Leads back to: \"Maybe we should cut our losses while we still can...\" Put my foot down Apollo: I'm not taking another step, Dhurke! Dhurke: Come on, now... Be reasonable... Apollo: No! I'm done, and that's final. Dhurke: I remember when you used to throw tantrums like this. Apollo: W-Well, I'm not a child anymore! Dhurke: There, there! It's okay. Daddy'll buy anything you want once we get home, son. Apollo: (...I'd better quit while I still have some manhood left to salvage... But it doesn't seem like Dhurke's about to quit any time soon. Even still...) Leads back to: \"Maybe we should cut our losses while we still can...\" Apollo: (Even if we were to turn back, we wouldn't make it up that wall of solid rock. So, I guess we keep going.) ............*sigh* How did I get stuck wandering around in a dark cave again? It's definitely not in my job description. Dhurke: Heh heh. Listen, son. Only the truly accomplished have the luxury of being so choosy. When I was just starting out, I did everything from street performing to yak milking. Apollo: And... that helped you become an accomplished attorney, how? Dhurke: It didn't. But when you need to make a living, you'll take on any job just to survive. ...Say, how IS your career going, by the way? Apollo: Well, it's been a harrowing adventure so far, to say the least. My first trial really put me through the wringer. And my next case had me investigating a pair of stolen panties. And just when I was hitting my stride, this one prosecutor branded me as \"Herr Forehead.\" Oh, and there's this other, ridiculous prosecutor who wields a samurai sword. Dhurke: ...Sounds like you've, um... seen quite a bit. Apollo: You're telling me. Dhurke: ...Listen, Apollo... I'm, uh, I'm sorry I didn't contact you for so long. Apollo: ............It's fine, Dhurke. What happened, happened. Dhurke: ...Hm? Careful, the ground doesn't feel as solid here. Apollo: What? Yikes! The cave floor's collapsing! Dhurke: Argh! Not agaaaain! Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH! May 16??? ???: Hey, Apollo. Can you hear me? Apollo: ...Unngh. (.........Dhurke?) Huh? Where are we? Whoa! What is this place?! Dhurke: I was shocked, too. These ruins look really old. Apollo: It's not exactly something you'd expect to find in the middle of a cave system, that's for sure. Maybe the doctor hid the orb here? I mean, those look like footprints over there. Dhurke: Son, I think our little adventure is about to pay dividends! Time to find that orb! Examine Plastic bottle Apollo: What's a plastic bottle doing here? Dhurke: There's seaweed stuck to it, which means it probably came from the ocean. Hmm... It's possible this cavern is connected to the sea somehow. Driftwood Apollo: Driftwood? How'd that get in here? Dhurke: By drifting on in, I'd assume. The only question is, from where? Cavern wall near stone altar Apollo: So that's the hole we fell through. Doesn't look like we'll be going back that way. We're lucky we survived the fall from way up there. Dhurke: Indeed. If that hole hadn't been above the lake, we'd be history. You passed out the moment you hit the water. Apollo: Yeah, well, water's not really my thing. Dhurke: Hmm, this cavern is solid rock all around. Looks like we either go back through that hole... ...or find some other way out. Apollo: Ugh. Why am I always between a rock and a hard place? Stone altar Apollo: It's a big stone altar. One false move, and some god might come and smite us. Dhurke: Oh, come on. It's not all doom and gloom. Apollo: ...I dare you to look at our surroundings and say that again, Dhurke. Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! You've got me there, son. Apollo: (Dear gods, please smite me now.) Water Apollo: This lake looks really deep. I can't even see the bottom. (A bottomless lake in the depths of a mountain cave system. My blood runs cold at the thought of falling in there.) Dhurke: The water... It's salty. This lake may very well lead to the ocean. Apollo: Didn't Pearl mention something about the ocean? ...Like how it's on the other side of the mountain? Can't imagine she meant it literally. Footprints Apollo: These have gotta be the doctor's footprints. They match the bottoms of the boots we saw in his study. Dhurke: So he made it all the way down here. Hmm... The water's washed and most of them away, but his footprints are everywhere. Apollo: Really? 'Cause these are the only sets I see. Dhurke: He must've been looking for something. ...Ah. Those prints... They're coming out of that lake. Apollo: Hey, you're right. But that would mean Dr. Buff came walking out of the water. Box on altar Apollo: This box looks pretty new. I'm guessing... the doctor's the one who brought it down here. Dhurke: It's no good. It's locked tight. Apollo: There's no way to open it? Dhurke: Doesn't look like it. There isn't even a keyhole. Which means... there must be a trick to opening it. We'll have to figure it out if we want to see what's inside. Talk Any ideas? Apollo: I wonder what this place was for before it was... well, ruins. Dhurke: I'm guessing it was a place for spirit mediums to perform their rites. But earthquakes and the changing landscape eventually buried it. Apollo: If you're right, that would mean that it hasn't been used in ages. After examining cavern wall near stone altar, water, footprints, and box on altar: Dhurke: Let's sum up what we know so far. The orb is almost definitely inside this box contraption that we can't open. As for this cave, there doesn't seem to be any way out. Apollo: Nnrgh... We're THIS close to the orb... Dhurke: Aww, come now, son. Don't be like that. It's just a bit of bad luck. That's all. Apollo: A bit? Murphy called. He wants his law back. Dhurke: What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger, right? Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (How can he laugh at a time like this?) Dhurke: We're stuck here for now, so we might as well try to open this thing. Apollo: Okay, let's see what we're dealing with. Examine button Apollo: There's a big button here. ...Huh. Nothing happened. Examine pictures Apollo: This thing is covered with pictures. And, hey! Each section also rotates! Dhurke: Take a look at this, son. See the picture of a dragon battling a tiger? And this green and purple one... ...is of a Khura'inese butterfly and a mitamah. Apollo: ...I wonder if they're clues for figuring out how to open this box. After examining button and pictures: Dhurke: It appears this box uses a picture-based combination lock. We'll have to arrange the pictures on each side in the correct sequence. Apollo: Let's see... There's the dragon and tiger fight, a Khura'inese butterfly with a mitamah... Dhurke: ...And a number of pictures, too. Apollo: Dhurke, I was thinking... Maybe we should check the evidence we've collected so far. I think we have something that just might help us open it. Dhurke: You read my mind, son. Apollo: I think this will help us open the puzzle box. Present Research Notes Apollo: Leads to: \"Dr. Buff's research notes mention the Song of Ceremony.\" Present anything else Apollo: Dhurke: I don't see how that would help us. Apollo: Really? (Guess that wasn't it.) Dhurke: There's a dragon and tiger fighting, and a Khura'inese butterfly with a mitamah. We've gotta have something related to those things, don't we? Apollo: Hmm... Leads back to: \"I think this will help us open the puzzle box.\" Apollo: Dr. Buff's research notes mention the Song of Ceremony. Maybe its lyrics and the pictures on the box correspond somehow. Dhurke: I think you're on to something, son. Apollo: Okay, let's give it a shot. Each dial has six pictures... ...and there are four dials in all. The box should open once the pictures are arranged in the right order. Funky puzzle box... here comes Justice! Input tiger and dragon picture on top row, Khura'inese butterfly and mitamah picture on middle-top row, praying people and Holy Mother picture halves on middle-bottom row, and Holy Mother's spiritual blessing picture on bottom row Leads to: \"It opened!\" Input any other combination Apollo: It won't open. Dhurke: Maybe the pictures aren't in the right order. The case should open if the pictures are arranged properly, but... Apollo: I know. I should carefully consider which part of the song corresponds to which picture. Apollo: It opened! So this is the Founder's Orb... Dhurke: We did it, son! The orb is finally ours! Founder's Orb updated in the Court Record. Dhurke: At last, the Founder's Orb is ours! And it's all thanks to you, son! Well done! Then again, I'd expect nothing less from my boy! Apollo: Oh, uh, ha ha. It's no big deal. Dhurke: Don't sell yourself short! You may think it's nothing... ...but your insights and reasoning led us here. And I'd say that's truly impressive! Apollo: I don't know about that, ha ha ha. Dhurke: All those battles you fought in the courtroom have shaped you into the man you are today. And I couldn't be prouder! Apollo: ...W-Will you cut it out, already? (...Before I turn into a sun-ripened tomato.) Dhurke: With this orb, I can finally deliver a fatal blow to the Ga'ran regime. Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: So, how exactly do you plan on using it? You're not going to try to become a spirit medium, are you? Dhurke: Don't be ridiculous. I don't need supernatural powers like that. Apollo: So then, are you going to use it as a bargaining chip with Queen Ga'ran? Like demanding she abolishes the Defense Culpability Act? Dhurke: Well, the thought had crossed my mind, but... ...the main thing is returning this to the Kingdom of Khura'in. After all, as a sacred relic of Khura'inism, that is where it belongs. Apollo: Really? That's all you wanted to do? Dhurke: Mm-hm. Because my true objective has always been... ...to find out who asked Dr. Buff to study it and why. Apollo: I'm not sure I follow. Examine Box on altar Apollo: That was one fancy puzzle box. Dhurke: The fact that he chose to use such an elaborate box... ...makes me think that Dr. Buff must've had a rather playful side to him. Apollo: I can almost imagine him saying, \"Go ahead. Open it if you can.\" Talk The orb's significance Dhurke: The official story is that the orb was stolen from the Tehm'pul Temple treasure room. Apollo: Yeah, I heard about that on the news. They also said your group was behind the theft. Dhurke: That's not good... We're probably on an international most-wanted list now. ...Let me ask you something, Apollo: Who do YOU think really stole the orb? Apollo: Umm, I really haven't a clue. Dhurke: Well, I think it was one of the royals. Apollo: Really? Someone from the royal family? Dhurke: Yeah, and I've got a pretty good idea which one it was. Apollo: (He knows who it is?) Care to share your hunch? Dhurke: All I'll say at this point is this: Security is pretty tight, but the royals have unfettered access to the treasure room. Plus, they seem to be turning a blind eye to the orb's loss. Apollo: But why would a member of the royal family do that? Dhurke: ...That, I haven't figured out yet. But whatever the reason, it can't be good. I mean, a Khura'inese royal stealing a national treasure of such religious significance? And then pinning the crime on us, the Defiant Dragons? Apollo: Sounds like a conspiracy or something. Dhurke: I agree. And if the truth were to come to light, it would be a scandal of epic proportions. To allow a foreign national to study a treasure so sacred that it's off limits to the public... It would be seen as an utter sacrilege to those who truly revere the Holy Mother. Apollo: So if this were to go public, support for the Ga'ran regime would weaken. Dhurke: But that's not all. This is just a hunch, but I believe there's something even bigger here. Something that would explain why the orb was being studied in the first place. Something that would shake the Kingdom of Khura'in to its very core. And I'm going to find out what. Apollo: (.........He's probably right. His intuition is usually spot on.) Dhurke, why are you so bent on revolution, anyway? Is it to reform the legal system in Khura'in? Dhurke: There's that. But I'm  also doing this for my children... I want to save Nahyuta. Apollo: What do you mean? Dhurke: ...This is for your ears only. It's the other reason why this revolution needs to succeed. Nahyuta (appears after \"The orb's significance\") Apollo: Nahyuta... I never thought that our reunion would take place in a courtroom. Dhurke: Oh, so you've run into each other already. Apollo: Yeah, but it was like he was a different person. He used to be such a kind, cheerful kid -- always smiling and stuff. But now... He tried to convict Trucy for a crime she didn't even commit. Plus, he kept telling me I had a \"putrid mind\" and to \"let it go, and move on.\" Dhurke: Has it really gotten that bad? It must be Ga'ran's influence. He wasn't like that when he first stepped into the courtroom. Back then, he still had a keen sense of justice. \"I vow to bring the Ga'ran regime down and reform the legal system.\" Dhurke: That's what he swore to do... but that was also five years ago. He'd been the shining star of the Defiant Dragons, and our greatest hope. Apollo: Wait, Nahyuta was a Dragon? Dhurke: He was. But these days, he's more like Ga'ran's lapdog. Apollo: Talk about a complete about-face. Why would he do that? Dhurke: Something must have happened to him. Something that sparked a radical change. Still... I don't think he truly believes in the new path he's taken. It's not conviction that fills his heart; it's resignation and despair. Apollo: I-I see... Dhurke: ...The only thing I know for sure is... Nahyuta is suffering... and he is suffering in silence. Apollo: Nahyuta... is suffering...? Dhurke: Yes. He knows the rightful state of Khura'in's legal system... ...but something forces him to bend to Ga'ran's will, and it's tearing him apart. Apollo: But it's been five years. Do you really think he even still wants to reform the legal system? Dhurke: ...As long as he carries what I've taught him in his heart, I do. Dhurke's teachings (appears after \"Nahyuta\") Leads to: \"\"A dragon never yields.\" ...That's what you always told us.\" Present Founder's Orb Dhurke: The orb is ours at last! Apollo: I'm just glad we were able to make what you said in your broadcast a reality. Dhurke: Me, too. I didn't want to admit it before, but I was starting to have second thoughts about making such a big, bold move. I kept thinking, \"What would happen if we failed to get the orb?\" Apollo: Just another example of how a bluff can be the starting point in the quest for the truth. Dhurke: And what a hard-won truth it was. But I couldn't have done it without you, son. Apollo: \"A dragon never yields.\" ...That's what you always told us. Dhurke: That I did. It's a belief I've held since back when I was lawyer. [sic] The dragon stands at the pinnacle of the natural world. Nothing and no one can bend its will. Apollo: That's why we lawyers must pursue the truth like an unyielding dragon, right? We must fight for truth to the bitter end, no matter what it takes... (Dhurke and Mr. Wright... they have that much in common.) Dhurke: That's why I've held onto this badge, even though there are no more lawyers in Khura'in. I believe that one day, our legal system will return to its former glory. And this badge here is a testament to that belief. Apollo: ...Hmm... I wonder if Nahyuta still believes in what you taught us? Dhurke: He does. That much I'm sure of. A dragon never yields. Dhurke: I know that belief is etched deep in his heart. ...I'd bet my life on it. After all, he is my flesh and blood! Apollo: ............ (This unshakable faith and confidence... It's what draws people to him, whether they like it or not. ...Even people like me.) You know, I remember back when we were kids... ...Nahyuta used to say with great pride, \"I have the blood of the dragon within me.\" Dhurke: Yes, and that's why I want to free him. Free him from the poisonous clutches of the Ga'ran regime. Apollo: So that's your other reason for starting a revolution... Dhurke: Yes. I need to smack some sense into that boy of mine. I mean, what else are fathers for? Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: ...I... I wouldn't know.) Dhurke: Now that we have the orb, on to the next problem -- getting out of here. Apollo: Well, we're not going back the way we came. That's for sure. That hole we fell through is way too high to climb back up to. Dhurke: Actually, I have an idea. That lake water tastes salty, which means it must connect to the ocean. Apollo: W-Wait a second. You're not suggesting we SWIM our way out of here...? Dhurke: That's exactly what I'm suggesting. Apollo: But we have no idea how deep that lake goes. It's pitch black down there. Dhurke: Not a problem. Apollo: How is that not a problem? I mean, how do you even know if there's really a passage to the ocean? Dhurke: Well, one of us has to try, and I'm the better swimmer. Time's a wastin'! I'll be back before you know it, son. Apollo: Dhurke! ...He's gone. I sure hope he knows what he's doing. May 16Mt. Mitama - Kurainese Ruins Apollo: ......... (It's been twenty minutes. I hope he's okay.) What's going on? Uh-oh. Th-The water...! It's rising! And fast! Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! (N-Need... air...) *cough* *sputter* *cough* *cough* ...Ahhh! I don't know how to swim! If I don't grab onto something that floats...! .................. *cough* *sputter* *cough* *cough* ...This is bad! I-I better think of something -- quick! Examine Plastic bottle Apollo: Hey, maybe I can use this like an oxygen tank! ...Wait, what am I thinking?! I need to stay calm and be more rational about this! Driftwood Apollo: I've got it! As long as I hold onto this, I should be able to stay afloat! Stone altar Apollo: This is not good. The water's almost up to the top of the altar. It won't be long before it reaches the roof of the cave. Box on altar Apollo: The puzzle box is still at the base of the altar. It must've been designed to stay put, even at high tide. Wait, that's it! Dr. Buff must've gotten in here from some ocean-side entrance at low tide. That's why his footprints were leading OUT of the lake. So it really DOES connect to the ocean. Not that that helps. I'd drown before I made it out. Top of cavern Apollo: Nnrrgh... It's no use! The hole's still too high up! I'll have to find another way -- and quick -- before I drown! After examining plastic bottle, driftwood, box on altar, and top of cavern: Apollo: The water won't stop rising! Aaaah! I-I'm getting swept away! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh! Please...! STOPPPP! Examine Plastic bottle Apollo: If only that bottle were a little bigger, it'd store that much more air... No, it wouldn't make that much of a difference... I need to stop with these harebrained ideas, and come up with a real way to escape! Cavern ceiling Apollo: The water's almost to the top now. At this rate, I'll run out of breathing room! I'm a goner if I don't find a way out quick! Hole in cavern Leads to: \"The water's just high enough for me to reach the hole!\" Apollo: The water's just high enough for me to reach the hole! I'm saved! All I have to do is go back the way we came! The water might even lift me all the way back up, over that wall of rock! Here goes! ...Huh? The hole! It's full of rubble. The tunnel collapsing above must've filled it in after we fell through it. Nngh... This... This can't be happening! No, I can't give up now. I refuse to die here! Th-The water...! I can't--! *cough* *sputter* I can't... I can't... breathe... .................. (Is this... the end?) .................. (Dhurke... I wonder if he made it out.) .................. (So this is what it feels like to drown. I would've eaten that sushi if I'd known it would be my last meal. ...I feel like I've been through this before. ...Ah, now I remember. It was back when all three of us were living in that shack in the mountains. Nahyuta and I were playing by the riverside when we got swept up in the rapids.) Apollo: AAAAAAHHH! Nahyuta: AAAAAAAGH! Apollo: (I thought we were goners, but then...) Dhurke: Nahyuta! Apollo! Hold on! I'm coming! Apollo: ...*sniffle*... *sniffle*... *sniffle*... Wahhhhh!!! Nahyuta: Waaahhhh!!! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! That was a close one! Thought I'd lost you two! Apollo: I-I'm sorry, Dhuuuuuuurke! Dhurke: All right, that's enough now. Didn't I teach you that boys don't cry? Nahyuta: ...Thank you, Father. Apollo: *sniffle* *hiccup* *hiccup* Nahyuta: You... You could've been killed... But you risked your life... to save us... Why...? Dhurke: What a silly question. What father wouldn't risk his life to save his own children? Nahyuta, Apollo... Don't you ever hesitate to call when you need me. Understand? Apollo: ...Hey Dhurke? This isn't forever, right? You'll bring me back from America someday, right? Dhurke: Of course... I'll come pick you up as soon as things settle down here. Promise. Apollo: Okay! You promised! Apollo: ...Dhurke. I waited and waited. For the day you'd come and take me home. But you never came. That's why I tried to forget about you... ...and my life back in Khura'in. ...Dhurke... Why...? Why... didn't you...? .................. ..................... ???: A... ...lo... A... pol... lo...! Apollo! Can you hear me?! Apollo: *cough* *sputter* *cough* .........D-Dhurke? Dhurke: Still can't swim, eh? Apollo: You... You came back? But why? Dhurke: I said I'd come for you, didn't I? Apollo: Yeah... But you can't hold me and swim...! We're both going to...! Dhurke: Stop talking. You'll bite your tongue. Apollo: What? Whoa whoa whoa! (We're being pulled under! What's going on?! Why is this happeniiiiing?!) .................. May 16??? Apollo: *cough* ...Uuuuugh. Wh-Where...? ???: Ahh, you finally came to, son. Dhurke: Get your fill of seawater? Good thing your name's not Neptune, huh! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: D-Dhurke... Datz: Har har har har har har! You're telling me! Check it out, snot's coming out of his nose! Trucy: What a miraculous escape! Not even some of the escape-artist greats could pull that off! Apollo: ...Wh-What on earth happened? Dhurke: Sorry it took me so long, son. I made it to the ocean, but I figured you still couldn't swim. So I found a local fisherman and had him take us out near the undersea cavern. He tied a rope to me, and I came and grabbed you. Then he yanked me back. Apollo: Oh, so that's what pulled us under with such force. Trucy: Don't forget about me! I assisted in your escape act, too, Polly! Dhurke: I've helped compatriots escape from all sorts of places -- mountain jails, island prisons... But an undersea cavern? Now that was a first! Apollo: ......... (Dhurke... He risked his life for me.) .........Dhurke. I'm only alive because of you. ...Thank you. Dhurke: Oh, uh... Y-You're welcome. I, uh... just did what any father would do for his son. Apollo: (.........He saved my life yet again.) *growl* ...Um... Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! I guess seawater doesn't make for much of a meal! Trucy: It's 'cause Polly didn't have any sushi! Apollo: (Oh, yeah. I haven't eaten anything since this morning.) Datz: ...Oh, that's right! Hey, AJ! Dhurke had me buy this for ya. Apollo: ! Dhurke: Thought you might be hungry. Ready to have some this time around? Apollo: .........Yeah. Thanks! *chomp* *nom nom nom* Oh wow, this is delicious! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Glad you approve! I'd better get some before you eat them all! *chomp* *chew chew chew* Apollo: (Just like old times. Dhurke used to slice up the fish he caught, and we'd all eat fresh sashimi together. He used to talk about all the vitamins and minerals packed in the raw fish.) Datz: *chomp* *munch munch munch* Hey, by the way! Lemme see that orb, AJ! Apollo: Here you go. Datz: Hoa, so that's what it looks like! Trucy: You found the legendary treasure! Nice work, Polly! Apollo: Thanks. ...Guess you could say, mission accomplished! Dhurke: With the orb, our revolution can take a big step forward. Let's celebrate the eve of our revolution! We'll all get dressed up and feast till dawn! Datz: Yeah! Now you're talkin'! Time to party! Apollo: ......... (After all that? I just want to go to bed. Sure wish Nahyuta was here. Maybe one day, we'll enjoy times like these together again. ...The revolution. If it can bring back those happy days... ...you can sign me up for--) ???: Sorry to interrupt your little party, but I'm here for my crystal. Staff: Right, left, right, left, HALT! Apollo: Ah! It's him again! Atishon: Heh heh heh. Well done. Then again, I always knew you could do it. After all, we politicians must be excellent judges of character. Still, I'm impressed you both made it out of there alive. Apollo: ...W-Wait a second. YOU'RE the one who shoved us into that pit? Atishon: It sounds so bad when you say it like that. All I did was give you a little nudge in the right direction. Dhurke: ...So... it was you... ............................................................... You no good, son of a--! Atishon: ...EEP! D-Don't look at me like that! The Crystal of Ami Fey is mine! Now, hand it over! Dhurke: Over my dead body! Atishon: EEK! Detective! Help! Ema: Yeah yeah, I know. Apollo: Ema? What's going on here? Ema: He filed a police report. He claims you're trying to steal his family heirloom. Atishon: Th-That's him! The one with the long hair! Arrest him this instant! He's the thief that made off with the Atishon family's most precious heirloom! Ema: Well, I suppose I should ask you to come in for questioning. Dhurke: Down at the police station? I... think I'll pass. After all, Mr. Atishon seems bent on having me arrested on theft charges. Apollo: (This is not good! If Dhurke gets arrested, he'll be sent back to Khura'in to face execution!) Ema: Sorry, but now that I know you have the crystal, or orb as you call it, I must insist. Will you please come with me, sir? Apollo: Apollo: Ema! I'm afraid I can't let you take Dhurke in! He received the orb from Dr. Buff in a perfectly legal transaction. Ema: Is that so? Can you prove it? Apollo: Of course. This should sufficiently prove that the orb now belongs to Dhurke. Present Orb Transfer Agreement Apollo: Leads to: \"Take a look at this agreement.\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: Look at this! It's proof that the orb is Dhurke's. Ema: Umm... All this proves is you're completely our of your mind. Apollo: Oops... (I guess that wasn't it.) But the doctor definitely transferred it over to us. Leads back to: \"This should sufficiently prove that the orb now belongs to Dhurke.\" Apollo: Take a look at this agreement. Ema: What do we have here? Let's see... \"I agree to hand over the Founder's Orb to the Defiant Dragons if I will come to no harm.\" Hmm... It appears to be a perfectly legal agreement. Atishon: Not so fast! That's not the Founder's Orb! It's the Crystal of Ami Fey, which means their agreement is null and void! Ema: Hmm, this is going nowhere fast. Apollo: You can say that again. ???: Then it will just have to go to trial. Right, Apollo? Apollo: M-M-Mr. Wright? Trucy: Daddy! Phoenix: What's with you two? You look like you just saw a ghost. Apollo: (...Oh yeah. Ema mentioned she had seen him around.) ...Um, what're you doing in Kurain Village, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Mr. Atishon has retained me as his lawyer. Apollo: Wait, you're his... lawyer? Examine Mountains Apollo: You can see Mt. Mitama from here. We're lucky we found the Founder's Orb, and even luckier we got out of there alive. I hope I never have to go through anything like that again. Talk Legal advisor Apollo: Mr. Wright, why are you serving as Mr. Atishon's lawyer? Phoenix: Because he hired me. He needed my help in getting a family heirloom back from Dr. Buff. And it seems he correctly foresaw that something like this might happen. Atishon: It's because those shifty insurgents were harassing poor Dr. Buff. So I knew I might need a lawyer if things went south. I figured with a celebrated lawyer like Phoenix Wright, I couldn't go wrong. Apollo: Is this what you came back from Khura'in for, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: It was just good timing. My work over there just happened to wrap up, so here I am. Plus... Mr. Atishon is a very important client. Apollo: (They know each other? But I've never heard Mr. Wright mention his name before.) The Crystal of Ami Fey Apollo: Mr. Wright, are you sure this is Mr. Atishon's family heirloom? Phoenix: That's my client's assertion. He says it's the Crystal of Ami Fey. Apparently, it's the crystal she once used when channeling spirits. Apollo: Who's Ami Fey? Phoenix: She brought Khura'inese channeling to Japan, and her descendants brought it here. Her true origins are still rather murky... ...but what's clear is she is the founder of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Apollo: Oh, so she's like the one they call the founder in Khura'in -- the Holy Mother. Present Anything Phoenix: I'd think you would have more pressing things to ask me about. Apollo: Y-Yeah... (I'd better ask what I can while I can.) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ...Apollo, I don't plan to betray my client's confidence. I may not know all the facts yet, but I do know we won't be handing the crystal over to you. Apollo: What? Are you saying...? Phoenix: .................. I'm really sorry it's come to this, but... Apollo: Mr. Wright? I don't understand. Phoenix: Let me spell it out then. If you continue to claim that the crystal belongs to your client... ...then I will be seeing you in court. Apollo: Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! Trucy: ...Wh-What's gotten into you, Daddy? Phoenix: Nothing. This is strictly business. Atishon: Heh heh heh. Two lawyers from the same firm facing off? What are the odds! Lucky for me, I believe I have the \"right\" man for the job! What ever are you going to do? Remember, he IS your boss. Apollo: Ngrrrgh... (How did it come to this?!) M-Mr. Wright! Please! Don't do this! Phoenix: Apollo, there's no point in arguing about it here... ...when it's now clear we're headed to court. That's where we'll find out who the crystal really belongs to. Apollo: (I don't believe it. Am I really going to face Mr. Wright in court?) Trucy: Daddy! Apollo! No! We can't have our agency's talent competing against each other! Phoenix: It's too late, Trucy. The die has been cast. We each have to fight for our clients' best interests. Trucy: B-But... Phoenix: So, what's it going to be, Apollo. Are we going to have to take this to trial? Apollo: (I have to battle Mr. Wright in court? THE legendary Phoenix Wright? No matter how many trials of his I've watched... ...no matter how dire the situation, he's always pulled out a win in the end. Can I do it? Can I really take on the man whose footsteps I've been following in...? I owe it to Dhurke to at least try. I... What should I do?) Battle Mr. Wright Leads to: \"There's no turning back now.\" Throw in the towel Apollo: (I can't do this. I mean, how can I go up against a man like him? I couldn't possibly win! ...But do I really want to give up without a fight? If I do, I'll be forever walking in his shadow! Plus, I'd be letting Dhurke down! And I can't let that happen!) Leads to: \"There's no turning back now.\" Apollo: (There's no turning back now.) If it's a trial you want, Mr. Wright, I'm more than happy to oblige! I'm ready to fight for my client... ...even if it means facing off against you! Phoenix: .................................... .................. ...All right. I won't be pulling any punches, either, Apollo. The kid gloves are officially off. May the best attorney win. Apollo: You got it! Trucy: Whoa whoa whoa! First Daddy, now you! Polly! You're not seriously... Apollo: ...Sorry, Trucy. But I have to do this. Phoenix: .................. Apollo... All right, then, I'd better go prepare for tomorrow. See you in court. Trucy: Daddy, no! Wait! Dhurke: A fine mess I've gotten you into, son. I mean, of all the lawyers we could've faced, it had to be him? He's practically a celebrity in Khura'in now. They're calling him the Fighting Phoenix. Apollo: ...I-I'll be fine! (After all, I've come a long way, too! Who knows? I could even end up winning. There's always a chance...... right?) Dhurke: You know, this may be a blessing in disguise. If the trial proves what we found is indeed the Founder's Orb... ...then whoever asked Dr. Buff to study it may be revealed, too. This is our chance to finally pull them out of the shadows! Apollo: ...The first step of your revolution, huh? Dhurke: Yes. The revolution to restore Khura'in to its former glory, and save Nahyuta's soul! Apollo: Dhurke... I swear to fight as hard as I can in court to make that a reality. We're going to win this one. You'll see. Dhurke: I know you can do it... son. Apollo: (It doesn't matter that I'll be going up against Mr. Wright. I have to win this for Dhurke... ...and for Nahyuta. His salvation, along with all of Khura'in, depends on it!) To be continued Nothing to examine during investigation Apollo: Nothing particularly interesting here. Area already examined Apollo: We've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around. Nothing to examine during fingerprinting session Apollo: Doesn't look like there are any prints here. Examine insignificant area on evidence Apollo: (Nothing particularly interesting here.) Consult (while opening puzzle box) Apollo: Hmm, this is harder than I imagined. I thought all we had to do was arrange the pictures according to the song. Dhurke: It's times like these you have to think outside the puzzle-box. Sometimes the truth can only be found when you look at things from a different angle. Apollo: A different angle? (Come to think of it, one of the pictures from the song is missing. Does this mean the pictures don't line up exactly one-to-one?) Turnabout Revolution Image Gallery Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 May 17, 10:08 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Trucy: Just so you know... I'm not going to take sides! Apollo: Message received, loud and clear. Trucy: Good, because I don't like this one bit! You and Daddy should be on the same team! Apollo: S-Sorry, Trucy... (Wow, she's really mad.) Dhurke: I'm sorry, too, little lady. This is all my fault. Trucy: I'm just worried things will never be the same between Daddy and Apollo... ...if they go through with this. Dhurke: Is that all? Well, I wouldn't worry about that. That's the way it is with us men. We may fight, but we don't burn bridges. Trucy: Really? Dhurke: Sure. One minute we're trading blows, and the next, we're having drinks together. We're simple creatures at heart. Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Trucy: I sure hope you're right... Athena: Sorry I'm late, Apollo! Apollo: Athena! There you are! What happened with you and Mr. Wright yesterday? Athena: O-Oh, about that... I ended up going to the wrong airport. I was waiting there, thinking his flight was really late... and before I knew it, I dozed off. By the time I woke up, it was already dark. Apollo: I figured something like that had happened. Being late and dozing off are the two things you do best. Athena: Ugh. Guilty as charged. Apollo: So then, I take it you have no idea what today's case is about? Athena: Not a clue. Sorry... Um, what IS today's case about, if I might ask? Another locked-room mystery? A suspect with a flimsy alibi? Ooh, or a dying message? Apollo: Sorry, strike three, you're out. It's a civil case. Athena: ...A civil case? Apollo: You act like I'm speaking Swahili here. Athena: It's just, the Wright Anything Agency specializes in criminal law, or so I thought. In civil cases, there are no prosecutors, right? Instead, both parties retain an attorney. Apollo: Right. And the other attorney is someone you know very well. Athena: Really? Who? Bailiff: The trial will begin shortly. Please proceed to the courtroom at once. Apollo: (...Okay, let's do this!) Athena: Apollo, wait. Who's the other attorney? And where is Mr. Wright? Apollo: No time to explain. Let's go. Athena: O-Okay! Right behind you! May 17, 10:30 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 6 Judge: Court is now in session. Oh, um... Uh, is this some sort of practice session? A mock trial, perhaps? Apollo: Um... no. No, it's not, Your Honor. Phoenix: It's the real deal, Your Honor. Judge: Hmm... So then you two have had a falling out? I won't have you use my courtroom for that, you know! Apollo: I-It's nothing like that, Your Honor! Phoenix: Exactly. It just so happens that we have different clients in this case. Judge: I see... Well, here's to hoping this has no adverse effect on your working relationship. Athena: You can say that again! I had no idea we'd be going up against the boss today! Ugh... You sure this is a good idea, Apollo? Apollo: ...What? Do you want to switch sides? Athena: Honestly, I'd rather be anywhere but here right now. Apollo: (Well, at least she IS here. I'm really going to need her help.) Phoenix: ...Mr. Justice. Apollo: Yes?! Phoenix: Don't expect me to pull any punches just because you're the opposing lawyer. As I said, the kid gloves are off, and come what may, they'll stay off. Apollo: ...Same here, Mr. Wright! If it's a fight you want, it's a fight you'll get! Phoenix: .................. Apollo: .................. Athena: Yeesh, you guys are really chomping at the bit, aren't you? Judge: Hmm... I don't mind a good fight between co-workers. Just keep this civil case civil. Now then, if the plaintiff would take the stand, we may begin. Staff: Right, left, right, left, HALT! Atishon: Noble judge, members of the gallery! Good day to you! I am Paul Atishon! This is but the start of my epic campaign! And you all have the honor of witnessing it! I believe the youth of this country are our very future. Too long have they been looked down on and given the cold shoulder! So, to them I say! Ask not what you can do for your country! Ask what you can do for me! Judge: M-Mr. Atishon! What is that crazy contraption you're riding in?! Atishon: Heh heh heh. It's my custom-made, election-winning campaign mobile. Beautiful, isn't it? Judge: You're at a witness stand, not a campaign podium. So come out of there this instant! Atishon: Feh... Judge: All right. Now, would the plaintiff's attorney, Mr. Wright... ...please explain the complaint filed against the defendant. Phoenix: Mr. Atishon's complaint against the defendant is simple. The defendant, one Dhurke Sahdmadhi... ...stole my client's family heirloom -- the Crystal of Ami Fey. Mr. Atishon merely seeks its return. Atishon: This wouldn't have happened if that archeologist hadn't kicked the bucket. Judge: ...I see. Well, Mr. Justice, let's have your opening statement, if you would. Apollo: The defense asserts the item in question is the Founder's Orb, a sacred relic from Khura'in. Judge: Hmm... Go on. Apollo: It seems someone asked an archeologist -- Dr. Archie Buff -- to study the orb. Dr. Buff determined that it was a Khura'inese national treasure known as the Founder's Orb. The very orb that was stolen from a treasure room in Khura'in several weeks ago. Judge: Why yes, I saw a news report about that! The theft of a Khura'inese national treasure caused quite an uproar in the kingdom. Apollo: Well, we believe it was not, in fact, a theft in the traditional sense. But rather, that it was spirited out of Khura'in by someone for Dr. Buff to study. Judge: You don't say... And...? Apollo: Around that time, an acquaintance of the defendant learned of Dr. Buff. He made contact with the doctor, who agreed to hand over the orb. Apparently, the doctor wanted nothing to do with it once he'd learned it had been stolen. Judge: Hmm... It seems you even have a transfer agreement between both parties. Apollo: Mr. Sahdmadhi also agreed to return the Founder's Orb to the Kingdom of Khura'in... ...once the doctor verified it was the real thing. Judge: I see... So this dispute centers on... ...whether the item is the Founder's Orb or the Crystal of Ami Fey. That, in turn, will determine the object's rightful owner. Apollo: (I'd better bring my A game. Going up against Mr. Wright won't be a walk in the park.) Judge: Hmm... Come to think of it, the name Dhurke Sahdmadhi sounds awfully familiar. But I can't recall where I've heard it. Apollo: ...Oh. umm, it's probably your imagination, Your Honor. He's just a tourist, after all. Judge: Hmm... My imagination, you say? Athena: Are you sure about this, Apollo? He's a wanted criminal in Khura'in, isn't he? Apollo: ...In Khura'in, yes. Here, he's just a tourist. Judge: Very well, let's begin the proceedings. Bailiff, would you bring in the first witness? Apollo: ...Ema? Ema: Show some manners. We're in court. Apollo: I know, it's just... This is a civil trial, so I was surprised to see a detective take the stand. Phoenix: I had her do some digging on Dr. Buff. Apollo: (What for?) Ema: You disappoint me, Apollo. First, you know I'm not just a detective. I'm a forensic scientist. Do try to remember that. Second, you owe Mr. Wright an apology. After all he's done for you, you have some nerve! Apollo: First, I'm sorry. And second, I'm really just trying to do my job. Ema: You'll never get anywhere with that attitude. Take some advice from someone who's been there. Apollo: Why do I feel like I'm on trial here? Judge: Detective Skye, your testimony, if you please. Witness Testimony -- The Doctor's Dark Secret -- Ema: The police have had their eye on Dr. Buff for some time. And just today, a number of stolen artifacts were discovered in his study. Among them were a priceless urn and a statue that were stolen from the Fey clan. It seems the doctor would do anything to study artifacts, including steal them. As for the relic at the center of this dispute, he likely stole it from the Atishon residence. Apollo: The doctor... is a thief? Why am I just hearing about this now? Ema: Well, \"cat burglar\" isn't something he'd put on his résumé. He was more careful than that. But the fact is, he was a classic treasure hunter. Athena: A treasure hunter, huh... Like people who have thrilling adventures in exotic places, risking life and limb for glory? Apollo: I doubt Dr. Buff was the star of his own hit movie series, Athena. Phoenix: Out of respect for the dead, I will say that Dr. Buff wasn't doing it to get rich. Apparently, he only wanted to borrow artifacts to study them. He would then return them as soon as his research was finished. Ema: According to the doctor's child... ...he would even repair or restore some of the artifacts he stole before returning them. He believed he was honoring the dead by discovering their history through artifacts. But whatever lofty ideals he had, it makes no difference. Larceny is larceny. Judge: Yes, he certainly sounds no different than a regular thief to me. Apollo: So, let's say for a moment that the doctor really did moonlight in stealing artifacts... Might he not have stolen the Founder's Orb in Khura'in and brought it back here himself? Phoenix: Nope. There's no records of him traveling overseas over the past few years. Plus, he couldn't very well leave his reclusive child at home all alone. Judge: Hmm... Then this really must be the Crystal of Ami Fey. Phoenix: Yes. He stole it from the Atishon residence, probably so he could study it. Apollo: ......... (This is the left hook I did not need.) Athena: I bet you never saw that coming, Apollo. Apollo: Yeah, when Mr. Wright said the kid gloves were off, he wasn't kidding. Phoenix: ......... Judge: Mr. Justice, you may proceed with your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- The Doctor's Dark Secret -- Ema: The police have had their eye on Dr. Buff for some time. Press Apollo: Apollo: How exactly did Dr. Buff arouse the suspicion of the police anyway? Ema: Chalk it up to good, old-fashioned sleuthing. After investigating countless artifact thefts over the years... ...the police finally zeroed in on him, and the doctor became their prime suspect. Phoenix: A number of those artifact thefts occurred in Kurain Village, too, if I might add. And they started right around the time the doctor moved there. Apollo: But he was never arrested. I take it there was nothing concrete linking him to a crime? Ema: No. Which is why we were never able to get a search warrant in the first place. It's hard to arrest artifact thieves unless you catch them red-handed. Still, the police had him under constant surveillance. Ema: And just today, a number of stolen artifacts were discovered in his study. Press Apollo: Apollo: Are you sure these allegedly stolen artifacts are the real deal? Ema: They're not fakes, that's for sure. Take the urn, for example. Apparently, it's an extremely intricate work of art. Its design, cracks, and other features would be impossible to replicate perfectly. Phoenix: Actually, I've had a few run-ins with that urn myself. So I was shocked to see it there in the doctor's study. I can say without a doubt, that that urn was stolen from the Fey clan. Apollo: I-I see... Judge: Detective Skye, please continue your testimony, if you would. Ema: Among them were a priceless urn and a statue that were stolen from the Fey clan. Press Apollo: Apollo: Were any other stolen artifacts found besides those belonging to the Feys? Ema: Yes. For instance... Remember the large relief on the wall? It was chiseled out some ancient ruins in the Kingdom of Khura'in several years ago. Apollo: Ch-Chiseled out...? Didn't that damage it? Ema: Well, he did restore the parts that were so faded you could barely see them anymore. It seems he intended to return it someday, so one could say his intentions were good. But good intentions are no get-out-of-jail-free card. That's a fact. Phoenix: If I might add, with respect for the deceased... ...the quality of the restorations was apparently exceptional. It seems the doctor invested a lot of money in hiring an extremely talented specialist. Athena: He sounds like a good man... who took a wrong turn somewhere. Apollo: (I guess Sarge takes after him in that way.) Ema: Any further questions? If not... Ema: It seems the doctor would do anything to study artifacts, including steal them. Press Apollo: Apollo: Had these alleged thefts been going on for some time? Ema: At least five years, as far as we can tell. All the recent thefts had been local... ...but before moving to Kurain Village, he had been stealing from ruins around the world. Apollo: (Dr. Buff was an international criminal?) Ema: This data lends itself to but one conclusion: Dr. Buff was a thief. Ema: As for the relic at the center of this dispute, he likely stole it from the Atishon residence. Press Apollo: Apollo: You claim he stole a family heirloom from the Atishon residence. But claiming something doesn't make it true. Ema: Unfortunately, it IS true. Apollo: How can you be so sure? Ema: A police report was filed concerning the theft -- one year ago, in fact. Apollo: What?! A whole year ago? Ema: August 25 of last year, to be exact. The report state, and I quote... \"The Crystal of Ami Fey was discovered to be missing... ...from the Atishon storehouse at 10 AM. The storehouse lock had been picked. Signed, Paul Atishon-Wimperson.\" Judge: Well, a year-old report certainly lends the the plaintiff's claim credence. The doctor could really have stolen the Crystal of Ami Fey. Phoenix: Not only that, Your Honor... ...but the Founder's Orb was only found to be missing several weeks ago. That is nearly a year after the crystal's theft was reported. Therefore, I believe we must consider the orb and the crystal to be two separate items. Apollo: ......... Athena: Paul Atishon-Wimperson? Not the most awe-inspiring tail end, is it? I see why he cut it. Apollo: Not that he inspires confidence without it. Still, I'd probably do the same in his shoes. Robbery Report added to the Court Record. Press (subsequent times) Apollo: Apollo: This police report say say the \"Crystal of Ami Fey,\" but... ...how do you know it's this relic right here? Ema: Because Mr. Atishon has stated as much. Apollo: (...Well, I'm not buying it.) Athena: Apollo, I was thinking... The plaintiff's legal name is pretty distinctive. Paul Atishon-Wimperson... Do we have any evidence related to his initials or his name? Apollo: We just might. It might even point out a flaw in something Ema said. Athena: You think her logic's faulty? Apollo: Yeah. If the doctor stole the relic from Mr. Atishon... er, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson... ...then there's one thing the doctor did that doesn't make any sense. Athena: Especially if Paul Atishon-Wimperson was desperately searching for his stolen relic. Apollo: (Okay, time to go over the evidence again.) Present E-Mail (after pressing fifth statement) Apollo: Leads to: \"The doctor stole the relic from the plaintiff?\" Before pressing fifth statement Athena: The trial's barely started and we're already backed into a corner. Apollo: To make matters worse the judge seems to agree with the plaintiff's case. But we've still got to give it our all. After pressing fifth statement Athena: A police report was filed about the crystal's theft a year ago. Apollo: But the theft of the Founder's Orb was only reported a few weeks ago. So the crystal's report was filed way before the orb was found missing. Athena: That suggests the stolen relic is the Crystal of Ami Fey, as Mr. Atishon-Wimperson asserts. Hmm... I doubt the police report is a fake. After all, Ema is the one who submitted it as evidence. Apollo: (Still, I feel like something we learned in the police report is important somehow...) Apollo: The doctor stole the relic from the plaintiff? Are you sure? Because that statement doesn't agree with a certain piece of evidence. Ema: What do you mean? Apollo: Take a look at this. Ema: What about it? Apollo: This contains an e-mail from the doctor's computer. Judge: ...E-mail? In that little piece of plastic? ......... I'm afraid I don't understand. Apollo: Oh, umm... This stick here can store all sorts of computer data. Judge: I still don't get it. Apollo: H-Here, just look at this! Apparently, the doctor was reporting his research findings to a certain individual. Now, take a look at this. It's the police report that Detective Skye presented to this court. You can see the plaintiff's legal name on it. Paul Atishon-Wimperson. Judge: I can see why'd he drop \"Wimperson\" from his name, but that's hardly breaking news. Apollo: Look closer, Your Honor. Phoenix: .........Ah! H-His initials! Apollo: Right. The plaintiff's full legal name is Paul Atishon-Wimperson. Now consider this... The e-mail's recipient address starts with three letters. Ema: P-A-W...? Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Don't tell me--! Apollo: Oh, but I will anyway. The individual who hired the doctor to study the disputed item... ...is none other than Paul Atishon-Wimperson. Ema: Wait, th-then that means... Apollo: Exactly. He wouldn't have asked the man who stole his family heirloom to study it. Therefore, how could this possibly be the Crystal of Ami Fey?! Ema: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! ...We never checked the doctor's e-mails. We couldn't even figure out the password to his computer. Apollo: The plaintiff willingly left the orb in the doctor's care so he could study it... ...at the behest of his \"benefactor\"! Ema: ...Wait. Then what about the police report? I have all the details of the theft right here! Apollo: It's probably for another relic -- the real Crystal of Ami Fey. He's just using the report as a way to claim that our orb is actually his stolen crystal. Phoenix: Phoenix: And how are you certain that \"PAW\" refers to my client's initials? Maybe the e-mail's recipient was a dog lover. Apollo: Perhaps. So let's get to know your client a little better, shall we? Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson! Atishon: Feh. I suppose shutting down detractors is all part of a politician's job. Apollo: Answer me this, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson: what is... Your shoe size? Apollo: What's your shoe size? Atishon: How should I know? Apollo: Wait, you don't know your own shoe size? Atishon: I have all my shoes handcrafted in Italy. And the shoemaker comes to my residence to take the necessary measurements. I have better things to do than memorize trivial information like that. Apollo: (Makes we wish I'd memorized the Italian for \"entitled jerk.\") Judge: Maybe this will help you memorize what happens to those who waste the court's time. Apollo: (I really put my foot in it this time.) Athena: Apollo, no matter what his shoe size is, there wouldn't be enough digits. We're looking for a three-digit number. Apollo: Oh, right. Let's see... Leads back to: \"Answer me this, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson: what is...\" Your favorite food? Apollo: What's your favorite food? Atishon: Curry rice. It's an old family favorite. Apollo: Really? As in, boil up some rice and dump some curry sauce on top? THAT curry rice? Atishon: Heh, I bet you assumed I would say French cuisine... ...just because I'm a member of the political elite. But nothing beats the delectable curry recipe my ancestors bright over from Japan. And I'm the kind of representative who upholds the value of such traditions! Apollo: (Is his entire strategy really just to pander to \"traditional values\" voters?) Judge: Your penalty is served, Mr. Justice. Let this be some food for thought! Athena: Apollo, why don't we take another look at the e-mail address? Apollo: No, it's fine! I just need another crack at this. Leads back to: \"Answer me this, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson: what is...\" Your birthday? Leads to: \"What is your birthday?\" Apollo: What is your birthday? Atishon: My birthday? It's July 11th, but what's it to you? (Changed from [My birthday? It's July 11, but what's it to you?] in the original release) ...Oh, I see. You can address birthday gifts to my office. But, full disclosure... I only accept gifts valued at one thousand dollars or more. (Changed from [But, full disclosure... I only accept gifts valued at $1,000 or more.] in the original release) Phoenix: ......... Judge: ......... Atishon: ...Hm? Why has everyone gone silent? Apollo: (How can anyone be that self-centered? Oh, right... politician.) Did everyone hear that? He said, \"July 11th.\" (Changed from [He said, 'July 11.'] in the original release) July 11 -- or rather, \"711\" -- matches the numbers in the e-mail address. Both the name and birthday are a match! I hardly think that's a coincidence! Atishon: .........Wait... Why you sneaky little--! Apollo: (Looks like someone finally decided to join the conversation.) Would the plaintiff care to explain? Atishon: I-I would like to say... that is q-quite... Apollo: Quite what? Atishon: Q-Quite... a thing... you've said. ......... Apollo Um... Any other thoughts? Atishon: No further comments. I stand by my previous statement. Apollo: Apollo: You can't just walk away. Even politicians have to explain themselves in a court of law! Atishon: ...I'm afraid I simply don't know how it happened. I can't possibly explain matters out of my purview. Perhaps it was a mistake on the part of my secretary? Apollo: (Oh no you don't, you slippery eel.) Mr. Wright, would you care to respond? Phoenix: ...I won't argue your assertion. My client lent the treasure in question to the doctor and asked him to study it. It seems that much is a fact. Apollo: (Now we're getting somewhere!) Phoenix: However, it has no bearing on the issue of ownership. Apollo: ...How so? Phoenix: Mr. Atishon, I fully understand your position here. You HAD to hide the fact that you sent the crystal out to be studied. Your family would've been very upset if they had found out. It's a family heirloom, after all. Apollo: You've got to be kidding me! Atishon: Mr. Wright is, well, right, of course. But then, he always is. That's why he's my lawyer. The crystal is a precious Atishon family heirloom, and has been for centuries. But Dr. Buff was so eager to study its proud heritage, I just couldn't say no. I didn't even tell my grandfather. Apollo: Apollo: But in order to win the backing of your so-called \"benefactor\"... ...you were going to give what you claim to be the Crystal of Ami Fey to that person? You were going to give a precious family heirloom away, just like that? Atishon: ...I-I was going to explain everything to grandfather later! Honest! Phoenix: My client's grandfather is very proud of his grandson for following in his footsteps. And if refusing him would've meant dashing the dreams of his darling grandson... ...I doubt the kindly old man could've said no. Judge: Well, grandchildren ARE meant to be spoiled. That's what grandfathers are for. Apollo: Your Honor... Please. (I mean, it's been in the family for centuries.) Atishon: My grandfather thinks highly of my talents as a politician. That's why he entrusted me with this very important name placard today. So I'm sure he would've been okay with me using the crystal as I saw fit. Apollo: (Grrr... Grandpa's spoiled little brat.) Athena: I think the judge is buying it, Apollo. Apollo: No surprise there. He's always going on and on about his own grandchild, after all. Ema: ...Excuse me. Can I leave now, Mr. Wright? I believe my work here is done. Phoenix: By all means, Detective Skye. Thank you for your assistance. Ema: You're welcome. It's nice to testify at a civil trial once in a while. See you around. Judge: Hmm... It seems the facts have changed somewhat. Mr. Atishon-Wimperson apparently lent his family heirloom to Dr. Buff. Mr. Justice. How would the defense like to proceed? Apollo: Oh, umm... (All right, now what?) Athena: Apollo, let's hear what what they know about this so-called \"Crystal of Ami Fey.\" Maybe we can find some inconsistencies in their statements. Apollo: Right... Okay then, Mr. Wright. If the item in question really is an Atishon family heirloom... ...then let's hear all your client knows about it. Phoenix: ...Of course. Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Please tell the defense everything you know about the crystal's origin. Atishon: All right. Now then, listen and learn. This is the tale of the Crystal of Ami Fey, and the illustrious history of the Atishon clan! Are you ready? Our story begins back in the old country, when the Atishon family reigned supreme... Witness Testimony -- The Illustrious History of the Atishon Clan -- Atishon: My ancestor was praised as a benevolent ruler. He protected the spirit mediums, a minority back then, from the rest of the locals. Some discriminated against them, you see, while others tried to abuse their power. As thanks, Ami Fey gave the crystal she had specially made as a gift to him. I am a descendent of that great lord. As such, my political power and influence is backed by centuries of history! Apollo: (Well, that devolved into a great load of self-aggrandizing propaganda fast.) Phoenix: As you can see... ...the Crystal of Ami Fey is an heirloom of the esteemed House of Atishon. Apollo: And you have proof that it has always been in the Atishon family? Phoenix: ...I have someone who gave a statement to that effect. My client's neighbor -- one Ives Shineto, age eighty-five -- gave the following statement: (Changed from [My client's neighbor -- one Ives Shineto, age 85 -- gave the following statement:] in the original release) \"The Atishons showed me the Crystal back when I was but a lad.\" Apollo: Apollo: Can we really trust the memory of an old man? Phoenix: ...Mr. Justice. Would you care you to explain that statement to the judge? Apollo: Oh... Er, I didn't mean-- What I'm trying to say is, um... Judge: Never underestimate the memory of your elders. I may forget my verdicts the next day, but the memories of my past are clear as day! Therefore, I find Mr. Ives Shineto's statement to be perfectly credible. Athena: Wow, did you see how Mr. Wright got the judge on his side? That's definitely a trick I want up my sleeve. Apollo: *sigh* You're not helping, Athena... Judge: You may cross-examine the witness, Mr. Justice. Cross Examination -- The Illustrious History of the Atishon Clan -- Atishon: My ancestor was praised as a benevolent ruler. Press Apollo: Apollo: Um, that object you set down there... Is it something of importance to you? Atishon: It's a name placard. This one here belonged to my grandfather, Abraham Atishon. He had it custom-made during his distinguished political career. It's special because it was crafted from the finest Italian plastic. Apollo: (I wasn't aware the Italians were famous for their fine plastic...) Atishon: Heh heh heh. You can touch it if you want. Apollo: No, I'm fine. Atishon: Very well. I'll just continue with my testimony. My ancestor was praised as a benevolent ruler. But he was also an eminent politician. Atishon: He protected the spirit mediums, a minority back then, from the rest of the locals. Press Apollo: Apollo: So I take it the relationship with the Fey clan was a close one. Atishon: A smooth and open line of communication with my entire electorate... That is the Paul Atishon way. Apollo: Huh...? Oh, sorry. I was asking about your ancestor. Atishon: Heh. Whether it's about me or my ancestor... ...feel free to ask me anything you'd like. Transparency in government! That's the Paul Atishon way. Apollo: (More like: Dodging questions! That's the Paul Atishon way.) Thanks. I'll be sure to ask when I have something you'll actually answer. Atishon: As I was saying, the Atishon family protected the Fey spirit mediums back then. Atishon: Some discriminated against them, you see, while others tried to abuse their power. Press Apollo: Apollo: Spirit mediums were targets of discrimination? Atishon: Yes. Some people even treated them like they were monsters. The transformation the mediums underwent when channeling spirits frightened the locals. And then there were those who tried to use them. Apollo: You mean they sought to control the channeling powers of the mediums? Atishon: Discriminating against a minority is absolutely despicable. A vote for me is a vote to end discrimination. I vow to root it out wherever it may be! That is my promise to you! Athena: He's totally ignoring your questions. It's like you're a moderator at a political debate. Apollo: Yeah, and only HE cares about his talking points. As thrilling as your campaign is, could we please get back to your testimony? Atishon: Feh. As you wish. Now then, as for the Crystal of Ami Fey... Atishon: As thanks, Ami Fey gave the crystal she had specially made as a gift to him. Press Apollo: Apollo: You said she had it made. So then it was made in Japan? Atishon: That's right. They say she hired a famous craftsman to make it. And they say it's quite valuable, too. Apollo: And you were going to take such a priceless family heirloom... ...and just give it to your patron? Atishon: Feh. That's so typical of you ignorant, common types. Making difficult decisions when the chips are down is what being a politician is all about. Apollo: (But only when it's in service of your own political career, you mean.) Atishon: The crystal is a testament to my ancestor's remarkable achievements. And furthermore... Present Research Notes Apollo: Leads to: \"You stated that Ami Fey had the crystal made for your ancestor.\" Atishon: I am a descendent of that great lord. Press Apollo: Apollo: So tell me, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, are you famous in Kurain Village? Atishon: You could say that. But I find my popularity to be rather bemusing. Apollo: Bemusing? Atishon: Yes, my campaign posters keep going missing as soon as I put them up. My avid supporters and female fans are likely taking them home to hang in their bedrooms. Apollo: (...I guess ignorance really is bliss.) Atishon: Heh heh heh. All this only proves my fine lineage. Atishon: As such, my political power and influence is backed by centuries of history! Press Apollo: Apollo: I'm sorry, but is any of that relevant to the issue of the relic's rightful owner? Atishon: ...Have you never heard of kingcraft? Apollo: Kingcraft? Atishon: It's the art of ruling as a king. My father drilled it into my head from a young age. And one of its precepts states: \"Ruin awaits a ruler who responds to every single issue posed by the masses.\" Apollo: (Well, that answered my question about what he meant by \"king of this nation.\" Progress.) Athena: Apollo, who is this Ami Fey, anyway? Apollo: I believe she was the founder of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Athena: The plaintiff claims she had the crystal made for his ancestor. That would mean it was made in Japan, right? Apollo: Yes, I suppose it would. Apollo: You stated that Ami Fey had the crystal made for your ancestor. So, am I to assume it was made in Japan? Atishon: That's right. The craftsmanship is unbeatable! Apollo: Well, that's strange. I don't see how your so-called crystal could've been made there. Atishon: What are you talking about? Apollo: It's quite obvious if you take a closer look at this. Present motif on Founder's Orb pedestal Apollo: Leads to: \"Take a look at the distinctive design here. According to Dr. Buff...\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: See this part right here? Doesn't it exude a mysterious, exotic charm? Judge: Hmm... I don't know about that. Phoenix: What I do know, Mr. Justice, is your assertion exudes a mysterious amount of nonsense. Apollo: ...Oops. Judge: And I assure you there's no mystery behind a penalty for aimless speculation, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Nope. No mystery there, Your Honor. Athena: Apollo, let's go over everything we have on the orb once more. Maybe there's something that can help us prove it wasn't made in Japan. Apollo: Your Honor, I can prove the orb wasn't made in Japan. Leads back to: \"It's quite obvious if you take a closer look at this.\" Apollo: Take a look at the distinctive design here. According to Dr. Buff... ...it's a mitamah motif dating back to the early days of the Kingdom of Khura'in. Judge: The Kingdom of Khura'in, hmm? And you base this on...? Apollo: Here, this piece of evidence, Your Honor. These are the doctor's research notes on the Founder's Orb. This is the box in which the orb was originally stored. It features the same pattern as the one found on the orb. Judge: Hmm... They do look like the same pattern. Apollo: Therefore, I assert that... ...the disputed item must have been made in the Kingdom of Khura'in! Atishon: AAAAAAAAAHHHH! Eeeeeeek! M-My placard...!!! Phoenix: Phoenix: The Kurain Channeling Technique originated in the Kingdom of Khura'in. And Ami Fey is known to have traveled there to train. With that in mind, what's to say she didn't bring that pattern back with her? Apollo: Apollo: But since this is CLEARLY a Khura'inese design... ...not even you can deny... ...the possibility that it was made there -- in the Kingdom of Khura'in! Phoenix: Phoenix: Anything is possible to some extent. That doesn't make it true. So you can't conclude that the orb is from Khura'in based solely on that pattern. If it were that simple... ...I could just as easily say it's Japanese. Judge: I have to agree with Mr. Wright. The pattern alone proves nothing. But that also means there's no basis to claim that the item in dispute was made in Japan, either. Hmm... At this rate, we're going nowhere fast. Apollo: (...Argh. He's right -- we're just spinning our wheels here.) Athena: I wonder if we have any evidence that could break this stalemate. Apollo: (Hmm... Evidence that could break this stalemate...) Exists Apollo: The defense would like to present a piece of evidence to the court. A piece that will finally break this stalemate! Phoenix: Oh? Well, you've sure piqued my interest. Let's see what you've got. Apollo: ...All right. I will now prove that this is, in fact, the Founder's Orb! Present anything Apollo: Phoenix: And just how does that piece of evidence prove that the relic is the Founder's Orb? Apollo: .........It doesn't, does it? Phoenix: Not by any means I can fathom. Athena: Sorry, Apollo, but I have to agree with the boss on this. Apollo: ...Me too, actually. Judge: Me three, defense! Apollo: Yikes! Judge: Time to think that one over again, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Y-Yes, Your Honor... Leads back to: \"Hmm... Evidence that could break this stalemate...\" Does not exist Leads to: \"There doesn't seem to be anything we can use. At least, not at this point.\" Apollo: There doesn't seem to be anything we can use. At least, not at this point. Athena: Well, unless we can find something, this trial won't be going anywhere. Atishon: ......... *whew* That's much better. Apollo: (What's his deal?) Phoenix: ...I have a suggestion. Why don't we consider this from a different angle? Apollo: I'm listening... Phoenix: What if... ...the Defiant Dragons really were authorized to take possession of the relic? Judge: Hmm... I'm afraid I don't know where you're going with this, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Consider the Orb Transfer Agreement, which states: \"I agree to hand over the Founder's Orb to the Defiant Dragons if I will come to no harm.\" What if, as the last part suggests, this was written under duress? That would render the agreement null and void. Apollo: ...What are you suggesting, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: While you were on your little cave expedition, I was investigating Dr. Buff's accident. And there was something you overlooked, Mr. Justice. Namely, that his \"accident\" might have actually been murder. Apollo: What?! (M-Murder?) Judge: M-Mr. Wright! You do realize such statements are not to be made lightly? Are you suggesting the doctor was murdered by the Defiant Dragons? Phoenix: Yes, but follow me on this for a sec. The books that came tumbling down were from the archeology shelf. However, among that mountain of books was a single volume on psychology. What's more, there was blood on it. Apollo: And you feel this is important because...? Phoenix: The took that came tumbling down were from the top shelf -- the archeology books. We know this because the doctor's books were meticulously organized by subject. Archeology took up the entire shelf, so that psychology book is completely out of place. Apollo: (Come to think of it, the shelves were arranged quite carefully.) Phoenix: It's also worth noting that psychology books only take up a tiny part of the bottom shelf. You might wonder why a book on psychology was found amid the pile of archeology books. But I believe I can explain what that single out-of-place book was doing there. The doctor was struck from behind while selecting a psychology book from the shelf. Apollo: And that's when the blood got on the book? Phoenix: Precisely. And to make it look like an accident... ...he was buried under a mountain of archeology books. Apollo: Apollo: W-Wait a second. This is all just speculation, right? Or do you have proof it was murder? Phoenix: Of course I do. Apollo: Y-You do? Phoenix: On a hunch, I had Detective Skye examine the doctor's head wound. She found that he'd been struck by the corner of some object or another. Apollo: Wait, what?! Phoenix: A would like that couldn't have resulted from a fall to a floor, you know. Do you understand what this means, Mr. Justice? The wound makes it crystal clear that Dr. Buff was murdered! Apollo: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Athena: Well, THAT was unexpected! Who'd have thought we'd break out of the stalemate like this! He pulled the ladder right out from under us. Apollo: (Still, if he thinks that's enough to make me back down, he's got another thing coming!) Even if the cause of death was murder, what makes you think it was the Defiant Dragons? You should know better than to hurl baseless accusations! Phoenix: Phoenix: Did you forget who you were up against, Mr. Justice? Apollo: Huh? Phoenix: You didn't actually think I'd come to court without witnesses and evidence, did you? Apollo: Wh-What are you talking about? Phoenix: I would like to request further testimony from the plaintiff. Specifically... ...I would like the court to hear how he saw one of the rebels leaving the crime scene! Apollo: He-- He-- He saw whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! Athena: If he can prove it was murder, that's the end of our client's right to the orb! Did he have this up his sleeve the whole time?! Apollo: Grrr... How could Mr. Wright do this to us? (He was just waiting to spring this trap!) Phoenix: ...Heh. Judge: Hmm... This trial has taken another unexpected turn. But I must mention, Mr. Wright, that you have yet to identify the murder weapon. Phoenix: The object used to commit the murder was not located at the scene of the crime. The murderer likely disposed of it elsewhere. Dr. Buff's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Judge: Well, I never thought we'd be deliberating the issue of murder at a civil trial. All right, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, your testimony, if you please. Atishon: Heh. Prepare to be dazzled! Dazzled by charismatic oration forged in the crucible of campaign battles! Witness Testimony -- The Rebel's Crime -- Atishon: That evening, I was walking alone, lost in thought. I passed by the doctor's house... and that's when I saw Mr. Are'bal. He was running out the front door. It was around 10 at night. Surely that must've been him fleeing the scene of his crime. A vote for me is a vote to end such violence. That is my promise to you! Judge: So the plaintiff saw a possible suspect fleeing from the doctor's residence? And it was within the window of the estimated time of death? Apollo: ......... (Datz Are'bal! What in the world were you doing there then?!) Study Photo updated in the Court Record. Phoenix: It seems that Mr. Are'bal was loitering about Kurain Village that day. There's evidence that he was in the doctor's study as well. Isn't that right, Mr. Justice? Apollo: ......Ah! You mean the suitcase? Phoenix: Exactly. He must have been in quite a rush to leave that behind. Oh, and by the way, Your Honor... ...Mr. Are'bal just so happens to be sitting in the gallery today. Datz: Ack! Phoenix: See? That's him trying to escape as we speak. Judge: Bailiff! Don't let that man get away! Datz: Wright, you backstabber! Why are you doing this to meeee?! Judge: All right. The... counsel-slash-defense may question the plaintiff-slash-witness once more. ...Ahem. Please proceed, Mr. Justice. Cross Examination -- The Rebel's Crime -- Atishon: That evening, I was walking alone, lost in thought. Press Apollo: Apollo: Why were you taking a walk? Atishon: Society is inundated with serious problems that must be solved. And as a politician... ...I'm always on the job, thinking hard about possible solutions, even on my walks. Apollo: Umm... (Thanks for the non-answer.) Atishon: While we live out our comfy lives... ...there are starving children who suffer in the back alleys of our major cities. It's not in me to ignore such suffering! A vote for me, is a vote to end hunger. ...And for world peace! Phoenix: Yes, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, we are well aware of your outstanding character. Now, please continue with your testimony. Atishon: Heh heh heh. I can practically hear my poll numbers surging. Now, on with my speech. After all, the voting public must be informed of the magnificence that is me! Atishon: I passed by the doctor's house... and that's when I saw Mr. Are'bal. Press Apollo: Apollo: Where exactly were you when you saw Mr. Are'bal? Atishon: Right here, under this tree. I saw him dashing out of Dr. Buff's front door. Apollo: And he didn't notice you? Atishon: No. I was hidden by the tree. Judge: Is it really all that important to know from where the plaintiff saw Dr. Buff? No, it isn't Apollo: No, I don't believe it bears any relevance to this case. Judge: All right, then. Will the witness please continue with his testimony? Leads back to cross-examination Yes, it is Apollo: Yes, I believe it matters a lot. I ask that it please be added to the witness's testimony. Adds statement \"I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal.\" if not already added Atishon: I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal. Press Apollo: Apollo: What were you doing under that tree? Atishon: A lack of lateral thinking... That is a politician's downfall. Apollo: What? Atishon: That is why, if I'm elected... I promise to think outside the box! Apollo: Um... uh... The question was, what were you doing under the tree, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. Atishon: Feh... I suppose I can't expect a plebeian such as yourself to understand my grand design. Apollo: (Oh, yeah? Try me, O Lord of Plebs.) Phoenix: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. I believe the court is well aware of your grand political vision. Now, let's have the rest of your testimony, if you please. Atishon: Heh, I can hardly wait for the upcoming election. Atishon: He was running out the front door. Press Apollo: Apollo: Did you notice anything unusual? Atishon: Yes, his behavior was incredibly suspicious. His eyes were darting all around as he ran off in total panic. As soon as I saw that, I knew he had done something, and it probably wasn't good. Apollo: Despite that, you still didn't report it to the police? Atishon: Who would've thought he had killed Dr. Buff? Not me. That's why I didn't report him. Judge: So the witness didn't notify the police. Is that an important statement, Mr. Justice? No, it isn't Apollo: No, it's not important. Judge: Hmm... All right, then. Let's have the witness continue with his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Yes, it is Apollo: Yes, it's important. I request that the witness add it to his testimony. Atishon: ...Feh. Sure, why not. Adds statement \"I had no idea Dr. Buff was dead. That's why I didn't call the police.\" if not already added Atishon: I had no idea Dr. Buff was dead. That's why I didn't call the police. Press Apollo: Apollo: You had no idea he was dead. In other words, you knew nothing about what had happened? Atishon: I am truly ashamed of myself. Apollo: What? Atishon: There's been a gruesome murder in my beloved village. What a fool I've been! I was thinking only of the village's future and world peace! It seems my earnest attitude and industrious nature have come back to haunt me! Apollo: (Only a politician would try to pass off self-aggrandizement as self-deprecation.) Athena: Apollo, you think this is how all politicians will be from now on? Apollo: We're all doomed if they are... Atishon: If you don't mind, I'd like to continue with my testimony. Present Study Photo or Study Diagram (after adding statement \"I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal.\") Apollo: Leads to: \"Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, rather than Mr. Are'bal...\" Atishon: It was around 10 at night. Surely that must've been him fleeing the scene of his crime. Press Apollo: Apollo: But at the time, you didn't know the doctor was dead. Is that correct? Atishon: ...It's true that I've been known as a prodigy from a very young age. Apollo: Huh? Atishon: I graduated high school and college with exceptional grades. As class president... ...I reformed stale old school traditions. My exploits were even covered in local papers. But as exceptional as I am, I can't possibly be expected to know everything at all times. Apollo: (This isn't working. He keeps bending the questions to serve his own needs.) Athena: Hang in there, Apollo! Phoenix: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. I believe the court is well aware of your exceptional nature. Now, would you please continue with your testimony? Atishon: Heh heh heh. I have the upcoming election in the bag. Atishon: A vote for me is a vote to end such violence. That is my promise to you! Press Apollo: Apollo: So, how do you actually intend to end such violence? Atishon: Elite politicians such as myself never reveal their strategies. Did you really think I would divulge such sensitive information to the likes of you? Apollo: Yeah, but, surely you have some sort of campaign platform you're running on? Atishon: ................................... ...No comment. Apollo: (Clearly, his is a platform, told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.) Before adding either statement Athena: They're accusing the Defiant Dragons of murder. If this sticks, we'll lose the orb! Apollo: Yeah, we need to sink Paul Atishon's testimony before it's too late. (Mr. Wright is pulling out all the stops. Then again, I'd expect nothing less from him.) After adding statement \"I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal.\", but before adding statement \"I had no idea Dr. Buff was dead. That's why I didn't call the police.\" Athena: He saw Mr. Are'bal from under that tree? Apollo, maybe there's some sort of an inconsistency there. Apollo: Hmm, I wonder... Athena: Why don't we review the evidence? Apollo: (Yeah. Maybe there's something we overlooked.) After adding statement \"I had no idea Dr. Buff was dead. That's why I didn't call the police.\", but before adding statement \"I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal.\" Athena: He didn't know the doctor was dead? Well, I guess that makes sense, considering the body was inside the study. Apollo: Right, how could he have known? (Guess I could find out where our weaselly witness was when he saw Datz.) After adding both statements Apollo: He said he saw Datz from under the tree. If that's true, then... Athena: Did you figure something out? Apollo: Yeah, I think he's hiding something. Let's take another look at the evidence, Athena. Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, rather than Mr. Are'bal... ...wasn't there's something else that should've had your undivided attention? Atishon: Like what? ...Oh, yes, of course! A politician must also keep his finger on the electorate's pulse, and focus on the nation's-- Apollo: Sorry, but you're way off. Atishon: I am? Hmm... Judge: Would you care to explain, Mr. Justice? Apollo: If the witness saw Mr. Are'bal from his position here... ...then he should've also been able to see the doctor's body. After all, it was right next to a huge window. Judge: Why, I believe you have a point there! Apollo: With the body THAT clearly visible to the witness... ...it's unthinkable that he wouldn't have reported it to the police! Phoenix: Ah! Judge: Hmm... Would the witness care to respond? Atishon: ........................... Apollo: ......... (Did he... fall asleep?) Judge: ...Um, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Atishon: ........................... Judge: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson!!! Atishon: Huh?! Oh, um. Hmm... There are many sides to any issue. Apollo: (What did I ever do to deserve this?) In any case, I'd like the court to acknowledge in the inconsistency in the witness's testimony. Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, did you really see Mr. Are'bal? Atishon: Yes! .................. Apollo: Apollo: Where do you think you're going?! Atishon: Oh, I thought I would return to my seat, seeing as I had already answered the question. Apollo: This isn't some small town hall debate, so you just stay right there until I say we're through. Atishon: I-I'll have to run that by my campaign manager before I... Apollo: Apollo: .........*glare* Atishon: *gulp* Phoenix: ...Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. I think it's time for you to come clean. Atishon: Huh?! Apollo: ...So then, does this mean he DIDN'T see Mr. Are'bal? Phoenix: As your lawyer, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson... ...I advise you divulge that matter we discussed. Silence is no longer an option. Atishon: ...Err, are you sure about this? I'm in the midst of running for office! I can't afford to let any strange rumors get out. Phoenix: Don't worry. You won't suffer any blowback for what you're about to reveal. Judge: \"Blowback\"? I'm not sure I like the sound of that, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Not to worry, Your Honor. Nothing untoward will come of this, I promise. Now then, Mr. Justice. Remember how it was an anonymous caller that reported the doctor's death? Apollo: Come to think of it... Apollo: Ema, who was the first one to discover the body? Ema: About that... Whoever it was, it seems they wanted to remain anonymous. Apollo: What? Ema: It happens now and then. Some people would rather not get involved with the police. Apollo: Wait... You're not saying that... Phoenix: Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. The anonymous source who contacted the police after discovering the body was... ...my client, Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson. Apollo: Wh-What?! (Y-You don't say...) Phoenix: So you see, he played his part as a concerned citizen -- quite admirably, if I may say so. Isn't that right? Atishon: .........Y-Yes, indeed... In our society today, there are too many who choose indifference over righteous action. But I don't number among them. That's why I did my duty as a concerned citizen. One might call me THE model citizen -- one worthy of standing above all the rest! Apollo: (What a real standard-bearer he is, reporting it anonymously.) Phoenix: ...Oh, and by the way, Mr. Justice. Wasn't there someone else at the scene of the crime when my client discovered the body? Apollo: ...Oh, um, you mean Mr. Are'bal? He would have been leaving the doctor's house right around then... Wait, th-that means...! Phoenix: Yes, it does. In short... ...what my client witnessed was Mr. Are'bal fleeing the scene of a heinous murder! Apollo: ...Aaaaaaah! Phoenix: And that's not all! Based on what we've heard so far... ...Mr. Are'bal looked exceedingly suspicious, and that's putting it mildly. We already know the Defiant Dragons threatened the doctor with bodily harm. And now that they've killed him, the so-called Orb Transfer Agreement is null and void! Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Athena: A-Apollo! If we don't come up wit with some sort of counterargument...! Apollo: A-And what sort of evidence do you have? Can you actually prove that it was Mr. Are'bal who killed the doctor? Athena: That move had \"desperate\" written all over it. Apollo: It's all I've got, so I'm going with it! Phoenix: ...Evidence? I suppose it's true that I don't have any... Apollo: I-I knew it! Phoenix: But I do have another witness. Apollo: You do? Phoenix: You should know I always come fully prepared, Mr. Justice. And my new witness will provide testimony proving Mr. Are'bal's guilt. Apollo: ...Gnrggh! Athena: A new witness? I wonder who it could be. Judge: ...Very well. Bailiff, please summon our new witness. In the meantime, the court will take a brief recess. I would like both sides to use this time to prepare properly, understood? May 17District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Apollo: Wow. I knew Mr. Wright would put up a tough fight, but... Athena: Yeah! Just when I thought we had him, he'd turn the tables on us. He really is the Turnabout Terror. Apollo: (We can't let him blindside us again.) Datz: Looks like they've got me again! Three times in one year! \"Datz\" a new record! Har har har har har har! Apollo: Datz, please... No more new records -- or bad puns, while you're at it. It's hard enough trying to help you as it is. Datz: Roger that. I'll be more careful next time! Dhurke: Datz, is what Mr. Wright said true? Did you really pay a visit to Dr. Buff that night? Datz: Sure did. Can't remember the exact time, though. All I know is he wouldn't hand over the orb. Someone put it in his head that we rebels were dangerous. That's why he threw me out. Apollo: So the doctor was still alive when Datz last saw him. Athena: We'll still have to prove it, though. Dhurke: ...Better brace yourself, son. The next witness's testimony could make or break this case. Apollo: Yeah, I know. Hey, where's Trucy? Athena: She went to go see her dad. Apollo: Hmm... Maybe she's still mad. Athena: More like worried. Worried that this trial will create a rift between you two... ...and that you might then leave the agency. Apollo: Ha ha ha. She has an active imagination. Bailiff: Excuse me. The trial will be resuming shortly. Apollo: Well, let's go see what new testimony awaits us. May 17District Court - Courtroom No. 6 Judge: All right, court is back in session. Mr. Wright, you said you had a witness...? Phoenix: Your Honor, I would like to call the lone survivor of the doctor's murder to the stand. Apollo: (Wait.. He can't mean... that Sarge is here?) You mean Dr. Buff's reclusive son? How did you get him to cooperate? Phoenix: ...Nothing a little persuasion couldn't handle. The poor child only agreed to help if it meant catching the killer. Apollo: (Getting a kid like that to overcome his fear... Now that's impressive.) Athena: This must be really important testimony for the kid to come out in public like this. Judge: Very well, Mr. Wright. Please call your witness to the stand. Judge: .........Oh, my! Sarge: Sergeant Buff at your service, sir! Apollo: ...He's here as the drone? Really? Judge: ...Um, Mr. Wright? What exactly is the meaning of this? Phoenix: Past trauma has rendered it impossible for the witness to venture into public. Leaving home was hard enough. And it seems leaving the witness lobby was just too much. But I would still like to continue with testimony delivered via this drone. Judge: Hmm... I understand it must be terrible to lose one's father like that... ...but testimony via a remote control toy? .........Well, let's take things for a spin and see how it goes. Apollo: (Just who's piloting this trial, anyway?!) Athena: The judge sure warmed up to the idea fast. Apollo: I think the phrase you're looking for is \"gave up.\" Sarge: You disappoint me, Corporal Justice! To think I once called you comrade! Apollo: AAAAAAAAAGH! Sarge: Defending the man who killed Papa?! That's full-on treason, soldier! I hereby demote you back to \"private\"! Athena: \"Corporal\"? \"Private\"? What's he talking about, Apollo? Apollo: It's... a long story. Judge: Now then, are you ready to testify, youngster? Sarge: Locked and loaded, sir! Ready to rain lead down upon the perpetrator! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Witness Testimony -- What Happened That Evening -- Sarge: Papa met with someone the night he died. I didn't have eyes on the ground, as I'd already mounted my siege defense, but... ...I did hear him arguing with someone in his study! From my window, I saw the one designated \"Datz\" getting ejected from the premises. After that, the man lingered around the perimeter for some time. He must have regrouped and killed my papa in the study later -- I just know it! Judge: Hmm... So he was thrown out, but later returned and committed the murder, did he? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. So the man my client saw... ...really must have been the fleeing Mr. Are'bal. Datz: Datz: Objeeeeection! Wright, you backstabbing, no good--! I-I didn't kill no one! Sarge: It's the enemy! Ready all missiles! And... FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRE!! Datz: WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA!!! Sarge: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Capitalist pig! I'll turn you into pork stroganoff! And that's just a taste of my ultimate anti-swine weapon! Apollo: (Whoa! It fires missiles, too?!) Judge: ...Yes, well, the witness is all yours, Mr. Justice. Cross Examination -- What Happened That Evening -- Sarge: Papa met with someone the night he died. Press Apollo: Apollo: Your father met with \"someone\"? Could you be more specific? Sarge: No. I was in the midst of a crucial defensive siege operation. Apollo: Right... You're referring to how you don't leave your room, correct? Sarge: You never know where the enemy might be lurking outside the siege perimeter. Apollo: What about, you know, school? Sarge: Oh, uhhh... I don't go to boot camp! I'm a soldier! A sergeant doesn't associate with rookies still too green to fight! Apollo: (With a kid like this, I bet Dr. Buff won't be getting any rest in the afterlife, either.) Judge: Hmm... It was very brave of you to come to the courthouse today. But what was that you said about a siege defense? Sarge: Oh, that? Well... Sarge: I didn't have eyes on the ground, as I'd already mounted my siege defense, but... Press Apollo: Apollo: Um, Sarge? I've always wondered... ...who or what are you battling? Sarge: ! Th-That's... classified. Apollo: Even so, it may be relevant to this case. Phoenix: Phoenix: Umm... I don't know if YOU'RE the right person to be asking things like that... Athena: That's right. Such matter need to be handled with a certain delicacy. Apollo: Oh, ha ha ha. I guess curiosity got the better of me. Sarge: You're all talk and no action, soldier! Out on the battlefield, it ain't the number of pretty words in yer repertoire... ...but the number of bullets in yer gun belt that counts! Apollo: (Easy for you to say. You're the one with all of them. Judge: Would the witness please tell the court what he saw and heard that night? Present Sarge's Drone Apollo: Leads to: \"Sarge, are you hiding something from me?\" Sarge: ...I did hear him arguing with someone in his study! Press Apollo: Apollo: What was the argument about? Sarge: I heard things like, \"Where's the orb?!\" and \"Are you Defiant Dragons really criminals?!\" It sounded real volatile, like a war might break out any second! Apollo: (So the two of them had an argument when Datz came to get the orb.) Did you see or hear anything else? Sarge: Yeah. I heard them arguing, and then, silence. Sarge: From my window, I saw the one designated \"Datz\" getting ejected from the premises. Press Apollo: Apollo: How was Mr. Are'bal acting? Sarge: Like a conquered trooper retreating with his tail between his legs. Apollo: A \"trooper\"...? Well, I guess he does dress like he's in the military. Athena: I bet those two would have really hit it off had they met under different circumstances. Apollo: Yeah, I can see that. Sarge: And so, the defeated soldier was expelled. But that wasn't the end. Sarge: After that, the man lingered around the perimeter for some time. Press Apollo: Apollo: That... does seem suspicious. Sarge: He kept hiding behind trees and telephone poles, and stealing glances at our house. Apollo: Well, he couldn't exactly leave without the orb...) Sarge: I bet he was angry that he'd been kicked out. Sarge: He must have regrouped and killed my papa in the study later -- I just know it! Press Apollo: Apollo: But don't you keep your front door unlocked? If so, anyone could've gotten in.. Sarge: That's true. Papa didn't keep our house locked up. He said there was no need because there were only good people in Kurain Village. Apollo: (Yet he ended up dead, anyway.) Sarge: Only a monster could do what they did to my kind, trusting Papa! There will be no mercy! I vow swift and terrible vengeance! I'll carpet-bomb the killer with everything in my arsenal! FIIIIIIRE!!! Judge: While I sympathize with you, witness, you will refrain from firing Gatling guns in this court. Athena: So Sarge saw Datz, too. Apollo: And just when I thought things couldn't get any worse. I wonder why he hung around after getting thrown out? Athena: I hate to say this, but if Datz is proven to be the killer... ...we'll lose the orb to the plaintiff. So our only option is to prove the Defiant Dragons had nothing to do with the murder! Apollo: Sarge, are you hiding something from me? Sarge: H-How dare you question your superior officer like that! You wanna get in on this stroganoff action with pig-boy over there, soldier?! Apollo: Sorry, but I'm afraid lawyers are missile-proof. Sarge: Wh-What?! Judge: Would the defense care to explain? Apollo: It's simple, Your Honor. Just as he is able to see what is happening in court right now... ...Sarge was able to see what happening in the study then. With his cherished drone, of course. Judge: Ahhh! Now that you mention it... And to think, the answer was right before our eyes this whole time. Apollo: Sarge! You were perfectly capable of patrolling the study that night! So you must've seen something! Sarge: Aaaaaaaaaagh! I'm hit! What is this strange new weaponry you're using against me?! Apollo: Courtroom warriors don't use guns or missiles, because evidence is our weapon of choice! And the evidence has exposed your bald-faced lie! My truth bomb, Sarge... has stripped your defenses bare! Sarge: A t-t... truth bomb?! Noooooooooooo! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH! Mayday, mayday!!! I'm going doooooooown!!! Judge: Oh, my! Are you all right?! Sarge: *cough* *sputter* Evidence... Never have I seen such fearsome ordnance. Apollo: Tell it to us straight, Sarge. After all, you want to help your father, don't you? Sarge: Papa... Apollo: Yes. You want to find out who killed him, don't you? So please. Tell us what you saw that night. Sarge: ...It's... It's... It's not what you think. I-I... I... I didn't see anything. I swear...! Apollo: ...You sure? You seem awfully stressed for someone who didn't see anything. Sarge: ...Grrrrrrr! Apollo: UWAAAAAAHHH! ...S-Sarge. You need to answer my question. Sarge: Shut your piehole, maggot! It'll be a scorching day in Siberia before a lowly private like you orders me around! Apollo: (...What's with him and Siberia, of all places? But if a scorching day is what it'll take, then maybe it's time to turn up the heat.) Hey, Athena. You think a therapy session might help? Athena: Well, it could help alleviate some of his anxiety. NOISE LEVEL100% Athena: ...Plus, I'm picking up a lot of discord in Sarge's voice. That usually means the patient wants to say something, but can't for some reason. Apollo: And in Sarge's case, I imagine whatever's plaguing him is pretty severe. In that case, I leave it to you and your Mood Matrix magic! Athena: You got it! Your Honor, I believe I can be of help here. Judge: Time for a therapy session, is it, Ms. Cykes? Athena: Yes. It will help the witness with his anxiety -- maybe even enough to testify! Judge: Then by all means, please bring the poor child out into the light of day. ...Oh, but I assume this will be all right with you, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Why not? It's not like we all haven't been through this before. Sarge: Wh-What are you butting in for, lady?! There ain't a place on this battlefield for you! Athena: Athena: I beg to differ, Sarge. This G.I. Jane's always ready for a fight in the courtroom! And wait until you see what I've got in my arsenal -- analytical psychology! With it, I'm going to blow a big ol' hole in the armor you've built around your heart! Sarge: UWAAAAAAH! First evidence, now analytical psychology?! Where are these WMDs coming from?! ...W-Well, if it's a battle you want, bring it on! You may have started this war, but I'm going to end it, Corpswoman Cykes! Athena: You got it, Sarge. Time to seek out the agony buried deep in your heart. Widget: Brace yourself! Sarge: I stayed in my room with my drone that evening. Sarge: I heard Datz and Papa arguing with each other. Sarge: Datz got kicked out, but I saw him still hanging around outside. Pinpoint Surprised marker Apollo: Leads to: \"That's strange...\" Sarge: I was in my room, so I didn't know Papa was dead until the next day. Pinpoint Surprised marker Apollo: Leads to: \"That's strange... You reacted with shock when you discovered your father's body... \" Apollo: So I'm looking for unexpected emotions and unnatural reactions, right? Athena: Right -- emotions and reactions that don't fit the content of his testimony. When you find one, make sure you point it out to me. Also, remember not to view his emotional reactions in isolation. Sometimes, it's important to see how they change from one statement to the next. Apollo: Okay, I'll give it a try. Apollo: That's strange... You reacted with shock when you discovered your father's body... ...yet, you weren't nearly as shocked then as when you saw Mr. Are'bal. Normally, you'd expect the death of one's father to be much more impactful. Sarge: ...Enemy fire! Direct hit!!! Athena: That IS strange. I wonder what it could mean. Apollo: Well, we know he wasn't as affected by his father's death as he should've been. And I think I know why. Athena: Oh? Apollo: Sarge, you weren't as shocked at seeing your father's body as seeing Mr. Are'bal because... You're scared of Mr. Are'bal Apollo: Maybe you were scared of him? Sarge: Why you--! How could you even THINK I was scared of that capitalist pig! Apollo: So you weren't scared? Sarge: Listen up, trainee! You feckless amateurs don't even know what true fear is! Naïve little babies like you wouldn't last two seconds out there. So he's your first lesson, private! A heaping spoonful of true, battlefield terror! Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Athena: I think that means you were wrong. But there's no need to look so bitter about it, Apollo. Apollo: No, but that was some bitter medicine... (Ugh, the aftertaste of failure...) Leads back to: \"Sarge, you weren't as shocked at seeing your father's body as seeing Mr. Are'bal because...\" You'd already seen his body Leads to: \"Sarge...\" Something else shocked you Apollo: Did... something else shock you when you saw Mr. Are'bal? Something even more shocking than your father's death? Athena: Hmm, like what exactly, Apollo? Apollo: I don't know... Maybe a mouse or a cockroach? Athena: Eeeuuuwww, gross!!! Sarge: Foolish cannon fodder! Vermin are powerless in the fact of my deadly arsenal! I'll pump 'em full of lead! Apollo: Sounds kinda messy, don't you think? Sarge: ...Ah! Th-Then I'll develop new weaponry! Maybe a flamethrower'd do the trick... Apollo: S-Sure... As long as you keep it \"for vermin use only\"... Athena: Guess it wasn't something like mice or cockroaches after all, huh. Apollo: No, but it was worth a try -- especially to see your reaction. (*sigh* What else could it be...?) Leads back to: \"Sarge, you weren't as shocked at seeing your father's body as seeing Mr. Are'bal because...\" Apollo: Sarge... Maybe the truth is, you left your room that night. And that's when you saw it -- your father's body. Sarge: I-I saw no such thing! Apollo: Really? You didn't see his body? All right then, what DID you see? Sarge: Err... NOISE LEVEL70% Athena: Look, Apollo! We've lost some noise! Apollo: So, just as I suspected... he really did see something. Sarge! Please. Tell us what you saw. Sarge: Ooh... B-B-But... .................. ........................... I-I... The moment I saw it, ooh... ...I-I.. I couldn't bear it. I couldn't stand to lose yet another loved one. Apollo: Huh? (Am I missing something here?) Is that you weren't very shocked when you found out your father was dead? Because you had already sensed he was a goner somehow? Sarge: M-Maybe... Apollo: Please, Sarge. What was it you saw on the night of your father's murder? Sarge: Ooh... Gah gah gah gah. I-I... I saw... ...Agh. Gah. Hrgh. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! UHWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Apollo: Wh-What's happening?! (I don't like where this is going...) Sarge: YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH! NO MORE! NO MORE, PLEEEEEEAAASE!!! Athena: Eeeeeek! Widget: Help! Sarge: I've confiscated your little toy! The battlefield has no place for unauthorized equipment! Athena: W-Widget...! A-Apollo! I can't continue the rest of the session without him! Judge: C-Calm yourself this instant, witness! I hereby order you to submit to your therapy session! What in blazes...?! Sarge: Lookit me! I'm judge, jury, and executioner now! I hereby convene a military tribunal! Apollo: Whoa, whoa... This has gone way too far. Judge: B-Bailiff! Arrest that drone this instant! Sarge: RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWRRRRRR! Bailiff: Stop resisting! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGHHHHH! If you don't come quietly, I'll--! Sarge: FIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRE! Bailiff: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Athena: Give Widget back right-- EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEKKK!!! .................................................................. Athena: *huff* *puff* *cough, cough* Whew, finally got him back. Apollo: Nice work. Judge: Hmm... This witness is truly a handful. Sarge: Ooh... hup, two, three, four... Uwoooooooooooooooooooooooooooh! Phoenix: Ms. Cykes, what is the witness's current psychological state? Athena: Let's see... He's emotionally all over the map. Apollo: So his out-of-control emotions are in control of him, huh. Does that mean we can calm him down if we can figure out the root cause? Athena: Yes. So let's see what we can find. Sarge! Can you hear me? Sarge: Ooh... I-Is that you, Corpswoman Cykes? Athena: I'm here. Now, I want you to take a few deep breaths. Just try to relax. Try it with me. Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out. Sarge: In... Out... In... Out... Athena: And now... Let your emotions take you where they will. Go on, just let it all out! Sarge: UHWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!!! All forces, attaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack! Apollo: (...That's the LEAST relaxing breathing exercise I've ever seen.) Sarge: Datz was still hanging around after he got kicked out when... Sarge: ...I heard more fighting, and I got worried about Papa. Sarge: So I left my room, but suddenly... Sarge: ...I got dizzy and passed out. Sarge: I remember a flame lighting up the room... Probe Flames Apollo: Leads to: \"That's it!\" Sarge: ...and Papa grinning with delight. Probe Flames Apollo: Leads to: \"That's it!\" Sarge: That's when he must have been killed. If only I hadn't passed out! Apollo: So he has two out-of-control emotions, huh. And all we have to do is find out what's causing them to run wild like this? Athena: Yes. Whatever the cause, it should appear somewhere in the Mood Matrix. Let me know if you think you've found it. Apollo: Ugh... Easier said than done. Don't suppose you have any ideas on where to start? Athena: Well... I would think about Sarge's personality and his past. Those are the things that shape a person's emotions. You should be able to find something to work with from there! Apollo: That's it! Sarge... You were overcome with shock and fear when you saw those flames, weren't you? Sarge: Was I...? Apollo: Yes. Just six months ago... ...you and your mother were caught up in an arsonist's blaze. So it's no wonder you would be extremely scared of fire. Sarge: ...Y-Yes, that does make sense. Athena: And maybe, just maybe... ...your subconscious fear of fire was what caused you to withdraw from the world. Sarge: What do you mean, Corpswoman Cykes? Athena: In the outside world, you were bound to come across all sorts of fire. Candles, cigarettes... heck, even the grill at a diner. Even if it's not that often, just the idea that you might see them... ...grew bigger and bigger until you couldn't shut it out. Sarge: ...! I... I think you might be onto something. Candles, cigarettes... Just thinking about them sends a chill down my spine. Apollo: (Wow, the things I take for granted.) Sarge: Now I see. I was afraid... Afraid of the fire. Strange, I didn't even realize it myself. Apollo: About that fire, Sarge... Can you tell me what it was burning? Athena: Just stay calm and maybe something will come to you. Sarge: Oh, umm... ............. ..................Oh! I'm starting to remember! I-It was...! It was that relic! That relic Papa was studying... It was on fire! Apollo: The orb... was on fire? Sarge: Mm-hm. It's still kind of fuzzy...  ...but yes, the \"orb\" was burning right in front of Papa. And there... in the flames was... ...Mama? Yes! Now I remember... I saw Mama appear amid the dancing flames! Apollo: Wait... WHAAAAAAAAAT?! NOISE LEVEL30% Apollo: Wh-What's going on here? Athena: Maybe it's a memory from the fire that killed his mother. Hmm... He might be confusing it with what really happened when his father died. Apollo: So let me guess... More therapy? Athena: Yep. But this time, it seems there's an inconsistency in his statements. And I think we should be able to prove that with the evidence at hand. Apollo: (I hope this inconsistency is the key... ...to proving that the relic is really the Founder's Orb!) Sarge: Datz was still hanging around after he got kicked out when... Sarge: ...I heard more fighting, and I got worried about Papa. Sarge: So I left my room, but suddenly, I got dizzy and passed out. Sarge: I remember a flame lighting up the room, and Papa grinning with delight. Sarge: The relic was on fire, and I saw Mama's face inside. Sarge: That's when he must have been killed. If only I hadn't passed out! Present Founder's Orb Apollo: Leads to: \"Don't blame yourself, Sarge.\" Athena: I believe Sarge's fear of fire is triggering a past memory. As a result, the memory of what he really saw is being suppressed. When he tries to remember, the past memory is being overlaid onto the more recent one. Apollo: Wow, the mind sure is a tricky beast. So, I'll just have to find an inconsistency? Athena: Right. Once you find an inconsistent statement... ...present the evidence that proves it. Apollo: (The main issue here is when the doctor was murdered. Was he really killed while Datz was there?) Apollo: Don't blame yourself, Sarge. After all, even if you hadn't passed out... ...the outcome would've been the same. Sarge: What do you mean? Apollo: I'm talking about the time of death. Your father wasn't killed right after you left your room. Sarge: Wh-What?! Explain yourself at once, Private Justice! Apollo: You said you saw your father burning the orb, right? But that night, he went out to hide it in a cave. So, what you saw, Sarge... ...was something that happened before your father left to hide the orb. Sarge: Ah! Apollo: So you see, you didn't pass out right before he was killed. You passed out right before he left for the cave, to hide the orb in the ruins within. Sarge: S-So, even if I hadn't passed out... Apollo: That's right. The outcome would've been exactly the same. That's because your father, Dr. Buff, was killed after he returned from the ruins. And therefore, Sarge, there's no need to blame yourself. Sarge: Oh... I see... .............. ................................ Private Justice... Can... Can you really say I bear no blame in this? Apollo: ...Why do you ask? Sarge: .........Because... the truth is... ...if I hadn't engaged in my siege defense, Papa would still be alive. Apollo: Sarge... Sarge: Papa wished nothing more than for me to lead a happy, healthy life. That's why he quit his job and moved us out, away from the big city. But even then, I didn't have the courage to set foot into the outside world. And in the end... ...I failed to make Papa's wish come true. Sarge: ..................... ???: ...Um, Sarge? Athena: If you want to make your father's wish come true... If that's what you really want... ...then who's to say it's too late? Why don't you take the first step now? Sarge: ...My first step? Athena: That's right. You can cast off all your regret. You can stop standing still and start moving forward. You have the power within you. I know from experience. I know what's it like to feel like you do. But only you... only you can decide to take the first step! Sarge: ................................ Apollo: If you don't change your tactics now, Sarge... ...the victory you seek in the war you're waging will always lie beyond your grasp. Sarge: ................................................ Hmm... I think I understand now. I've... I've made up my mind! Apollo: ! Sarge: As of this moment... ...I will suspend my siege defense indefinitely! Apollo: ...............Huh? ???: S-Sergeant Buff, r-reporting for duty. Apollo: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! I-I-I thought you were a guy! Athena: You're DEFINTELY not the gruff drill sergeant I envisioned! ???: W-Well, my mama was in the Russian army. Phoenix: I was just as shocked, but it certainly explained a few things when I found out, too. May I introduce to you Miss Armie Buff, age twelve. (Changed from [May I introduce to you Miss Armie Buff, age 12.] in the original release) Apollo: N-No way... Armie: Careful, soldier! Don't forget I could blow you away at a moment's notice! Athena: S-She's just too cute... Apollo: So... Have you always been in a wheelchair, Sarge? Armie: Negative. Only since I was injured... in the fire. Judge: Umm... Your voice sounds awfully different from before. Armie: My drone features a voice modulation device. It's just one of my army's many technological marvels. Judge: Well, you fooled me. I thought some twenty-something military fanatic was at the controls. Armie: I-If it's all the same to you, troops, I'd like to continue my testimony! I've just remembered something! And it's as crisp and clear as a trumpet at roll call. Apollo: What did you remember? Armie: It wasn't my mother who appeared in the burning orb. It was some lady Papa had shown me a picture of a long time ago. He said it was the Holy Mother, the founder of Khura'inism. She appeared right there, right in the burning orb! Apollo: Huh...?! Phoenix: What did you just say?! NOISE LEVEL0%BYE BYE Athena: The Holy Mother of Khura'inism was in the burning orb? Wh-What does that even mean? Phoenix: ...I have a bad feeling about this. Apollo: Could it be...? Could this explain what Sarge means by the Holy Mother appearing in the burning orb? Present Research Notes Apollo: Leads to: \"Dr. Buff's research notes? What do they have to do with this?\" Present anything else Apollo: Armie: What's that? Apollo: A piece of related evidence. Wouldn't you agree? Although, to be honest, I'd have to plead the fifth if you asked me how certain I was. Sarge: Private! Did you really think such a cockamamie plan would rout out the enemy?! Apollo: Yiiiiiikes! {I'd better be more careful!) Athena: If the orb was burning, maybe the evidence you're looking for has to do with fire. Apollo: Yeah, I know. Leads back to: \"Could this explain what Sarge means by the Holy Mother appearing in the burning orb?\" Athena: Dr. Buff's research notes? What do they have to do with this? Apollo: Look at this! The burning orb, the appearance of the founder -- this part points to both! Present third stanza of Song of Ceremony Apollo: Leads to: \"There's a legend about the orb involving a mysterious riddle.\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: It's all... right here! Athena: Umm.. I'm not seeing it. Apollo: Well, it's... Maybe you can explain it, Athena. Athena: I'M not the one who's supposed to explain things when YOU'RE the one presenting! Apollo: (Yikes, she's really mad. I'd better come up with something before her anger burns me to a crisp.) Leads back to: \"Look at this! The burning orb, the appearance of the founder -- this part points to both!\" Apollo: There's a legend about the orb involving a mysterious riddle. And this song, in turn, is said to contain the key to solving it. If the legend is true, then I believe the answer lies in this part of the song: \"Offer thy prayers as fervent as fire Only then shall the Holy Mother return.\" ...Well? Anyone see where I'm going with this? Phoenix: Prayers as fervent as fire... ...Ah! You're supposed to... set the orb on fire? Apollo: The whole stanza seems to suggest that the founder will appear if the orb is set on fire. Athena: ...Wait! S-So the doctor! He...! Apollo: ...Yes, Athena. He had solved the ancient riddle of the Founder's Orb! Judge: Oh, my! Armie: Papa was a great archeologist. So I believe in him... and I want to believe... I want to believe he achieved his long-time dream of solving that riddle before he died. Apollo: Well, we won't know for sure... until we try it for ourselves. Armie: Yes, do it, Private Justice. Please! I want to see what Papa was searching for with my own eyes! Phoenix: Phoenix: The, uh... The plaintiff must object to this! Apollo: Apollo: The plaintiff will stand down and be quiet! Phoenix: Phoenix: Y-You don't have the right to set a precious relic like that on fire! Apollo: Apollo: Oh, but I do. All I needed was Sarge's permission. Since we still don't know if this treasure if the Founder's Orb or the Crystal of Ami Fey... ...any ownership rights the doctor had now belong to his daughter. Therefore, you have absolutely no right to stop us! Phoenix ...Gnrk! Judge: Very well, Mr. Justice. I never thought I'd be saying this, but you may burn the evidence. Apollo: All right, here we go! Apollo: Look! Athena: A-Apollo! The inside of the orb... It's melting! Apollo: There's something in there... Ahhhhhhhhhh! Dh-Dhurke! Isn't she...? Dhurke: Her garb leaves no room for doubt. It's the founder herself! Face and all... Dhurke: I-I don't understand. The greatest of taboos in Khura'inism... ...is the depiction of the founder's face. Yet here it is, hidden within this orb! Founder's Orb updated in the Court Record. Apollo: Sorry, Mr. Wright, but as you can see, the issue is \"crystal\" clear. This figure is the Holy Mother, founder of Khura'inism. And based on that, this must be none other than the Founder's Orb! Phoenix: Phoenix: B-Be that as it may, Mr. Are'bal still may have killed the doctor! If so, it would render the Orb Transfer Agreement null and void! Apollo: Don't play dumb, Mr. Wright. The truth of the matter has already been proven! Dr. Buff wasn't killed right after Sarge saw Mr. Are'bal. It happened after the doctor came back from hiding the orb. And you've no proof that Mr. Are'bal was still around at the time! Phoenix: ...Urrrrrrrgh. Apollo: Your claim that the Defiant Dragons were behind the crime doesn't hold water. And that means the Orb Transfer Agreement is still perfectly valid. Phoenix: ...Arrrrrrrgh. Apollo: Admit it, Mr. Wright. I just burned your whole case to the ground! Phoenix: Ooh... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Apollo: (I won? I actually won?) Judge: M-Mr. Wright! Would you care to respond? Phoenix: .........R-Respond? ...Um... Apollo: (I didn't think so!) Athena: Wait, did we just win? Did we actually beat the Turnabout Terror?! You're amazing, Apollo! Atishon: Don't just stand there, Wright! Do something! Phoenix: ...Umm, well... I don't think there's any digging out of this hole. Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, I think it's time for your concession speech. I have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that this is the Founder's Orb. The facts don't lie, but you obviously do. How's that for a campaign slogan? Atishon: Wh-Why you contemptuous peasant...! Judge: ...Hmmm. I think this is a good time to wrap up this trial. If both parties have no further objections, I will render my verdict. Apollo: No objections here, Your Honor. Phoenix: Err... Um... No ob-- Atishon: Atishon: You can't do this. The crystal is mine! I'll lose the election if I lose that crystal! Phoenix: I'm sorry, but there's really nothing more I can do. Atishon: ...You haven't forgotten about our little chat... have you? Phoenix: ! .......... Apollo: (What's going on here?) Phoenix: Phoenix: ...Y-Your Honor. I...I object to the defense's last claim! Apollo: What?! Phoenix: I don't believe they have truly proven that the relic is indeed the Founder's Orb. Apollo: Apollo: Mr. Wright. I don't think even you could bluff your way out of this one! What possible argument could you have to claim that this isn't the Founder's Orb? Phoenix .........Um, about that... ...................Oh, of course! Apollo: .......... (H-He can't possibly have hit on something...) Phoenix The defense's assertion is incomplete, and here's why. Their claim that this relic is the Founder's Orb is based on a legend. (Changed from [The defense is basing their claim that this relic is the Founder's Orb on a legend.] in the original release) And that legend claims that the founder will return when the riddle is solved at last. Apollo: Right. And that's what happened. The founder was revealed for all to see. Phoenix: But Mr. Justice, what about the rest of the legend? Apollo: Huh? Phoenix: According to the legend, once the founder returned... ...she would bestow spiritual power onto the person who solved the riddle. Apollo: ..........Y-You're kidding, right? Phoenix: Well, Mr. Justice? Do you feel great spiritual power coursing through your veins? Apollo: Um.......... no. B-But receiving spiritual powers and stuff... It's all just mystic mumbo-jumbo, right? Phoenix: Maybe so, but you're the one basing your claim on said legend. And what we saw here does not fully fulfill it, does it? Apollo: N-No, but... Phoenix: Consequently... You cannot rightfully claim that this is the Founder's Orb! Judge: .......... Atishon: .......... Apollo: .......... .......... Apollo: (What's gotten into him? Why is Mr. Wright doing this?) Judge: Hmm... It would appear that Mr. Wright has lost a few of his marbles. Phoenix: ...Th-That couldn't be further from the truth, Your Honor. Judge: In any case... I believe this a good time for a recess. Both sides will have twenty minutes to prepare. (Changed from [I believe this a good time for a recess. Both sides will have 20 minutes to prepare.] in the original release) I ask that all arguments be ready by then. Oh, and Mr. Wright? You'd do well to wash up and find your missing marbles by then, too. Phoenix: .................... May 17District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Athena: Mr. Wright is sure acting funny. I mean, he's famous for going out on a limb, but that last assertion was just plain crazy. Apollo: It's either a bluff or a Hail Mary. Either way, it doesn't make much sense. Trucy: ...Maybe there's something we're missing here. Although, he seemed perfectly normal when we spoke earlier. Athena: ...Apollo, I have a bad feeling about this. I'm going to go check up on him. Apollo: (What's going on with you, Mr. Wright...?) ???: Hey. Private Justice. Apollo: ...Oh, Sarge. Armie: I forgot to mention something. O-On the night of Papa's murder, a strange thing happened. Apollo: Oh? But why are you only telling me about it now? Armie: Well... I didn't say anything before because I thought Papa's death was an accident. But now that we know otherwise, I figured it might be important. Apollo: (There's still more to this case?) Armie: When I left my room and lost consciousness, I passed out right here. Apollo: That's right above the coffee bar. Armie: Mm-hm. But when I came to... ...someone was pushing my wheelchair. Apollo: What?! Armie: I was so scared, I beat a hasty retreat -- as fast as my wheels could take me! Apollo: Do you know who it was? Armie: No. It was pitch black. Plus, I fled to my room so fast, I didn't even have a chance to turn on the lights. Apollo: Maybe it was your father. Armie: No, he would have said something to me. Besides, I'd have known if it was him. Apollo: So then, it could've been... ...your father's real killer? Armie: My thoughts exactly. Apollo: But you didn't report this to the police? Armie: ...I-It didn't even occur to me. Apollo: It's okay. You were obviously still upset, so don't bear yourself up over it. Dhurke: Apollo, this could be really important information. I think the act of pushing Sarge's wheelchair could be part of some bigger scheme. It's hard to see why else the killer would do such a thing. Apollo: (Guess I should take her statement down as evidence.) Armie's Statement added to the Court Record. Apollo: Oh, welcome back, Athena. ...Hm? (What's with the long face?) Athena: .......... Apollo: How'd it go with Mr. Wright? Athena: .......... What should I...? Apollo: Athena? Athena: Oops, sorry! Zoned out there for a sec. The recess is almost over, so let's go! Ha, a-ha ha. Apollo: ........ (What was that all about?) May 17District Court - Courtroom No. 6 Judge: All right. Court is, once again, back in session. Now, umm... Mr. Wright. About that last objection you raised... Phoenix: We, the plaintiffs, still believe that the defense has yet to sufficiently prove its case. They claim that, according to legend, the Founder's Orb would bestow spiritual power... ...yet the relic in question has failed to do so. Therefore, it has failed its own test. Judge: I-I see... Apollo: (He's sticking with that ridiculous argument?) Phoenix: Furthermore... ...even if is the Founder's Orb, it can't be awarded to the Defiant Dragons. After all, they were the ones who killed Dr. Buff. Apollo: Apollo: What are you talking about? That was already proven to be false. There are no grounds for asserting that the Defiant Dragons murdered the doctor! Phoenix: Oh, but I'm afraid there are, Mr. Justice. ...Your Honor. I would like to present new testimony to this court. Testimony that will show that Datz Are'bal did, in fact, kill Dr. Buff! Apollo: What?! Judge: Very well. You may call your witness. Athena: I guess Mr. Wright found another new angle. Apollo: What new testimony could there be this late in the game? Atishon: Fellow citizens! It is I, Paul Atishon, the once and future representative of the people! Apollo: (Jeez, not him again.) Phoenix: My client divulged new information to me during the recess. He remembered something he saw, you see -- something crucial to this case. Apollo: (How very convenient...) Witness Testimony -- Datz's Crime -- Atishon: It was around 11 at night, and I was out on a mobile meet-and-greet around the village. That's when I saw Dr. Buff being murdered from outside his study window! Mr. Are'bal snuck up from behind and struck him on the head. His weapon of choice: a suitcase. A big, strong man like him could easily swing a heavy suitcase into someone's head. Apollo: You saw the murder as it happened?! And you're just telling us now because...? Atishon: Heh heh heh. I saved the best for last. It's a tactic known to all the political greats. Phoenix: The murder weapon was a complete mystery... ...but my client's eyewitness account has finally brought it to light. Judge: According to the autopsy report... ...Dr. Buff was struck in the head by the corner of some object. I suppose that could very well be the corner of a suitcase. Apollo: Apollo: But eyewitness testimony isn't the same as hard evidence! Phoenix: Oh, I wouldn't worry about that if I were you. Apollo: What's that supposed to mean? Phoenix: We have physical evidence, too. A luminol test revealed... ...the doctor's blood on Mr. Are'bal's suitcase. Apollo: R-Really?! But how does that prove that Mr. Are'bal used it as a weapon? Phoenix: Phoenix: You should know the answer to that, Mr. Justice. Since you know was well as I that the suitcase is covered in his fingerprints. Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! (I forgot we'd dusted it right in front of Ema!) Athena: The Turnabout Terror strikes again. Judge: Hmm... This is quite convincing testimony and evidence. Nevertheless, you may proceed with your cross-examination, Mr. Justice. Cross Examination -- Datz's Crime -- Atishon: It was around 11 at night, and I was out on a mobile meet-and-greet around the village. Press Apollo: Apollo: You were on a so-called \"mobile-meet-and-greet\" at 11 at night? Atishon: That's right. It's the perfect time because everyone is at home. You should have seen how the villagers' eyes teared up when they heard what I had to say. Apollo: (With tears of frustration, no doubt.) You weren't riding around in your palanquin? Atishon: That's right. Some village idiot reported me to the police. I've been banned from using it after dark. Athena: No wonder, what with all the noise he makes. Apollo: So, what exactly did you see, then? Atishon: That's when I saw Dr. Buff being murdered from outside his study window! Press Apollo: Apollo: Sounds like you witnessed something rather shocking. Atishon: Indeed. I didn't even believe it at first. I mean, a vicious murder, in Kurain? Apollo: There haven't been many murders there, I take it? Atishon: If I'm elected, I promise you that such a terrible tragedy will never happen again! A vote for me is a vote to banish murder forever from our beloved Kurain Village! Apollo: (Yeah, good luck with that.) Judge: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, please tell the court what you saw at the scene of the crime. Atishon: Mr. Are'bal snuck up from behind and struck him on the head. Press Apollo: Apollo: He snuck up from behind? So you're saying the doctor never even realized Mr. Are'bal was there? Atishon: That's right. He was utterly absorbed in a book. Apollo: ...I see. What did you see Mr. Are'bal do next? Atishon: He climbed up the bookshelf ladder and dumped a bunch of books down on the body. I believe he was trying to make it look like an accident. But that idiot didn't realize I could see everything from outside the window. Apollo: (One of those statements doesn't feel right.) Your Honor, I believe the witness made an important statement just now about how... The crime was clearly visible Apollo: If the crime was visible through the window, that's earth-shattering testimony! Judge: ...Is it? Because to my ears, it sounds like a rather obvious fact. Apollo: ...Oh, sorry. I'm good, then. Judge: Hmmm... Very well. Will the witness please continue with his testimony? Leads back to cross-examination The doctor was reading a book Apollo: The doctor was reading a book at the time of the murder...? That's vital testimony! Judge: Very well. The witness will please add that statement to his testimony. Adds statement \"The doctor was standing in front of the bookshelves, absorbed in a book.\" if not already added Datz is an idiot Apollo: The witness said Mr. Are'bal is an idiot. That's a key piece of information! Datz: Don't you jump on the bandwagon, AJ! I'm no idiot, you hear! Judge: Hmm... I fail to see how that is a key piece of information. Apollo: ...Yeah, I guess it's not, is it? Judge: Then it seems there is no need to add it into the witness's testimony. So let's get on with it, shall we? Leads back to cross-examination Atishon: The doctor was standing in front of the bookshelves, absorbed in a book. Press Apollo: Apollo: You watched a murderer commit his crime and did nothing to stop it? That doesn't sound like a good way to score points with the voting public. Atishon: I'm a politician, not a superhero! I'm under no obligation to risk life and limb. Athena: He's sure quick to deny his obligations when there's nothing in it for him. Apollo: I'm getting tired of listening to his endless campaigning and flimsy rationalizations. Phoenix: About your testimony, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson... You said Mr. Are'bal struck the doctor from behind when he was absorbed in a book. Atishon: Yes, that's exactly what happened. Present Doctor's Reading Glasses Apollo: Leads to: \"The doctor was standing in front of the bookshelves, absorbed in a book, you say?\" Atishon: His weapon of choice: a suitcase. Press Apollo: Apollo: Are you sure? Atishon: Positive. I saw it with my own two eyes. Apollo: Yet, despite your certainty, you kept quiet about it until now? Atishon: No, I was waiting. I knew there would be a perfect chance to talk about it later. Information must always be disclosed in a strategic manner. That is one of the lessons of kingcraft, as taught by the Atishon clan. Apollo: (Is there a lesson, by chance, in the Atishon Kingcraft Guidebook on being honest?) Atishon: Anyway, I saw Mr. Are'bal commit that heinous crime. Atishon: A big, strong man like him could easily swing a heavy suitcase into someone's head. Press Apollo: Apollo: I would have to agree, that suitcase is really heavy. ...Wait a second. How did you know it was so heavy? For all you knew, it could've been empty. Atishon: Gnrk! Phoenix: Phoenix: My client witnessed the crime in progress. So naturally, he saw Mr. Are'bal straining to lift what was obviously a heavy suitcase. I can't say I'm a fan of you trying to discredit my client by tripping him up, Mr. Justice. Apollo: (But I'm just doing what you always do, Mr. Wright!) Before adding statement Athena: Talk about new testimony. He's totally changed his story. Apollo: If he had really seen the murder taking place, you'd think he'd have said so from the start. Athena: Maybe he had some reason to hide what he really saw? Apollo: (If so, that might be our only opening.) After adding statement Athena: Dr. Buff was struck from behind while he was absorbed in a book? He must've been really into it. Apollo: Hmm... It doesn't add up. Athena: What doesn't? Apollo: (That Paul Atishon is lying. I'm sure of it.) Apollo: The doctor was standing in front of the bookshelves, absorbed in a book, you say? I'm sorry, but it seems your testimony is completely unreliable. Atishon: That's quite a bold statement. Well, let's hear you back it up. I challenge you to prove that I am anything but one hundred percent reliable. (Changed from [I challenge you to prove that I am anything but 100% reliable.] in the original release) Apollo: It would be my pleasure. Lately, it seems that the doctor's eyes had gotten so bad, he needed reading glasses. However, his reading glasses were over on his desk. So you see, there's no way he could've been reading a book in front of the bookshelves! Atishon: Hrrrrrrngh! Apollo: I'm sorry, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, but... ...I'm going to have to ask you to explain this discrepancy to the voting public! Atishon: Ngah, gah gah gah! I-I-I... Apollo: You what? Atishon: I-I'll explain it, you lowly cur! I simply made a mistake, you see. The doctor was actually sitting at his desk when Mr. Are'bal hit him over the head! Apollo: But then the doctor would have been facing him. Surely he would've seen him and tried to run? Atishon: D-Dr. Buff was nodding off! I could tell because he his eyes were closed, and he wasn't moving! Apollo: (Sounds more like what you would do.) Then how do you explain the back that he was struck in the back of the head? Isn't that something that should be impossible from the front of the desk? Atishon: ...Oh, um... About that... H-He... He bowed his head when he nodded off. That's when he was clobbered. Judge: Hmm... So that's what you saw. Well, Mr. Justice, that sounds like a perfectly reasonable explanation to me. Do you have a problem with the proposal that the doctor was struck while nodding off? No problem Apollo: No problem here, Your Honor. The doctor was probably dozing, just as the witness said. Athena: N-No, Apollo! Wait! If you accept that, then you might as well admit Datz killed the doctor. Apollo: ...Your Honor! I, uh, actually do have a problem with that statement... Judge: Very well. But let's avoid careless answers like that, or I will have a problem with you! Apollo: (Guess I blew that one.) Judge: Now, as you were saying, Mr. Justice? Leads to: \"There is a problem. A very big problem.\" A big problem Leads to: \"There is a problem. A very big problem.\" Apollo: There is a problem. A very big problem. The witness's statement doesn't hold up under the slightest bit of scrutiny! Judge: Is that so? Then will you please show this court what evidence you have to justify this? Apollo: Gladly, Your Honor. This shows the problem with the witness's claim that he saw the doctor nodding off! Present Study Diagram Apollo: Leads to: \"...A diagram of the study?\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: This shows the glaring problem with the witness's statement! Atishon: ...............Zzz... Apollo: See? The witness has passed out from the overwhelming power of my evidence! Phoenix: No, Mr. Justice. Your lackadaisical attempt to refute him put my client to sleep. That's all. Judge: I feel a yawn coming on myself. Perhaps giving you this penalty will wake me up. Apollo: Surely there are better ways to stay awake, Your Honor? Athena: Apollo, think about the relative positions of the witness and doctor again. Apollo: Right. That's where we'll find the contradiction. Judge: Now then, Mr. Justice. See that you avoid these snooze-incusing answers in the future. Leads back to: \"This shows the problem with the witness's claim that he saw the doctor nodding off!\" Judge: ...A diagram of the study? Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson allegedly viewed the murder from... ...here. And the doctor was allegedly nodding off... ...here. But from his vantage point, the bookcase would've blocked the witness's line of sight. Judge: Why, yes, I believe you're right! Atishon: B-B-But...! Arrrgh! Phoenix: Phoenix: The fact remains, my client knew that the suitcase was the murder weapon. So he definitely had first-hand knowledge of the crime scene! Apollo: I'm afraid I have to agree with you there, Mr. Wright. But then we have to ask ourselves, from what vantage point did he see the murder? Phoenix: What are you insinuating, Mr. Justice? Apollo: From what vantage point could Mr. Atishon-Wimperson have seen the dozing doctor? Once we determine that, I believe we'll finally see the truth behind this incident. The witness saw the murder from... right here! Present area between Bookshelf and Coffee Bar Apollo: Leads to: \"You've got to be kidding!\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Phoenix: How could he have seen it from there? Apollo: Oh, umm... He just did somehow? I mean, I just feel like it must've been from there. Athena: Um, Apollo? for some reason, I feel like you're wrong. Judge: Hmm... And for some reason, I feel like giving you a penalty. Apollo: (So much for that spot.) Athena: Hmm... Looking at it in another way... ...where must Mr. Atishon-Wimperson have been standing to see the doctor nodding off? Apollo: Someplace where the bookcase wasn't blocking his view, I guess. Judge: Now then. Will the defense please indicate where the witness saw the murder from? Leads back to: \"The witness saw the murder from... right here!\" Phoenix: You've got to be kidding! Judge: B-But that's--! Apollo: It is indeed. But everything only makes sense if the witness was there in the study. Athena: I-Inside the study? But that's the scene of the crime! Apollo: I know. Mr. Atishon-Wimperson -- the man who claims to be a witness to the murder... ...was most certainly in that very room. Athena: A-Apollo, are you suggesting...? Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson! Weren't YOU the one who actually swung that suitcase? Atishon: Gaaaaaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Phoenix: What you're proposing is ludicrous! My client is a small, thin man, whereas Mr. Are'bal had the musculature to pull it off. Apollo: ......... (He has a point... I gave up trying to lift that thing after one go.) Atishon: That's right. He's the only one who could've lifted such a heavy object. Now do you understand? The rebel Datz Are'bal is the doctor's killer! Athena: As long as the suitcase is the murder weapon, the suspicion falls entirely on Datz. You'll have to poke a hole in Mr. Wright's argument somehow, Apollo. Apollo: Oh, I will. And with his own technique, no less. If Mr. Atishon-Wimperson couldn't swing the suitcase around... ...we'll just have to consider another way he could've used it as a murder weapon instead. I'm going to turn this case on its head, Mr. Wright, just like you taught me. Phoenix: ...You talk big, Mr. Justice, but do you have what it takes? Judge: Well, this should be interesting... Apollo:: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson's testimony has been filled with one inaccuracy after another. First he stated Dr. Buff was in front of the bookshelves. Now he claims that the doctor was sitting at his desk. So where was the victim REALLY when he was killed? Also, where was his killer, and how was the murder weapon REALLY used? Judge: So the important thing here is the position of the victim and killer related to each other? Apollo: Yes, Your Honor. If they were positioned a certain way... ...it would be possible to use the suitcase as a weapon without lifting a finger. Phoenix: You can't mean...! Apollo: I would ask the court to recall the study's layout. It's quite distinctive, as you can see. Now, if Dr. Buff were sitting in a certain spot, and his killer was at a certain other spot... ...the suitcase would become a weapon ANYONE could use! Judge: Hmm... Very well, Mr. Justice. Where was Dr. Buff's killer at the time of the crime? Present balcony west of Coffee Bar Apollo: Leads to: \"Th-There...?!\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Judge: How could the murder have been committed from there? Phoenix: Yes, I would love to see a demonstration. Apollo: ...Um, well... I can't from here. Judge: Well, I have a demonstration for you from here... on how to give a penalty. Apollo: (So much for that spot.) Athena: If the killer didn't swing the suit case, there aren't many other ways to use it as a weapon. Apollo: I know. And there aren't that many places to use it from, either. Judge: Now then. I hope the defense is ready to try again. Leads back to: \"Where was Dr. Buff's killer at the time of the crime?\" Judge: Th-There...?! Phoenix: Oh... That's... Apollo: This should wrap things up nice and pretty for you, Mr. Wright. I would ask the court to recall the study's layout. But this time, instead of thinking in two dimensions... ...let's think in three. Only then can we clearly see the killer's method at work. The killer didn't have to swing the suitcase. ...If he used gravity to his advantage, that is. That's right. It was the plaintiff -- one Paul Atishon-Wimperson -- who used the suitcase. He pushed it from the second floor... ...and sent it hurtling down onto Dr. Buff, who was sitting at the coffee bar! Atishon: Yaaaaaaargh! Apollo: That psychology book had been at the coffee bar, no doubt. The doctor must have set it down there after he'd finished reading it, or the like. But his blood got on it, which is why the killer thought to hide it in that mountain of books! Phoenix: Phoenix: That's quite an entertaining theory you have there, Mr. Justice. But there's no evidence that the murder took place at the coffee bar. Apollo: ......... (I'm not so sure about that, Mr. Wright. I'd say that evidence of the murder occurring at the coffee bar...) Exists Leads to: \"The evidence does exist, and I'm going to show you.\" Does not exist Apollo: Obviously, there is none! Phoenix: Just as I thought. So, if the coffee bar isn't where the doctor was killed... ...the defense's little theory fails to bear fruit Judge: Hmm... Mr. Wright is correct, of course. Apollo: Urk! ...Umm... Athena: Don't just stand there, Apollo! If you don't do something quick, we're going to lose both the orb AND the creep, together! Apollo: I'm thinking... I'm thinking... Oh! (Wait a second... There IS a piece of evidence that proves the doctor was killed at the coffee bar!) Phoenix: So, such evidence never existed in the first place, did it? Leads to: \"The evidence does exist, and I'm going to show you.\" Apollo: The evidence does exist, and I'm going to show you. Phoenix: Y-You are? Apollo: This, right here, is proof that the murder took place at the coffee bar. Present stained book Apollo: Leads to: \"This brown stain was determined to be coffee.\" Present anything else Apollo: Judge: Hmm... I don't understand how that could be proof of anything. Apollo: You don't, Your Honor? Well, I believe Mr. Wright understands perfectly. Phoenix: All I know is, it's perfectly clear you don't understand what you're talking about. Judge: Now that is something I can understand. Apollo: (Me too... Oww.) Athena: Apollo, let's take another look at that crime scene photo. Maybe there's something in it related to the coffee bar. Apollo: I've got it this time! Leads back to: \"This, right here, is proof that the murder took place at the coffee bar.\" Apollo: This brown stain was determined to be coffee. What's more, it was still a bit damp when we saw it yesterday morning. Phoenix: Ah! Apollo: One look at this book speaks volumes, I'm afraid, Mr. Wright. It tells us the doctor was having a cup of coffee at the coffee bar. That's when the suitcase came hurtling down, striking him on the head... ...causing both his blood and his coffee to spatter onto it! Phoenix: Ack! Atishon: Aaaaaaagh! Apollo: Well, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson?! Atishon: .........Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh... What motive could I have possibly had to kill Dr. Buff?! Apollo: (And there it is. That final excuse cornered killers are so fond of.) Well, the doctor never returned your \"crystal\" to you, did he? Instead, he hid it in the cave ruins. Atishon: Nngh... Apollo: Telling him that the Defiant Dragons were a dangerous bunch was a huge blunder. All it did was make him hide the orb. Your lie came back to bite you in the end. Atishon: Uhhh... Apollo: Even worse, the doctor saw the news reports, so he knew the relic was the Founder's Orb. Being the conscientious researcher he was, he knew he had to return it to its rightful place... ...and that meant keeping it out of your hands. Atishon: Aaaaaaaaaaaaah... Apollo: You were so angry that he refused to return the relic to you... ...that you killed him with your own hands. Isn't that right, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Atishon: Arrrrrraaaaaagh! .........I-I-I... Th-That is... Phoenix: Phoenix: ...A-Apollo! Don't! Please don't accuse my client of murder! Apollo: .........Huh? What do you mean, \"don't accuse him\"? Why would you even say that, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: ...Er, what I meant was, um... He's a promising politician with a bright future ahead of him. It's in our nation's best interests to avoid burdening him with the taint of scandal. Apollo: Say what? Atishon: Wright! You'd better do something to change the current courtroom climate... ...or I'll be charged with murder! And you know what will happen to her if that happens. Phoenix: ...Arngh! Apollo: (What's he talking about? Well, I can ponder that later. For now...) Mr. Wright, you can't possibly believe that Mr. Are'bal is the killer. Are you really going to send an innocent man to prison? I thought you were better than that. Phoenix: Uhhh... Ummm... Apollo: Well, Mr. Wright? Answer me! Phoenix: Errr... Ummm... UUHWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH! Apollo: M-M-Mr. Wright? ...What in the world's going on here? Athena: ......... Apollo: ...If you won't say anything, then...! Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, the defense hereby accuses you of-- Athena: Athena: A-Apollo! Wait! Apollo: Not you, too, Athena! Athena: Umm... It's just, uhhh... I wasn't sure whether I should say anything, but... ...during that last recess, when I went to check on Mr. Wright... ...I overheard something I shouldn't have. Phoenix: I trust Maya is unharmed. Atishon: I can't really say. But just remember... If I'm arrested or fail to obtain the treasure... ...there will be consequences. Consequences of the worst kind, if you catch my drift. Phoenix: Augh! Atishon: Relax. All you have to do is ensure I get my hands on that relic. I must deliver it to my benefactor at all costs. Phoenix: What do they want that relic for anyway? Atishon: Heh heh heh. It's something to do with an old legend. My patron seeks the great power said to be granted to whoever solves its secret. Apollo: ....Maya? As in Maya Fey? Athena: Yes, the boss's legendary former assistant. Apollo: Ms. Fey's being held hostage? Athena: So it seems. Apollo: Why didn't you tell me as soon as you heard this? Athena: Sorry. It's just, Mr. Wright spotted me before I could slip away... ...and made me promise not to tell you. He said it would make things more difficult if you found out. Apollo: Arngh! As if things weren't already hard enough! (So that's why Mr. Wright was acting so strange. I had no idea. This must've been excruciating for him. Think, Justice... There's got to be something you can do!) Judge: Mr. Justice, about that last statement of yours... I believe you were in the middle of accusing the plaintiff of murdering Dr. Buff... Would you care to continue? Apollo: Ack! I-I... Phoenix: Nngh... I'm sorry, Apollo... I'm really, really sorry. Judge: What's gotten into you two? Apollo: ......... (If I accuse that slimebag, I put Ms. Fey's life in jeopardy.) Atishon: Heh heh heh. It seems you've finally caught on. I'm far too important to be accused of murder. After all, our nation's future rests squarely on my shoulders. Apollo: (Nnrgh... Either I give up, or...) Atishon: Once I present the crystal to my patron, my victory is assured! Then one day, I'll become president -- and then, king! I'll have every politician at my command! Now, retract your accusation! Apollo: Arrrrrrnnngh! (I can't kowtow to him, but... but...) The defense would... It would like to retract... the previous accusati-- ???: Dhurke: ...Apollo. Apollo: Dh-Dhurke? Dhurke: I don't know what's going on here... ...but a lawyer should never look the way you do right now... ... with \"defeat\" and \"resignation\" written all over your face. Apollo: ! .........A dragon never yields. Dhurke: Even when wounded, a dragon bites down hard, and never lets go till its dying breath. It glares, it roars, and it latches its jaws firmly onto its prey till the bitter end. That's what lawyers do to get to the truth! Apollo: ...Dhurke. (A dragon never yields... ...He's right. It's all over if I give up now! If Mr. Wright's hands are tied, it's up to me to do what must be done! He's saved my neck so many times. Now... it's my turn to save his!) ...Dhurke, thanks for that wake up call. Dhurke: Heh, now that's the face of a lawyer you've got there, son. Apollo: (Where there's a will, there's a way. And I'm going to find the way to save Ms. Fey AND see that justice is served!) Apollo: That scumbag is holding Ms. Fey hostage to ensure he gets the orb for his patron. And it seems said patron believes in the orb's legend. Thing is, the founder DID appear when the orb was exposed to fire, as the legend said. If the legend is true, then we've already solved the riddle, right? Yes, we have Apollo: Yes, we've definitely solved the riddle! ...And yet... ...we still don't understand what the part about \"bestowing power\" is talking about. I need to rethink this! Leads back to: \"If the legend is true, then we've already solved the riddle, right?\" No, not yet Leads to: \"We have not solved the riddle yet\" We have not solved the riddle yet Apollo: The legend says that the founder will bestow great spiritual power when she returns. But if that's true, it means we haven't solved the whole riddle yet. But how can that be? Are we missing something? ...Wait, maybe... Maybe the part about the founder returning should be taken literally. But how would it be possible for a dead person to return to the world of the living? Cloning Apollo: Oh, I know! Cloning technology! I bet some of the founder's DNA is hidden somewhere in the orb. ...Argh, what am I talking about? They didn't know about DNA and cloning back then. I'd better think of something else. Leads back to: \"But how would it be possible for a dead person to return to the world of the living?\" Channeling Leads to: \"The founder can return though channeling\" Time travel Apollo: Oh, I know! Time travel! We could go back to the past and bring the founder here to the present. ...Wait, what am I saying? Maybe I should cut back on the sci-fi movies. I'd better think of something else. Leads back to: \"But how would it be possible for a dead person to return to the world of the living?\" The founder can return though channeling Apollo: Oh, I know! here IS a way for the dead to return -- spirit channeling! Of course, you'd have to know what he founder looks like first... ...but the orb has revealed her face to us, so what if it's a sign that we should channel her? Given the facts, in order to solve the riddle and receive the founder's power, I'd need... A spirit medium Leads to: \"A MEDIUM IS NEEDED TO OBTAIN THE POWER\" To practice channeling Apollo: All I have to do is train as a spirit medium, so I can channel spirits myself! ...Wait, it can't be that easy. And if I ever did become a medium, I wouldn't need the founder's power anymore anyway. Leads back to: \"Given the facts, in order to solve the riddle and receive the founder's power, I'd need...\" A MEDIUM IS NEEDED TO OBTAIN THE POWER Apollo: The ability of a medium to channel spirits is the final key to unlocking the orb's secret. That means Mr. Atishon-Wimperson's patron will need one, too. And once that slimy politician realizes that, he won't be able to lay a finger on Ms. Fey! Apollo: Everything is going to be okay, Mr. Wright. Because Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson can't afford to harm a hair on Ms. Fey's head. Phoenix: ............Huh? Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson! It seems you've chosen the wrong person to take hostage. Atishon: Wh-What do you mean? Apollo: Your patron seeks to solve the orb's riddle... ...and thereby receive great spiritual power. However, only Maya Fey can truly give them what they really want. Phoenix: She can? Atishon: What do you mean, \"only Maya Fey\"? Apollo: Think about what the return of the founder really means. We should have considered it more literally. After all, the orb was made in the Kingdom of Khura'in -- the birthplace of spirit mediums. Phoenix: ...Ahh, I think I see now. You need to know what the deceased looks like in order to channel them. But in Khura'inism, depicting the face of the founder is taboo. However, her true face was hidden in the orb. So maybe the orb is telling us... to try channeling the founder. Apollo: Exactly. Through a spirit medium, the founder can quite literally return. And if the legend is true... ...the founder just might bestow spiritual power on someone when she does. Phoenix: It's like when Pearls imbued my magatama with spiritual power. If a human could be imbued with such power in a similar manner... Dhurke: It is said the founder possesses immense spiritual power. Such a great feat would not necessarily be beyond her-- W-Wait a second! Th-Then the legend is true?! Apollo: Do you understand now, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? You are holding hostage the final key to unlocking the orb's secret. And if anything were to happen to her, the riddle would remain unsolved, forever! Atishon: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Atishon: Atishon: Th-Th-There's always Pearl Fey! I could simply ask her to help! If she wants money, I have plenty to offer! Apollo: She's not the kind of person to be tempted by material gain. And she certainly wouldn't help you if anything were to happen to her cousin. Atishon: Urhgk. Apollo: Or maybe you'd like to go ask the queen of Khura'in to channel the founder for you. Phoenix: He could, but he'd probably get executed for requesting such a thing. Apollo: ...It's over. Now, confess! You killed Dr. Buff, didn't you? Atishon: Ack! Hrrrrrrrrrrrrrngh! It wasn't supposed to end this way! Judge: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. Are you admitting to committing the crime? Atishon: Errr... Um, I-I-I... You're my lawyer, Wright! Do something! Phoenix: It's true that I'm your lawyer. And as such, it's my job to defend you. ...However, defending my client isn't the only job a lawyer has. There's something else that's equally as important. And that is finding the truth. Atishon: Wh-What? Phoenix Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, you have sought to twist the truth in the dirtiest of ways. I was complicit in your hostage-taking, but in a way, I was being held hostage, too. Even so, there's still time for me to make things right. And I owe it all to you, Apollo. Apollo: ! (Mr. Wright...) Phoenix: I can't allow a murderer to walk away scot-free! Therefore, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, I must resign as your attorney. Atishon: No no no no noooo! D-Does this mean... I'm under arrest? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! ........................ ............... .................................... ........................ Apollo: ...Well? Atishon: ...I've nothing to confess. Apollo: What?! Atishon: I said, I've nothing to confess! I don't and I won't, especially not to a plebeian like you! Apollo: (This guy doesn't know when to give up.) Atishon: Besides, there's no truth to these allegations! I mean, look at the suitcase. You won't find a single print of mine on it! Apollo: All that means is that you wiped them off, taking care to only leave Mr. Are'bal's. Atishon: Heh heh heh. As many a great politician has said before me: no comment. Phoenix: In that case, try switching things up, Apollo. Look at the situation from a different angle. Is there really nothing that points to the suitcase being dropped from up above? Apollo: Hmmm... Evidence that points to the suitcase being dropped from the second floor... Athena: Hmm... If the killer pushed the suitcase from the second floor hallway over the coffee bar... ...that would place him right around here. Apollo: Ah! Maybe... Just maybe...! Phoenix: Thought of something, Apollo? Apollo: I believe this piece of evidence to be connected to the dropping of the suitcase. Present Armie's Statement Apollo: Leads to: \"That... appears to be a statement. But how is that related to this case?\" Present anything else Apollo: Atishon: Wh-What is that?! Phoenix: Apollo, I don't see how that could possibly be related. Atishon: ...Oh, it's not? Tsk, I just wasted a perfectly good reaction! Your Honor! Penalize this pernicious peon! Judge: Hmm.. Yes, well, we all must be held accountable for our words and actions. Apollo: (What do you think I'm trying to do with Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, Your Honor?!) Athena: So the killer dropped the suitcase from above the coffee bar. Apollo: Right. Let's look again to see if we have any evidence related to that event. Phoenix: Come on, Apollo. I'm counting on you. Leads back to: \"I believe this piece of evidence to be connected to the dropping of the suitcase.\" Judge: That... appears to be a statement. But how is that related to this case? Apollo: On the night of the murder, Your Honor, Miss Armie Buff physically left her room. That's when she saw the doctor burning the orb, and subsequently passed out. ...Right above the coffee bar. But with her there in her wheelchair... ...the killer wouldn't have been able to drop the suitcase down onto the doctor. Phoenix: Good point! Apollo: However, according to Sarge... ...she woke up just as someone was trying to move her in her wheelchair. Phoenix: Ah! Armie: ...someone was pushing my wheelchair. Apollo: What?! Armie: I was so scared, I beat a hasty retreat -- as fast as my wheels could take me! Apollo: She must've been in the killer's way and had to be moved. Isn't that right, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Atishon: ...Agrk! Phoenix: And if the killer had pushed the wheelchair with his bare hands... ...we may yet find the conclusive evidence we need. Apollo: Exactly. Fortunately for us, that evidence slipped right through the killer's fingers. If only he'd been able to hold on to it just a little tighter. But now, he is neither able to discard nor alter it. Phoenix: Honestly, that piece of evidence wasn't even supposed to be here in this courtroom today. And yet... it looks like sometimes, things DO get better. Atishon: Unngh! B-B-B-B-But...! Th-This... This wasn't supposed to happen! Apollo: No? Well, too bad. Because the evidence that sped away from you that night... ...has come back to haunt you! Right here at this very trial! Atishon: ARGH! UHWAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! Apollo: Your Honor! The defense's final piece of evidence is on this person! Present Armie Buff profile Apollo: Leads to: \"Th-That's...!\" Present anyone else Apollo: Phoenix: ...Apollo? Apollo: Yes, Mr. Wright? Athena: Umm, I think he's saying that that doesn't jive with anything you've said so far. Judge: It seems Ms. Cykes is the more sensible of you two. Apollo: (Ugh... No need to compare the two of us...) Phoenix: What did the killer have to move in order to drop the suitcase? Consider that, and the rest should follow. Apollo: Okay, I'll get it for sure this time! Leads back to: \"Your Honor! The defense's final piece of evidence is on this person!\" Atishon: Th-That's...! Apollo: On the night of the murder, Sarge passed out... ...only to come to and find that someone was pushing her wheelchair. That's when she fled back into her room. Phoenix: She didn't physically see a single soul after that... Not until Athena drew her out through that therapy session, that is. Apollo: While the killer was able to wipe the prints on the suitcase off... (Changed from [While the killer was able to wipe the prints on the suitcase...] in the original release) ...the same can't be said for the prints that got away. Atishon: Ah. Ah. M-My fellow Kurainians... Apollo: Well, Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson? Try to explain your way out of this one! The podium is all yours! Atishon: Ah. Ah. P-Paul Atishon, savior of Kurain... I-I... I am not a crook... I... My political career...! It can't end like this! I-I'm destined for great things! Something's wrong... This isn't real! It's a dream! No, a nightmare! Ooooooooooooh. Huh? What? ...Wait? ...Really? Ah! Election ResultsWINNER Atishon: Ahhhhhh! Whoa, no waaaaaaaaay!!! BANZAI! BANZAI! BANZAI! BANZAI!!! Breaking NewsPaul Atishon arrested on murder charges and stripped of his electoral win. Atishon: ...Wait, what? ...............No, please. Wait. Don't go! No... No... Please...Whoa! Grandpaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! ........................ Judge: M-Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Are you all right? ...B-Bailiff! Get him to the first-aid station, on the double! Judge: Well, this was yet another unexpected turn of events. In light of everything that's been revealed, it seems that this relic is indeed the Founder's Orb. And it seems Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson can be considered a suspect in Dr. Buff's murder. Phoenix: Apollo, I want to thank you for everything. Apollo: ! Phoenix: Thanks to you, I didn't have to keep bending the truth. I don't know what I would've done without you. Apollo: Er, don't mention it, ha ha ha... Athena: You were amazing today, Apollo! Apollo: (Well, I couldn't have done it without Dhurke.) .........A dragon never yields. Dhurke: Even when wounded, a dragon bites down hard, and never lets go till its dying breath. It glares, it roars, and it latches its jaws firmly onto its prey till the bitter end. That's what lawyers do to get the truth! Apollo: (A dragon never yields... Every lawyer should take that to heart.) Judge: As it seems both sides have no further objections... ...would Dhurke Sahdmadhi please take the stand? Dhurke: .......... Judge: This court awards the orb to the Defiant Dragons per the stated transfer agreement. Should the Kingdom of Khura'in claim ownership... ...the matter may have to be deliberated in court all over again. I just hope, or shall I say pray, that I'm not the judge presiding over that one! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Indeed! A trial like that might spark an international incident. Still, there are bigger and more momentous things astir in the air! Apollo: (The revolution... Dhurke's really serious about this.) Judge: This court is adjourned! May 17District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Dhurke: Nice work, son! We've finally broken through the last obstacle on the road to revolution! Apollo: Revolution... It just doesn't seem real. Dhurke: Yes, well, to think you actually defeated the Fighting Phoenix... All I can say is, that's my boy! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (Well, Mr. Wright did have his hands tied. Who knows if I'd have won if he'd been able to fight me head-on.) Athena: I see it more like you saved Mr. Wright. Apollo: ...Saved him? Athena: Yeah, remember what he said? He didn't have to bend the truth anymore, and it was all thanks to you! Apollo: I don't know about that. (Still, I guess it IS kinda nice to be appreciated.) Trucy: ...Um, Mr. Dhurke? Now that the Holy Mother's face has been revealed... ...are you going to have a spirit medium try channeling her? I, for one, would love to see the return of the legendary founder! Apollo: Yeah, just think about it. Being able to speak to someone right out of the history books... Dhurke: Unfortunately, it's not that easy. Apollo: What? Why? Dhurke: A face isn't enough. You also need the true name of the one you're attempting to channel. Apollo: Oh, right. Pearl mentioned something like that. Dhurke: And the founder's name is only known to the priestess who's been crowned queen. In short, the only living person who knows it is the current queen of Khura'in, Ga'ran. Apollo: Oh, so without her help, we won't be seeing the founder anytime soon? Trucy: Tsk, that's no fun. Founder's Orb updated in the Court Record. Apollo: So, Dhurke, what will you do now? Dhurke: First, I'll start by tracing the route by which the orb came into Dr. Buff's hands. Apollo: Since we now know it was Paul Atishon that asked the doctor to study it... ...isn't he the one who stole it? Dhurke: No, a political nobody like him couldn't get anywhere near the orb, let alone steal it. He must've had inside help. My money is on someone connected to the royal family. Apollo: Oh, right. You said something to that effect back in the cave. Dhurke: Whoever it may be, we need to expose their dirty scheme to the light of day. Apollo: Well, I'm sure Mr. Wright has plenty of information, courtesy of his dirty client. He might be able to shed some light on this. ???: Private Justice! Sarge: That was fine work you did at the trial today! You did your sergeant proud! Apollo: Back at you, Sarge! It took real courage to leave your room like that. Armie: It's all thanks to you and Corpswoman Cykes. With my siege defense over, I can finally sally forth. Sarge: But the battle's only just begun! One for me, and me alone, to fight! Athena: To lose your mother, and then your father... What a terrible thing to endure. Apollo: Yeah... (And being wheelchair-bound doesn't help.) Armie: ...Private Justice! I've been thinking... It's about time I stood on my own two feet. After all, I no longer have Papa to coddle me! Apollo: Huh? I'm afraid I don't follow. Armie: ...Take a good look, soldier. This is one small step for man... ...and one giant leap for me! ......... Hold my drone for me, would you, Private Justice? Apollo: Y-Yes, sir. (What she is up to?) Armie: .........Hrgh! Wh-Whoa... Apollo: Sh-Sh-She's... standing?! Dhurke: Wh-What's this?! Sarge! You mean your legs... They're...?! Armie: The doctor told me that I was ready to walk again months ago. But if I admitted I could walk, I knew I would have to leave the house. So I... I faked it. Apollo: (Makes sense, but...) Armie: I kept pretending I couldn't walk. But I know Papa is watching over me now, and I'd hate to disappoint him. So, from this day forth, I'm going to march forward on my own two feet! Apollo: (What a brave kid, trying to move forward like this. But it must be so hard this soon after her father's death.) Dhurke: Don't you ever stop. You just keep on walking... comrade. Stay brave, because there will be days when you want to stop... ...but I have faith you'll find a way to muster the strength to push through them. Apollo: Yeah, you can do it. Trucy: Hey, Daddy's back! Phoenix: .................. Apollo: Mr. Wright! (What's that look on his face for?) Phoenix: Oh, Apollo! Apollo: Um, is everything all right with Ms. Fey? Phoenix: She's safe... for now. Athena: Well then, we'd better go save her, quick! Where is she, anyway? Phoenix: ...I'm afraid I have some bad news. Apollo: Huh? Phoenix: Maya's... not here in the States. She's still in Khura'in. And she's still being held hostage by the mastermind behind this whole thing. Apollo: The mastermind? Phoenix: ...That's right. Paul Atishon-Wimperson was nothing more than a pawn. Maya's true abductor is in the Kingdom of Khura'in. Apollo: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaat?! I-I don't understand, Mr. Wright! What in the world's going on over there?! Apollo: But as shocking as that news was... ...it was only the beginning. The beginning of something big -- big enough to shake Khura'in to its very core. ...Revolution. I was being swept up in a mighty wave that nothing could stop. Of course, at the time... I had no idea what the days ahead had in store for us... To be continued Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: Please take a look at this piece of evidence. Judge: I'm looking... But what am I supposed to see? Apollo: Oh, um... Uhhh... Phoenix: As your boss and mentor, here's a bit of advice: Never present evidence before you have a good grasp of the situation at hand. Apollo: R-Right... Sorry... Judge: And as the presiding judge, here's a penalty. Apollo: (Ouch. Double-teamed for doing what Mr. Wright always does anyway.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: That statement contradicts with this piece of evidence! Judge: Hmmm... And just how does it contradict with the evidence, Mr. Justice? Apollo: Um... Could I have about five minutes to figure out the answer to that? Judge: The defense will figure it out before he presents his evidence next time! Apollo: (Sounds like a plan...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: There's... something off about that statement... Judge: Hmm... It seemed perfectly reasonable to me. Apollo: No, something's definitely not right if you listen really carefully! Phoenix: A gambler once sang, you've got to know when to hold 'em, when to fold 'em... Judge: Oh, I love this one! ...Know when to walk away, know when to run! Apollo: (I don't know which penalty hurts more: the judge's or their singing.) Consult (when evidence must be presented) Athena: Is it just me, or does that statement sound a bit dubious? Apollo: You know what... you're right. Thanks, Athena! Athena: Anytime! Apollo: (Now to take another look at the evidence...) Consult (when statements must be pressed) Athena: You look like you've hit a brick wall, Apollo. Apollo: Yeah. It feels like I have, too. Athena: Maybe you just haven't brought all the facts to light. Why don't you try pressing a little more? Apollo: Good idea. (Okay, time to turn up the pressure!) Pinpoint wrong emotion (during Mood Matrix segment in the chapter \"Cross-Examining Sarge\") Apollo: Athena: Hmm... This emotion isn't that out of place, given this statement... Apollo, are you just looking at his emotions as they relate to only a single statement? It's really important to look for emotional fluctuation between different statements, too. Apollo: Oh, right. Thanks for the reminder, Athena. (All right, let's try that again.) Probe wrong area (during Mood Matrix segment in the chapter \"Cross-Examining Sarge\") Apollo: Athena: That doesn't seem to be the cause of his current emotional state. Apollo: I could sure use a clue or two right about now. Athena: A person's personality and past shapes their emotional responses. Consider everything you know about Sarge. That's where you'll find the clues you need. Apollo: (Everything I know about Sarge...) Presenting wrong evidence during the Mood Matrix Apollo: Apollo: There's an inconsistency in Sarge's testimony! Judge: Is that so? Would you be so kind as to point it out to the court? Apollo: ...Well if you're going to put me on the spot like that, I admit my confidence is waning. Judge: ...I could say the same about my confidence in you, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Ugh. (I wish you wouldn't, Your Honor.) Athena: Say, Apollo... Sarge is saying that his father was burning the orb when he was killed... ...but doesn't that seem funny to you? Considering what the doctor was up that night, it doesn't add up. Apollo: Well, now that you mention it... (All right, I'd better look through the evidence one more time.) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The Defiant Dragons have failed to sufficiently show their right to the item in question. Therefore, ownership is hereby awarded to... ...the plaintiff, Mr. Paul Atishon. Apollo: That creep Paul Atishon stole the Founder's Orb right out of our hands. The dream of revolution in the Kingdom of Khura'in died that day. And we returned to our daily lives. As for my relationship with Mr. Wright... The word awkward comes to mind. Let's just say it was never really the same. Turnabout Revolution Image Gallery Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 May 17District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Apollo: What do you mean Ms. Fey is still being held hostage? And who's this \"mastermind\"? Phoenix: ...Paul Atishon-Wimperson was nothing more than a puppet. His benefactor was the one pulling the strings. But I have no idea who they are. Apollo: So all we know is it's the person he was trying to give the orb to? Phoenix: Right. He was just following orders. Whoever it is, it seems they really want to get their hands on the orb. Apollo: So then, Ms. Fey's abduction is the work of this so-called \"benefactor,\" too? Phoenix: Right again. Whoever they are, they're in Khura'in... ...along with Maya. Apollo: I wonder who they could be. Dhurke: Wright, this Maya -- the spirit medium you've been talking about... She wouldn't happen to be that bun-haired young lady you defended back in Khura'in? Phoenix: That's her. Why do you ask? Dhurke: I see... I think I know what's going on here.  I've got good news for you, Wright. Maya is somewhere safe. That much I'm sure of. Phoenix: ...I'm afraid you've lost me. Dhurke: Heh heh heh. So that's who the little snot's patron is. It's all starting to make sense. That fool has no idea I'm here in the States with you all. Apollo: Dhurke, you mind filling us in? Phone: .......................................... Phoenix: ...! ...No caller ID. I wonder who's calling? Phone: *beep* Phoenix: Hello? Phone: Mr. Phoenix Wright, yes? Let me start by thanking you... ...for taking such good care of my subordinate. Phoenix: Wh-Who is this? Phone: I believe you know me as Mr. Atishon's... \"benefactor.\" Phoenix: Ah! Apollo: (Sounds like they're using a voice changer or something to disguise themself.) Phoenix: Where's Maya?! Is she safe?! Phone: ...I had my ears on today's proceedings. What a shock it was to hear that the key to solving the orb's riddle is a spirit medium. I admit, I did not see that coming. Apollo: (Wait, did they plant a listening device in here somehow?) Phone: Nevertheless, don't think for a minute that it will guarantee Maya Fey's safety. She is not the only medium within my reach, you see. Phoenix: You harm a hair on Maya's head and you'll have to answer to me! Dhurke: ...Wright, give it here a sec. Phoenix: Wait! Dhurke: Hey, there. How's it going, stranger? Phone: ...Who is this? Dhurke: Why, it's your friendly neighborhood dragon. I just happen to be in the U.S. on a little trip. ...Minister of Justice Inga Karkhuul Khura'in. Phoenix: I-Inga?! Apollo: What?! Phoenix: Maya's kidnapper... Apollo: ...Is Khura'in's... Minister of Justice? Inga: Dh-Dhurke?! Is that you, ya dirty turncoat?! How in the--! What in blazes is going on here?! Dhurke: Oh, you know, just popped over to the States for a little R&R. But enough about me, Inga. That was a poor excuse for a bluff you pulled just now. We both know your threats are as empty as your head. You can't lay a hand on Maya Fey, and I do mean that literally. Inga: Ugh! Apollo: (What is he talking about?) Dhurke: You can kiss your chances of getting the orb goodbye. Inga: ...Heh heh heh. Maya Fey ain't my only... how shall I say... insurance, you know, Dhurke. Dhurke: What? Inga: I've got someone dear to you right in the palm of my hand, see? Now that one, well... You can imagine what kinds of things I could do, right? Dhurke: ! ............ Inga: Heh heh. Glad you're seeing things my way. Meet me at Amara's Tomb tomorrow, 3 PM sharp. And you better come alone, got it? If all goes well, the orb is all you'll need to get Maya Fey back. Dhurke: ......... Apollo: Dh-Dhurke, what's going on? Dhurke: You heard him. I have to get back to Khura'in at once. Apollo: What?! Why?! Dhurke: No time to explain. Apollo: But are you even going to make it? What if there are no seats left on the next flight? Plus, you're a wanted man. They're not just going to let you get on a plane. ???: Let me worry about that, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Ch-Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth? What are you doing here? Edgeworth: Taking care of the hostage situation. Apollo: Oh, now that you mention it... ...Pearl did say that she saw you around in Kurain Village. Phoenix: I had him look into a few things while I was on my way back from Khura'in. ...Including Maya's situation, of course. Edgeworth: I was astonished to hear she was still in Khura'in earlier... ...but it explained why I found no connection between her and Mr. Atishon. Apollo: Sorry to interrupt, but going back to the plane situation... Edgeworth: I've taken the liberty of chartering one for us. It's ready to take off at any time. And I will do what's necessary to hide the fact that Dhurke Sahdmadhi is onboard. Apollo: ...Wow. (Must be nice to be chief prosecutor...) Edgeworth: Wright, we have no time to lose. We must head for Khura'in at once. Phoenix: ...Right. Athena: I'm going, too! After all, you're bound to need my help! Trucy: No fair! I wanna go, too! Phoenix: This isn't a vacation, Trucy. Besides, I'll need you to hold down the fort. Trucy: But Daddy! Apollo: (Guess I should also only bring what's necessary.) ...Sorry Trucy, but would you mind holding on to this stuff for me? Unnecessary evidence foisted onto Trucy. Trucy: Fine. But you'd better bring me back something besides just more evidence. Dhurke: Excellent. Now, let us make haste... to Khura'in! Apollo: And that's how our sudden trip to the Kingdom of Khura'in began. I never imagined I'd return to the country of my youth under such circumstances, though... May 18, 2:30 PMTehm'pul Temple Apollo: That was a long flight. It's already 2:30 in the afternoon. Talk about cutting it close. ........... (The Kingdom of Khura'in... This is no time to reminisce, but... ...I gotta say, this place sure brings back memories.) Phoenix: Hurry up, Apollo! Apollo: Right behind you! Dhurke: Amara's Tomb is located in the courtyard of Ga'ran Palace. We should have just enough time to get there. Athena: Then let's sprint there! Think you can keep up, Apollo? Apollo: S-Sure, no sweat! Edgeworth: I'll contact the royal family and the local police, and inform them of our arrival. Phoenix: Thanks, Edgeworth. Examine Athena: Apollo. I'm sure this place brings back memories, but could you reminisce later? Time's running out! Apollo: You're right. We have to find Ms. Fey before it's too late. Talk Any ideas? Athena: I know you probably want to reminisce and all, but there's no time for that right now! Apollo: You're right. We've got to get to Amara's Tomb with Ms. Fey is being held captive! Present Anything Athena: Apollo! Don't go showing me stuff for no reason! We have to find Ms. Fey before it's too late! May 18, 2:45 PMGa'ran Palace - Royal Residence Apollo: *huff, puff* *huff, puff* I wasn't made for all the running and climbing and near-drowning I've done this week. Phoenix: It's 2:45... Only fifteen minutes left. (Changed from [It's 2:45... Only 15 minutes left.] in the original release) Dhurke: See that cylindrical building rising in the distance? That's Amara's Tomb. Phoenix: Amara... Wasn't that the previous queen? The one who was assassinated? Dhurke: Yes. And I'm the one they pinned it on. Apollo: It will take a few minutes to get to the tomb from here. ???: So, you have returned... Barbed Head. Phoenix: Ah...! Apollo: (I've seen her before on the news. If I remember correctly, this is the crown princess Rayfa Padma Khura'in.) Rayfa: What are you people doing here? This is the Royal Residence! Commoners are not allowed entry without permission. Phoenix: A prosecutor from the States... ...should've already called and requested permission for us to enter. As to why we're here, Your Benevolence... Have you seen Minister Inga? Rayfa: If you seek my father, I just saw him heading toward Amara's Tomb. Phoenix: Was he with anyone? You know, like some shady-looking underlings or something? Rayfa: No, he was alone. Why do you ask? Apollo: (Looks like she has no idea about Ms. Fey's abduction.) Athena: You hear that? I think we have company. *stomp, stomp, stomp* Royal Guard: Bow down before her glooooooory!!! Her Eminence Queen Ga'ran, grand priestess of Khura'in approooooooooaches!!! Apollo: Huh? ...Ga'ran? Ahhh! I-It's--! Phoenix: ...Q-Queen Ga'ran! Ga'ran: ............... Guards... Surround Amara's Tomb at once! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence! Ur di'hara Ga'ran! Apollo: (What's she doing? Is she going to help us?) Phoenix: Excuse me, Your Eminence... Ga'ran: So, our \"Barbed Head\" lawyer returns. May we presume you are here for Maya Fey, the spirit medium who has been abducted? Phoenix: Y-Yes, you may! Ga'ran: Allow us to apologize for the criminal actions of our husband. Phoenix: Oh, um... no need to apologize for him! Ga'ran: Honestly, Inga... Abducting a guest in our country? How could you? Rayfa: Father... abducted someone? Phoenix: Your Eminence, what about those soldiers over there? Ga'ran: They are the Ga'ran Royal Guard, soldiers who serve the crown and no other. Apollo: Royal guard? Ga'ran: They are an elite force selected from only the most loyal and outstanding of our subjects. Apollo: And why have you ordered them to surround the tomb? Ga'ran: The police will not come if it is my husband who is committing the crime. We shall have to storm the tomb and take Minister Inga into custody ourselves! Apollo: Whaaat?! Y-You mean...? Dhurke: Ga'ran! No! His hostage is in there! Ga'ran: Dhurke! How dare you set foot in the palace! Have you come to turn yourself in?! Dhurke: Listen, we need to call a truce for now! Ga'ran: Ga'ran Royal Guard! Seize this traitor of the crown! Royal Guard: As you wiiiiiiish, Your Eminence! Resist and you diiiiiie! Apollo: W-Wait a second! Dhurke: Dhurke: Slow down there, Ga'ran. I'm here to conduct a hostage exchange. But if you take me in now, Maya Fey is as good as dead. Ga'ran: ...A hostage exchange? And why would he choose to do such a thing with you? Dhurke: We can talk about that later. Right now, I need to get in there before it's too late. If I can't resolve this in twenty minutes, you can storm the palace. Now then... if you'll excuse me... Ga'ran: Dhurke, wait! ... *sigh* Guards, allow the insurgent Dhurke Sahdmadhi to pass. Rayfa: Barbed Head, you have some explaining to do! Phoenix: Right... Well, while we're waiting here... ...Apollo, why don't you explain the situation? Apollo: Whaaat?! M-Me? Rayfa: Leave nothing out, Horn Head, or I'll dehorn you where you stand! Apollo: (Horn Head? She doesn't waste any time coming up with nicknames. And what's with the attitude? Her father is the one who abducted Ms. Fey!) Examine Amara's Tomb Apollo: (Dhurke's in there right now.) Guards Athena: The Ga'ran Royal Guard has the tomb surrounded. Apollo: Yeah, and it looks like they might storm the place at any moment. Phoenix: If Her Eminence gives the order, they'll have no choice but to follow through. And I have the feeling she's about ready to do so. Apollo: All we can do is wait and hope for the best, huh... (I hope Dhurke and Ms. Fey both come out of this in one piece.) Any other point of interest Apollo: (This is no time to be looking around. Not until Dhurke gets back.) Move Rayfa: Where do you think you are going?! Apollo: (Oh, right. We're supposed to wait for Dhurke to return.) Talk Hostage taking by Inga Rayfa: Do my ears deceive me, or did I hear talk about my father abducting someone? Apollo: Oh, um, you heard right. He abducted Maya Fey, and... Rayfa: I-Insolent fool! Apollo: P-Pardon my rudeness! Rayfa: A gentle soul such as my father could not possibly have committed such a crime! Phoenix: \"Gentle\"? You think he's gentle? Apollo: I'm afraid it's true, Your Benevolence. He's holed up in that tomb as we speak. Rayfa: Really? I find this difficult to believe. Why would he do such a thing? Inga Karkhuul Khura'in Apollo: Umm, Your Benevolence? You saw your father heading toward the tomb? Rayfa: I did. I was over on that veranda, deep in thought... ...when I saw him hurrying toward the tomb. I'd say it was about ten minutes ago. (Changed from [...when I saw him hurrying toward the tomb. I'd say it was about 10 minutes ago.] in the original release) Apollo: (Why was he rushing? Maybe he was worried he'd be late?) Did you see anyone else heading for the tomb? Rayfa: I saw no one else after he entered. Apollo: So Minister Inga and Ms. Fey are the only ones in there besides Dhurke? Phoenix: Who knows? But I wouldn't be surprised if he had a minion or two with him. Apollo: Dhurke... I sure hope he's all right. Present Anything Rayfa: Horn Head! Stop wasting time and explain what's going on here! And make it quick, or I'll yank those horns right off your head. Apollo: Nngh... How about we keep our hands to ourselves and I'll explain everything...? (Guess I'd better start talking...) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: ...It's only been five minutes? (Argh, it feels like an eternity.) Phoenix: Patience, Apollo, patience. Ga'ran: ................. May 18, 3:20 PMGa'ran Palace - Royal Residence Apollo: It's been almost twenty minutes. What's taking Dhurke so long? Ga'ran: ...The appointed time has come. Our royal guard shall now storm in. Apollo: Umm, can't you wait just a little longer? Ga'ran: No, we cannot. Every second we wait puts the hostage's life in even more danger. Therefore, we see no alternative but to order our guards to storm in. Apollo: (But that'll put Ms. Fey's life in danger, too!) Ga'ran: Guards! Storm the tomb and seize Minister Inga, along with the insurgent Dhurke Sahdmadhi! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence! Apollo: What?! Dhurke's under arrest, too? Ga'ran: Naturally. That traitorous snake assassinated my predecessor, Queen Amara. Now go! Seize them both! Royal Guard: Raaaaaaaaah! We're going in! Follow me, men! For Her Eminence! Ur dihara Ga'raaaaaaaan! Apollo: ............ (I hope no one gets hurt.) Royal Guard: Ah! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Your Eminineeeeeeeence! Apollo: What the--? Why are they running back out?! Ga'ran: What is the meaning of this? Royal Guard: S-Something terrible has happened! Dhurke...! Th-Th-The minister...! H-H-He's dead! Ga'ran: What's this?! Apollo: WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Phoenix: Apollo, quick! Apollo: I'm right behind you! Ga'ran: No one enters without our--! ...Hmph! Come, let us see what has transpired! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence! May 18Ga'ran Palace - Amara's Tomb Apollo: Wh-Where's Dhurke?! Phoenix: Apollo, over there! Apollo: .........Dhurke? Dhurke: ................ Apollo: Dhurke! Wh-Wh-What... What have you done? Dhurke: ..........Apollo? Phoenix: L-Look! Ga'ran: So it is... Minister Inga who has fallen? ...! Guards! Seize this murderous man at once! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence! Surrender or peeeeeeerish, rebel scum! Dhurke: N-No, wait! Aaaaaaaaargh! .............................. ............................................................ Apollo: Dhurke! (They're taking him away...) *thud* Apollo: Oww! (Dhurke just threw something at me.) Wait, this is the... (Is he telling me to keep it safe?) ???: ......Nick? ...Is that you? Phoenix: M-Maya! Are you all right?! Maya: Dh-Dhurke, he... he saved me. ...I feel... exhausted. I can't keep my eyes... open... Phoenix: Maya! Apollo: (Minister Inga -- the man behind Ms. Fey's abduction -- had been killed. And Dhurke was arrested for his murder. So it was that the abduction of Maya Fey came to a sudden and unexpected resolution. With this, the curtain fell on the minister, but things were far from over.) May 18Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence Athena: Apollo! What happened?! Apollo: ......I can't say for sure. But from what I can tell, it seems Dhurke has killed Minister Inga. Athena: Whaaaaaaaaaaat?! You think he did it to save Ms. Fey? Apollo: Most likely... But who knows? I'm really confused right now... Rayfa: M-My father... He's...? This cannot be! I must see for myself! Royal Guard: Your Benevolence! We cannot allow you to pass! Rayfa: Fools! Stand aside! Royal Guard: Forgive us! But we have direct orders from Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran! Rayfa: Uuuuuuuuuuuh! Father... Oh, Father...! Dhuuuuuurke! You will pay for this! Phoenix: ...Apollo, let's go regroup somewhere. Apollo: Y-Yeah... (Dhurke... It wasn't really you that did it... right?) May 18Tehm'pul Temple Apollo: ......... Athena: Are you okay, Apollo? Apollo: ...Y-Yeah. Phoenix: Edgeworth's speaking with the local police... ...so let's sit tight until he returns. Apollo: ...O-Okay. ............... Phoenix: ...I know you must be in a state of shock right now, but I need you to stay with us, Apollo. Apollo: (He's right. I can't go to pieces now!) Thanks, Mr. Wright. I'll be fine! May 18Tehm'pul Temple Edgeworth: Wright, Mr. Justice... I'm afraid I have some bad news. It looks like things will only get more complicated from here. Apollo: Prosecutor Edgeworth... What's happening with Dhurke? Edgeworth: As I understand it, he has been officially charged with the murder of Minister Inga. Apollo: H-He has? Edgeworth: However, I did manage to get us permission to investigate the crime scene. And I expect we'll be allowed to visit Mr. Sahdmadhi shortly. Apollo: ...Thank you. (I'm sure glad Prosecutor Edgeworth is here with us.) Edgeworth: Also, it just so happens that Detective Skye is here in Khura'in... ...so I have asked her to assist us with our investigation. Apollo: What?! What's she doing here? Edgeworth: It seems Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has grown quite fond of her. He's been ferrying her around all over the place. A few days here, a few days there... They've almost become a team of sorts. Apollo: (Despite what Nahyuta says... ...it seems he thinks highly of Ema's skills.) Athena: So what now, Apollo? Apollo: I think I'll go pay Dhurke a visit at the Detention Center. Phoenix: I... want to go check in on Maya at the hospital. What about you, Athena? Athena: Well... If there's footwork to be done, I'd better stick with Apollo and give him a hand. Edgeworth: Very well. Then I will accompany Wright. Apollo: Okay, we'll go our separate ways for now. Phoenix: All right. If anything comes up, you have my cell number. Athena: Do you know your way around here, Apollo? Apollo: It's been over ten years since I left... but I'll try not to get us hopelessly lost. Examine Temple Athena: Mr. Wright stayed there the entire time he was here, apparently. Apollo: Why would he stay at a temple instead of a hotel? Athena: He says it helped to cut costs. Long stays at a hotel really add up, you know. But he had to sleep on the floor with a load of strangers. There weren't any showers, either. Apollo: Wow, that's worse than staying at a youth hostel for backpackers. Spring Apollo: (This is said to be a sacred spring, and a pathway for souls to follow. The people of Khura'in believe the spring draws souls to the temple... ...and by the truth gained in the Hall of Justice beyond, they are memorialized. It seems that legal trials and funeral rites are inseparable in this country.) Background temples Apollo: (There sure are a lot of temples around here. In fact, it looks like most of the buildings around here are related to Khura'inism.) Talk Any ideas? Athena: Queen Ga'ran sure has a lot of personal attendants. Apollo: Yeah. The Ga'ran Royal Guard... They're like her own private army. Athena: More like an elite fan club made up of carefully selected soldiers who adore her. That's how I see it anyway. Apollo: That's... a pretty blunt way of putting it. What to do Athena: Dhurke Sahdmadhi -- the charismatic leader of the Defiant Dragons -- arrested. This is going to deal a major blow to the rebels. Apollo: Yeah. I can already see Datz having a heart attack when he finds out. Athena: Speaking of Datz, he was on the plane with us... ...but I haven't seen him since we landed. Apollo: Dhurke said he wanted Datz to go to him before he caused any more trouble. Athena: ...Yeah, he strikes me as a troublemaker. Apollo: ...I just hope he doesn't do anything crazy, like trying to break Dhurke out of jail. Present Attorney's Badge Athena: I thought that attorney badges were the same around the world. But I just realized this type is only used back home. Apollo: You've had your badge for a while now, and you're JUST noticing that? Athena: Hey, I'm still getting used to things after all the time I spent in Europe. But as they say, when in Rome! Apollo: Wait, what are we even talking about anymore? Founder's Orb Athena: The orb... It was a real surprise to find out that it's hollow on the inside, wasn't it? Apollo: Yeah, and an even bigger surprise to find that the founder's face was hidden within. Athena: But now that the orb's secret has been revealed... ...how are you supposed to restore it to its original state? Apollo: ...Well, it was probably wax or something that melted to reveal the figure inside, so... ...if we turned it upside down and heated it up again, it should go back to the way it was. Athena: Ohhh, I get it! That's one clever little contraption. Photo of My Father Athena: I've been thinking about that photo. Your father was quite the manly man, Apollo. Apollo: Ha ha ha. I sense a compliment in there somewhere. Athena: Huh? Where'd you get that idea? Apollo: Oh, um... N-Never mind. Athena: Never mind what? Apollo: ......... Er, nice weather we're having today. Athena: ......... Aww... Is there something you wanted to hear me say, Apollo? Apollo: L-Look! Just forget I said anything, okay?! Royal Residence Examine Inga's residence Apollo: (Somebody got a little carried away decorating this place. There's a golden lion keeping watch at the entrance.) ...That frog looks like it's cowering under the lion's glare. Athena: Really? 'Cause to me, it looks like the frog is glaring at the lion. Apollo: Come on, Athena. How does that make any sense? Athena: Huh? I just call 'em as I see 'em. Apollo: (I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.) Ga'ran's palace Apollo: The palace of Queen Ga'ran is built to impress. Its white walls and gold ornamentation lend it an imposing air. Athena: It makes Minister Inga's residence look downright humble by comparison. Apollo: Yeah. It shows the difference in their tastes... and which one wears the pants, so to speak Amara's tomb Apollo: The previous queen, Amara, was laid to rest in her own private tomb. Pretty impressive. Athena: They say it cost $800 million to build, and took 400 workers five years to complete. Special memorial rites were also conducted at various points of its construction. Apollo: That's quite an undertaking. Athena: It was built with donations from her devoted subjects and royalty of neighboring countries. It ended up giving a huge boost to the national economy. Apollo: Wow, Queen Amara must've been one charismatic lady... Rayfa's residence Athena: Ooh, look at those flowers! They give the whole house such a cute vibe! I wonder if this is where Princess Rayfa lives. Apollo: ...I doubt it. She doesn't look like the type to decorate with cute flowers. I mean, I may not know her well, but she seems awfully serious and snobby. I bet she uses nothing but roses and peonies - stuffy old people flowers, you know? Athena: ......Apollo. I guess it's too much to ask that you not judge a book by its cover, huh. Apollo: What's that supposed to mean? Footprints Apollo: Are these... Inga's footprints? They appear to be heading toward the tomb. Athena: Didn't Princess Rayfa mention something about that? You know, something about him rushing over to the tomb before we arrived? Apollo: I wonder if he had accidentally dozed off before the exchange or something. Pond or bridge Apollo: Vibrant lotus flowers floating on still waters... Butterflies dancing about... It's almost supernatural in its beauty. Athena: And at the center of it all rises the tomb where Amara's soul slumbers.  It makes you wonder if that bridge there is a getaway to the hereafter. Apollo: Yeah... Especially after both Dhurke and Inga crossed that bridge earlier. Urns Apollo: This overturned urn has spilled water everywhere. Everything around it is soaking wet. Athena: D-Don't look at me! Apollo: (Rightly or wrongly, I'm guessing Athena's the type who gets blamed for a lot of things. And the more people accuse her, the more defensive she becomes. Even to the point of preemptively denying any wrongdoing.) Athena: I said, it wasn't me! Apollo: I never said it was. Amara's Tomb Examine Athena: Apollo, I know you can't help but want to start investigating, but... Apollo: I know. We should pay Dhurke a visit over at the Detention Center. May 18Detention Center - Visitor's Room Dhurke: Apollo! Here to see your old man, are you? Apollo: Dhurke. Are they done interrogating you? Dhurke: Nope, the fun hasn't even started. I imagine they'll really take me over the coals though. Athena: I don't even want to think about how harsh their interrogation method will be. Apollo: ...Yeah, but that's nothing compared to what they'll do if they find him guilty. Dhurke: They've branded me a terrorist who killed the previous queen, and now the justice minister. If found guilty of these crimes, I'll be facing a very public execution. Apollo: P-Public execution...?! (This is worse than I thought!) Dhurke: Come on, son. Turn that frown upside down! You'll jinx us. As soon as I get out of here, I'll take you to this tasty hash house I know. Apollo: .........I'd like that. (I really need to find out what happened. Time to switch to work mode.) Dhurke, can you tell me what happened? ...Oh, and there's also something I want you to take a look at. Examine Bell Athena: .................. Apollo: ...Don't do it, Athena. Don't ring that bell. Athena: Ack! Wh-Who, me...?! Perish the thought. I mean, would I ever do something so childish? Apollo: .................. Athena: All right, all right! Put your bracelet away already. Talk about unfair! Guard Apollo: That guard's standing so still, and with such great posture... I wonder if he spends his days just watching the dust dance in the sunlight. Wait a second. Don't you do that in court sometimes, Athena? Athena: Eep! You mean you noticed? Apollo: Don't think you can take it easy just because I'm the lead lawyer on this one. Talk The incident Apollo: Dhurke, what happened in there? You didn't really kill Minister Inga, did you? Dhurke: Well, the thing is... ...I really don't know. Apollo: Huh? Dhurke: I remember seeing the mural of the founder right as I entered the tomb... ...but I got all dizzy immediately after that. The next thing I knew, I was standing there with a bloody knife in my hand... ...and covered in Inga's blood. Apollo: So you don't remember meeting with him? Dhurke: No. The last thing I remember after entering the tomb is feeling really dizzy. Athena: There's no way he can explain what happened if he can't remember anything. Apollo: Y-Yeah... Dhurke: .........Hmm. I suppose there's no getting out of this one. Apollo: But we can't give up yet! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! I was just messing with you, son. Apollo: Well, stop. It's not funny. Dhurke: S-Sorry. Apollo: (Sheesh. Nothing seems to faze him. Not even being arrested for murder.) Dhurke: This is going to be one tough case, Apollo. Not only have I been charged with Inga's murder... ...but I've also been charged with Amara's assassination from twenty-three years ago. Apollo: You're on trial for two charges? Dhurke: Ga'ran is practically licking her chops just thinking about my public execution. Guess it means we can't afford to lose our heads, huh. Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: I... I don't know how you can laugh at a time like this. Dhurke: ...So, son, I take it you'll be defending me at my trial? Apollo: ...Of course. You can count on me. Dhurke: That's my boy! Looks like your nerves are as steely as those vocal chords of yours! After all, you've got the Defense Culpability Ace to contend with, too. Apollo: ...Oh, right... So if you're found guilty... ...then I'll be charged with the same double homicide, huh. Dhurke: Don't tell me you forgot about that...! Apollo: I'll-- I'll be fine. I-I just have to make sure we win this one. Dhurke: You sure? Because you don't sound very fine. Athena: ...Um, Apollo? What was that about an assassination twenty-three years ago? 23 years ago (appears after \"The incident\") Apollo: About that incident twenty-three years ago... That was when the previous queen, Amara, was assassinated, wasn't it? Dhurke: Yes. Someone set her private residence on fire. She lost her life in the ensuing blaze. Apollo: And you were arrested for the crime? Athena: Why would they arrest you, Mr. Sahdmadhi? Weren't you just a lawyer back then? What relation could you have had with the queen? Dhurke: Um, about that... Amara was... well... she was my wife. I may not look the part, but I was once husband to a queen. In short, I was royalty. Athena: What? No waaaaaay! Are you saying you won the heart of the reigning queen? Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! C'mon, you're talking to a guy who hones his prowess against witnesses on the stand. Even a queen is no match for this dragon's glare! Athena: W-Wow, you're really something else. Apollo: So was a verdict ever reached, Dhurke? Dhurke: I acted as my own attorney and won. ...Until I was accused of fabricating evidence, that is. Then it all went south. Apollo: (...Now where have I heard a story like that before?) Athena: What happened after that? Dhurke: I, uh... I made a run for it. Athena: You ran?! But why? Dhurke: I didn't kill Amara, and I didn't fabricate any evidence. But if I had stuck around for a retrial, I'd have been found guilty for sure. I couldn't allow that to happen; Amara's true killer would never face justice if I did. So I left my law practice behind and went underground. Apollo: But that was twenty-three years ago. ...Are you telling me that after all these years... ...you still haven't discovered the truth? Dhurke: Yeah... The fact that it was arson means that the crime scene was reduced to ashes. There is little in the way of evidence left. It's just been brick wall after brick wall. Apollo: (I guess that means it's all up to me to figure it out, huh. Along with Minister Inga's murder, of course. ...I think I'm going to be sick.) Dhurke: Come on, son. Don't look so down. With you on the case, it'll work out somehow. Apollo: (I hope he's right.) Dhurke: Say, son, do you remember my office? Apollo: ...Sure. (I remember that messy, dimly lit room.) Dhurke: The file I've amassed on Amara's assassination is kept there. I think it might help you on this case. Do you remember how to get there? Apollo: (Let me think... I recall going in through a manhole...) How can I not, Dhurke. I hated how I always got so dirty getting there. And that stench... (That old case is important, too, but I should probably focus on the minister's murder first.) Present Attorney's Badge Dhurke: I'm proud of you, son. You've really become a fine lawyer. Apollo: Well, at least it means I'm qualified to defend you. Dhurke: ...To think the day would come where you'd come to my defense. I'm one lucky man. Now I can die in peace. Apollo: Whoa, slow down! I'm going to prove you innocent, so...! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Just pulling your leg, son! Apollo: (...Even when he's in the slammer, Dhurke is Dhurke.) Founder's Orb Dhurke: I see you got it safely out of the tomb! Apollo: Why did you throw it at me like that? Dhurke: I want you to listen carefully, son. The orb must not fall into Ga'ran's hands... Not ever. Apollo: I thought Minister Inga was the one who was after it. He was the one who lent it to Professor Buff to study, after all. So haven't you exposed his crime now? Dhurke: I have, but... ...there's more connected to this relic than meets the eye... Much more. And whatever it is, I can't help feeling that it could turn this entire kingdom upside down. Apollo: You said something like that before. (Looks like Dhurke's intuition is at it again.) Dhurke: Ga'ran will do anything to retrieve this... ...so guard it well, son -- at least until tomorrow's trial. Photo of My Father Dhurke: That's the only remaining photo of your father. Take good care of it. Apollo: I will. ...I'm just surprised to see it after all these years. Dhurke: I had a tough time tracking it down and retrieving it. It was taken by some European tourists who just happened to be watching your father. I had one of my men go to Europe to look them up and ask whether we could have it. Apollo: Y-You went through all that trouble? Dhurke: ...I did. So don't go losing it or anything. Apollo: I said I'd take good care of it, didn't I? After clearing \"23 years ago\" Talk option and presenting Founder's Orb: ???: I'm afraid your time is up. Apollo: ! N-Nahyuta. Nahyuta: It's time for the prisoner's interrogation. So begone, you putrid-headed, criminal-abetting lawyer. Apollo: Wait! Don't tell me... you're the prosecuting attorney? Athena: What?! But that would mean... Nahyuta: ...Is there a problem here? Apollo: You bet there is. He's your father! Nahyuta: ...And your point is...? My relation to the accused is irrelevant. The fact remains, I am a prosecutor. Apollo: N-No, that's not what I... (I don't think I'm getting through to him.) Dhurke: .........Nahyuta. Long time no see, son. How've you been? Nahyuta: ......... Dhurke: Look... I hear you've been serving Ga'ran -- rather faithfully, in fact. Whatever happened to our dream of taking her down and changing this country, son? Nahyuta: .........The past is the past. Dhurke: What do you mean? Why are you doing this? Nahyuta: .........It's simple. People change. The Nahyuta you knew exists no more. Dhurke: Listen, son, I don't know what made you change like this... ...but you're still my boy, even if you prosecute my case. The rest of the Defiant Dragons and I eagerly await your return. Whenever you're ready, we'll welcome you back with open arms. Nahyuta: ........Ngh! .........As I said, I've moved on. Now, let us waste no more time; for flowers do not blossom simply from talk of the past. Apollo: ......... (Nahyuta... Why do I get the feeling there's something he wants to say, but can't?) Nahyuta: ...Guard, move the accused to the interrogation room. Guard: Yes, sir! This way, you rebel scum! Dhurke: Ow! Watch it! Not so rough, will you! Apollo: (...Nahyuta. Is he seriously going to prosecute his own father?) May 18Ga'ran Palace - Amara's Tomb Apollo: So, this is the tomb of Amara, the previous queen of Khura'in. It's really lavish. I guess you could say it's fit for a queen. Athena: Is the faceless woman in that mural over there Amara? Apollo: No, that's the Holy Mother. She's the one who brought spirit channeling to Khura'in. Athena: Oh, right. The woman in the orb. ???: Oh, it's you two. Getting right down to business, I see. Apollo: Hi, Ema. We heard you'd give us a hand if we needed it. Ema: Yep. Mr. Edgeworth asked me to help where I could. So, it's been quite a while since you've been back in Khura'in, I hear. Apollo: Yeah, more than ten years, in fact. Ema: Well, you sure didn't waste any time. I mean, you're already mixed up in a murder. You're as big a trouble magnet as Mr. Wright. Apollo: P-Please don't say that. My luck's already bad enough as it is. Athena: Ema, I hear Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has requested your services again. He seems to have really taken a liking to you. Ema: You mean His Ephemeral Holiness? MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. I don't mind that he approves of me and my abilities. It's just, his people skills need some serious work. But when he manages a smile and compliments my work, it's hard to say no. Plus, working on investigations overseas is a priceless experience. But flying back and forth between here and home every few days with no days off... That's been tough, and the lack of sleep has been brutal on my skin. To make matters worse, the defendant in this case is someone I know. I mean, how could this get any worse?! MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. Apollo: (Sounds like they've got one complicated prosecutor-detective relationship going on.) Examine Apollo: (We better get Ema's okay before we start snooping around.) Talk The incident Apollo: Ema, have you determined the cause of death? Ema: Blood loss from a stab wound. A single stab in the back was enough to cause the victim to bleed to death. The estimated time of death is 3 PM, which is when Dhurke came onto the scene. Inga's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Apollo: Any suspects besides Dhurke? Ema: No. He, Maya, and the minister were the only ones here. And Maya had been tied up until she was freed by the queen's royal guard. Apollo: Could someone have been hiding somewhere in here? Ema: Not likely. I was told this tomb was searched from top to bottom right after the murder. And during that time, the royal guard set up a perimeter to prevent anyone from escaping. Athena: In other words, the crime scene was completely sealed off? Ema: It would appear so. Apollo: Hmm... No way for a third party to escape without being spotted, so... (Great. It's another one of those convoluted locked-room mysteries.) The incident (subsequent times) Apollo: Ema, have you determined the cause of death? Ema: Blood loss from a stab wound. A single stab in the back was enough to cause the victim to bleed to death. The estimated time of death is 3 PM, which is when Dhurke came onto the scene. Apollo: Any suspects besides Dhurke? Ema: No. He, Maya, and the minister were the only ones here. And Maya had been tied up until she was freed by the queen's royal guard. Apollo: Could someone have been hiding somewhere in here? Ema: Not likely. I was told this tomb was searched from top to bottom right after the murder. And during that time, the royal guard set up a perimeter to prevent anyone from escaping. Athena: In other words, the crime scene was completely sealed off? Ema: It would appear so. Apollo: Hmm... No way for a third party to escape without being spotted, so... (Great. It's another one of those convoluted locked-room mysteries.) The victim Apollo: About the victim, Minister Inga... He was the kingdom's Minister of Justice, correct? Ema: Yes. Inga Karkhuul Khura'in was the second most powerful figure in Khura'in. Plus, he was married to the queen. Apollo: Seems strange that someone of his status would abduct someone. Ema: Apparently, he only told a few of his most loyal subordinates about his plan. That way, there was little chance of the police or even the queen finding out. Apollo: What was Inga hoping to gain by getting his hands on the orb? Ema: That I don't know. But I'm working on it. Apollo: (...I wonder if it really was for what Paul Atishon-Wimperson said...?) Atishon: I must deliver it to my benefactor at all costs. Phoenix: What do they want that relic for anyway? Atishon: Heh heh heh. It's something to do with an old legend. My patron seeks the great power said to be granted to whoever solves its secret. Apollo: (A great power that is said to be bestowed on whoever solves the orb's secret. In Khura'in, only those who can channel spirits are said to be fit to rule. Was that why Inga wanted such power? Did he want to be king?) Amara's tomb Apollo: So this is the tomb of the previous queen? Ema: Yes, Queen Amara was laid to rest here. She lost her life in an arsonist's blaze. What a tragic end. I heard this tomb sits on the actual site of her residence before it was burned down. They built it on the same spot so her soul could rest in peace. Apollo: (So this is where the fire happened, huh.) Athena: Why do you think Minister Inga was holding Ms. Fey captive here? Ema: It's the perfect spot, if you think about it. It's close to his private quarters, which made it easy to keep an eye on his prisoner. And the courtyard is only open to the royal family, so he had little fear of prying eyes. Plus, the tomb is normally locked, and only the royal family is allowed access. Athena: So that's why he picked this place. Apollo: How long had Ms. Fey been held captive? Ema: About six days. Apollo: Really?! That long?! Ema: It appears that she was severely weakened by her prolonged confinement. She passed out as soon as she was freed, and is now on an IV drip at the hospital. She's been asleep ever since. Athena: Poor Ms. Fey. I hope she gets better soon. Present Attorney's Badge Ema: Your attorney's badge? Huh... Apollo: What, that normally gets a better reaction from you. Ema: I'm tired of collecting your fingerprints. It's kind of lost its luster. Apollo: Yeah, but who knows? There could be other people's prints on it. Ema: Ooh, that's true! Hand it over, buddy! Apollo: Ah! Ema: ............Hmph. The only prints I found were yours. Apollo: (Argh, it's all dusty now.) Anything else Ema: Oh, you must need my forensic expertise! Just leave it to me! Apollo: Oh, um... Actually, I was wondering if you see anything strange about this. Ema: ...Oh. .................................... Apollo: (Why isn't she saying anything?) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: Ema, do you mind if we start looking around? Ema: Sure, I've already got the okay. Knock yourselves out. Oh, and here. It's a diagram the police drew of the tomb. I thought I'd give you a copy to help your investigation along. Apollo: Thank you. Tomb Diagram added to the Court Record. Ema: Oh, and let me know if you need my forensic expertise. Don't you dare keep all the fun to yourselves, you hear?! Apollo: You don't need to worry about that. (Besides, I'd hardly classify this as \"fun\".) Examine Front of Amara's sarcophagus Apollo: So this is Amara's sarcophagus. Let's take a closer look. Sarcophagus curtains Athena: Hey, these curtains open, Apollo. Sarcophagus keyhole Apollo: ...That's one big sarcophagus. Ema: They say the mummy of Amara, the former queen, rests inside. Apollo: A mummy, huh? ...Rats, it's locked. Ema: Hey, don't touch that! Apollo: You mean we can't search inside it? Ema: Not a chance. Besides, it's not something anyone'd try opening, anyway. Apollo: What if the real killer's hiding inside? Athena: Hey! Anyone in there? Ema: D-Don't do that! You're going to get us cursed! Athena: C-C-Cursed? Ema: The queen likely bears a grudge toward the living after such a violent, painful death. So no one dares touch the sarcophagus for fear of incurring her wrath. Athena: .........Oh no, Apollo. What am I going to do? Apollo: Don't look at me. Ema: ...In any case, the sarcophagus is temperature controlled. It's kept really cold to preserve the mummy. So even if someone did decide to hide inside it, they would eventually freeze to death. Apollo: I see... (Still, if they bundled up, I bet a person could hide in there for a little while.) Sides of Amara's sarcophagus Apollo: The sarcophagus is surrounded by a curtain. I bet someone could've hidden behind it. Ema: True, but that's one of the many places the royal guard checked after storming in. Athena: Wow, they were really thorough. Ema: Yes, well, apparently, one of their members loves mystery novels. He peered into every nook and cranny with an almost frightening amount of gusto. And when he was done, he said: \"Very interesting. It's like one of those locked-room mysteries.\" Apollo: Sounds like he's in the wrong line of work. Bloodstain on Amara's sarcophagus Athena: Wow, it's covered in blood. Apollo: With a blood spatter this large, it must've gotten all over the killer, too. Come to think of it... There was blood on Dhurke's clothes. Athena: The circumstantial evidence points to Dhurke being the killer. Apollo: That's what I'd conclude if I were a cop, too. (Why are things always so bleak for me...?) Holy Mother mural Apollo: It looks like the Holy Mother was painted here to watch over Amara's sarcophagus. Athena: So it's like, this tomb is protected by the founder? That must be so reassuring to those she left behind. Apollo: Only one problem: they didn't paint the eyes she needs to do said watching. Athena: Come to think of it, she doesn't have a mouth to smile down on the tomb with, either. It's actually kind of creepy. I wonder if being watched over by something like that gives the queen nightmares. Apollo: ...Hey, hey. Keep that up, and the founder just might come and \"watch over\" you, too. Broken statue (while facing Holy Mother painting) Apollo: Look, one of the statues is broken. Athena: Yeah, but it's kind of hard to see from here. Apollo: Let's check it out when we get a little closer. Front of broken statue Apollo: One of the statues is broken. Let's take a closer look. Broken statue Apollo: This thing's more splinter than statue now. Ema: The bullet from the victim's gun did a real number on it. Athena: It seems like something you'd get cursed for, you know? Apollo: In Minister Inga's case, I'd say getting your ticket punched is curse enough. Athena: Yeah, but don't curses extend to the afterlife? Apollo: You need to stop taking what Nahyuta says so seriously. Athena: I-I'm perfectly capable of thinking for myself! Brown magatamas Apollo: It's a magatama... I think. Did it come from the broken statue? Athena: Look, Apollo, there's another one. But the other statues only have one each. Apollo: Hey, you're right. Maybe this statue was special or something. Bullet Apollo: Look, there's a bullet here. Ema: It's from the pistol the victim was carrying. My guess is he tried to shoot his attacker, but missed, and the bullet ended up here. We've already determined the rifling marks to be a match to his gun. Athena: Rifling marks? Aren't those...? Ema: Oh ho! Shall I explain? The science behind it is absolutely fascinating. Apollo: No, no, we're good. Ema: Hmph, lawyers... Think they're so smart. Apollo: You do realize we can hear you. Sparkling object Apollo: Hm? There's something shiny down there. It's a pendant... Athena: There's blood on it. I wonder who it belongs to. Ema: All we know is it's not the victims. No one in the royal family recognized it. Apollo: ...Ema, did you lift any fingerprints from it? Ema: I did, but... ...I wasn't able to get a clean one. Apollo: That's too bad. Ema: But the blood turned out to be the victim's. Apollo: That means it must have fallen here in the course of the murder. (It might be Dhurke's. I should ask him about it later.) Pink Butterfly Pendant added to the Court Record. Body outline Apollo: Guess this is where Inga collapsed when he died. Better take a closer look. Body outline Apollo: They've already taken the body away. It's kind of sad how familiar I've become with body outlines. Ema: I have a photo of the body if you're interested. He was stabbed right in the back; the poor guy was practically skewered. Athena: What's he wearing on his arms? Ema: Those are the Cuffs of Justice. Seems to be a tradition here for the Minister of Justice to wear those forearm cuffs. Apollo: They look like they're made of a thick fabric, so I guess they aren't for protection. Athena: Maybe they're for keeping his sleeves out of the way when handling documents. Apollo: Yeah, that's probably their original purpose. But over the years, the reason for wearing them was probably forgotten. So now, they're just one of many traditional things that people do without knowing why. Athena: ...Oh, I get it. Kind of like the way you roll up your sleeves, huh? Apollo: ...Or your psychology, if we're going there. Athena: I happen to know why I started, thank you very much! Tomb Crime Photo added to the Court Record. Body outline (subsequent times) Apollo: These white lines indicate where the minister's body fell. Athena: Hey, didn't Ema give us a photo of the crime scene before they took the body away? Apollo: Looks like he was stabbed in the back. Athena: Those things on his arms... They're called the \"Cuffs of Justice,\" right? Apollo: Yeah, they're supposedly a traditional part of the minister's outfit. Knife Apollo: So, this is the murder weapon. Ema, did you find any prints on it? Ema: Yep, and they were super clear. They belong to one Dhurke Sahdmadhi. Apollo: That's not good. Were there any others? Ema: There was one more print from another individual... ...but it was too smudged to identify. It's probably an old print from someone else who had handled the knife. Apollo: Oh... (Yet another piece of unhelpful info to add to our ever-growing pile... *sigh*) Knife (subsequent times) Apollo: The murder weapon... Athena: Apparently, Dhurke's prints were found on it. Apollo: That's not very helpful, is it. Cell phone Apollo: I wonder if this is Inga's cell phone. Ema: It should be. His fingerprints are all over it. Apollo: Do you know if he talked with anyone recently? Ema: There were a few calls logged between him and his underlings. They're all members of the secret police, who were directly under the minister's control. Athena: You mean like spies? Apollo: I don't think that's quite it. Pistol Apollo: So the minister was armed, huh. Ema: Mm-hm. That's a four-shot pistol. He had it for self-defense, apparently. But it won't be firing anything any time soon. Apollo: Huh? Athena: He was carrying a broken gun around for show? Ema: No, we recovered a bullet here. Which means the gun probably broke as the minister fired its last round. Thing is... the gun's chambers are all empty. Yet, that one bullet is the only bullet we could find. Apollo: That is strange. Where did the other three go? Athena: ...Maybe Dhurke ate them. Apollo: We can ask the next time we see him. Just be ready for his predictably \"shocking\" answer. Pistol (subsequent times) Apollo: Inga's pistol... He used to carry it for self-defense. Athena: Apparently, he fired all four rounds. Apollo: Yeah, but only one slug was recovered in this tomb. Rows of statues Apollo: It's like a small army of monks, all neatly lined up. It looks like they're facing the sarcophagus in prayer. Athena: If you look carefully, each one has a slightly different expression. Apollo: I wonder if they used real people as models. Athena: Some are frowning, some are smiling... Hm? There's one that looks like he's trying his hardest not to burst out laughing. Apollo: ...Really? Hmm, I wonder why. Athena: Maybe it's like those times when things are so intense, you can't help but laugh. You know, like at funerals and stuff. Apollo: They went through all the trouble of depicting that? Talk about going overboard... Right incense burner Apollo: It's full of ash. My guess would be this is an incense burner. Athena: Hey, look, Apollo. There's something in the ashes. Apollo: ...Let's see what it is. Ash Apollo: It's full of ash. They must burn incense in here. Athena: So, I was wondering, Apollo... Did the ash come from the incense sticks that were burned in this? Or do people put their incense in after there was already she in here to hold them up? Apollo: Don't be silly, Athena. The answer's simple. The ash is the product of prayers from countless visitors who came here. It's not a chicken-or-the-egg kind of thing. Apollo: Oh, that's an interesting take on it. It's so much more poetic than mine! Gemstone Apollo: Is that... a gemstone? Wonder what it's doing here. Athena: Heh heh heh, I've got this one covered, Apollo. Would you like to hear my brilliant theory? Apollo: Well, I guess it wouldn't do any harm. Athena: You know how people make wishes by throwing coins into a fountain, right? Well-- Apollo: You know, on second thought, I'm good. Athena: Whaaat?! Y-You sure you don't need to hear my theory? I was just about to get to the good part! Apollo: Let's just ask Ema. That'll be much quicker. Excuse me, Ema? What's this gemstone doing here? Ema: Oh, that... It's not a gem, it's a button -- albeit a very expensive one -- from the victim's jacket. Must've fallen off and gotten in there somehow. Apollo: See? Every puzzle has an answer, Athena. Athena: Well, I thought my idea was pretty good... Wait... What's with this soot? See here, on the gemstone. Apollo: ...Hey, you're right. Gemstone added to the Court Record. Right incense burner (after examining gemstone) Apollo: It's full of ash. My guess would be this is an incense burner. Grape juice Apollo: This is the grape juice Inga was drinking. He was probably nervous before his meeting with Dhurke. Athena: So he drank grape juice? I'm not seeing the logic here. Apollo: Mr. Wright told me all about it when he was hospitalized a few years ago. He said grape juice has something in it that helps you relax. Athena: Really? ...Um, are you sure he was talking about regular, plain old grape juice? Because it sounds like he was talking about the fermented variety. Apollo: No, he couldn't have meant that. I mean, we're talking about a medical facility. They wouldn't have allowed something like that in. Athena: R-Right... Let's just leave it at that. Side paintings (while facing Holy Mother mural) Apollo: There's a painting up there, but I can't see it very well from here. Paintings right of Holy Mother mural Apollo: A baby on a lotus blossom? That's one strange painting. Ema: Apparently, that's part of a mural depicting the life and times of Queen Amara. You know, like a storyboard or something. Apollo: So that baby's supposed to be Amara? Athena: This one depicts Amara preaching to the faithful. Apollo: It's hard to put into words, but I've never seen anything like it. Let's see, the next one is... I-Is that... Dhurke? Why does he have horns? Athena: My best guess is... ...it depicts the first time Amara and Dhurke met. Apollo: So he's supposed to be some kind of demon who's seducing her? Athena: Well, he WAS successful since they got married after that. Apollo: ...The mural continues on the opposite wall. Paintings left of Holy Mother mural Athena Is this supposed to be Amara channeling a spirit? Apollo: It looks like the spirit of some country's sultan or something. And she seems to be conveying something to his retainers. Athena: ...Sh-She's on fire. Apollo: This must be Amara's assassination as allegedly carried out by Dhurke. They really made him look evil. Athena: ...This is the weirdest one of all. Apollo: Is that supposed to be Dhurke facing his punishment in the afterlife? Anyway... Hm? I guess that's the last one. Athena: I guess we're supposed to see this as a happy ending. Apollo: Yeah, except nobody came out of this story happy. Chair Apollo: Ms. Fey was apparently tied to this chair. Let's take a closer look. We should try to cover every angle possible here. Let's use [left analog stick / WASD] to change our perspective and take a careful look around. (Changed from [Slide the Touch Screen...] in the original release) * (Line [...or use the Circle Pad ([Circle Pad]) to look around carefully in this area.] removed in the Trilogy release) Seat, rails, or legs of chair Apollo: (...Poor Ms. Fey. She must've been tied up to this chair.) Athena: I can just imagine how much her backside must've hurt after sitting here for so long. Apollo: It would've been torture for you, I bet. I mean, you don't know how to sit still. Athena: If by that you mean I like to stay active, then I have to agree with you. Rope Athena: I bet you didn't know, but I happen to be a bit of an escape artist myself. Trucy showed me how to do her rope escape trick. Apollo: Uh-huh. And why would you bother learning something like that? Athena: Because we're always getting into trouble when working cases with Mr. Wright. So I thought it might come in handy someday. Apollo: Well, I guess you're right about that. Ms. Fey could've definitely used that knowledge. Athena: That's right! So now, you just sit right here and we'll get started. Apollo: What in the world gave you the idea I wanted to learn?! Bloodstain on chair leg Apollo: Look, there's a bloodstain on one of the chair legs. Ema: Really?! Hey, you're right. I completely missed that. Apollo: Let's move the chair so we can check under it. ...There's more blood under the chair leg. Ema: Hmm... I wonder what it's doing there. I have some luminol here. Why don't you do some testing around it? Spray floor near rope Leads to: \"Look!\" Apollo: Look! The bloodstain leads all the way to the sarcophagus! Athena: Ema, is this Minister Inga's blood? Ema: Hold on one second... .........Huh? That's strange. I didn't get a match. Apollo: So then... whose blood is it? Dhurke and Ms. Fey weren't wounded as far as we know. Athena: And the blood's been wiped up by someone for some reason. Apollo: Yeah, that's strange, too. Mysterious Bloodstain added to the Court Record. Bloodstain on floor (after examining bloodstain on chair leg) Apollo: There's a bloodstain on the floor. Athena: It's already been mostly wiped up, but the stain leads all the way to the sarcophagus. Apollo: I wonder whose blood it is. Wall curtains Apollo: Someone could have hid behind these curtains. Athena: Here, I'll go give it a try! Well, can you tell I'm hiding here? Apollo: No, I can't tell at all. That's it! That's the perfect hiding place! Athena: We did it, Apollo! We solved the case! Ema: Sorry to burst your bubble, but... ...the royal guard searched the tomb high and low right after they stormed in. And they said no one else was in here besides Minister Inga, Dhurke, and Ms. Fey. Apollo: ...Well. Back to the drawing board, I guess. Athena: My brilliant deduction -- destroyed in three sentences. After examining sarcophagus keyhole, sides of Amara's sarcophagus, bloodstain on Amara's sarcophagus, Holy Mother mural, broken statue (zoomed in), brown magatamas, sparkling object, body outline (zoomed in), knife, cell phone, pistol, gemstone, bloodstain on chair leg, and wall curtains: Apollo: I think we've covered just about everything. Maybe we should go over what we've learned so far. Athena: Umm... For starters, we're dealing with a locked-room murder. But instead of the tomb being locked, it was being cordoned off by the royal guard. And after the murder, no one was found to be hiding inside. Apollo: Right. In addition... ...we also know that Dhurke's fingerprints are all over the murder weapon. Athena: The curtain around the sarcophagus was drenched in the victim's blood on one side. The blood must've also gotten on the killer when they stabbed the minister from behind. Apollo: Dhurke had blood on him when the crime was first discovered. Unfortunately, he doesn't remember what happened. .................. Athena: ............ Apollo: (This is not good.) Athena: So, what we know so far is... ...things couldn't be worse for our case. And that's still and understatement somehow. Apollo: Yeah, it's looking pretty grim. Ema: Oh, uh! If you two are done here, I'll have to ask you to leave. Go on, scoot! Apollo: Something wrong, Ema? Why are you trying to give us the boot? Ema: ...It's just easier if you're not here when His Ephemeral Holiness arrives. ...Ah! Apollo: (Speak of the devil.) Ema: P-Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... Nahyuta: Detective Skye... It seems you've spoken at length with these two lawyers. I do hope you've also kept an eye on them. Ema: Y-Yes, of course! Like a hawk! They didn't touch a single thing! Ha, a-ha ha ha! Nahyuta: ...Give a lawyer an inch, and they'll take a mile. Never forget that. Apollo: (There's that look of distrust again.) ...Hey, Nahyuta. Do you really believe that Dhurke's guilty? Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: And are you seriously going to prosecute this case? I mean, he's your father. You were once part of the Defiant Dragons, weren't you? Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: Hey! Nahyuta! Wait! I said wait! Come on, Athena, after him! Athena: Huh? ...Oh, uh, right behind you! May 18Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence Apollo: Nahyuta, would you stop already?! Nahyuta: .........What do you want? Apollo: It's about Dhurke. Would you please hear me out? Nahyuta: ...I fail to see why I should. Now, if you'll excuse me... Apollo: Apollo: Nahyuta! ...Are you afraid of what I might have to say? If not, there's no harm in listening, right? Nahyuta: .........Very well. Speak. But make it quick. There is much I must do. Apollo: (Why does everything have to be so difficult with you?) Talk Prosecuting Dhurke Apollo: So, I know you'll be prosecuting Dhurke's case, but... ...aren't there any other prosecutors in this country? Why does it have to be you? Nahyuta: ...Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran, personally requested that I serve as prosecutor. Apollo: Sh-She did? That WOULD make it hard to say no. Nahyuta: Her Eminence thinks highly of my prosecutorial skills. Apollo: Still, she didn't have to ask you to handle a case against your own father. Be honest. You really don't want to do this, do you? Nahyuta: ...Ahh. You speak of love and sentiment. Apollo: Er, I guess so. Nahyuta: I do not deny such human emotions. But... the law is the law. And placing personal feelings above it is beyond reprieve. ...Do you disagree? Apollo: W-Well... No, I don't disagree, but... Nahyuta: Civilizations only exist due to the confines of the law. Without them, love and sentiment would lack the fertile they need to flourish. Do you disagree? Apollo: No, but... Nahyuta: The law must be obeyed. This truth sits above all else, including personal feelings. Therefore, whether or not I am the son of the accused is of no consequence. It is that simple, or would you say otherwise? Apollo: Nnnngh... B-But... Athena: Come on, Apollo! Tell him how wrong he is! Apollo: B...But don't you... you know... wish it wasn't that way...? Nahyuta: ............... Athena: ......... Nahyuta: It appears I've wasted my breath on you. Athena: And the winner is... Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! Nahyuta: ...Hmph. Still spewing empty words devoid of meaning or consequence, I see... ...you putrid red pepper. Apollo: Argh! ........ (I know I'm right... But did he have to be so eloquent about his point? It's like he's trying to cover something up with his pretty words.) Athena: Apollo, I'd cut back on the debates with him if I were you. Just stick to questions, like the one you wanted to ask. Who Dhurke cares about (appears after \"Prosecuting Dhurke\") Leads to: \"Nahyuta, I wanted to ask you about that hostage situation.\" Present Attorney's Badge Nahyuta: Why is that badge before me? Apollo: Remember how we used to talk about what we wanted to be back when we were kids? I wanted to be a lawyer, and you, a prosecutor. You said you wanted to prosecute bad guys to make sure they got punished. Nahyuta: Yes, passing judgment upon evil... That is my calling. And it is why I have taken this case. Apollo: Are you saying Dhurke is evil? Nahyuta: He who goes against what is righteous and holy... ...I shall reap his soul with all my power, whoever he may be, for that is my role. Apollo: (Then I'll just have to defend his soul with all MY power, Nahyuta.) Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Nahyuta: Alas... Another soul has departed this world, and must now be guided to the Twilight Realm. Apollo: You would even hold last rites for a kidnapper like Minister Inga? Nahyuta: Criminals, too, must be given funerary rites. Deny that, and their soul will turn malevolent, bringing woe upon the living. That is why all who pass on must receive a proper requiem. Apollo: Makes sense. I mean, if I were murdered, I'd probably be pretty keen on revenge, too. Anything else Nahyuta: The putrid-minded lawyer seeks information from me? Apollo: Come on, throw me a bone here. Nahyuta: I think not. Apollo: Well, aren't we stingy? Apollo: Nahyuta, I wanted to ask you about that hostage situation. Inga said he had someone dear to Dhurke in the palm of his hand. And he was using that person, along with his hostage, as leverage in obtaining the orb. Nahyuta: ...! That's news to me. Apollo: Well, that's what Inga said. Dhurke: You can kiss your chances of getting the orb goodbye. Inga: ...Heh heh heh. Maya Fey ain't my only... how shall I say... insurance, you know, Dhurke. Dhurke: What? Inga: I've got someone dear to you right in the palm of my hand, see? Now that one, well... You can imagine what kinds of things I could do, right? Dhurke: What? Inga: I've got someone dear to you right in the palm of my hand, see? Now that one, well... You can imagine what kinds of things I could do, right? Dhurke: ! ............ Inga: Heh heh. Glad you're seeing things my way. Apollo: I got the impression Dhurke had no choice but to follow Inga's demands after he heard that. So who do you suppose this special person is? Nahyuta: .........I wouldn't know. BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: ! (My bracelet's reacting!) Hey, Nahyuta, about what you just said-- Nahyuta: Apollo: Ack! Ow-ow-ouch! M-My bracelet is crushing my wrist! Youch! That really hurts! Wh-What the heck's going on?! Nahyuta: ...I'm wise to your tricks, you putrid pepper. That bracelet reacts to the anxieties around you by squeezing your wrist. But now that I know how it works, I can make it tighten around your wrist any time I wish. Consider this a warning. Apollo: Argh... (I don't know how he did it, but this renders my bracelet useless.) Nahyuta: Such devilry is powerless in the face of the Holy Mother's blessings. Athena: Looks like your special power won't work against Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, Apollo. We'll have to try something else. Apollo: Argh, you're right. We'll just have to ask Dhurke about this. Nahyuta: .........It appears... Apollo: ? Nahyuta: ...You intend to go through with a trial you have no hope of winning. Grow up, Mr. Justice. We are no longer children, you and I. Apollo: I'm not the one who needs to grow up, Nahyuta. In case you didn't hear, I won my last case against none other than Mr. Wright. Nahyuta: ! Athena: You tell him, Apollo! Nahyuta: ............... Apollo: (Is he mad? I can never tell with him.) Nahyuta: ...This trial is different. Your foolishness will only earn you a death sentence for aiding and abetting a criminal. And those who die as criminals... ...are doomed to be reborn in the next life as something lower than a bug or vegetable. You would be lucky to return to this realm as a patch of mold. Apollo: M-Mold? That's pretty harsh. Nahyuta: If you wish to avert such a fate, abandon this folly before it is too late. Apollo: ...I don't care if I end up as a dollop of blue cheese dressing in my next life! I'm going to defend Dhurke in court! Nahyuta: .........You fool. Know this... I intend to prosecute the accused with all my might -- no matter what you say or do. Consider yourself forewarned. ...Now, if you will excuse me. Athena: Prosecutor Sahdmadhi knows his father will be publicly executed if he's found guilty. Yet he won't show even an ounce of mercy. Apollo: ............... (...Nahyuta. Is this the real you? Have you really changed? Do you really plan on sending Dhurke to his death? Do you even hear me? Don't Dhurke and I matter to you anymore?) To be continued May 18Tem'phul Temple Phoenix: (Maya passed out right after we found her in the tomb.) Maya: ...I feel... exhausted. I can't keep my eyes... open... Phoenix: (She's been out cold ever since. We haven't been able to get a word out of her. The doctor says it's just exhaustion, but I can't help but worry...) Edgeworth: What is it, Wright? Are you all right? Phoenix: ...Yeah. Just thinking is all. I'm glad you're here, Edgeworth. We wouldn't have gotten the permissions we have without you. Edgeworth: ...Well, I didn't come all the way to Khura'in to be useless. Speaking of the investigation, I received a few things from Detective Skye. These should prove to be useful to us as well. Inga's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Tomb Diagram added to the Court Record. Tomb Crime Photo added to the Court Record. Phoenix: I can't thank you enough, Edgeworth. (Honestly, I'd have been so lost without him these past few days.) ???: You there! The \"Barbed Head\" lawyer, Phoenix Wriiiiiight! Phoenix: Huh? .........You're... from the Ga'ran Royal Guard, right...? Royal Guard: I am Lah'kee, royal guard member and Her Eminence's shoooooulder rubber!!! Phoenix: That's... very specific... And what does the royal shoulder rubber want with me? Wait, come to think of it, my shoulders ARE a bit stiff-- Royal Guard: Don't be absuuurd!!! I am here for one purpose ooonly!!! I am to bring you before Her Eminence... ...Queen Ga'ran, grand priestess of Khura'in!! Will you complyyy?!!! Phoenix: The queen? What could she want with me? (And why does he have to shout like that?) Edgeworth: Hmm... I can't fathom why Queen Ga'ran would summon you... ...but I advise you to accept Her Eminence's gracious invitation. .........Royal shoulder rubber Lahkee, was it? May I join Mr. Wright in his audience with the queen? Royal Guard: The name's Lah'kee! L-A-H apostrophe K-E-E!!! And...! All praise the omnipotent Queen Ga'raaan!!! For she has already foreseen and approved your request, Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth!!! You are both to come with meeeee!!! Edgeworth: You mean to say that Queen Ga'ran sees our every move? Royal Guard: Yes indeeeed! Her Eminence's spiritual power is immeeeeeeense!!! She can even see what's going on thoooousands of miiiiiiiiles away!!! Edgeworth: .........Wright. I fear I'll lose my hearing next if we don't hurry. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Me, too... Why would the queen herself summon me personally? What could she possibly be up to? Examine Temple Phoenix: There weren't any hotels available, so this is our home for tonight. It's a bed to sleep in and a roof over our heads. Phoenix: Sorry to disappoint, but... there aren't any beds here. We'll have to sleep on the floor next to a bunch of strangers. Edgeworth: Wh-What? ...Tell me there's a shower at the very least. Phoenix: The kitchen sink works just fine, I hear. Edgeworth: Of all the-- Wright, you will work to bring this case to a swift resolution. The sooner the better. Edgeworth: .........I suppose it will do. Spring Phoenix: The water's so clear, it's like a window into the soul. Edgeworth: I wouldn't stare too hard into it, Wright. Or you may find all your bluffs staring right back at you. Phoenix: No pool-gazing in front of a client. Got it. Temples in background Edgeworth: There appears to be many temples in this area. Phoenix: Yeah, there are always a lot of monks and worshippers praying around here. And then there's tourists like us. Edgeworth: It's unfortunate that we have more pressing matters to attend to. Then again, sightseeing with you of all people isn't exactly at the top of my list. Phoenix: (As if you have the luxury to be so picky, Edgeworth.) Talk Any Ideas? Edgeworth: So you'd been here all this time. I wondered where you had gone. Phoenix: ...Don't tell me you missed me, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: As if. The courts have been so peaceful without you around. Phoenix: You make it sound like I leave legal devastation in my wake. Edgeworth: Heh... Well, don't you? What to do Edgeworth: Well, Wright, what do you intend to do now? Phoenix: I was thinking... I want to help Apollo win this case. So why don't we try to gather whatever information we can? Edgeworth: You're quite the considerate boss. Phoenix: Well, I kinda forced him to take care of the office in my absence, so... ...it's the least I can do. Present Attorney's Badge or Tomb Diagram Edgeworth: Still at it, I see. I guess borders mean little in the face of your incurable habit. Phoenix: Well, I heard you used to present evidence left and right during your investigations, too. Edgeworth: That was a long time ago. ...Besides, who did you hear that from? Phoenix: Oh, I have my sources. Edgeworth: Oh? Well, tell your \"source\" that I look forward to his next salary review. Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Edgeworth: It's ironic that the man tasked with upholding the law should end up breaking it. Phoenix: Well, it's not like we don't have our fair share of that back home. Edgeworth: Hmph, that is a thing of the past. The worst offenders have already been removed. Phoenix: Now that you mention it, wasn't Gaspen Payne expelled from the prosecutor's office? Edgeworth: Yes, he was a particularly troublesome individual. I was shocked to see him resurface here in Khura'in, and with considerable sway, no less. I just hope he doesn't end up making a mess of things here as well. Royal Residence Examine Ga'ran Palace Phoenix: Ga'ran Palace, the heart of the kingdom's government and religion. Edgeworth: Yes, the two are inseparably intertwined here in Khura'in. The religious beliefs of its people touch every aspect of their lives, including legal affairs. Phoenix: Right. Like how they commune with spirits in court. I suppose Khura'inism is the glue that binds their faith, law, and politics together. It may seem strange to foreigners like us, but for them, it's perfectly natural. Landscape Phoenix: What a beautiful place this is. But I'd be enjoying this a whole lot more if we weren't investigating a murder. Edgeworth: Commoners aren't normally allowed access to the royal residence, you know. Under ordinary circumstances, it would be impossible to take in such a spectacular view. Though murder is certainly a unique reason to be offered such a rare opportunity. Rayfa's residence Phoenix: This place is decorated with all sorts of colorful flowers. And that view from the veranda looks like it would be amazing. If I had to guess, I'd say Rayfa must live here. Amara's Tomb Phoenix: Amara's Tomb -- the scene of Inga's murder. Poor Maya was held captive in there. Edgeworth: To think she was actually being held here in Khura'in. If only we had found out sooner. Phoenix: ...No point dwelling on that now. All we can do is to keep moving forward. Edgeworth: Yes, of course. Footprints Edgeworth: There are footprints coming from this residence. Phoenix: Too bad they just kinda end. I wonder who made them and where they went. Urns Phoenix: This overturned urn spilled its water all over the place. It was already knocked over when we got here earlier this afternoon, so... ...we can rule out Athena at least. Edgeworth: .........Wright. What does it say about you if your first suspect is your own subordinate? Inga's residence Phoenix: ...What a gaudy building. Looks like something you'd appreciate, Edgworth. Edgeworth: ...For the record, Wright, I have absolutely no interest in such ostentatious things. Phoenix: (Says the man who rides around in a red sports car, wearing that frilly cravat thing.) Amara's Tomb Examine Anywhere Phoenix: Apollo and Athena are already working this area. Edgeworth and I should try someplace else. Detention Center Examine Bell Edgeworth: This bell must be for summoning the guard. Phoenix: I bet one of your detectives would come running if you rang it. Edgeworth: Let's find out, shall we? Phoenix: Th-They're not seriously going to show up, are they? Guard Phoenix: Oh, the guard's asleep. And here I thought he was stoically doing his duty. Impressive. May 18Ga'ran Palace - Audience Chamber Ga'ran: Ah, the \"Barbed Head\" lawyer has arrived. We bid you welcome. And you, as well, Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth. Phoenix: Th-Thank you. (This place is still as magnificent as last time.) Ga'ran: We have heard much about you, Barbed One. It seems your bluffs and tomfoolery tend to leave our court devastated in their wake. Phoenix: Uh... Is that what people have been saying about me? Edgworth: ...Wright! Where are your manners?! Your Eminence. I am both humbled and delighted to be in your presence. Phoenix: Oh, umm... Your Eminence... Um, glad to be here. Looks like you're doing well. Ga'ran: ...Heh. It is all right. There is no need to keep your head bowed all day. Edgeworth: Yes, Your Eminence. Rayfa: ............ Phoenix: (Rayfa's not looking too good. I guess even she can't just bounce back from her father's murder...) ...So what can I do for you, Your Eminence? Ga'ran: We wish to question you about something related to the case at hand. Phoenix: (Perfect. Because I have a few questions of my own.) Examine Throne Phoenix: That's one swanky throne. I wouldn't mind taking a seat there myself. Edgeworth: The jester and the crown. I imagine it'd make quite the interesting picture. Phoenix: You know Edgeworth... I hate to say this, but you're absolutely right. Guards Phoenix: It's the Ga'ran Royal Guard. The one who came for us earlier said that he's the royal shoulder rubber. ...Um, excuse me. But are each of you charged with your own specific task? Royal Guard: I'm the royal teeeeeaaaa server! Royal Guard: I'm the royal taaaaaaster! Royal Guard: I'm the royal bed maaaaaaaker! Royal Guard: I'm the royal fitness traaaaiiiiine-- Phoenix: All right, all right... I'm sorry I asked. Edgeworth: At this rate, one has to wonder if there is no task left unassigned by Her Eminence. Talk Inga's crime Ga'ran: We fear we do not fully comprehend what has transpired. So it is that we summoned you here to further elucidate the situation. Is it true that our husband Inga had been seeking the Founder's Orb? Phoenix: That's right. He wanted to trade a hostage for it. That's why he abducted Maya Fey. Rayfa: Insolent fool! *ka-tonk!* Phoenix: Oww! Rayfa: That is a lie! A lie, I say! Father would have never done such a thing! Phoenix: B-But he did abduct Maya. That much is-- Rayfa: I will not stand here and listen to this nonsense! You will pay for this, you... you...! *ka-tonk!* *ka-tonk!* *ka-tonk!* Phoenix: Ow-Ow-Oww! P-Please, Your Benevolence! Ga'ran: That is quite enough, Rayfa. We understand your feelings, but we fear he speaks the truth. For we believe we know why your father would do such a thing. Rayfa: Huh? Ga'ran: We believe he was seeking the orb as a means of obtaining spiritual power. And with it, he intended to usurp the throne. Rayfa: .........M-Mother... Phoenix: What do you mean, Your Eminence? Ga'ran: Inga was planning a coup, for he was dissatisfied with the current administration... ...and his secret police was the primary instrument of his treason. Phoenix: The secret police... They came up during the high priest's murder trial, too. An elite force under the direct command of the Minister of Justice -- in this case, Inga. The man who was hunting down rebels as Lady Kee'ra was a member of that group. Ga'ran: Indeed. Inga turned that once proud force into his own private army. And he intended on using them to launch a coup and assassinate us. Edgeworth: So Your Eminence had no control over them? Ga'ran: As much as it shames us to admit it, Khura'in is not the unified realm it would appear to be. We are truly sorry you have had to witness the dirty underbelly of our kingdom. Rayfa: H...How could Father...? Ga'ran: But know that Inga could not have become king simply through our assassination. For in Khura'in, only those who possess spiritual power may sit on the throne. Edgeworth: I see... That explains why Minister Inga was seeking the Founder's Orb. Ga'ran: Barbed One, do you recall the man known as Pees'lubn Andistan'dhin? Phoenix: ...What about him? Ga'ran: He, too, was involved in Inga's machinations. Inga had bought his loyalty, ordered the man to steal the orb, and covered up the theft. Phoenix: And then, he sent the orb to the U.S. for Dr. Buff to study... It's all coming together... Dhurke the criminal Ga'ran: The capture of the infamous villain Dhurke Sahdmadhi... It may prove to be the crowning achievement of our reign. Now, perhaps, the kingdom may return to the peace it once knew. Oh, what a joyous day. Royal Guard: Hail to Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran, Grand Priestess of Khura'in! Her Eminence's spiritual power invoked a blessing straight from the Holy Mother! Phoenix: (I could see how her cronies would be elated at the prospect. But the queen herself seems almost giddy for someone whose husband was just murdered.) Rayfa: Father... Phoenix: (Rayfa, on the other hand, doesn't appear to be taking it so well.) About that incident that occurred twenty-three years ago... The one in which Dhurke was accused of assassinating Queen Amara. Ga'ran: Yes, he set fire to her private residence, burning my dear sister alive. Phoenix: Murder by arson... Ga'ran: ONly a demon would be capable of such a heinous crime. Phoenix: (But that event also set the stage for you to become queen...) What did you do before you were crowned queen, Your Eminence? Ga'ran: As part of our training to be queen, we served in many different governmental positions. The longest of which was as the previous Minister of Justice. It was in that position that we were best able to support our elder sister, Queen Amara. Phoenix: (Interesting... That's her husband's position, or at least it was.) And when you ascended to the throne, you passed the Defense Culpability Act. Defense Culpability Act (appears after \"Dhurke the criminal\") Phoenix: \"...those who would support criminals will be deemed just as guilty.\" What prompted you to pass something like the Defense Culpability Act, Your Eminence? Ga'ran: ...The assassination of our dear sister Amara. When the infamous villain Dhurke Sahdmadhi was apprehended... ...he announced that he would act as his own lawyer. Phoenix: (That's right... Dhurke used to be a lawyer.) Ga'ran: Dhurke had been an extraordinarily talented lawyer, and highly esteemed by the people. But he falsified evidence in an attempt to win his own case. Phoenix: I see... Ga'ran: But when the truth of his fabrications and the assassination of the queen came to light... ...the people were devastated. And trust in the legal system plummeted. Edgeworth: .........Now why does that sound so familiar? Phoenix: Yeah, I wonder, aha-hah-hah... Ga'ran: In Khura'in, the Hall of Justice is a sacred space where victims receive their last rites. Should the people lose their faith in it, the kingdom would be shaken to its very core. That is why the Defense Culpability Act had to be passed. It was the only way to keep our legal system from tumbling into the abyss. Phoenix: So that's how you sought to eliminate the use of perjury and phony evidence, huh. But that law is what made lawyers go extinct in your kingdom. Now there's no one left to defend those who have been accused. Ga'ran: .........We see how you could take issue with such a reality. However, we have not banned the act of lawyering itself. Those who are confident that they can prove their client's innocence... ...are always welcome to mount a vigorous defense, as you yourself have shown. Phoenix: W-Well, I guess so, but... Without lawyers, there's the possibility of false charges being filed and prosecuted. Ga'ran: So long as our prosecutors continue to run nothing but perfect trials... ...there needn't be fear of such nefarious dealings. Do you disagree? Phoenix: (Perfect prosecutors and their perfect trials, huh...) Edgeworth: Let's not get started down THIS path... Ga'ran: Furthermore, here in Khura'in, we have the Divination Séance. And so it is we no longer need lawyers, for the dead do not lie. Phoenix: Well, in the short time I've been here, I've beaten back false charges twice. And I've found that cases built on the memories of the dead are less than perfect. So yes, I do take issue with the Defense Culpability Act, to say the least. Ga'ran: ...Ho ho ho. Such relentless rhetoric. Your reputation precedes you, Barbed One. It feels as if we ourselves were being cross-examined. Phoenix: O-Oh, no, that wasn't my intention. Ga'ran: ...It is true that some feel that the Defense Culpability Act is a necessary evil at best. But it is a small sacrifice upon which the peace of our kingdom has been forged. Phoenix: (If you consider executing innocent lawyers a small sacrifice, then sure.) Ga'ran: The fact is that following its passage... ...the crime rate here in Khura'in dropped markedly. Therefore, we have no regrets concerning the enactment of the Defense Culpability Act. Phoenix: (Really? None at all?) Edgeworth: Wright, why don't we leave it at that? This isn't a court of law, after all. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Present Anything Phoenix: Um, please take a look at this... Ga'ran: ...That reminds us of when Dhurke was still practicing law. So, we see that lawyers in your country also present evidence... ...simply to gauge the other party's reaction when all else has failed. Do not presume to use such simplistic methods upon us. Phoenix: S-Sorry. After clearing all Talk options: Ga'ran: About the Founder's Orb that was to be exchanged for the hostage... It went missing after the murder. Would you happen to know anything about that? Phoenix: It's missing? I'm sure Dhurke had it when he went into the tomb. If it wasn't there, I have no idea where it could be, Your Eminence. Ga'ran: ...In that case, then perhaps Dhurke has hidden it somewhere. ...Incidentally... there is the matter of that horned youth you were with. Phoenix: Oh, you must mean Apollo. Ga'ran: From his odd hairstyle, may we assume him to be a relative? Perhaps, your younger brother? Phoenix: N-No, no! You've got it all wrong. He's Dhurke's son. Well, more like foster son -- they're not actually related by blood. Ga'ran: Dhurke's...? .........Royal guard! Royal Guard: Your Eminence! Phoenix: Hm? (What's she whispering in that one guy's ear?) Ga'ran: .........Thank you for your time. The two of you may go now. Edgeworth: Yes, Your Eminence. We'll be on our way. Phoenix: (Okay, now what? Apollo and Athena have the murder scene investigation covered, so... ...maybe we should go speak with the locals over at the bazaar.) May 18Khura'in - Bazaar RAWWWRRR! Edgeworth: Wh-What... Was that a lion? Phoenix: Oh, that? Caught me by surprise, too, when I first heard it. It's the cry of a local bird known as a warbaa'd. Edgeworth: A bird? That sounds like that? Warbaa'd: RAWWWRRR! Edgeworth: Sounds more like a beast than a bird, if you ask me. Phoenix: It's a form of mimicry. You know, to help protect them against predators and stuff. Edgeworth: Yes, well... Can't say I've heard one quite like that before. Phoenix: Oh, it's more than unusual -- it's endangered. It's extremely rare to encounter one in the wild these days. Edgeworth: ...If it's so rare, then what's one doing out here in the middle of the bazaar? Phoenix: You got me. Maybe it's got something to do with it being their national bird. *BANG* Phoenix: Aaahh! (Was that a gunshot?!) ???: Har har har har har! Startle ya, PW? Phoenix: Wh-What was that, Datz?! Datz: The Defiant Dragons' newest weapon. I call these puppies... Dragon Snot Snaps! Phoenix: Uh, huh... And you need those... why? Datz: Because our hard work is starting to pay off! Thanks to our TV signal hijacking and stuff, more and more people are joining our cause. But on account o' that, the regime's been cracking down on us real tough-like. Phoenix: Yeah, there's been a lot going on lately. Datz: You can say that again. I mean, what with the high priest's fake-murder-slash-suicide. People are calling it the \"DCA Tragedy,\" and it's causing a real public uproar. Phoenix: (Hopefully this means Tahrust's death won't be in vain after all.) ...So how exactly is a handful of firecrackers going to be of help to you guys anyway? Datz: Simple. First, I supply 'em to our fellow rebels. Then we use 'em as a diversion when we need to shake Ga'ran's goons. Phoenix: Huh? Datz: Like this! *BANG!* Phoenix: Whoa! W-Will you cut that out?! I'm not with the regime, and I'm not chasing you! Datz: Har har har har har har! Haaaar har har har har! Your reaction! That was priceless, PW! Warbaa'd: RAWWWRRR! Datz: Har har har har har har! Guess I startled that warbaa'd, too! Phoenix: (It's a miracle no one's trying to arrest him while he's too busy laughing.) ???: You there. Datz: ! Rayfa: You are one of those insurgents, are you not? Datz: Yikes! ...Take that! *BANG!* Rayfa: Eek! Phoenix: Aaand he's gone. Those firecrackers are more useful than I thought. Rayfa: Barbed Head! Phoenix: Your Benevolence. What can I do for you? Rayfa: I... I wanted to speak with you. .........About what my mother said... I do not believe a word of it. My father could not have been planning a coup. Phoenix: Well, I can understand why you'd feel like that, but... Rayfa: It was a setup! Someone must have been plotting against him. Phoenix: Um, and how do you know that? Rayfa: I just do. Because the Holy Mother guides me. And as the royal priestess, I must uncover the truth for all to see. Phoenix: (Hmm... Maybe this is just how Rayfa expresses her sense of duty.) Rayfa: You're investigating this matter, are you not? Then rejoice, for I shall accompany you, and bestow upon you the royal priestess's wisdom. Phoenix: Ha, a-ha ha. That's the best news I've heard all day, Your Benevolence. (No one would dare get in our way with Rayfa by our side.) We humbly accept your offer, don't we, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: As you wish, Wright. Rayfa: Excellent. Then let us begin with my father's private quarters. We should be able to find some clues there. I shall expose this false charge for what it is, if it is the last thing I do! Phoenix: (Could it be? Is the reason she's so defensive about Inga because she's a daddy's girl?) Rayfa: Barbed Head! Let us not waste any time! My father's private quarters are located within the royal residence. Now, follow me! Phoenix: Wait! She's sure in a hurry. Edgeworth: Wright, the minister's private quarters may hold evidence related to his murder as well. Phoenix: Yeah, maybe we can kill two birds with one stone. (Rayfa's awfully fired up. I just hope she'll be ready for the truth we find. After all, it's hard to believe that Inga was not in full control of the whole affair.) Examine Any point of interest Edgeworth: I never thought the day would come when we'd be investigating a case side by side. Phoenix: Oh? 'Cause I never thought the day would come when you'd get sentimental on me. Edgeworth: Nghrk! Come on, Wright! Time's a wasting! Phoenix: Wait, exactly which one of us was wasting time here? May 18Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence Phoenix: Now, if we could figure out which of these buildings houses Inga's private quarters... That's where we'll find Rayfa. Examine Inga's residence Phoenix: Now that's what I call an extravagant exterior. Is this where Inga's private quarters are? Edgeworth: Watch your step, Wright. That urn's been knocked over, spilling water everywhere. Phoenix: Yeah, the ground's soaked. I wonder who did this? ???: .........*sob* Phoenix: Hm? ...I think someone's in there. ???: *sob* Father... *sniffle* Phoenix: Is that... Princess Rayfa? Rayfa: There were still so many things I wished to tell you... Phoenix: (...She always puts on such a brave face. But hearing her crying all alone... I... I can't help but think of Trucy.) Rayfa: *sob* Father... ............... Phoenix: ...Um, Princess Rayfa? Are you in there? Rayfa: Ah! J-Just a moment! I'll be right out! .........I see you are finally here. Well, let us commence our investigation, shall we? Phoenix: ...Um, Your Benevolence? Maybe you should rest for a minute first. Rayfa: ...! You were eavesdropping on me! Weren't you?! Phoenix: Um, no! I mean, yes... Sorry. I couldn't help overhearing... Rayfa: .........Grrrr. Phoenix: I-It wasn't like I was spying on you or anything! Rayfa: ...You stupid... stupid... Barbed Head! *ka-tonk!* Phoenix: Yeowch! Edgeworth: ...You could've feigned ignorance. It's as if your brain-to-mouth filter shuts off the moment you step out of the courtroom. Phoenix: Ugh... I'm not THAT bad, Edgeworth. Rayfa: ...Anyway, what took you so long? I thought you would never get here. You have a lot of nerve, keeping the crown princess waiting. Phoenix: Oh, um... sorry? Rayfa: This was my father's residence. I have already unlocked it, so you can go right in. Oh, and... Be careful. Some dingbat dog in the courtyard and spilled water over there. Phoenix: A dingbat dog? Rayfa: That's right. The yappy mutt spilled a whole urn's worth. Phoenix: I wonder how it got into this area. Do you know what it looked like? Rayfa: Hmph. I have better things to do than to memorize what some stray dog looks like. Anyway, it is not worth talking about. Let's search my father's room, shall we? Phoenix: (...I really hope she's all right.) Inga's residence (subsequent times) Edgeworth: The Minister of Justice used to live here. Phoenix: Yeah, the decor looks like something he'd choose. After examining Inga's residence in Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence: May 18Ga'ran Palace - Inga's Private Quarters Phoenix: (What a mess. You can definitely tell a guy used to live in this room. I guess Inga and I had at least that much in common.) Rayfa: ...Bah, this staff keeps getting in the way. Nayna! .................. ...Oh. Phoenix: (Huh? Where's Nayna? Normally... ...she comes running whenever Rayfa calls.) Rayfa: ...That's right. Nayna is... Phoenix: (Nayna is... what?) Rayfa: Oh, well. You, Barbed Head! Come, hold this staff for me. Phoenix: Wh-Why me? Rayfa: Just take it! It's too heavy, and I am tired of holding it! Phoenix: (*sigh* How does Nayna put up with this day in and day out?) Um... I'll just set it over here for now. Examine Shoeprints Phoenix: There are some muddy shoeprints here. (Come to think of it... There was some spilled water by the entrance. Somebody must've stepped in it before coming in here.) Edgeworth: They're already dry. That means they're at least several hours old. Rayfa: Then someone must have been in here today in the early afternoon... ...for our servants clean this room each day. Here in Khura'in we have a saying: \"Leave not today's untidiness to the morrow.\" Phoenix: (Mine is: \"Why clean up today what you can leave for tomorrow?\") Hair dye bottle Phoenix: What's this? ...\"Je suis L'Belle!\"? Never thought I'd see THIS brand again... Edgeworth: It appears to be a sample of some sort of spray-on hair color. Phoenix: \"Color: Jet Black\"... I wonder if Inga was going grey. Here, Edgeworth. Maybe you can use it. Edgeworth: I like my natural hair color just fine, thank you very much! Desk Phoenix: His desk is crammed full of documents! Edgeworth: Hmm... They appear to be paperwork for executions. Phoenix: B-But for this many cases?! Edgeworth: Indeed. Something is rotten in the Kingdom of Khura'in. Hm? This one dates back to five years ago. Phoenix: Something tells me he simply kept putting them off because he hated doing paperwork. Bed Phoenix: That's one luxurious and comfy-looking bed. I've slept on nothing but hard floors since coming to Khura'in. Can't wait to sleep in a nice, soft bed again. Rayfa: Then take it. It's yours, if you wish. ......We'll have to clean this room out, anyway, now that my father's gone. Phoenix: But don't you want to keep these things as a memento of your father? Besides... I don't need his spirit haunting me late at night. Rayfa: .........Do you suppose if I slept on it, I could see my father once more? Phoenix: P-Princess Rayfa... (I honestly don't know how to answer that...) Bust Phoenix: Wow... That's one gaudy sculpture. Rayfa: My father sculpted it himself from a block of solid gold. Phoenix: (Why does it not surprise me that he was also a narcissist?) Ha ha ha. It's pretty detailed. He even included that personal stamp of his. Hey, the stamp's a little loose. Ah! Edgeworth: Look. There's a secret safe inside! Rayfa: Oh, my! To think such a thing was here all this time! Phoenix: Rats. Looks like we'll need the combination to get in. Bust (subsequent times) Edgeworth: To have a secret safe in his own bedroom... It seems the minister was a rather cagey man. Phoenix: Let's take a look inside. Who knows what we might find. Safe (after examining bust) Phoenix: We can't open this without the combination, but I doubt Princess Rayfa would know it... Edgeworth: Well, if we can't open it, we can't open it. For now, let's continue our investigation, and come back to this dilemma later. Syringe Phoenix: It's a syringe and a vial... Rayfa: Those were for my father's back pain. He said it really helped when the pain was particularly unbearable. Phoenix: It was that bad, huh. Edgeworth: He must've been injecting some sort of painkiller directly into his back, then. Rayfa: Yes, my father said his back pain could knock him off his feet. Phoenix: I know the feeling. I've experienced some pretty severe back pain of my own... Rayfa: Well, we can't have you throwing your back out in court, so why don't you take a vial? Phoenix: Oh, uh, no thanks. I hear your body builds up a tolerance to that sort of thing. Painkiller Shots ninja'd into pocket. Rayfa: I thought you didn't want them. Phoenix: (I'm going straight to a chiropractor as soon as I get home.) Syringe (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's a syringe and a vial... Rayfa: Those were for my father's back pain. He said it really helped when the pain was particularly unbearable. Phoenix: It was that bad, huh. Edgeworth: He must've been injecting some sort of painkiller directly into his back, then. Rayfa: Yes, my father said his back pain could knock him off his feet. Phoenix: I know the feeling. I've experienced some pretty severe back pain of my own... Backrest of chair Phoenix: This chair looks like it was modeled after Inga's suit jacket. Edgeworth: Hmm... The backrest even has those fancy buttons of his. I imagine they make the chair awfully uncomfortable to sit on. Rayfa: Actually, they served to massage the pressure points on his back. My father suffered from terrible back pain, you see. Phoenix: ...I wonder if it really works. Notepad Phoenix: This notepad must've belonged to Inga. Let's see... That's strange. Edgeworth: These appear to be notes detailing people's most prominent characteristics. Phoenix: Hey, there's even some stuff about me in here. Why would he bother doing this? Rayfa: Hmm... I am afraid even I can't answer that. Phoenix: (Whatever the reason, it's giving me a case of the heebie-jeebies.) Edgeworth: Hmm... It's as though he was taking down descriptions of people over the phone... That's what it reminds me of, anyway. Rayfa: What a brilliant deduction! One fitting of a chief prosecutor such as yourself. I commend you. Edgeworth: ...Heh, that's high praise coming from you, Your Benevolence. Phoenix: (Edgeworth's right. They do look like dictation notes, but... I don't know... I mean, why bother describing Nayna, who he must've seen every day?) Inga's Notepad added to the Court Record. Notepad (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's the notepad with those descriptions of various people in it. I wonder what Inga was using it for. Move Rayfa: Barbed Head. First you make me wait, and now you're simply going to leave?! Phoenix: (Guess I should stay put for a while.) Talk The kidnapping Rayfa: Barbed Head... I, the Royal Priestess of Khura'in, shall share my thoughts on the abduction. Phoenix: You will? Rayfa: ......Listen carefully, for such opportunities do not come often. Phoenix: Y-Yes, of course. We'd be grateful to hear anything you'd like to share. Rayfa: ...My father was very likely seeking to obtain the Founder's Orb. But it was not for the purposes of a coup d'état. It was all... for my sake! Phoenix: For your sake? Rayfa: The Founder's Orb is capable of bestowing great spiritual power. My father truly believed that. And he wanted that power to be mine. I haven't finished my training, and I still can't channel spirits! He was doing it for me! Phoenix: ......Right, I see. Rayfa: Well? Do you understand why he did it now? Phoenix: ............I do, but... ...it doesn't change the fact that Minister Inga was a kidnapper. Rayfa: Ah! Phoenix: But I guess you don't believe he is, do you? Rayfa: Ooooooh! New information is sure to surface upon further investigation. S-Suffice to say, he did this all for me. End of story! Phoenix: (Was he really trying to obtain the orb for Rayfa? Somehow, I doubt it. Speaking of powers... ...I wonder if Rayfa will be performing the Divination Séance tomorrow. I should probably ask her about that. Nayna Phoenix: Your Benevolence, I noticed Nayna isn't with you today. Rayfa: .........I know not where she has gone. I have not spoken with her since this morning. I assume she must be quite busy today. I did catch a glimpse of her a little after two o'clock. I tried calling out to her... ...but she went off somewhere again. Phoenix: A little after two? That's about an hour before the murder. Rayfa: ...Indeed. Of all the times for this to happen... She normally comes to me the moment I call her name. Phoenix: (I know it's hard to believe, but even nannies have lives, you know...) Edgeworth: Your inability to find her after the murder is slightly alarming. I wonder if her absence is related to today's incidents somehow. Rayfa: Do you think she was unwittingly caught up in them? Phoenix: Who knows... At the very least I don't think she was at the scene of the crime. Rayfa: Nayna... I hope she is all right. Phoenix: (Rayfa seems really worried for Nayna.) Tomorrow's Séance (appears after \"The kidnapping\") Phoenix: I take it you'll be conducting tomorrow's Divination Séance? Rayfa: Who else, if not I? Phoenix: Good point. (The thing is... ...Divination Séances are all about what victims experienced in their final moments. So, tomorrow... ...Rayfa will experience her own father's death, exactly as it happened. That's more than anyone should ever have to deal with.) ...Do you really have to go through with the Séance tomorrow? There's really no one else? What about just calling the whole thing off? Rayfa: ............It's not as if... ...It's not as if I'm doing this because I want to. Phoenix: No? Rayfa: Ah! N-Never mind. I misspoke! The Divination Séance is a very important duty of the royal priestess. And it is one I intend to fulfill. Phoenix: (There's that word: duty.) Maya: ...Your Benevolence. As crown princess, you are destined to rule this kingdom one day. That means there will be many things that you alone must determine. Things like how to keep your people happy, and what is true and what is false... And most importantly, what role you must play therein. Rayfa: .................. I wonder if I am even up to the task. Phoenix: (Performing the Divination Séance IS very important for a priestess... ...but duty or not, it's a heavy burden for someone so young. Even worse, she'll be forced to watch her father's murder. Will it be a weight too heavy for her to bear?) Nayna and Rayfa (appears after \"Nayna\") Phoenix: Your Benevolence, has Nayna served you long? Rayfa: Yes, she has been at my beck and call for as long as I can remember. I have heard she even cared for me as an infant, right down to changing my diapers. Phoenix: Your diapers? It almost sounds like she could be your mother. Rayfa: Indeed. But that is a simple fact of life when your mother is busy being queen. Nayna takes care of my every need. She is my teacher in all things, as well. Phoenix: (Rayfa's pool of knowledge seems rather lopsided in some respects. Could that be the result of Nayna's teachings?) Rayfa: Nayna... Could it be that my trusted attendant has come to dislike me? Now that I think about it, perhaps I've been acting rather spoiled as of late. Phoenix: Oh, I'm sure she'll be back. Rayfa: ...Yes, I suppose Nayna would never truly abandon me. Upon her return, I will do something nice for her. Perhaps she'd like a shoulder massage. Phoenix: (And yet, I can't shake the feeling that Nayna's connected to this case in some way.) Present Attorney's Badge Rayfa: Remove that vile badge from my sight! If you insist on tormenting me, I will take matters into my own hands! Phoenix: Hey, don't bite it! Rayfa: ............ Hmm, it's much harder than I thought. Phoenix: ...What did you think it's made of? Tomb Crime Photo Rayfa: ...! ............ Phoenix: Um, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: .........Father. Phoenix: Whoops, s-sorry! Didn't mean to hurt you like that. Rayfa: Hmph! Do not underestimate me! I am the royal priestess, and as such I will experience my father's death tomorrow. So hand it over! A photo of a corpse... will not... phase... Phoenix: Your Benevolence! Edgeworth: Wright, you fool! Put that picture away! Rayfa: ...Nngh. There is no need to worry. I simply lost my footing, that's all. Phoenix: (Now I'm REALLY worried about tomorrow.) Painkiller Shots Rayfa: My father's back used to cause him considerable pain. I would give him massages from time to time. He seemed to truly enjoy them. Phoenix: Hmm, I didn't peg you as the dutiful daughter type. Rayfa: But never again... will I... Phoenix: Your Benevolence... Um... I could stand in for your father if you'd like-- Rayfa: ............Rrgh! *WHAM* Phoenix: Youch! M-My back! I think you broke something! Rayfa: Hmph. That's what I call the royal treatment. Inga's Notepad Rayfa: These are notes my father took on the characteristics of those around him. I wonder what he wrote about me. Phoenix: Let's see... Pink raiment... Tattoos on face... Ch-Childishly cute?! Rayfa: Huh?! Phoenix: That last one's rather subjective, isn't it... Anything else Phoenix: Your Benevolence, I wanted to ask you about this. Rayfa: Nayna! Nayna! Where are you?! Phoenix: Um, I thought you said she wasn't around... Rayfa: ...Oh, yes, of course......... Well, you're sadly mistaken if you think questioning Nayna will clear things up. Phoenix: (But I'm trying to question you, not Nayna.) After clearing all Talk options and examining shoeprints, hair dye bottle, bust, syringe, and notepad: Phoenix: I'm really beginning to wonder what's inside that safe. Any idea what the combination might be, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: None whatsoever. Phoenix: (It looks like a four-digit combo lock, so maybe it's a date. But it's probably not anything that would be easy to guess.) Well, let's try some dates and see what happens. I wonder what date Inga would use as a combination? Date the DC Act was enacted Phoenix: How about the date the Defense Culpability Act was enacted? Do you know when that was, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: Nayna! Nayna! Edgeworth: Your Benevolence... *whisper, whisper*... Rayfa: Yes, of course... I believe the date would be: June 14! Phoenix: (Really, Edgeworth? Is whispering in the ears of elites the secret to your success?) All right, let's give 0-6-1-4 a try. Nope, that's not it. Time to try something else. Leads back to: \"I wonder what date Inga would use as a combination?\" Parents' anniversary Phoenix: How about your parents' anniversary? Rayfa: Hmm... I have not the faintest idea of when it is. Phoenix: Yeah, I guess you wouldn't, huh. Edgeworth: ...It's December 11. Phoenix: H-How in the world do you know THAT fact, Edgeworth?! Edgeworth: Hmph, I don't. I simply deduced it using elementary school-level logic. Though I doubt you'd grasp how I arrived at my conclusion, so I'll save my breath. Phoenix: (There's no way you didn't use some kind of superpower to come up with that...) Anyway, here goes... 1-2-1-1. ...No good. It won't open. Let's try another number, shall we? Leads back to: \"I wonder what date Inga would use as a combination?\" Rayfa's birthday Leads to: \"When's your birthday, Your Benevolence?\" Phoenix: When's your birthday, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: Hmph, you are wasting your time. It could not possibly be my birthday. Phoenix: Aw, come on. It's worth a shot. Rayfa: ...Fine. It's December 24. Phoenix: Christmas Eve? Well, let's give it a try. 1-2-2-4... Ahhh! ...I-It... It opened! Rayfa: It did?! Phoenix: Yep. And it looks like the bottom safe was a fake. Edgeworth: Something meant to mislead would-be thieves, no doubt. Still, it was rendered quite ineffective by his use of such an easily-guessed combination. Rayfa: Wh-Why, Father...? Why my birthdate...? Examine Open safe Phoenix: Okay, let's see what's in here. Hm? This looks like a letter or something. Let's see... \"Dear Father... I wanted to wish you a happy birthday. You're always so kind, and I love you very much. I hope you live to be a hundred years old! Love, Rayfa.\" ............... Rayfa: I-I wrote this to my father when I was eight years old. F-Father... Why would you hold on to... something so childish and stupid...? Phoenix: .........There are some other papers in here. Hmm... Ah! This... This is the plan for his coup d'état! Rayfa: Wh-What?! Give me that! .........I... I don't understand. Edgeworth: It seems Justice Minister Inga was plotting the assassination of the queen. Rayfa: This... This can't be true. Father would never harm Mother. Phoenix: (Poor Rayfa. This has to come as a terrible shock.) ...What's this? There's a photo in here, too. Hmm... It's of a woman and a baby. I wonder who they are. ...On the far left, there's a law book with the mark of the Defiant Dragons branded on it. Rayfa: .........Wait! Th-Th-That's...! Phoenix: Your Benevolence? Rayfa: ...How... How can this be? *thud* Phoenix: P-Princess Rayfa! Rayfa: ............... Phoenix: (She's looking incredibly pale.) Your Benevolence. Are you all right? Rayfa: .........All right? How can I be all right? Phoenix: Huh? Rayfa: .........All that I have believed... It was all lies. Phoenix: I'm afraid I don't follow. (What the heck's she talking about?) Um... Can I ask who the woman is in this picture? Rayfa: ...H-How should I know?! .........It seems I didn't know ANYTHING that was going on! Phoenix: (...Doesn't look like I'm going to get much more out of her while she's like this.) Woman's Photo added to the Court Record. Rayfa: .........Mother. Phoenix: Huh? Rayfa: I must ask my mother... about the secret she is hiding. Phoenix: Um, what secret...? Rayfa: ...I must go. Goodbye. Phoenix: Wait! ...What was that all about? It's like her mind was off somewhere else. Edgeworth: It appears this photo really upset her. Phoenix: (I wonder who the lady in this picture is.) ???: Stop! Shah'do! Come back here! ???: Ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff! Phoenix: Wait, that sounds like... Ahlbi and Shah'do. Edgeworth: That's odd. Commoners aren't normally allowed in this area. I wonder what's afoot. Any point of interest (after examining open safe) Phoenix: I better not touch anything without Rayfa's permission. Who knows what she might say... or do if she finds out. After examining open safe in Ga'ran Palace - Inga's Private Quarters: May 18Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence Shah'do: Ruff ruff ruff! Edgeworth: Nghoooooooooh! Phoenix: Ahhh! Edgewooooorth! Edgeworth: .........I hope one of you has a good explanation for this. Ahlbi: Ahhhhhh! I'm SO sorry! Phoenix: Hi, Ahlbi... Ahlbi: No, Shah'do! Bad dog! Leave the man's frilly thingamajig alone! Shah'do: Grrrrrrrrr... Edgeworth: If you would kindly detach your dog from my cravat. Ahlbi: R-Right away, sir! Just hold still, and... Edgeworth: And...? Shah'do: Grrrrrr... Ahlbi: Hrrrrrgh! Hrrrrrrrrrrrgh! Edgeworth: Nghoooh! Stop pulling like that! You'll only stretch the fabric! Ahlbi: Come on, Shah'do...! Let go of his... carava-chamacallit! Shah'do: Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! Ahlbi: Hmm... This isn't working. I'll just have to pull harder, then... One, two... Edgeworth: Wait! What are you--?! Ahlbi: THREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! RRRRRRRNNNNNNNNGH! .........Come OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON! Edgeworth: NNNNGHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH! AAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! I NEED AAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRRRRR! *huff... huff... huff...* Were you trying to kill me?! Ahlbi: I'm really sorry, mister. My dog has a habit of attacking frilly things like that. Phoenix: (Maybe for his sake, he should stick to more traditional targets, like cars, or his tail...) Ahlbi: What's worse, he snuck in here again today and stole some weird-looking hat. I don't know what to do anymore. Bad dog! You're a very bad dog! Shah'da: *whine* Phoenix: (Wait a second... I've seen that hat before.) Examine Urns (after clearing \"Ahlbi in the courtyard\" Talk option) Leads to: \"Ahlbi, you wouldn't happen to know how this urn got knocked over, would you?\" Talk The frilly hat Phoenix: Ahlbi, could I see that hat again? Ahlbi: Sure! Phoenix: (Wait... Isn't this... Isn't this Nayna's hat? But I thought she'd disappeared.) Ahlbi: Shah'do swiped it from someone. Phoenix: Um, Ahlbi? How exactly did Shah'do get this? Ahlbi: Allow me to explain! It all started while we were on a walk through the bazaar today. When, suddenly, Datz popped out of a manhole! Datz: Hah! Ahlbi: Whoa! Datz: The fangs of the Defiant Dragons... ...Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaah... ...Datz Are'bal is here! .........Say, you wanna join our cause, kid? Ahlbi: (Misattributed to Datz Are'bal in the original release) Huh? Ahlbi: Naturally, I was super startled by that weirdo's sudden appearance. Warbaa'd: RAWWWWWWRRRRRR! Shah'do: Ruff ruff! Datz: Back! Dog of the Ga'ran regime! Ahlbi: (Misattributed to Datz Are'bal in the original release) Huh? But this is my dog, Shah'do... Datz: Defiant Dragon secret weapon: Dragon Snot Snaps! ACHOOOO! *BANG* Ahlbi: WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOA! Oof! Datz: Har har har har har! Aw man, the look on your face! That was classic! Ahlbi: The sudden bang of the firecracker spooked Shah'do, and he ran off into the crowds. Shah'do: Ruff ruff ruff ruff! Ahlbi: Ahhhhhh! Shah'do, come back here! Datz: Har har har har har! That'll teach ya, Ga'ran's lapdog! Policeman: You there! What do you think you're doing?! Datz: ...Ack! Not good! Ahlbi: That's when a policeman came running over and hauled Datz away. That happened right around 2 PM, if I remember correctly. Phoenix: (...I'm not even going to pretend I know what Datz was trying to do.) Ahlbi: I chased right after Shah'do, and... ...when I finally caught up to him here in the palace courtyard, he had this in his mouth. Edgeworth: 2 PM, hmm? That's about an hour before the minister's death. Phoenix: Nayna supposedly went missing after the murder... ...but this would place her here at the palace at around two. (Changed from [...but this would place her here at the palace at around 2.] in the original release) Ahlbi's Statement added to the Court Record. Ahlbi: Actually! I just remembered I saw something pretty amazing around that time, too! Phoenix: Something amazing? The frilly hat (subsequent times) Phoenix: Ahlbi, could I see that hat again? Ahlbi: Sure! Phoenix: (Wait... Isn't this... Isn't this Nayna's hat? But I thought she'd disappeared.) Ahlbi: Shah'do swiped it from someone. Phoenix: Um, Ahlbi? How exactly did Shah'do get this? Ahlbi: Allow me to explain! It all started while we were on a walk through the bazaar today. When, suddenly, Datz popped out of a manhole! Datz: Hah! Ahlbi: Whoa!

(Changed from [...but this would place her here at the palace at around 2.] in the original release) Ahlbi: Actually! I just remembered I saw something pretty amazing around that time, too! Phoenix: Something amazing? Something amazing (appears after \"The frilly hat\") Phoenix: So, Ahlbi, what was it you saw that was so amazing? Ahlbi: I saw Her Eminence Queen Ga'ran channeling a spirit! Phoenix: Is it really that big of a deal to see her channeling someone? Ahlbi: You bet it is! Commoners are never allowed to behold the sacred rite. Phoenix: Oh? Can you tell me more? Ahlbi: Of course! I'm always happy to explain! Um... I believe it was around 2:10 PM today. I got lost on the palace grounds while looking for Shah'do. Ahlbi: Ooh... What is this place? It gives me the creeps. Where could Shah'do have gone? Ahlbi: In my search, I took a peek into a small room and... ...that's when I saw Queen Ga'ran! She was channeling a spirit for a neighboring kingdom's king! I saw her transform right before my eyes! I was so excited, I had to take a picture of it! Phoenix: You... You took a picture? Ahlbi: I know I shouldn't have... ...but I just couldn't help myself! Phoenix: (Between this and the treasure room, Ahlbi's not exactly the picture of self-restraint...) Ahlbi: Her channeling rite ended right after that, so I ran off before anyone could spot me. Phoenix: You could've been arrested again, you know. Ahlbi: ...Yeah, I know... ........................ Anyway, here's a copy of the picture. Just don't tell anyone I was the one who took it. Phoenix: (...I worry about his future sometimes.) Channeling Photo added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Come to think of it... ...how did you and Shah'do get into the royal residence anyway? It's not open to commoners, after all. Ahlbi: Allow me to explain! Something amazing (subsequent times) Phoenix: So, Ahlbi, what was it you saw that was so amazing? Ahlbi: I saw Her Eminence Queen Ga'ran channeling a spirit! Phoenix: Is it really that big of a deal to see her channeling someone? Ahlbi: You bet it is!

Phoenix: (...I worry about his future sometimes.) Come to think of it... ...how did you and Shah'do get into the royal residence anyway? It's not open to commoners, after all. Ahlbi: Allow me to explain! Ahlbi in the courtyard (appears after \"Something amazing\") Ahlbi: There's a way to get into the palace from the bazaar. It's a bit of a tight squeeze, though. Shah'do can easily fit, but anyone bigger than me is out of luck. Phoenix: You don't say... Ahlbi: Yeah, part of the palace wall is damaged, and there's a hole I can just make it through. Phoenix: Go on. Ahlbi: Heh heh heh. Betcha didn't know they have some really tasty food here! Phoenix: Oh? Then this isn't your first time in here, huh. ...Trespassing is illegal, you know. Ahlbi: N-No, it's not like that! I didn't mean any harm. It's just... I want to help change this kingdom. Phoenix: What do you mean? Ahlbi: Well, after Ms. Fey's trial, I started thinking. Like maybe... Maybe there was something I could do to help the revolution, too. Phoenix: (...Maya's trial, huh. That tragedy only happened because of how twisted Khura'in's legal system has become.) Nahyuta: How utterly foolish to cast away one's life for such a reason! There must have been other ways to cover up the crime! Tahrust: Yet, had I done so, my wife would rush to my defense. And when the case went to trial... ...she would suffer the same fate as I under the Defense Culpability Act. I could not have lived with myself had she been convicted because of that fiendish man! Rayfa: Th-This... This cannot be... All I have done under the laws of our kingdom... It has all been... Phoenix: (The DC Act led to the false charges against Maya and the high priest's suicide. But that trial also caused the public to start questioning the current state of things. And it seems even Ahlbi has some pretty strong feelings on the matter.) Ahlbi: I knew there had to be something I could do to help! That's when I remembered the hole in the palace wall, and started thinking... ...maybe I could sneak in and take a picture of one of the royals up to no good. I just want to do my part! Edgeworth: The spirit of revolution seems to be catching on, even with one so young. Wright, the momentum is steadily building, and the tipping point is fast approaching. It's just a matter of when. Phoenix: I agree. And the public's perception of the Defiant Dragons seems to be changing, too. But Ahlbi... You can't go trespassing like that. Even if it's for a good cause, it's not right. Ahlbi: Okay. I won't do it again. Phoenix: Ahlbi, is that really all you have to confess? You haven't been up to any other mischief? And when I say \"you,\" I mean Shah'do. Ahlbi: Huh?! Oh, um... I-I... I don't know what you're talking about. Aheh... heh heh heh... Phoenix: (Nice try, Ahlbi, but the proof is literally right in front of us.) Present Attorney's Badge Ahlbi: Oh, that's an attorney's badge from your homeland, right?! I've studied all about it. Allow me to explain! There's a reason why the badge is shaped like a sunflower. You know how sunflowers always turn to face the sun -- the source of their well-being? Well, lawyers are like that -- they will chase after anything that will make them money! Phoenix: Whaaat?! Ahlbi: ...I guess people hate lawyers in your country, too, huh. Phoenix: Umm... Where did you get your information from again? Ahlbi: A proud sermon Chief Prosecutor Payne gave in the middle of the bazaar the other day. Phoenix: Nngh... Lawyers already have a bad enough time here without his lies. Channeling Photo Ahlbi: I know I shouldn't have taken that picture... But it was the first time I'd ever seen a spirit medium at work! I couldn't help myself. Phoenix: (At least he knows what he did was wrong.) Ahlbi: .........100-- no, 400 dahmas per copy sounds about right. Phoenix: Ahlbi... You're not planning to sell this photo to tourists, are you? Ahlbi: ...! Ah-ha ha ha! Come on, Mr. Wright, You don't really think I'd do that, do you? Phoenix: (Now I REALLY fear for his future.) Anything else Phoenix: What do you know about this, Ahlbi? Ahlbi: .........S-Sorry. I don't know anything about that. I'm the worst tour guide ever. Phoenix: N-No, no, it's my fault for randomly whipping it out and asking you about it. Ahlbi: Don't worry. I'll study hard, so I'll be ready to answer all your questions next time! Phoenix: (Argh, now I feel like a jerk.) Phoenix: Ahlbi, you wouldn't happen to know how this urn got knocked over, would you? Ahlbi: Ah! Phoenix: Because Her Benevolence told me something rather interesting. Rayfa: Be careful. Some dingbat dog got in the courtyard and spilled water over there. Phoenix: A dingbat dog? Rayfa: That's right. The yappy mutt spilled a whole urn's worth. Phoenix: The \"dingbat dog\" she mentioned wouldn't happen to be Shah'do, would it? Ahlbi: ...Ooh...! ......... I guess the dog's out of the bag. Sorry I lied. But I was worried I'd get in trouble. I know I shouldn't lie to a lawyer like that. Phoenix: No, it's not good to lie to anyone like that. So let's try to only tell the truth. Okay, Ahlbi? Ahlbi: Oh, Mr. Wright! I almost forgot. I saw a couple of Americans a moment ago. They had really weird haircuts, so I thought they might be friends of yours. Phoenix: ...R-Really, now... Um... Edgeworth: It seems your little friend thinks all us Americans have strange hairstyles. I suppose we have you to thank for that, Wright? Phoenix: ......... So, what exactly did their hair look like? Ahlbi: There was a guy with two crops of hair sticking out of his forehead like antennae. Then there was this lady with a long bunch of hair that looked like a big, orange spider leg. Phoenix: Oh, that sounds like Apollo and Athena. What were they doing? Ahlbi: They were racing through the bazaar... ... with the Ga'ran Royal Guard in hot pursuit! Phoenix: Wait, whaaaaaat?! Edgeworth: Why were they being pursued...? Phoenix: I'm not sure, but I have my suspicions. I just hope they're all right. Ahlbi: S-Sorry for not mentioning it before. It just kind of slipped my mind, heh heh... To be continued May 18Khura'in - Bazaar Apollo: *huff, puff, huff, puff* Those... Those guys... sure are... persistent! Athena: *huff, puff, huff, puff* Yeah. They even wore ME out, and that doesn't happen often. Apollo: Why are they after us, anyway?! Athena: Ah, Apollo! It's the royal guards again! Apollo: Argh! Q-Quick, hide! Royal Guard: Hey! Where'd Horn Head and Spidey Hair gooooooo?!! Athena: ...Spidey Hair? They're not talking about me, are they? Apollo: I-Is that a trick question...? Royal Guard: We know you're hiding somewhere around heeeeeeeeeeere!!! RAWWWRRR! Athena: A-Apollo, that weird-looking bird over there... Did it just...?! Apollo: ...Yeah, it did. It's called a warbaa'd and... You know what? I'll tell you all about it later when we're not being chased by masked men! Royal Guard: Come out, come out, wherever you aaaaare!!! ...Hand over the Founder's Orb, if you know what's good for yooooouuuuuu!!! Apollo: (It figures they're after the orb.) Athena: I don't want to know what they'll do to us if we were captured. If they grill us in those obnoxious, loud voices... ...I'd cave after the first hour and confess to whatever they wanted, truth or no! Royal Guard: Come out now, you foreign deeeeevils!!! This has gone faaaaaar enough!!! You must not keep Her Eminence waiting any looooooonger!!! RAWWWRRR! Apollo: W-We've gotta get out of here! There must be a safe place to hide somewhere! Examine Manhole cover Leads to: \"Look, a manhole.\" Any other point of interest Apollo: Maybe we could hide here. Athena: No way! They'd find us in no time! Royal Guard: Stay where you aaaare!!! Athena: Th-They're closing in on us! Apollo: We've gotta find a place to hide! Talk Any ideas? Athena: Apollo! We shouldn't be standing around talking like this! Who knows what they'll do to us if they catch us! Apollo: You're right. Let's find somewhere safe to hide! Present Anything Athena: Apollo! Do you really HAVE to show that to me right this second?! Apollo: S-Sorry. It's just... something I do now when I'm stuck... Anyway, your shouting isn't helping, either. Royal Guard: That voice! It's Spidey Hair!!! Athena: Eeeeek! ...Hiii-yaaaaaa!!! Royal Guard: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!! Apollo: (Sh-She sent him flying!) Athena: L-Let's find somewhere else to hide before the other guards get here! Apollo: Look, a manhole. ...Ahhh! That's right! Dhurke: Say, son, do you remember my office? Apollo: ...Sure. (I remember that messy, dimly lit room.) Dhurke: The file I've amassed on Amara's assassination is kept there. I think it might help you on this case. Do you remember how to get there? Apollo: Athena! I know where we can hide! Follow me! Athena: Oh?! Where are we going?! Apollo: Hrrrrrrrnngh! Athena: W-Wait. You're not seriously thinking about going down there? It smells like rotten eggs. And are those rats I hear?! Apollo: We've got no choice! I can get us somewhere safe, but this is the only way in. Quick, before it's too late! Athena: Ugh. It's going to take forever to get this stench out of my hair. May 18Former Sahdmadhi Law Offices Apollo: .........Looks like we lost them. That was close. .................. (Dhurke's office... How long has it been since I last set foot in here?) At least we're safe now, but... (Why is Athena all huddled over in the corner like that?) Datz: Ah! Apollo: Datz? Datz: AJ! What the heck are ya doing here? Apollo: Ga'ran's royal guards are after us. Datz: Har har har! Once a rebel, always a rebel. Don't worry. The regime doesn't know about this place, so ya can relax now. Apollo: Good. But since when am I part of the rebellion? I don't recall signing up. ???: Apollo! Apollo: Mr. Wright? What are you doing here? Phoenix: We saw you two go into that manhole. Edgeworth: You narrowly escaped the guards' notice. Phoenix: It was like watching a pair of ostriches burying their heads in the sand. Apollo: (I guess that was a closer shave than I had thought...) Phoenix: Anyway, you're safe and sound now, and that's what really counts. Oh, I also have some evidence for you. Apollo: Thanks, Mr. Wright. Case evidence received from the boss. Edgeworth: So, what is this dubious hovel we've found ourselves in, anyway? Apollo: It's the Defiant Dragons' safe house... also known as the former Sahdmadhi Law Offices. Edgeworth: I see... Well. Though it might just be happenstance... ...here I am -- a chief prosecutor -- hiding out in a rebel base. Apollo: Um, please don't report this place to the local police, Prosecutor Edgeworth... (Might as well take a look around while we're waiting for the heat to die down out there.) Come on, Athena. Stop moping over there and help me check this place out. Athena: *shudder* Please tell me there's a shower here. Apollo: There's a sink in the kitchen. And if you're lucky, maybe even some soap. Athena: .........I'm sorry I even asked. Examine Picture of Ga'ran Apollo: There's a scary-looking knife sticking out of the queen's picture. If anyone saw this, they'd think the Defiant Dragons were a violent group. Datz: Oh, that? That was actually me trying to kill a fly. I threw that knife at it and whiffed, and the thing ended up stuck right between her eyes. Apollo: You mean this wasn't on purpose?! White flowers Apollo: Datz, what's with the altar? Datz: It's where we pay our respects to the victims of the Defense Culpability Act. The DC Act is a heinous law that puts innocent people to death! Apollo: (A law that's supposed to protect the people sends them to their graves instead... Talk about insane.) Ladder Athena: Wait... Don't tell me we have to go back through the manhole to get out of here... Apollo: The only reason this safe house is still safe is because the front door's been boarded up. Athena: Fine, then I'll just have to live here till the revolution begins! Apollo: ...What if I told you rats come out at night? Athena; Then we'll just have to start the revolution before sundown! Apollo: (I bet the revolution never thought it'd get a new ally this way.) Photos Athena: Hm? Who's the kid... Wait a second! That's YOU, Apollo! I'd recognize those horns anywhere! Apollo: Is that really the only way ANYBODY recognizes me?! Athena: Hee hee hee. You were so cute! ...And who's THAT fine-looking young man? Apollo: That's Nahyuta, back when he used to smile. Athena: ...Wow. His smile is absolutely angelic. Datz: Sure brings back memories! That was taken the day we all went out fishing. Athena: What was Prosecutor Sahdmadhi like when he was younger? Datz: He was kinda quiet, but passionate when it came to his convictions. When he finally made prosecutor, he was all fired up to change Khura'in for the better. But now he's nothing more than Ga'ran's lackey! Apollo: (Seems like Datz has a lot to say about Nahyuta. I'll ask him about his thoughts later. Photos (subsequent times) Apollo: These pictures sure bring back memories. Nahyuta is cheerfully smiling in this one. That quiet smile he gives in court now seems almost fake by comparison. Lizards Athena: Eeewww... Is that a newt? Apollo: Come on, Athena. Can't you tell a gecko when you see one? Athena: What's the difference? Apollo: Geckos like to live in houses, while newts prefer to be outside near water. They're totally different creatures. Athena: Well, how do you know this one wasn't caught outside near some water? It could very well be a gecko. Apollo: No, I'm pretty sure it's a newt. Athena: Oh, so then you agree it's a newt, Apollo? Apollo: Ack! (I fell right into her trap!) Phoenix: You're both wrong. It's just a plain old lizard. TV Apollo: I'm surprised to see so many appliances here. There's even a TV. Datz: Speaking of which, we gave the people of Khura'in quite a shock... ...when \"The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm\" was last on TV. Apollo: You mean that show where actors play the parts of Dhurke and Rayfa? You hijacked that in the middle of its broadcast, right? Datz: Yep. All their writers do each week is try to ruin the Defiant Dragons' good name. So we decided to hit 'em where it hurts! Har har har har har har! Apollo: That must've been real shocking, especially for the kids who'd waited all week to see it. I mean, the show's main villain was actually hijacking the very show he's in! Coat Athena: Dhurke's jacket... You should try it on, Apollo. It might actually suit you. Apollo: R-Really? Datz: There's also a spare eye patch here. Why not try that on, too? Athena: ...Pffft. ...*snicker* Hee hee hee! S-Sorry, sorry. Just picturing you in all that... Ha ha ha ha! It's just too funny! Apollo: (Oww... My pride...) Sign Apollo: Sahdmadhi Law Offices... That's the sign Dhurke used to display out front. Hey, Datz. I heard the office used [sic]do quite a bit of business. Datz: That it did. Dhurke was a famous lawyer with countless courtroom victories, after all. He was the Dauntless Dragon who turned trials upside down... ...snatching victory from the jaws of defeat! His fame as a lawyer spread far and wide across Khura'in back in the day. Apollo: ...I hope the day comes when he can proudly display this sign again. Spider Apollo: What's with all the spider webs, Datz? Don't you ever clean the place? Datz: Not the webs! We have what ya call a symbiotic relationship. They catch the bugs that get in here, and I don't clean 'em up! Apollo: You know... that actually makes a lot of sense. Law book Apollo: This is Dhurke's old law book. Athena: Look, there's a mark on the cover. It looks like it was branded with a hot iron. Apollo: Yeah, I think it was done in protest against the Defense Culpability Act. There's an entry on the DC Act right here. See? Athena: Oh, so this is the infamous anti-lawyer law you guys are always talking about... Dhurke's Law Book added to the Court Record. Law book (subsequent times) Apollo: This is Dhurke's old law book. Athena: Look, there's a mark on the cover. It looks like it was branded with a hot iron. Apollo: Yeah, I think it was done in protest against the Defense Culpability Act. There's an entry on the DC Act right here. See? Athena: Oh, so this is the infamous anti-lawyer law you guys are always talking about... File Athena: I wonder what's in this file. Oh, it's full of newspaper clippings. Apollo: It seems to be a collection of documents and information on Amara's assassination. (So this is what Dhurke was talking about.) Athena: We already know most of the stuff here on top. Let's see what else there is. Wow, where did he get all this? Umm... Anything important here...? Hmm, what about this... \"Apollo's roving musician father got caught up in this incident and lost his life.\" ...Whaaat?! Th-This is about your father, Apollo! Apollo: Looks like it. But I was never told much more than what's written here. Athena: Really? How come? Apollo: Dhurke always skated around the subject. Maybe he thought I was still too young. Plus, I always thought of Dhurke as my dad, so I never really brought it up. Athena: ...Oh, I see. Still... I feel kind of sorry for your real dad. Apollo: (My real dad... I was never really interested in learning about him. But after seeing his picture, I can't help but feel a little curious. I wonder if Datz could tell me anything about him.) Amara's Assassination File added to the Court Record. Athena: ...Apollo, this file looks like it might be useful. But there are so many pages, I can't tell what's important. Apollo: We need someone to help organize all of this. (And I think I know just the person to ask.) File (subsequent times) Apollo: This file has a ton of information on Amara's assassination. We should go over the important parts later. Talk Sahdmadhi Law Offices Apollo: So, Datz, you guys are still using this office, I see. Datz: Yep. 'Cept now it's the official HQ of the Defiant Dragons. But as Dhurke said, and I quote... \"We must keep it for the day when Khura'in needs lawyers once more.\" Phoenix: Restoring the legal system to its rightful form through popular uprising... You can tell how much Dhurke believes in his cause. Datz: Oh, and AJ. Dhurke said something else that might interest ya. He said he hopes you'll come back and take over this office someday. Apollo: T-Take over?! Me? Datz: Those were his words. He may've been half joking though. Datz: Dhurke! Guess what I heard from PW! AJ's become a lawyer! Dhurke: ...Yeah, I've been meaning to tell you. Datz: Must've been because of you, Dhurke! Dhurke: I'm not so sure about that. I imagine he's already forgotten about me. Datz: Whaddaya talking about? I bet he can't wait to follow in your footsteps. Dhurke: Hah, ha ha ha. Nothing would make me happier. Maybe one day he'll return to Khura'in and take over this office. ...Heh. It's just a pipe dream, though. Apollo: .........Dhurke really said that? Datz: Dhurke was never a hands-on kinda dad... ...but not a day went by that he wasn't thinking of ya. That much I'm sure of. Athena: Doesn't get more paternal than that. Apollo: (Dhurke... And to think, I really did spend my days trying to forget you. I'm looking forward to a nice, long talk once you're free.) Nahyuta (appears after examining photos) Apollo: Datz, wasn't Nahyuta once part of the Defiant Dragons? Datz: Yep. Yuty was a rising star in the resistance! He vowed to fight for the cause through the legal system. Said he'd become a prosecutor, and give Inga and Ga'ran the smackdown they deserved! Apollo: But now he's... Datz: Yeah... a puppet of the Ga'ran regime. Not only that, but now he's gonna prosecute his own dad. It doesn't add up! Athena: I wonder what happened to him. Datz: Me, too. But if I had to guess... ...I'd say Ga'ran has some serious leverage over him. Apollo: Leverage? Like what? Datz: Wish I knew. But it seems like Dhurke knows. I tried to press him about it, but he wouldn't say. Apollo: (Come to think of it, Dhurke did say...) Apollo: Nahyuta... is suffering...? Dhurke: Yes. He knows the rightful state of Khura'in's legal system... ...but something forces him to bend to Ga'ran's will, and it's tearing him apart. Apollo: (If that's the case... ...I bet Nahyuta doesn't really want to go through with Dhurke's prosecution.) My father (appears after presenting Photo of My Father) Apollo: Do you know what my biological father was like? Datz: Dhurke once told me about him. He was a modern minstrel, walking the world and making music in his travels. Athena: This file also has some information on your real dad. It says he died in the blaze at Queen Amara's residence twenty-three years ago. Datz: That's right. Dhurke had invited him over. Dhurke's the kinda guy who can become fast friends with just about anyone. And it seems your pops was like that, too, AJ. They hit it off at a bar... ...and the next thing ya know, Dhurke's asked him over to play some tunes. Apollo: And then the place went up in flames... Datz: Yeah. Dhurke had just stepped out for a sec when the fire broke out. .........Apollo. You were there, too, but you were still just a baby. Apollo: ...I remember hearing about that when I was little. Datz: Yeah, it was a crying shame. Your pops just happened to take you along that day. So you were there with him when the fire broke out. But Dhurke risked his life to save you! Apollo: (It's like Dhurke's done nothing but save me all my life...) Datz: All your pops's stuff got burned up. Including anything that could've helped us identify him. All we knew about him at first was his stage name, \"Jangly Justice\" or something like that. Dhurke did everything he could just to dig up what little we know now. Apollo: ...Um, what about my mother? Do you know anything about her? Datz: All we know is she was traveling with your pops. But that day, she was off doing something on her own. Apollo: So then, she probably didn't even know my father had been with Dhurke, huh. Athena: But she must've been desperate to find you and your father once you'd gone missing. Datz: No doubt. But the queen's assassination threw the kingdom into chaos. The police were so overwhelmed, they were probably hardly of any help to her. We searched and searched till our legs gave out, too, but we never found her. And with your father's stuff all burned up, we had zero leads -- not even a photo. Apollo: So that's how I became an orphan... Datz: Yeah... Who knows? Maybe your mom read about the details of the fire in the newspaper. And maybe she figured you'd died along with your pops. Athena: Wow, I had no idea you'd been through all that, Apollo. Present Photo of My Father Apollo: Datz, I wanted to ask you about this picture. Datz: That's the picture of your pops that Dhurke found. And he had a heck of a time tracking it down. He said he searched all over for it! Apollo: Why...? Why would he go through all that trouble? Athena: Datz, please tell us everything you know about Apollo's dad! Dhurke's Law Book Datz: The Mark of the Dragon... That's the symbol of our group, the Defiant Dragons. Apollo: Dhurke has the same mark tattooed on the palm of his hand, right? Datz: Yep. And I've got one, too. Apollo: Really? Where? Datz: On my heart! Apollo: ...Oh, you mean metaphorically. Like you're ready to die at any time for the cause or something like that? Datz: You got that right. Dead or alive, I'll always be a Defiant Dragon! Amara's Assassination File Apollo: Datz, about this file... Can you help me figure out whihc pages are the most relevant? Datz: Yup, sure can. I got the whole thing memorized. See this page? It's definitely worth a look. Athena: Oh, that's right! Prosecutor Sahdmadhi was part of the royal family, wasn't he! Datz: Yep. But he was expelled after that whole thing with Dhurke happened. He must've gone through hell once he entered the legal world though. Apollo: Because of the whole \"the sins of the father are visited upon his children\" thing? Datz: Yep. In the eyes of the people, Dhurke is not only a traitor to his kingdom... ...he's also the terrorist who assassinated the previous queen. So, as his son, Yuty no doubt got the cold shoulder at every turn. Apollo: That must've been really hard on him. Datz: Yeah, the ties between father and son aren't something you could break, even if you tried. No matter where he went, he was probably labeled the son of a criminal. But despite it all, he made a name for himself through blood, sweat, and tears. I mean, just look at him now. He's a star prosecutor working cases around the globe. He's become a hero! The pride and joy of Khura'in! Apollo: (Now that's the Nahyuta I know -- super smart and never willing to give in. He must've studied and fought like his life depended on it to get to where he is today.) Amaras Assassination File updated in the Court Record. Anything else Datz: Ahhhhhh! Apollo: What? Do you know something about this? Datz: Nope. Just felt like shouting is all. Apollo: (He had me going there for a sec...) After clearing all Talk options, examining law book, and presenting Amara's Assassination File: Old Man: So then you believe me? You believe in my son's innocence?! Beh'leeb: Your poor son -- imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit... Let's petition the government for his release and a declaration of innocence! Old Man: Oh, thank you, thank you! I'm forever in your debt! Apollo: Hm? Who's that? Datz: Hey there, Mrs. Inmee. Hard at work, I see. Beh'leeb: Yes, I have my own battle that I must wage. After all, there are many who suffer under the Defense Culpability Act. Rebel: Mrs. Inmee! Please don't forget about our case, too! Beh'leeb: I won't! I will look into it as soon as I am able. Phoenix: Um, Datz? What's Mrs. Inmee doing here? Datz: She's lending an ear to all those suffering under the regime's wrongful accusations. A lady whose husband's been imprisoned, parents whose son's been falsely charged... She's helping all those types of people. Phoenix: So she's trying to help the revolution along... ...in her own special way. Datz: Yep. And thanks to her, more and more folks are coming over to our side! All the people who've been unhappy with the regime have been waiting for just this chance! And they're starting to speak out in support of us! Apollo: (The people are responding... and a grassroots movement is growing... Dhurke's dream of revolution may finally come true.) Athena: What should we do about the Founder's Orb? We'll probably run into the royal guards again the moment we leave this place. Phoenix: Well, we can't stay here forever, so we'll have to think of something. Apollo: ...I've got it. Why don't you hold on to it, Datz? It should be safe here, right? Datz: You can count on me! I'll get it back to you in time for tomorrow's trial at the Hall of Justice. Founder's Orb left with Datz. Athena: What now, Apollo? Apollo: Well, we've got a handle on what happened twenty-three years ago. Maybe we should pay Dhurke a visit. There's something I want to show him. Phoenix: I'll join you. I want to talk to him before tomorrow's trial. Edgeworth: Maybe I should wait here, then. We'll attract undue attention if we go in too large of a group. Bazaar Examine Yak Apollo: It's a yak. They used to serve as a beast of burden here. Athena: They're actually kind of cute up-close. Hello there, big fella! Or are you a girl...? Apollo: Umm, if you stick your face that close to it, it's liable to-- *sluuuuurp* Athena: Eeewwww, gross! .................. Apollo: ...Need some tissues? Athena: I-I could use a handful of wet naps, if you've got 'em... Bird Athena: What's this bird doing here? Apollo: I wouldn't get too close to it if I were you. ???: RAWWWWWWRRRRRR! Athena: Eeeeeeeeek! Apollo: ...Athena, meet the warbaa'd. Its cry resembles a lion's roar to scare off predators. Athena: Wow... that's one gutsy little bird. But I bet it's not really all that tough. Apollo: How about we just leave the bird alone? Cart Apollo: (So many street stalls... And they all have stuff you can't find back home.) Athena: We should spend some time shopping here when this case is over. I'd like to buy Trucy a souvenir or something. Poster Apollo: There's a poster here... \"The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm\"...? Phoenix: It's a special-effects-driven action-here show that's become a huge hit here in Khura'in. Apollo: (Maybe it's a cultural thing, but she totally looks like a villain to me.) Steaming buns Phoenix: Khura'in's national delicacy, magatah'man -- or \"soul buns,\" if that makes it easier. Apparently, they're so delicious, they'll send your soul straight to the Twilight Realm. Apollo: \"Delicious\"? More like \"deadly.\" Phoenix: Actually, in one of the commercials, an old man literally drops dead after taking a bite. And at the very end, there's a warning that goes, \"Enjoy at your own risk.\" Apollo: Like I said: deadly. Manhole cover Apollo: (This is the manhole that leads to Dhurke's office-turned-safe house. It's the only way in or out. And for obvious reasons, there's no doorbell or welcome mat.) Souvenir stands Apollo: (The souvenir stands sure are popular with the tourists. I should check them out later.) Tehm'pul Temple Apollo: Tehm'pul Temple is just up ahead. When I was a kid, I used to race Nahyuta and my friends to the top. Present Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Athena: The victim was the Minister of Justice, the second most powerful person here in Khura'in. In Wright Anything Agency terms... ...I guess that would be you, Apollo. Apollo: Ha ha ha. Thanks, but... ...everyone knows it's Trucy. Athena: ...Yeah, you're probably right. On second thought, she might actually be number one. I mean, even Mr. Wright is no match for her. Apollo: .........Remind me not to forget to buy her a souvenir. Dhurke's Law Book Athena: I can't believe Dhurke's been fighting the good fight for over twenty years. Fighting for the truth and the repeal of the Defense Culpability Act... Apollo: Yeah. And being branded a traitor for it. That's got to be extremely hard on him. Athena: Whatever happens, we can't let them find him guilty! We have to help him achieve his life's dream! Anything else Athena: .........What? Are you just going to show that to me without a word? Apollo: (I guess she doesn't have anything to say about it.) Athena: W-Well?! Are you going to at least say SOMETHING?! Inga's Private Quarters Examine Phoenix: Edgeworth and I already searched this room. Apollo: Oh, okay. (I wonder if anything interesting turned up?) Hair dye bottle Athena: \"Je suis L'Belle! SAMPLE\"... Now THERE'S a brand I know well... Apollo: .........Yeah... Me, too. Athena: Let's see what it says on the back. \"The hair care sensation celebrities have been RAVING about! Guaranteed to make you WANT to proclaim, 'Je suis L'Belle!' to the world! This product is NOT FOR SALE. EVER. Even if you come to really like it, PEASANT.\" Apollo: I REALLY still don't get his sales strategy... Any other point of interest Phoenix: We already investigated that, Apollo. May 18Detention Center - Visitor's Room Dhurke: Hey there, son. Came to see your old man again? Apollo: Hi, Dhurke. Guess they're done questioning you? Dhurke: Yeah... You'd think Nahyuta might've cut his old man a little slack, but no. He really laid into me. Seems they're really keen on recovering the Founder's Orb. When I wouldn't tell them where it was, he confiscated what few possessions I had left. Apollo: (...Wait, Dhurke's not wearing his attorney's badge. They even took THAT from him? *sigh*) Talk Nahyuta Dhurke: He confiscated all my prized jailbreaking tools. Apollo: What did you expect? I mean, no prosecutor in their right mind would let a prisoner keep stuff like that. Athena: Did he take your attorney's badge, too? Dhurke: No. I thought it strange, but... ...just when it looked like he was going to take it from me, he changed his mind. Apollo: I wonder why. Dhurke: Indeed. I find it hard to understand anything he does these days. Your attorney's badge (appears after \"Nahyuta\") Apollo: Your Khura'inese attorney's badge... You've worn it all these years -- even though all the lawyers are gone. Dhurke: Yes, because the Dragon's Eye is the embodiment of my creed. Apollo: (To show the world that \"a dragon never yields,\" huh.) Apollo: Hey, Dhurke? Why do you still wear your badge? You're not a lawyer anymore, right? Dhurke: This badge is my heart and soul, son. I'll never stop trying to realize my dream -- not until my very last breath. Nahyuta: \"A dragon never yields,\" right?! Dhurke: Exactly. ...Nahyuta, Apollo, I vow to restore Khura'in's legal system to its rightful state one day. I want to pass on to you a world where you can live free from the fear of tyranny. Apollo: (He was always saying stuff like that to the two of us. Nahyuta... Is the reason why you didn't take Dhurke's badge... ...because you still remember those talks, too? I really hope that's what it is.) Dhurke: ...Son, would you keep my badge for me? Apollo: Are you sure?! I can't take something so important to you. Dhurke: That's exactly why I want you to hold on to it, Apollo. I'm placing my fate in your hands. Apollo: .........All right. I'll make sure it stays safe. Dhurke's Badge added to the Court Record. Your attorney's badge (subsequent times) Apollo: Your Khura'inese attorney's badge... You've worn it all these years -- even though all the lawyers are gone. Dhurke: Yes, because the Dragon's Eye is the embodiment of my creed. Apollo: (To show the world that \"a dragon never yields,\" huh.) Apollo: Hey, Dhurke? Why do you still wear your badge? You're not a lawyer anymore, right? Dhurke: This badge is my heart and soul, son. I'll never stop trying to realize my dream -- not until my very last breath. Nahyuta: \"A dragon never yields,\" right?! Dhurke: Exactly. ...Nahyuta, Apollo, I vow to restore Khura'in's legal system to its rightful state one day. I want to pass on to you a world where you can live free from the fear of tyranny. Apollo: (He was always saying stuff like that to the two of us. Nahyuta... Is the reason why you didn't take Dhurke's badge... ...because you still remember those talks, too? I really hope that's what it is.) Present Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Dhurke: Inga Karkhuul Khura'in... He was an entirely insufferable, unlikable fellow, but I never thought he'd wind up dead. Apollo: Why didn't you like him? Dhurke: He was the most hawkish one in the Ga'ran regime. He established the secret police to arrest us rebels without due process. Those they managed to capture were immediately executed. My compatriots in the Defiant Dragons came to call him \"The Executioner.\" Apollo: \"The Executioner\"? Pretty ironic, considering how he ended up. Dhurke: He's probably in Hell now, being tormented by those he wrongfully put to death. Pink Butterfly Pendant Apollo: I found this in the tomb. Look familiar? Dhurke: ...Ah! Th-That's... Apollo: Dhurke? Dhurke: Where did you find it? Apollo: Down between the monk statues in the tomb. Is it yours, Dhurke? Dhurke: .........Oh, um, it's... it's something I bought. Apollo: ? (Why's he suddenly acting all awkward?) Dhurke: Hmm... I wonder when I lost it. Let's have it. It's very important to me. Apollo: O-Of course... (I'll just make a note about it for future reference.) Pink Butterfly Pendant returned to Dhurke, but a record of it remains in the Court Record. Dhurke's Law Book Dhurke: Careful with that. Don't go showing it around town. You'll be branded a rebel. Apollo: But I'm not a rebel. Dhurke: Don't be ridiculous. You're a member of the Defiant Dragons simply by being my son. Or did you think that dragon tattoo on your rear end was just for show? Athena: Whaaat?! You have a tattoo on your butt, Apollo?! Let me see! Apollo: Relax, Athena. He's just jerking our chains again. Amara's Assassination File Dhurke: I prepared that myself. Use it well. Apollo: I'm surprised you were able to gather this much information. Dhurke: It wasn't easy. After all, all of the evidence from the assassination was lost in the fire. And the newly-installed Ga'ran regime was in full control of the media. Every lead I tried to follow led to a dead end. Apollo: So then how am I supposed to solve this case? Dhurke: ...You'll figure something out once tomorrow's trial is underway. After all, no one's looked into this assassination since my last trial. Apolo: (I hope I can turn things around enough to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.) Dhurke's Badge Dhurke: Ah, my attorney's badge. You don't see those around here anymore. Apollo: It's not exactly something you can wear publicly, is it? Dhurke: Yeah... And if you did, people would jeer and throw things at you. I've had tomatoes, cabbages -- even eggs thrown at me. Apollo: That sounds awful. But at least they didn't throw rocks. Dhurke: ...True. Plus, if you were good at catching things, you'd have the start of a good meal. Apollo: What?! Dhurke: It's true. An hour's walk can yield all you need for a nice, big hot pot! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (Dhurke... I'm sorry I never knew how bad things were when you were raising us.) Anything else Dhurke: Is that for me, son? Apollo: No, I was just wondering if you knew anything about it. Dhurke: What? You came to visit me and you didn't even bring a present? Apollo: (I'll take that as a \"no.\") After clearing \"Your attorney's badge\" Talk option and presenting Pink Butterfly Pendant: Phoenix: Apollo, remember how Inga said he had \"someone dear to Dhurke\"? Why don't you ask about that? Apollo: Oh, right. I'll give it a try. Talk Someone dear to Dhurke Apollo: What did the minister mean when he said... ...he had someone dear to you in the palm of his hand? Who was he talking about? Dhurke: Hm? Apollo: Nahyuta seemed to know, but he wouldn't tell me anything. Dhurke: W-Well, I've no idea, so... Phoenix: Well, you obediently followed his every word after he said that... ...so it seems to me the minister was in close proximity to someone you really care about. Dhurke: Oh, um... Apollo: Someone you really care about that isn't Nahyuta...? Wait, don't tell me--! Is there a new lady in your life, Dhurke?! Dhurke: Wh-What?! No! Don't be ridiculous, son! Apollo: .................. Dhurke: .................. The love of my life was Amara. But she's gone now and there will never be another. BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: (Ah! My bracelet! Wait, does this mean...? Dhurke... Have you REALLY not met somebody new?) Present Bracelet Dhurke: The love of my life was Amara. But she's gone now and there will never be another. Perceive twitching left forearm on \"But she's gone now\" Apollo: Apollo: ...Dhurke. You can't fool me. You tensed up when you said, \"But she's gone now.\" And you unconsciously moved your arm... ...causing something to press up against your jacket. Dhurke: Ahhhhh! ...H-How did you do that?! Apollo: ...Oh, so that's it! You're hiding a woman's photo up your sleeve. You don't have to keep secrets like that from me, Dhurke. You're an eligible bachelor now. But you'll... introduce her to me at some point, right? Dhurke: I keep telling you, there's no other woman! Apollo: Fine, then let's see it. What are you hiding up your sleeve? Dhurke: ...It's just this. Satisfied? Apollo: Huh? But that's the pendant we found in Amara's Tomb... Dhurke: See? I wasn't trying to hide anything. Apollo: (...Then why did he tense up?) Dhurke, let me take a look at that. Dhurke: Ah! Apollo: .........Hey, what's this button for? *click* Apollo: Whoa! I-It's...! Athena: It's a picture of Dhurke and some lady! And she's really young-looking, too! Mon Dieu! Are you into younger women, Dhurke?! Apollo: Heh heh. Dhurke, you old dog, you. You got yourself a younger lover. Dhurke: Will you stop with this nonsense! This is Amara before she died. If you look closer, you'll see that I was younger, too. Apollo: Hey, you're right. Athena: Aww. That's no fun. Apollo: ...Wait a second. Haven't we seen this woman before? Athena: .........Now that you mention it...! Apollo: Isn't this woman the same as the one in the pendant's photo? Present Woman's Photo Apollo: Leads to: \"The woman in the pendant is also the one in this photo.\" Present anything else Apollo: Athena: Apollo... I don't see how that has anything to do with the woman in the pendant's photo. Dhurke: Have you had your eyes checked lately, son? Apollo: (I'm wrong, not blind! Maybe I should compare the pendant's photo against the evidence again.) Dhurke, I know I've seen the woman in the pendant's photo before. Leads back to: Isn't this woman the same as the one in the pendant's photo? Apollo: The woman in the pendant is also the one in this photo. Dhurke: ! A-Apollo, where did you get this? Apollo: From the safe in Inga's room. Phoenix: ...Apollo. If this is Queen Amara, it had to have been taken at least twenty-three years ago. But that's just not possible. Dhurke: ! Apollo: Yeah, I just noticed the same thing. Here's why this photo couldn't be twenty-three years old! Present law book Apollo: Leads to: \"Take a look at the law book. It has the mark of the Defiant Dragons branded on it.\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Dhurke: I don't see how that proves anything. Apollo: Look closer. Doesn't that part look, you know, kinda modern? Athena: Hmm... I don't know about that. Maybe you just don't know what's considered new and hip these days, Apollo. Apollo: Nngh... Dhurke: This photo is at least twenty-three years old. I don't know how you could say otherwise. Apollo: That's where you're wrong, Dhurke. (There's something in this photo that couldn't have existed back then.) Leads back to: \"Here's why this photo couldn't be twenty-three years old!\" Apollo: Take a look at the law book. It has the mark of the Defiant Dragons branded on it. But that mark didn't exist until after you started your revolutionary activities, Dhurke. So, this photo must've been taken AFTER Ga'ran came into power. ...And that didn't happen until AFTER Amara was assassinated. Dhurke: Gnrk! Apollo: ...So then, how could Amara even be in this photo? ...............Wait a second. That would mean that Amara is... ...still alive? Dhurke: Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh! ............Looks like you found me out, son. Apollo: Wait... So it's actually true?! Leads back to Talk options Perceive wrong area Apollo: Apollo: You seem uneasy, Dhurke. Wait... Don't tell me you're ashamed because she's much younger than you?! Dhurke: D-Don't be ridiculous! I'm just getting tense because of your intrusive questions! Anyone would react the same way! Apollo: (Hmm, I guess that's not it... Still, my bracelet reacted... ...so I know he must be hiding something!) Leads back to Talk options Someone dear to Dhurke (after perceiving) Apollo: Dhurke! What do you mean, Amara's still alive?! I thought she'd been assassinated. Dhurke: .........So did I. But it seems she made it out alive, only to be held captive by the Ga'ran regime. Apollo: Why would they do that? Dhurke: When I fled from the law and went underground twenty-three years ago... ...I heard some shocking news from a Defiant Dragons spy. There were rumors of Queen Amara being sighted in the palace. Apollo: And those rumors turned out to be true? Dhurke: Yes. I snuck into the palace to see for myself. She was confined within the grounds, but otherwise, she was as fit as a fiddle. Phoenix: S-So then, the sarcophagus in the tomb... It's empty? Dhurke: Yes. That entire tomb is one big charade. Ga'ran had it built to stage Amara's death. Athena: So we're not going to be cursed by her vengeful spirit? That's a relief. Dhurke: She was being held under virtual house arrest. So I freed her, and we made a run for it. This photo was taken back then. Apollo: (Look at how they're both grinning from ear to ear.) .........Hm? (There's a fingerprint on the metal part. I guess Dhurke must've left it by accident.) Athena: Ooh, Mr. Sahdmadhi! I wanna hear ALL about how you ran away with Queen Amara! Pink Butterfly Pendant updated in the Court Record. On the run with Amara (appears after \"Someone dear to Dhurke\") Apollo: I'm surprised Amara agreed to run away with you. I mean, Ga'ran must've told her that you tried to kill her. Dhurke: I tried to convince her that I wasn't the one who set the blaze. Apollo: And she believed you? Dhurke: She said, and I quote, \"I shall accompany you so I may ascertain the truth myself.\" Heh, she always was a tough one to read. Athena: I bet she was thrilled you came to her rescue, Mr. Sahdmadhi. To be set free by your beloved... It's like something out of a fairy tale. Dhurke: Yeah, well... There was no \"happily ever after\" once Ga'ran's people caught up with us. They took Amara away to who-knows-where. I snuck back into the palace and searched high and low for her, but to no avail. They probably moved her to some remote mountain prison or the like. Apollo: Dhurke, does Nahyuta know about this? Dhurke: He knows she's his true mother. I told him as much. Apollo: Wait... Is that why Nahyuta is following Ga'ran's orders? Dhurke: .........Most likely. Athena: So then, do you think that deep down, he doesn't really want to prosecute you? Dhurke: Well, he's not one to show his feelings. And lately, I've had no idea what he's thinking. Phoenix: Apollo. We need to grill the queen about Amara when we have the chance. Athena: ...Um. I was wondering about something. The little baby the lady's holding... Is that Prosecutor Sahdmadhi? Apollo: Not necessarily. It could just as well be me. After all, we're only one year apart. Athena: I don't know. I mean, the kid in the picture is too cute to be you. Apollo: (...Let's settle this by asking Dhurke himself.) Something important (appears after \"On the run with Amara\", then presenting Woman's Photo) Apollo: So what's this \"something important\" you have to tell me? Dhurke: ........................ Listen son. Even if you manage to prove me innocent tomorrow... ............... ...I... I don't have long to live. Apollo: Huh? ............... Wh-What are you talking about? Dhurke: What I mean is, I can already hear the Twilight Realm calling my name. There is no escaping death now that it has its sights set on me. Apollo: What?! ............I-Is this another one of your jokes? Dhurke: I wish it was. Apollo: Ha... Ha ha ha. You can't fool me, Dhurke. (Hm? That's strange. Why isn't my bracelet reacting?) Dhurke: ............ Phoenix: ...Are you sick? Dhurke: I-It's something like that. Apollo: So you're not joking? Dhurke: .........I'm afraid not, son. Sorry. Apollo: I-Isn't there a cure? Or at least some sort of treatment? Dhurke: Unfortunately not. Not for what I've got. Apollo: If you need some kind of surgery, I'll work hard until I can pay for it! So... Please...! Dhurke: .........It's too late. There's nothing more to be done now. Apollo: B-But you always say, \"A dragon never yields.\" So why are you giving up now? Dhurke: ...Apollo, I'm sorry. I really am. Apollo: ............I don't understand. Why is this happening, Dhurke? Why? Dhurke: ..................Listen, Apollo. I've got a favor to ask of you. Would you keep quiet about this? I don't want my fellow Dragons to find out. They'd lose all hope if they knew I was dying. Would you do that for me? Apollo: ............Of course. (Why is this happening now? Just when I was finally starting to feel like you really are my... I thought that this time, we'd finally... But now...) ...Damn it... Why...? Athena: Apollo... Dhurke: Listen, son. I don't have much longer to live... ...but I'll never let them execute me. Not before I finish what I need to do. Apollo: ...I know, Dhurke. There's no way I'm going to let them prove you guilty. (Before he goes, I'm going to turn back time by righting the wrongs that have been done. I'm going to restore Dhurke's freedom... ...and return a real smile to Nahyuta's face! I'm going to win this case. I just have to!) Dhurke: ...Son. I have one more... big secret. Apollo: What? There's something else you've been hiding from me? Dhurke: I'm afraid I can't tell you what it is. I'd be betraying a certain someone if I did. Apollo: Huh? What's that supposed to mean? Dhurke: .........Forgive me. You'll just have to find out for yourself. That's the only way. Apollo: I don't understand, Dhurke. Dhurke: ..................... Apollo. In court tomorrow... ...you may find yourself faced with a truth that is difficult to accept. But I know you. And I know you can handle the truth, no matter what it turns out to be. I know that because I believe in you. You're my son, after all! Apollo: ...Dhurke. (What is he talking about? Wait... He's not going to reveal that he actually IS the killer, is he?) Phoenix: Looks like we've run out of things to discuss. Apollo? ...Are you okay? Apollo: ...I'm fine. ???: FREE HIM NOW...!!! RELEASE DHURKE...!!! Apollo: What's going on out there? Dhurke: Sounds like the party's getting started without me. Apollo: Huh? Athena: It's coming from the temple. Let's go, Apollo, and take a look! Something important (subsequent times) Apollo: So what's this \"something important\" you have to tell me? Dhurke: ........................ Listen son. Even if you manage to prove me innocent tomorrow... ............... ...I... I don't have long to live. Apollo: Huh? ............... Wh-What are you talking about? Dhurke: What I mean is, I can already hear the Twilight Realm calling my name. There is no escaping death now that it has its sights set on me.

Present Pink Butterfly Pendant or Woman's Photo (after clearing \"Someone dear to Dhurke\" Talk option) Dhurke: Amara... I hope she's doing well. Apollo: I've been wondering, Dhurke... How could a commoner win the heart of a queen anyway? Dhurke: ...Hm? Wait, don't tell me... Have you fallen for Princess Rayfa, son? Apollo: Wait, what?! Athena: ...Apollo. I had no idea you liked your women so young. Apollo: No! I don't! Phoenix: She's barely in her teens. That's just not right, Apollo. Apollo: Listen to me! I never said anything about her! Dhurke: Aww, it's all right son. In a few more years, the age difference won't matter so much. Apollo: Would you guys just stop already?! Woman's Photo (after clearing \"On the run with Amara\" Talk option) Apollo: Dhurke, about the cute little kid in this photo... Is that me? Dhurke: ...Huh? What are you talking about? Apollo: .................. Athena: See? I told you it was Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. Dhurke: Hm? .........Oh, I see. Well, either way, it's not you, son. Apollo: So then... ...if it's Nahyuta, it was taken when he was about a year old, right? And that would mean... ...you ran away with Amara around twenty-two or twenty-three years ago? (Changed from [...you ran away with Amara around 22 or 23 years ago?] in the original release) Dhurke: Hm? .........You're pretty good with numbers, son! Impressive. Apollo: Huh? (What kind of answer is that?) Woman's Photo updated in the Court Record. Dhurke: .........Before you go, son, there is something else I need to tell you. Something important. Apollo: What is it, Dhurke? I've never seen you act so serious before. After clearing \"Something important\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: May 18Tehm'pul Temple Apollo: Wh-Whoa! What IS all this?! Anime cutscene Datz: Ow-ow-oww! Let go, will ya?! Policeman: W-What are they-- Datz: Huh? Well, look at that! The people are coming to take their courts back! Policeman: Don't hold back, men! Arrest them all! Rebel: Dhurke belongs to the people! Give him back! Rebel: Yeaaaaah! Where are you holding him?! Policeman: Quiet down, you! Child: Th-They have my big sister, too! But she didn't do anything wrong! Policeman: Ouch! YOUCH! Stop pulling my hair! Old Man: Release my son! Release him now...!!! Policeman: Aaaagh! Stop that! No biting! Apollo: This... is really something. Phoenix: And it looks like Datz and Mrs. Inmee are leading the charge. ???: ...You unenlightened fools. Do you honestly think this will change anything? Datz: Yuty! ...Why do you keep serving that witch Ga'ran?! Apollo: Ah! (It's...) Hey, Nahyuta! Nahyuta: ! You again? Apollo: What's going on here? Nahyuta: It would appear that the insurgents are fanning the flames of the rebellion. ...But I never thought it would grow so large. However, they will all be under arrest shortly. Reinforcements are almost here. Apollo: They'll be arrested? Just for protesting? Nahyuta: They are aiding and abetting a criminal by seeking his release. Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran, has ordered they be arrested and judged en masse. Apollo: B-But weren't you once a member of the Defiant Dragons, too? How can you go along with this? Nahyuta: ...I am simply following the orders that Her Eminence has handed down. Apollo: No, it can't be as simple as that. Listen, Nahyuta. There's something I want to talk to you about. Hey! You're not getting away this time! We need to talk. Nahyuta: .........*sigh* I see there is no reasoning with you. Very well, then. Speak. Examine Protesters Athena: Look at all these people! They've got the whole temple surrounded. Phoenix: And it looks like Datz is fanning the flames. The police are going to really have their hands full with this many protesters. Apollo: This whole thing is like a powder keg waiting to go off. We should keep our distance for now. Talk Dhurke Apollo: Nahyuta, do you really have to serve as prosecutor on Dhurke's case? I mean, prosecuting your own flesh and blood... It's just not right. Nahyuta: Again with this drivel? Your ethical standards are not the be-all, end-all of the world around you. Apollo: (I'm not getting into another debate with him.) .........Nahyuta, did you know that Dhurke is sick? Nahyuta: What? Apollo: He apparently doesn't have that much longer to live. If found guilty, he probably wouldn't even make it until his execution day. Nahyuta: What are you talking about? Apollo: Knowing this, are you still prepared to send an already dying man to his grave? Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: Well? Nahyuta: ...I... Apollo: Enough with the zen monk act, Nahyuta. Tell me how you really feel. Nahyuta: .........Mr. Justice. Each person is born with a role to fulfill. And I... must fulfill mine. Apollo; Well, I'm not convinced that taking Dhurke to trial is a part of your lot in life. Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: As for why you've been at Ga'ran's every beck and call... ...I think I might have the answer. Amara (appears after \"Dhurke\") Leads to: \"Nahyuta. You know the truth about your mother, don't you?\" Present Dhurke's Law Book Nahyuta: That's... Apollo: The rebels' \"Mark of the Dragon.\" It symbolizes a person's opposition to the Defense Culpability Act. Nahyuta: You seek to argue with me about the legal system? ...If so, you're wasting your breath. Lawyers and prosecutors do not lay down the law; they merely follow it. The laws decreed by our sovereign are absolute. There is no room for debate. Apollo: So \"let it go, and move on,\" right? Why is that your only answer to everything? Apollo: Nahyuta. You know the truth about your mother, don't you? About how the former queen is still alive and being held somewhere. Nahyuta: So Dhurke told you, did he... Yes, it's true. My mother was spirited away to some remote corner of this kingdom... ...to keep her safe from harm. Apollo: Safe from harm? But Dhurke said the Ga'ran regime is holding her captive. Nahyuta: No, they are keeping her safe. Apollo: So you don't know where Amara is being held? Nahyuta: I only know that it is some secluded hideaway where visitors are not allowed. I have heard she leads a simple life, akin to that of monastic disciples. Apollo: (Sure sounds like she's being held captive to me.) Listen, Nahyuta... Aren't you really doing the queen's bidding... ...because she's holding Amara captive? Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: And this whole thing with Dhurke... You know he didn't really kill Inga, don't you? Nahyuta: .................. Apollo: Dhurke doesn't have much longer to live, so I want to help him however I can. This time, it's our turn... Apollo: *sniffle* *hiccup* *hiccup* Nahyuta: You... You could've been killed... But you risked your life... to save us... Why...? Dhurke: What a silly question. What father wouldn't risk his life to save his own children? Nahyuta, Apollo... Don't you ever hesitate to call when you need me. Understand? Apollo: It's our turn to help Dhurke however we can. Nahyuta: .................. .................. .........What you speak of... is futile. Apollo: ! Nahyuta: .........Let it go, and move on. The guilty verdict... The hopelessness... You must resign yourself to it all. Clinging to false hope now will only serve to magnify your future despair. So let it go... and move on... Apollo: ...Nahyuta. (Are you really going to just roll over on this?) Nahyuta: ...I've no more time for idle chatter. I must prepare for tomorrow's trial. Now, if you'll excuse me... Apollo: ......... Athena: Apollo. I sensed a whirlpool of emotions coming from within Prosecutor Sahdmadhi just now. Anger, shock, bewilderment... ...and an icy sorrow, as deep and dark as an abyss. Apollo: Yeah, I picked up on that, too. Looks like Dhurke really won't be the only one who will need my help tomorrow. Phoenix: ...I think it's about time to pay Queen Ga'ran another visit... ...and ask her about her sister Amara. Talk Any ideas? Athena: I didn't know Dhurke was sick. What's wrong with him? I mean, he looked fine to me. Apollo: ...I really don't know. The Dhurke I remember would go out hunting in the middle of winter... ...while everyone around him was dropping like flies with the flu and whatnot. Athena: ............... Apollo: .................. Phoenix: ........................ Apollo: .........Come on everyone, cheer up! The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles, right? Phoenix: ...Apollo, you don't have to put on a brave face for-- Apollo: No! I'm fine! Besides, Dhurke will have his day in court. I won't let this get me down. What to do Athena: So you don't know Queen Amara at all, Apollo? I thought that since you used to live with Dhurke, that maybe you had met her. Apollo: Dhurke escaped with Amara twenty-three or so years ago, so I was still just an infant. Even if I had met her, I wouldn't have remembered it. Athena: I guess not. But that means you may have been cared for by a queen. And if you had been, then... Apollo: Th-Then what? Athena: You would've turned out... I don't know... better? Apollo: Wh-What's that supposed to mean? May 18Ga'ran Palace - Audience Chamber Phoenix: Hm? The royal guard isn't around. ???: That is utter... utter... hooey! You cannot continue to deceive the people like that! ???: ...Rayfa. Justice is much more than simply speaking the truth. Apollo: Is that Princess Rayfa and Queen Ga'ran over there? Rayfa: Y-You deceived me, too, Mother! How can I ever believe a word you say again?! You... You... nincompoop! .........Ah. Phoenix: Your Benevolence... ...I, uh, couldn't help but overhear... Rayfa: Nnnnnnnnnnnngh... You impudent--!! *ka-tonk!* Phoenix: Oww!!! Apollo: Are you okay, Mr. Wright? I can't believe she actually punched you... Phoenix: ...Yeah, I'm used to it by now. Athena: What's the matter with the princess? Apollo: It sounded like she was arguing with her mother. Phoenix: .........Maybe it has something to do with this picture. Rayfa said she had to ask her mother about some secret or another as soon as she saw it. Apollo: So then... ...does that mean that Princess Rayfa knows what really happened? That Amara wasn't assassinated, and is still very much alive? Phoenix: It would seem so. And she doesn't seem to be taking Ga'ran's lies very well. But that's no surprise, considering how much Rayfa reveres her mother. Athena: That would definitely cause her a great deal of anguish and sadness. ???: Eavesdropping, are we? How very rude. Ga'ran: Hm? You there. Are you not Dhurke's son? Apollo: Oh, um, nice to meet you, Your Eminence. We're actually here to speak with you, if you could spare a moment. Examine Throne Apollo: ............ Phoenix: Apollo? What are you doing? This is the queen's audience chamber. You can't snoop around in here. Apollo: Oh, right. Sorry! (I wonder what it'd be like to sit there with Athena and Mr. Wright groveling at my feet... No! Stop! I can't let myself think about that sort of thing!) Talk Amara's alive? Apollo: Your Eminence, Dhurke told me about Amara. About how she's still alive, that is. Ga'ran: ...We know not of what you speak. Apollo: After Dhurke learned Amara was still alive, he rescued her, and they ran off together. But she was captured and remains captive in a secret location to this day. As for Nahyuta doing your bidding, it's only because Amara's life's in your hands. Ga'ran: Ho ho ho. What an active imagination you have. Royal Guard: Ha ha ha ha ha ha! A lawyer AND a comedian! How droll! Apollo: (Wh-Whoa. Where'd THEY come from? Anyway! If she's going to play dumb, I'll just have to jog her memory with some evidence!) Amara's alive? (subsequent times) Apollo: Your Eminence, Dhurke told me about Amara. About how she's still alive, that is. Ga'ran: ...We know not of what you speak. Apollo: After Dhurke learned Amara was still alive, he rescued her, and they ran off together. But she was captured and remains captive in a secret location to this day. As for Nahyuta doing your bidding, it's only because Amara's life's in your hands. Ga'ran: Ho ho ho. What an active imagination you have. Royal Guard: Ha ha ha ha ha ha! A lawyer AND a comedian! How droll! Apollo: (Argh! If she's going to play dumb, I'll just have to jog her memory with some evidence!) Amara's alive! (appears after \"Amara's alive?\", then presenting Woman's Photo) Apollo: So then, you admit that Amara's still alive? Ga'ran: .........Yes. She is under our protection in a safe location. Apollo: (I think you mean \"being held prisoner.\") ...And where is she being kept? Ga'ran: Ho ho ho. Now why would we tell the son of a traitor that? Apollo: (Guess she has a point there.) Ga'ran: Now, heed our warning, Horned Devil. It would not be wise to inform the people that Amara yet lives. It would only serve to plunge public order into chaos. Apollo: I have no intention of doing that. (Besides, there are real terrorists out there who might try to kill her.) Ga'ran: ...Good. Now, there was something we have been meaning to ask you. Do you know what has become of the Founder's Orb? The Founder's Orb (appears after \"Amara's alive!\") Leads to: \"The Founder's Orb went missing after Dhurke took it into the tomb.\" Present Attorney's Badge Ga'ran: What have we here? Apollo: It's the attorney's badge used by lawyers like me back home. Ga'ran: Well, in this country, lawyers are a loathsome breed. And we would advise you not to needlessly advertise your place among their ranks. For even now, the bad karma Dhurke has engendered brings woe to your kind. It is a simple matter of cause and effect. Apollo: (Yeah, an effect you caused by enacting the Defense Culpability Act.) Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Ga'ran: His own ill will was visited upon him. So it is within the cycle of karma. Others might call it divine retribution -- the punishment of the gods. Apollo: You don't seem particularly sad, even though it was your own husband. Ga'ran: We were betrayed by the man we had called husband. Moreover, we are the Grand Priestess, summoner of spirits from the Twilight Realm. For us, death is not the end, for we can still speak with those who have passed. Apollo: (I guess being a spirit-channeling queen gives you a different take on life and death.) Woman's Photo (after clearing \"Amara's alive?\" Talk option) Apollo: Your Eminence, I ask that you take a look at this photo. Ga'ran: Why, that's--! Apollo: It's a photo of Amara. And here you can see a law book bearing the mark of the Defiant Dragons. I believe you know what that means. Ga'ran: .................. ..........Very well. Royal guard, stand down. Royal Guard: Yes, Your Eminence! Your wish is our command! Ga'ran: It seems there is no need to perpetuate this charade any longer. We shall speak... of all we know. Dhurke's Law Book Ga'ran: To burn such a mark upon a sacred text of the law... He will surely be visited by what he has wrought. And to think he once called himself a man of the law. Apollo: I think it's just his way of objecting to the DC Act. Ga'ran: Yet that act is but an objection to his falsified evidence. How appalling that even now he recognizes no responsibility and knows no shame. Anything else Apollo: So, I was wondering if... Ga'ran: We have no intention of bestowing any information upon you or any other lawyer. Apollo: (Guess someone doesn't like to play nice with others.) Ga'ran: The Founder's Orb went missing after Dhurke took it into the tomb. As his son, we thought you might know something of its current whereabouts. Apollo: I knew it. I suppose I should thank you for that free running tour of Khura'in. Ga'ran: ...That was the royal guards' own doing. Apollo: (Nice try, lady. But now you're definitely not getting the orb, ever.) Why do you want the orb so badly, anyway? Ga'ran: Because... it would be most dangerous in the wrong hands. It must be recovered. Phoenix: Is the legend true? Can the orb really impart spiritual power? Are you worried that someone could overthrow you with it? Ga'ran: The Holy Mother's power is without equal. Should Her Holiness once again return to our world... ...she could conceivably bestow great power upon the one who unlocked the orb's secret. Phoenix: I guess it makes sense, considering spirit channeling is a fact of life here. Ga'ran: ...So we ask you, Horned Devil. Did you receive the Founder's Orb from Dhurke? Apollo: ...Does it look like I did? Ga'ran: ...So you like to play games, do you? ...Royal guard! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Eminence! Ga'ran: Search this devil, and his belongings! Apollo: What? Royal Guard: At once, Your Eminence! Don't move!!! You're only making this haaaaaarder on yourseeelf!!! Apollo: Yikes! Hey, cut it out! Argh! What the--?! Athena: Eeeeeek! Apollo! Don't strip here! Royal Guard: Stop resisting!!! Just submit to our strip search alreeeeeady!!! Apollo: N-No, wait! Hey! Cut it out! Aaaaaaaaaaaaagh! .................. (Rest in pieces, my poor, tattered dignity.) Royal Guard: There's no sign of the Founder's Orb, Your Eminence! Ga'ran: .........So, you have hidden it somewhere. Heh. No matter. We shall recover it one way or another once you are found guilty of abetting the accused. Apollo: (Dhurke was right. She really is bent on getting the orb.) ???: Mother! Apollo: Looks like the princess is back. Rayfa: I took a stroll to try to calm myself, but... I still find this situation unacceptable. The people must be informed about Queen Amara! Apollo: ! (So she DOES know about that!) Ga'ran: Rayfa, you do not yet possess a clear grasp of how a government and its people interact. There will always be secrets that must be kept from the ignorant masses. Rayfa: You have little faith in our people, Mother. But it is the Royal Priestess's duty to always speak the truth. And as such I cannot remain silent! I will not! Ga'ran: Hah. The truth, you say? Your mind has been poisoned by the Barbed One. Phoenix: It was an honor and a pleasure, Your Eminence. Ga'ran: ...We must speak with our child. It is a mother's duty to discipline her child, after all. Now, if you would excuse us. Apollo: (Discipline? Coming from her, I don't like the sound of that at all...) Phoenix: Well, Apollo, let's head back to the safe house for now. Apollo: Good idea. We need to go over what we've found and collect our thoughts. May 18Former Sahdmadhi Law Offices Edgeworth: ...Ah, you're back. Athena: Thank you for holding down the fort, Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth. Sorry it took so long. Hope you weren't too bored. Edgeworth: ...I watched \"The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm\" while you were gone. And my verdict is... it's an outrage! Especially its theme song. Even worse, the people here believe it's an original, Khura'inese show. Can you believe it! I've already spoke about it at length with Mr. Are'bal here, and he... Apollo: (I'm not sure what he's babbling about, but at least it seems he wasn't bored.) Phoenix: Moving along to things that actually matter... We've gathered about all the information and evidence we can concerning this case. I think it's time we go over everything we've learned so far. Examine Any point of interest Phoenix: ...Apollo. We probably shouldn't search the place while Datz is gone. Besides, we need to go over the case for tomorrow. Athena: What's with you recently? It's like you want to spend every free minute we have snooping. Apollo: (But don't you get the urge to look at everything you can sometimes, too?) Talk About Inga's murder Phoenix: The orb trial... Maya's abduction... And the murder of the mastermind behind it all, Justice Minister Inga... It's a lot to consider. Think you have all the facts straight in your head? Apollo: Yep, I've got it covered, Mr. Wright. It's the truth about what really went down that's going to be the problem. Athena: Yeah, it's like the more we learn about this case, the less we understand. Phoenix: I agree. There's a deep darkness enveloping this case. I'm almost afraid of what we will find once we lift that black veil. Suffice to say, the real killer is certainly waiting underneath. Apollo: (The real killer, huh... Now that's the million dollar question.) Phoenix: Who killed Inga, and why? Think, Apollo. Who would you say had a motive to commit this crime? Apollo: Umm... Athena: I, for one, am drawing a complete blank. Phoenix: I want to know how the killer slipped into the tomb, killed Inga, and slipped back out... ...without ever being seen. That's a bona fide locked-room mystery right there. Apollo: Well, we've collected plenty of evidence and statements. I just hope the rest comes out in court. It'll be a thinner tightrope than usual, that's for sure. Amara's assassination Phoenix: This case has one big fly in the ointment. In order to prove Dhurke completely innocent... ...we'll also have to exonerate him of the crime committed twenty-three years ago. Apollo: Amara's supposed assassination... Athena: Right. We know Amara's still alive... ...but Dhurke could still be charged with plotting to kill her. Apollo: He couldn't discover the truth -- even after over two decades of investigating. So our biggest hurdle is going to be the complete lack of evidence. The fire made sure of that. Athena: Mr. Wright, have you ever won a case without any evidence? Phoenix: No, that's one thing I've never done before. Apollo: A trial unprecedented even in the decorated annals of the Wright Anything Agency... (Still, I can't help but wonder... Was there really no evidence left behind?) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: You flash that badge like a pro now. And with such confidence, too. I can really feel it. Apollo: R-Really? Phoenix: ...Sure. Take Trucy's case, or that civil trial yesterday. You really came into your own during both of them. Apollo: Eheh... Heh heh heh. (I can feel my cheeks betraying me...) Athena: You'd better not be thinking of starting your own firm, Apollo. Apollo: What? No, of course not. (I'm probably not ready for that, anyway.) Pink Butterfly Pendant, Woman's Photo, or Amara's Assassination File Phoenix: Amara... She's still alive. Apollo: But she's basically being held prisoner somewhere. Phoenix: This puts Dhurke at a distinct disadvantage. ...Not to mention us, too. Apollo: And Nahyuta is under Ga'ran's thumb because of all this as well. Phoenix: Yep. It's a problem all right, and it's not like we can just go and rescue Amara. There must be something we can do... Athena: We'll just have to pin our hopes on Dhurke's revolution! Apollo: So, basically, the fates of Amara and Nahyuta... ...depend entirely on our ability to beat the charges against Dhruke tomorrow. Dhurke's Law Book or Dhurke's Badge Phoenix: What would you do if the Defense Culpability Act was established back home? Apollo: What would I do? That's a good question. Athena: What are you worried about, Apollo? You'd always have a job as Trucy's assistant. Apollo: Uh-huh... And what about you, Athena? Couldn't you become a therapist? Athena: Hmm... I don't know if I could do it for a living... Phoenix: I'd probably go back to playing piano. Apollo: ..................... Athena: ............... Phoenix: Hey! What are those looks for?! Anything else Phoenix: Just because you don't know something, doesn't mean that I do, Apollo. That's an important lesson for you to learn. Apollo: (In other words, this didn't ring any bells.) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ...Oh, and we can't forget about the Defense Culpability Act. \"...those who would support criminals will be deemed just as guilty.\" In short, if Dhurke is found guilty, and is sentenced to death... ...we'll likely join him in a very public execution. Apollo: Y-Yeah... Athena: Beat the charges or die... What kind of crazy, upside-down legal system is this, anyway?! Phoenix: ...Don't worry. I can't ask someone as young as you to risk your life, Athena. So tomorrow, it'll just be me and Apollo on the courtroom floor. But you can support us by watching from the gallery. Athena: What?! No... I wanna help! I'm part of the agency, too, after all! Phoenix: ...Sorry, but this is a direct order from your boss. Plus, there's Prosecutor Blackquill to think of. He said he'd use me for sword practice if I put you in harm's way. Athena: Nrrgh... Simon... Well, at least promise me this, you two. Promise me you'll make it back alive! Apollo: Ha... Ha ha... Make it back alive... huh... Phoenix: What's with that face, Apollo? You'll never inspire confidence in your client like that. And it'll play right into the prosecution's hands. Remember, \"the worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles.\" Apollo: You're right! Even when it seems hopeless, or when there's not a shred of evidence to be found... ... we can never let it show on our faces... right? (But will I actually be able to do that tomorrow? When push comes to shove, will I be able to force my biggest smile?) To be continued Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Apollo Justice) Apollo: Nothing particularly interesting here. Area already examined (while playing as Apollo Justice) Apollo: We've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around. Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Phoenix Wright) Phoenix: Nothing particularly interesting here. Area already examined (while playing as Phoenix Wright) Phoenix: I've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around. Nothing to examine during investigation (during chapter \"Apollo's Narrow Escape\", while visiting Bazaar) Apollo: We've gotta find a place to hide!\n-- I'm No Spirit Medium, Sonny --Nayna: I was feeling under the weather yesterday, and decided to rest these weary bones.Press Apollo: Apollo: Ahlbi's dog stole your hat when you were in the courtyard yesterday afternoon. Was it after that that you decided to take a rest? Nayna: I had been feeling unwell all day, and had pushed myself too hard. I kept feeling weak and dizzy, and that dirty mongrel only served to worsen my condition. Apollo: While I sympathize with you, Nayna... ...you took the whole day off without informing Princess Rayfa. She was very worried about you, you know. Nayna: How very kind of Her Benevolence. But she need not concern herself with the welfare of a mere servant such as I. Phoenix: Except, to Rayfa... ...Nayna's not just a \"mere servant.\" Nayna: To even think a mere commoner could channel spirits or slay a minister... What hogwash.Nayna: Besides which, a lowly servant such as I could not possibly be an honorable spirit medium.Press Apollo: Apollo: I hear you are the head servant. Isn't that right? Nayna: Are you suggesting that my position affords me the ability to channel spirits? Apollo: .........Since you're the head servant to a family of channelers, I'd say it's plausible. If you wanted to, it's not impossible for you to learn through exposure. Nayna: ...I think not. For that goes against the very underpinnings of the Kingdom of Khura'in. Ga'ran: To become a spirit medium requires a noble spirit and rigorous training. But most importantly, one must be a direct descendant of the founder. It is not simply some hobby one can take up in the manner of knitting or gardening. Apollo: So commoners could never become a medium, no matter how hard they tried? Nayna: That is common knowledge to all who are born and raised here, young Horn Head.Nayna: Only members of the royal family can learn the art of spirit channeling here in Khura'in.Press Apollo: Apollo: Okay, then... What if you actually have royal blood in your veins, Nayna? Like a distant relative or something? Nayna: I am from a line of humble fishermen, all the way back to my grandfather's grandfather. I've never heard talk of royal blood or noble ancestry. Phoenix: Apollo. If spirit channeling is a secret art passed down from mother to daughter... ...then even with a royal ancestor, it'd be impossible to learn without the right training. Ga'ran: It is as the Barbed One says. It also must be mentioned that this secret art... ...is only taught here in the Kingdom of Khura'in, and your country's Kurain Village. Apollo: (Why aren't things falling into place like I expected...?) Judge: I would ask the witness to continue her testimony.Nayna: After Queen Amara's passing, Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran is the only spirit medium left.Press Apollo: Apollo: ...Queen Amara was the victim of an assassination, right? Nayna: Yes. Oh, she was a beautiful, gentle soul. But she fell in love with a man of dubious origins... ...and was murdered in a terrible blaze. Fate can be so cruel. Apollo: (Except she's actually still alive.) Phoenix: Poor Nayna's yet another follower unwittingly praying over an empty sarcophagus. Apollo: (Amara -- the queen who's been locked away, and her existence in this world, erased. But the fact that she is still alive shackles Nahyuta to Ga'ran's will. Nahyuta... The only reason you're still standing there by that woman's side... ...is because you're afraid of what would happen to Amara otherwise... right?) Ga'ran: We need not recount such ancient history. Let us continue with the witness's testimony.Present Woman's Photo Apollo: Leads to: \"............\"Nayna: If you believe a medium to be the culprit, it would have to be that young lass Maya Fey.Press Apollo: Apollo: Ms. Fey was being held hostage. She was completely tied up, and didn't even know Minister Inga's true name... ...making it impossible for her to kill or channel him! Nayna: Bah, I know nothing of that. Ga'ran: Ga'ran: Listen, you horned devil. Were you not just insisting that it was Maya Fey who had channeled Minister Inga? My, how quickly you change your tune. Apollo: No, I'm just quick on my feet when new information presents itself. (I'm also quick to force my biggest smile when times like these demand it.) Phoenix: It's great that you're following my advice, Apollo... ...but try not to LOOK so forced while you do, would you?Phoenix: Nayna is right about one thing, though. Only those of the royal bloodline can be spirit mediums in Khura'in. Common folk like us are out of luck.Apollo: Yeah, I guess so. (Still... ...I think I'll finally be close to connecting all the dots, once I point one very big thing out.)Apollo: ............ (Okay, so I presented what makes sense in terms of a direct contradiction... ...except I don't know how to make it make sense in the larger context of this case.)Judge: Well? Is the defense going to follow up its loud objection with a sound explanation?Apollo: Oh, um... sorry. How do I put this... I believe there's a problem with Nayna's testimony.Judge: Go on.Apollo: She asserted that she could not possibly be a spirit medium because... ...in Khura'in, only members of the royal family can learn how to channel spirits.Judge: I fail to see the problem in that statement, defense.Apollo: Hold on -- I'm getting to it, Your Magistry. ............ (Nayna stated an absolute falsehood... ...since we know that Amara is still alive. At the same time, circumstantial evidence points to Nayna channeling Inga. After all, just after she entered his private quarters... ...Inga came running out screaming, despite having been killed at 2 PM. That would mean that Nayna channeled Inga... ...even though supposedly, only those of the royal family are capable of doing so. Wait, wait, wait... Is it too late to ask for a refund on my trip down the rabbit hole?) .........Mr. Wright. You may think I've lost my mind with this bluff, but...Phoenix: But?Apollo: But if I can at least establish the possibility... ...I think it'll give us the break we need.Phoenix: .........Wait a sec... Are you going to propose what I think you are...?!Apollo: (Yes. It's a huge risk, but I think there's a chance I can prove it.) Will the court please take a look at this photo?Judge: Hm?Ga'ran: !Nahyuta: Th-That's...!Apollo: This photo's very existence, to say nothing of the person in it... ...contradicts the witness's claim... ...that Queen Ga'ran is the only remaining spirit medium in Khura'in.Ga'ran: Horned Devil! You mustn't...!Apollo: Oh, but I must. Under these circumstances, the outcome of this trial depends on it. But you already knew that, didn't you, Your Eminence?Ga'ran: ............Judge: Will the defense please explain who is shown in the photograph?Apollo: The person in the photo is... the previous queen, Amara Sigatar Khura'in. Contrary to popular belief, she was never assassinated. In fact, she's very much alive.Judge: What?! But that's nonsense!Apollo: Take a good look at the law book in this photo, Your Magistry. The Mark of the Dragon branded on it... ...could only have been placed there after Queen Amara's supposed assassination.Ga'ran: ...Rrrgh!Gallery:Queen Amara's still alive?Has the lawyer gone mad?Judge: .........While I personally find it hard to believe... ...I will allow the defense to continue. You may proceed, defense.Apollo: Queen Amara's death was staged to keep her safe from her would-be killer. Yet, according to Dhurke, she is actually being held captive somewhere. But the real truth is that Queen Amara is not being held in confinement! Rather, she walks freely among us... ...here -- in this very courtroom today!Judge: But how--?!Nahyuta:Nahyuta:  Do not be deceived, Your Magistry. The red pepper is skilled in weaving plausible lies. It is the cunning lawyerly art known as \"bluffing.\" But knowing this, there is no need to fear his forked tongue.Apollo:Apollo: That's where you're wrong, Prosecutor. 'Cause you'll be quaking in YOUR boots soon enough.Nahyuta: ...Is that so?Apollo: (It's my turn, Nahyuta, to wake you up to the truth right before your eyes!) Queen Amara is still very much alive and has been disguising herself as...Present Nayna profile Apollo: Leads to: \"B-But that's...!\"Present anyone else Apollo: Judge: Well, now... You believe this to be Queen Amara in the flesh? Apollo: .........You mean, it's not? Judge: Looks like YOU'RE the one who deserves to be quaking in his boots! Apollo: F-Forgive me, Your Magistry! (So I made a mistake! Yeesh!) Nahyuta: Listen, you putrid-minded lawyer. My mother couldn't possibly be here in this sacred hall. Apollo: That's where you're wrong, Prosecutor. She's here, and I'm going to prove it to you. Leads back to: \"Queen Amara is still very much alive and has been disguising herself as...\"Judge: B-But that's...!Ga'ran: ...Gnrk!Nayna: ...Eek!Apollo: This is the simplest and cleanest explanation for everything we've covered so far. The person who killed Minister Inga... Someone with intimate knowledge of the Divination Séance... The medium who channeled the minister in order to mask the real time of his death... Condense these traits into one person and you get a spirit medium of royal blood. And that person... is none other than you, Nayna!Nayna: !Apollo: Your true identity... ....is the former queen Amara, and the killer we've been looking for all along!Judge: Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaat?!Nahyuta:Nahyuta: Have you finally lost your mind, Mr. Justice? What you say is beyond blasphemous -- even in the depths of hell!Nayna: Oh my, such frightening allegations!Judge: Indeed! And absolutely ludicrous, to boot! Her Eminence Queen Amara yet lives... ...and is actually Ms. Nayna here? You have truly gone off the deep end!Apollo: You don't have to take my word for it. In fact, a certain someone can help me prove it. Your Eminence!Ga'ran: ...............Apollo: If Queen Amara truly is dead... ...you should be able to channel her spirit, right here, right now. Isn't that correct?Ga'ran: ...........................Gnrk. I can... deny it no longer.Apollo: !Nayna: !Ga'ran: The lawyer speaks the truth. Nayna, the woman who stands here before us... ...is Amara, the former queen believed to have perished twenty-three years ago.Nahyuta: P-P-P... Pohl...!Judge: Pohlkunkaaaaaaaaa!Nayna: ............Apollo: ......... (Finally... We've finally got... Inga's real killer on the stand!) Nayna -- no -- Amara Sigatar Khura'in! Please drop the act and tell us what really happened!Nayna: ................................. ............... Oh, dearie me. I guess I shouldn't have underestimated the power of youth. Well done, young Horn Head.Apollo: ! Whoa!Amara: .........*sigh* I was getting tired of masquerading as an old woman, anyway. It has been far too long since I last greeted you, good people of Khura'in. It is I, Amara Sigatar Khura'in, your former queen.Judge: Qu-Qu... Queen Amara?!Nahyuta: Wh-Whaaa--? Ah...... NGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!Apollo: (And I thought Ga'ran's makeover was extreme...)Judge: Can it really be true? You are alive and well?!Amara: It is true. I feel as if I have been called back from the Twilight Realm. I fear I have caused all of you a great deal of distress. O ho ho ho ho.Ga'ran: Amara... I'm sorry I was unable to keep your secret any longer. I hope you can forgive me.Amara: It is quite all right, Ga'ran. I am safe now. For Dhurke, that blackguard who threatened my life, will be re-captured soon enough. I need not conceal my identity any longer.Judge: Qu-Queen Amara! What... What does this all mean?! Were you not killed in that fire twenty-three years ago?Amara: I barely escaped that blaze with my life. But though I survived, I knew that scoundrel would make further attempts on my life. Therefore, I staged my death and abdicated the throne to my dear younger sister, Ga'ran.Judge: B-But the building of that great tomb...! A-And disguising yourself as a lowly servant! Why would you do such a thing?!Amara: ...Ga'ran. I would have you explain.Ga'ran: I wished for her to be close at hand. It was the only way I felt I could protect her. And it was the best way to hide her from the eyes of the public. After all, who could conceive of Amara lowering her station to that of a servant?Phoenix: She's got that right. Even Dhurke thought Amara was being held captive in some far-off place.Apollo: He never even guessed she was living as a servant, right in plain sight.Amara: I must say, a life dedicated to the servitude of others is not the least bit disagreeable. It is a quiet, humble existence -- far removed from the tedium of regal duties. Ah... But those days of peace have ended. And it's all because of you... Horn Head.Apollo: You should consider yourself lucky if that's all this ends with.Amara: If there is something you wish to say, then say it.Apollo: It doesn't matter who you are, you won't escape the crime you committed. The defense... moves to indict you as Justice Minister Inga's real killer!Amara: !Judge: What's this?! You would accuse Queen Amara of homicide?! A grand priestess of Khura'inism?! Y-You can't do that! Sh-She's... virtually a goddess in the eyes of her people!Apollo: If you commit the crime, you'd better be ready to do the time. Be you a priest, saint, queen, or god.Judge: I-I've... never met such an egalitarian person...Apollo: Queen Amara. In your years disguised as Nayna, you would have learned about Minister Inga's disorder. So you knew you could dress in Dhurke's clothes to forge a convincing Séance vision. Isn't that right?Amara: ...O ho ho ho ho. What a curious character you are. You would label me a murderer? Me -- the one who the people regarded as the reincarnation of the Holy Mother herself?Apollo: You may be a grand figure in Khura'inism... ...but as a foreigner, you're just another suspect to me.Amara: ......... .........It would appear your words are not in jest. Am I to suffer the sullying of my good name with accusations of murder most foul? ...............Judge: P-Please, Queen Amara! Forgive his impudence! The lawyer knows not what he speaks!Amara: .........Fear not, Good Magistry. For this is the sacred Hall of Justice. Though I am a grand priestess, on this stand I am but a witness like any other. I shall face his accusations with grace and benevolence.Judge: Your compassion overfloweth, Your Mercifulness.Amara: ...Oh, young lawyer. In my benevolence, I must warn you that your assertion suffers from a tragic flaw.Apollo: Huh? There's a flaw?Amara: Nahyuta.Nahyuta: Y-Yes, Your Mercifulness?Amara: Who was present in the tomb when the murder was discovered?Nahyuta: ...Dhurke Sahdmadhi, Maya Fey, and the victim, Minister Inga. ! .........I see. That is a fatal flaw indeed. It appears Queen Amara couldn't possibly have gone to the tomb as Minister Inga.Apollo: What? Why not?Amara: Do not keep the defense waiting, Nahyuta. Explain how wrong he truly is.Nahyuta: Yes, Your Mercifulness. Her Benevolence, Princess Rayfa saw Minister Inga enter the tomb around 2:30 PM. Yet you, the defense, claim the person she saw... ...was the minister being channeled by Queen Amara. However, if Her Mercifulness had channeled him... ...and moved to the tomb... ...then, once she was done channeling... ...Queen Amara would have re-emerged and been left stuck in the tomb.Apollo: Oh, yeah...Nahyuta: Had she tried to exit before you all arrived... ...Princess Rayfa, who had been looking down upon the courtyard, would have seen her. However, Her Benevolence saw nothing of the sort.Apollo: Urk.Nahyuta: In conclusion, Queen Amara could not have left the tomb without being observed. And yet, was she there in the tomb when the murder was discovered, defense?Apollo: .........N-No. No, she wasn't.Nahyuta: ...Hmph.Amara: Now do you see? Your flimsy claim has been uprooted like a sapling in a flood.Apollo: Nngh......... Aaaaaaaaah!Ga'ran: Well. That was entertaining. Prosecutor Sadhmadhi. Assume the prosecution of this case and clear your mother's good name.Nahyuta: You wish for me to take over?Ga'ran: Yes. Prosecute your father to save your mother. Heh heh heh. What a poignant fate you bear, but bear it you must. Are you ready?Nahyuta: ...Yes, Your Eminence!Ga'ran: ...And there you have it, Your Magistry. I shall watch the rest of the proceedings from the sidelines. I relinquish complete control of this sacred hall to your authority once more.Judge: Wh-Why, thank you, Your Eminence. Now then, Your Mercifulness. Your testimony, if you please.Witness Testimony-- The Laywer's Theory Is Absurd --Amara: Now I shall destroy your utterly absurd and barbarous theory. I was not anywhere near the tomb following the murder. Were your theory correct, I would have been in the tomb once I had stopped channeling. My husband Dhurke is the killer, but he has fled from this sacred hall. May the Holy Mother rain judgment upon the traitor Dhurke Sahdmadhi for his crimes.Judge: Oh, such marvelous testimony. You are truly a treasure, Your Mercifulness.Amara: This, too, is but by the grace of Her Holiness. No doubt my unmasking here today was Her will as well.Judge: Oh, my... The Holy Mother, you say?Amara: Yes. Surely Her Holiness has guided me to this witness stand... ...and to the purity of truth!Judge: Oh, how magnificent! Queen Amara, the Holy Mother's messenger here on Earth!Gallery:Praise be for Queen Amara! Blessings! Blessings upon Her Mercifulness!Apollo: (Where did those animals even come from?!)Judge: Now then, the defense may question the witness. But remember, she is a grand priestess, so disrespect will not be tolerated. That means... ...no pointing out conflicts, inconsistencies, or any other flaws in her testimony!Cross-ExaminationCross-Examination-- The Laywer's Theory Is Absurd --Amara: Now I shall destroy your utterly absurd and barbarous theory.Press Apollo: Apollo: My theory is utterly absurd and barbarous? Amara: And high-handed, if I may say so. Nahyuta was right to call you putrid-minded. Surely even the monkeys of Mt. Poniponi's holy waterfalls could devise a better theory. Apollo: (Surely you can steal better insults than \"Nahyuta's Best\"...) Amara: Now then, to all of you gathered in this sacred hall... need I remind you?Amara: I was not anywhere near the tomb following the murder.Press Apollo: Apollo: Well, maybe... you were hiding inside the sarcophagus. After all, it DOES technically belong to you. I bet you'd have no trouble opening it. Amara: If I had been in there, I could not be here today. For the tomb has been under constant surveillance since the murder. I would have never been able to leave. Apollo: (Hmm... I guess not.) Um... If I might ask... What's in that sarcophagus, anyway? You're still alive, so... Amara: ...There is despair, sadness, hatred, and malice. Only one brave enough to see the truth hidden deep within... ...couldl discover the final hope -- my continued corporeality! Apollo: You completely lost me... Phoenix: In other words... it's empty. But no one dared to open it because they were too scared of the curse. Amara: Now, will you dispense with your theory? It is as empty as my sarcophagus.Press (after pressing third and fourth statements, before adding statement) Apollo: Apollo: Well, maybe... you were hiding inside the sarcophagus.

But no one dared to open it because they were too scared of the curse. Amara: Now, will you dispense with your theory? It is as empty as my sarcophagus. Judge: That's quite enough! It's abundantly clear that Queen Amara's testimony is flawless. Amara: Oh ho ho. Do you understand now, lawyer? Apollo: Nnrrrgh. (This is bad. The judge isn't going to let me cross-examine her much longer!) Phoenix: Amara should've been in the tomb after the minister's murder, but she wasn't. I don't get it. Apollo: How did she just vanish from the scene of the crime like that? (It shouldn't be possbile for normal people to...) For... normal people... .........Ah! Maybe...! Phoenix: Maybe what? Apollo: Your Magistry. I think I can explain why Queen Amara wasn't there in the tomb after the murder! Judge: Very well, defense. Do explain. Apollo: I believe it was accomplished through a method only she is capable of. And by using this special method, it would be possible for her to literally disappear. Judge: Well, don't keep us waiting. Let's hear it. How did Queen Amara disappear from the tomb? (Changed from [How did Queen Amara disappear from tomb? [sic]] in the original release) She hid in the sarcophagus Apollo: Maybe she hid in the sarcophagus. Amara: Perhaps next you can explain when and how I was able to escape unseen? After all, the tomb has been under constant surveillance since the murder. Apollo: ...There could be a secret passage beneath that stone coffin. I've seen something like that before at a magic show back home.  Amara: Oh? Then let us shut you in the sarcophagus and see what happens. Nahyuta, would you do the honors? Go ahead and throw away the key as well. Then we can witness his valiant escape through this supposed secret passage. Nahyuta: That sounds wonderfully entertaining. I shall start making the preparations at once. Apollo: Apollo: ...You know what? I think I might have made a mistake there.  Judge: Don't even think about trying to escape from your mistake, defense. Now then, I will ask the defense again... Leads back to: \"How did Queen Amara disappear from the tomb?\" She channeled someone Leads to: \"All she had to do was channel someone.\" She clung to the ceiling Apollo: Queen Amara must've clung to the ceiling. Yes, she was hanging off of it like one of Datz's dried geckos! Amara: ......... Judge: ......... Ga'ran: ......... Apollo: W-Was it something I said?

Leads back to: \"How did Queen Amara disappear from the tomb?\" Apollo: All she had to do was channel someone. Then she could easily disappear from the scene of the crime. After all, she would literally be someone else. Judge: Why, I believe that actually makes sense! Apollo: What do you have to say to that, Queen Amara?! Amara: ..................You believe that I, a grand priestess... ...would use the sacred power of spirit channeling to commit murder? .................. Apollo: ! (Wh-Wh-What the--?!)

Amara: ............No, Good Magistry. It is quite all right. Khura'inism also teaches that we must respond at all times with reasoned principle. Therefore, I shall offer a measured response to his blasphemous accusation. Apollo: ...You have something to counter with? Amara: Indeed. Now, are you listening? It would not have been possible to simply vanish by means of spirit channeling. After all, it would require a deceased person to channel. However, there was only one murder victim in the tomb. And that was Minister Inga. The only others there right after his murder... ...were Dhurke and Ms. Fey. Apollo: Ah... Amara: Had I channeled Inga as you allege... ...well, the outcome would have been quite odd to say the least. For there beside the dead minister, a living, breathing one would have appeared! Even if I had been in the tomb, there was no one to channel except the deceased minister. So, you see, I could not have vanished by means of spirit channeling. Apollo: Gnrk!

Judge: How dare you compare Her Mercifulness to a mere gecko?! Apollo: S-Sorry! Judge: Now then, I will ask the defense again... Leads back to: \"How did Queen Amara disappear from the tomb?\" Apollo: All she had to do was channel someone. Then she could easily disappear from the scene of the crime. After all, she would literally be someone else. Judge: Why, I believe that actually makes sense! Apollo: What do you have to say to that, Queen Amara?! Amara: ..................You believe that I, a grand priestess... ...would use the sacred power of spirit channeling to commit murder? .................. Apollo: ! (Wh-Wh-What the--?!) Judge: E-Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek! Mercy, Your Mercifulness! H-How dare you spew such... vile blasphemy, defense! You will retract your last statement, or face immediate execution! Apollo: ......... Amara: ............No, Good Magistry. It is quite all right. Khura'inism also teaches that we must respond at all times with reasoned principle. Therefore, I shall offer a measured response to his blasphemous accusation. Apollo: ...You have something to counter with? Amara: Indeed. Now, are you listening? It would not have been possible to simply vanish by means of spirit channeling. After all, it would require a deceased person to channel. However, there was only one murder victim in the tomb. And that was Minister Inga. The only others there right after his murder... ...were Dhurke and Ms. Fey. Apollo: Ah... Amara: Had I channeled Inga as you allege... ...well, the outcome would have been quite odd to say the least. For there beside the dead minister, a living, breathing one would have appeared! Even if I had been in the tomb, there was no one to channel except the deceased minister. So, you see, I could not have vanished by means of spirit channeling. Apollo: Gnrk! (That's true, but... ...I can't rule it out yet. Because... Well...) .........What if there WAS another victim? Someone we haven't identified yet. Amara: How absurd. Apollo: If you channeled someone other than Minister Inga... ...you could have used their identity to disappear from the tomb. Amara: ......... Phoenix: Another... victim? Apollo: ...Queen Amara. Please add your last statement to your testimony. (This could explain everything. Wasn't there some sign of another victim there in the tomb? And yet... why do I sense I'm not going to like what I'm about to find out?) Adds statement \"Minister Inga was the sole victim. There was no other spirit to channel until he was dead.\"Amara: May the Holy Mother rain judgment upon the traitor Dhurke Sahdmadhi for his crimes.Press Apollo: Apollo: The Holy Mother is going to judge him? Amara: Within the doctrines of Khura'inism... ...we are taught that, upon death, the Holy Mother shall judge our souls. To those of pure spirit, Her Holiness shall be as warm and merciful as the sun. But to those of depravity, Her wrath shall echo that of an angry mother to her child. Apollo: ...An angry mother? I wasn't expecting the founder's judgment to be so... down-to-earth. Amara: The scriptures of Khura'inism were the first in the world to be written such that... ...they would be accessible to worshippers of all ages! Apollo: Wow, that's... unexpectedly progressive...!Before adding statement Apollo: I guess she's going to keep on claiming Dhurke's the killer until she's blue in the face. Phoenix: You'll have to find a hole in her testimony if you want to turn this thing around. Apollo: (If I ever needed a ghost of a chance, it's now.)After adding statement Phoenix: So, Amara is claiming that Inga was the sole victim... ...which fits pretty well with what we know. Apollo: But was he REALLY the only one? Phoenix: What do you mean? Apollo: (Wasn't there evidence of another victim besides Inga? Someone that we've yet to discover...?)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Trucy Wright\nDescription: A particular set of circumstances led to her being adopted by Mr. Wright.

Rayfa actor: Aaah! Why me?! Dhurke actor: Mwahahahaha! It's time for a revolution! Rayfa actor: No! Let go of me! Plumed Punisher actor: That's far enough! Dhurke actor: Who's there?! Plumed Punisher actor: It is I-- The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm! Dhurke: Good people of Khura'in, we can't allow things to go on like this. The Defense Culpability Act has done nothing but produce countless victims of wrongful convictions. The time to act is now. For we, the Defiant Dragons, have obtained the ultimate weapon: the Founder's Orb! And to the Ga'ran regime: Make no mistake about it-- I will personally dethrone you! A dragon never yields. Nor will he rest until his revolution is complete. May 16, 11:00 AMWright Anything Agency TV: ...And this concludes our report on the recent television hijacking in Khura'in. But really, who could have anticipated a surprising turn of events? Trucy: Did you hear that, Polly? Someone hijacked the airwaves over there! It's like something out of a movie! Apollo: ......... Trucy: Apollo? Apollo: ......Um, yeah. Dhurke... What are you up to this time? Trucy: Wait a second... Do you know the TV hijacker or something, Apollo? Apollo: ......You could say that... but it was a long time ago. Trucy: ...And WHY do you know someone like that? I mean, they're calling him an \"insurgent.\" Apollo: Y-Yeah, about that... ???: Hey now. Is that any way to talk about the man who raised you? Apollo: Huh? Dhurke: Hey there, Apollo! Long time no see! How've you been, son? Apollo: I-I-It's-- Trucy: It's that guy that was on TV! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Guilty as charged! Surprised to see me, Apollo? I just beamed in from Khura'in, and boy are my arms tired! Apollo: Th-Th-This can't be happening! ...I must be dreaming... or hallucinating... or both... Trucy: No, you're not, Apollo! It's that TV hijacker-slash-insurgent in the flesh! Apollo: ........ (I'm so confused.) Trucy: Um! Mr. Hijacker! Sir! I have SO many questions, I don't even know where to begin! But let's start with that bit about \"the man who raised you.\" Dhurke: Wait, don't tell me you haven't told anyone about me, son? It's okay to brag about it. Tell everyone your old man's me, the rebel Dhurke! I mean, my face is all over TV these days! I'm practically a celebrity, hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: .........Trucy, what do you say we close up early today? Trucy: What?! Why?! Dhurke: ...Aw, come on, son. No need for the cold shoulder! Apollo: ......... (*sigh* I know I'm going to regret this, but...) What do you want, Dhurke? You just show up here without warning after all this time... What gives? Dhurke: I came all this way to see you, son! Come, rejoice! Apollo: Riiight... Why don't you tell me the real reason you're here. Dhurke: W-Well... Okay, so maybe there's a little something I need your help with, too, but... The fact is I came here to see you. That's the honest truth. Apollo: Yes, I think we've established that. (It figures... I haven't seen him in ten plus years and he's already asking for a favor. He really is a rebel in the purest sense -- he just does whatever he pleases.) Trucy: C'mon, Polly! I need details. Inquiring minds want to know! Apollo: Okay, okay. Hold your horses. First, I've got a few questions of my own. Examine Bookshelf Dhurke: Hm? Why, this is Apollo's journal. Apollo: Huh?! What's it doing at the office? Trucy: It's magic! Dhurke: Let's see what he wrote... Apollo: N-No, don't! Dhurke: Huh... There's nothing in here. Apollo: What? Trucy: This calls for a special spell! Presto diario! Dhurke: Why, there's writing appearing right before my very eyes! Trucy: Like I said, it's magic! Now go ahead, read to your heart's content! Apollo: Wow! ...Er, I mean, give me that! Charley the plant Apollo: That's Charley the houseplant. Dhurke: You know, my hideout used to have a houseplant, too. We called it \"Apollo.\" Trucy: I bet it was a cactus! Dhurke: How'd you guess? Trucy: Because Polly's hair's just as spiny! Apollo: Hey, leave my hair out of this. Trucy: And he has a prickly attitude, to boot! Apollo: (I better quit while I'm ahead.) Hula hoop Dhurke: More magic props... Oh! I've seen a ring like this before! I used to be quite good with these. Apollo: Really? Why don't you show us? Dhurke: Well, if you insist! I'll show you the act of daring-do I used to perform to supplement my income. First, I have to light the ring on fire, then I'll jump through it... Apollo: That's a fire hoop, this is a kid's toy, Dhurke... Magic props Dhurke: This is one seriously cluttered office. I mean, do you really need a piano here? Trucy: Well, it has sentimental value for Daddy, you see... Apollo: Yeah, but this office could use a little help with its bottom line. What if we sold it? Trucy: Apollo! ...You'd better give me a cut of the proceeds when you do. Dhurke: Money before memories, eh? This office's finances really must be in dire straits then. Magic split box Dhurke: This is one of those contraptions for cutting people into pieces! Trucy: How did you know that, Mr. Dhurke? Dhurke: Well, it just so happens I've been in one of these myself. Apollo: Really? Trucy: You have? Dhurke: Yes. Once, when I was being held prisoner by Minister Inga's secret police... ...they tried to torture me into revealing one of my compatriot's hideouts. Apollo: That's a torture device, this is a magic prop, Dhurke... Dhurke: Man, I barely escaped that thing alive! Trucy: Well, you have my respect as a magician for your death-defying spirit! Table Dhurke: What's with this bright red jacket? Who would wear such a garish thing? Trucy: Maybe one of our clients forgot it here. Dhurke: I'd love to get a look at the man who'd dare wear something like this! Trucy: Me, too! Apollo: (I know I don't wear it much, but... she has to know it's mine, right?) Talk Dhurke Dhurke: Pleased to meet you, little lady. My name is Dhurke Sahdmadhi. I'm a... well... a rebel by trade. Trucy: A rebel? But on TV, they were calling you an insurgent. So which is it? Personally, I vote for a rebel with a cause -- a real \"head\"-ache for anyone in your way! Apollo: Trucy...! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! You got me there. I'm the head of a resistance group. The Defiant Dragons. We're like the good, the bad, and the ugly... but without the good part. In Khura'in, I'm like the bogeyman -- a tall tale parents use to spook their kids straight! Trucy: That's too bad. You seem like you'd be a fun, cool guy to hang with! Dhurke: ...This little lady's a real catch, son. I'm talking bride material, if you get my drift. Apollo: Wait, what? Trucy: Oh! Stop it! You're embarrassing me... Dad. Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha. She's a plucky one, all right! Apollo: Someone pluck me out of my misery... Trucy: Now, about that \"man who raised you\" business... Foster father (appears after \"Dhurke\") Trucy: What did Mr. Dhurke mean when he said that he's \"the man who raised you,\" Apollo? Apollo: The truth is, I grew up in the Kingdom of Khura'in. Did I, uh... never mention that? Trucy: Oh, so you grew up in... Khura'in?! Wait, are you saying... ...you're not from around here, Polly? Apollo: No, it's just I was raised in Khura'in when I was really little. Trucy: Still, that's a shocker. It's like I hardly know anything about you! How come you never told me?! Dhurke: ...Apollo. You really haven't said a word about your past, have you? Apollo: What, that I was raised by a wanted criminal? It's like a bad joke. Trucy: It does sound rather melodramatic. I doubt anyone would even believe you. So you two haven't seen each other in a while, huh? Apollo: You could say that. I'd wager it's been at least ten years. Trucy: Wow... That's a really long time. Apollo: Yeah, well, I figured he'd forgotten about me. Dhurke: Not a chance! It's just, well... Starting a revolution takes time, and keeping it going even more so... And being a wanted man, I couldn't just hop a plane to come say hello. Apollo: ...I get it. It's fine. (Though, truth be told... ...it's weird having Dhurke suddenly show up acting all paternal. I'd even almost forgotten about Khura'in... No, that's not true. I probably tried to forget about it on purpose.) Trucy: Now then, Mr. Dhurke, what is it we can help you with? Request (appears after \"Foster father\") Dhurke: I need to get my hand on the Founder's Orb, the most sacred treasure of Khura'in. That's where you come in. Apollo: The Founder's Orb? Trucy: Wait, but didn't you say you already have it in that broadcast of yours? Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Don't go believing everything you see on TV, little lady. No one's seen hide nor hair of the Founder's Orb for some time. Trucy: No way! Apollo: S-So that was just a bluff...? What are you going to do if you DON'T find it? Dhurke: I don't know. Guess that just means we HAVE to find it, son. 'Cause I can't really back down now, can I? Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (*sigh* Different year, same old Dhurke. It's all coming back to me now.) Hold on. I think I read something about this in the newspaper a while back. Something about you stealing a sacred treasure from a temple's treasure room. Dhurke: That's a load of crock. We didn't lay a finger on the orb. Apollo: Really? Dhurke: Yes, Baseless allegations, all of it. Our enemy has really found a way to keep us all on our toes. Trucy: Ooh! So it's like a setup! Dhurke: That's the long and short of it. However, my compatriot has been hot on the orb's trail. And just the other day, his hard work finally paid off. We now know the Founder's Orb is in... Kurain Village. Apollo: Kurain Village? Dhurke: Yes. I hear there are spirit mediums there. They even have direct relations with Khura'in. Apollo: Spirit mediums... Right... Dhurke: Some doctor of archeology there supposedly has the orb. His name is Archie Buff. My Defiant Dragon compatriot has already made contact with him. Apparently, someone asked the doctor to study the orb. Apollo: So whoever asked him to do that is the real thief? Dhurke: Most likely. Apollo: And you think this guy will just hand the orb over to you? Dhurke: My compatriot, Datz, says Dr. Buff has already promised to do so. It seems he knew it was stolen, and wanted to do the right thing. Apollo: (Datz... I remember running around him when I was a kid.) (So he's here, too, huh.) Dhurke: Apollo, I want you to be present as my lawyer when I take possession of the orb. Would you do that for me? Fine Leads to: \".........Fine, but I'll charge my standard fee.\" Nope Apollo: I haven't seen you in years, and you waltz in here asking for a favor? You have a lot of nerve, you know-- Trucy: Of course we'll help! Right, Apollo?! Apollo: W-Wait, Trucy...! Trucy: Oh, come on. It's not like you have any work anyway. Besides, we're talking about rebels and legendary treasure here. It'll be fun! Apollo: (*sigh* Why is she always into the things I'm not?) Leads to: \".........Fine, but I'll charge my standard fee.\" Apollo: .........Fine, but I'll charge my standard fee. Now tell me about the Founder's Orb. The Founder's Orb (appears after \"Request\") Apollo: If I remember correctly, the founder is always depicted as a faceless spirit medium. Trucy: What do you mean \"faceless\"? Dhurke: Images of the founder, the Holy Mother of Khura'in, never show her face. To depict it is to commit the greatest taboo in Khura'inism. Apollo: The greatest taboo, huh? (I wonder why? I mean, what could she have looked like to make them hide her face like that? Dhurke: As for the Founder's Orb, it was discovered during an excavation eight years ago... ...and has an interesting legend that goes along with it. It's said that there's a riddle to the orb, and that any who can solve it... ...will receive immense spiritual power from the founder herself. Apollo: Sounds like one big fairy tale to me. Dhurke: In any case... ...it's just what us Defiant Dragons need to get our revolution started. With it, we can gain the spiritual power, and thus, the legal authority to rule Khura'in! Apollo: Wait, suppose I believe this legend. Then, anyone could become king or queen? And THAT'S why you think it'll help you overthrow the Gar'an regime? Dhurke: Only the rulers of Khura'in have ever laid eyes on the orb, Apollo. A legendary treasure that bestows immense spiritual power... Doesn't that sound like something you'd want to see with your own two eyes? Apollo: (...That does sound just a tiny bit intriguing.) Founder's Orb added to the Court Record. Dhurke: That should just about cover everything. Any other questions? Apollo: Not right now. Dhurke: Ah, I almost forgot. I brought you a present. Eat up, son! Apollo: ...Sushi? Dhurke: I figured you probably couldn't afford three square meals a day, so... Trucy: Yay! I was just thinking it was time for lunch! Dhurke: You dig in, too, little lady. After all, we're practically family, right?! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Trucy: Thanks, Dad! Ooh, that tuna looks good! *chomp* *nom nom nom* Dhurke: This salmon sushi's got my name on it! *chomp* *chew chew chew* Aren't you hungry, son? This is some of the best sushi you'll ever have! Apollo: .........I'm... I'm good. Dhurke: O-Oh, well... Okay then. ...Actually, I have one more present for you. Here. Apollo: What's this? Dhurke: A picture of your father. It's been twenty-three years since he passed away. Apollo: Huh?! This... This is my father? Dhurke: His name was Jove Justice. Apollo: Jove... Dhurke: I haven't talked to you about your real father in some time, but as you know... ...he was a musician -- a wandering minstrel, if you will -- and a talented one at that. Apollo: ............ Why... Why are you giving this to me now? Dhurke: I thought it was sad you didn't know what your old man looked like. I searched high and low to find that one picture. Apollo: ............ Trucy: What's wrong, Apollo? Don't you want it? Apollo: (I don't know. I mean, it's not like I ever met the guy.) Dhurke: Well, I went through all the trouble of finding it, so go on, take it! And don't ever let it go, you hear? Photo of My Father added to the Court Record. Dhurke: Well, now that our bellies are full, what do you say we hit the road? Apollo: One second. Hey, Trucy, any idea where Athena is? Trucy: She left early this morning to pick up Daddy from the airport. Apollo: Oh, I almost forgot. Mr. Wright is coming back today. Trucy: Yeah... but I wonder why he cut his trip short like that. Anyway, shouldn't they have been back by now? Apollo: Knowing Athena, she probably got lost. Well, there's no point sitting around here waiting. Let's get going. Trucy: I can't wait to see that super mysterious treasure! Dhurke: To Kurain Village, then! The Founder's Orb awaits! The Founder's Orb (subsequent times) Apollo: If I remember correctly, the founder is always depicted as a faceless spirit medium. Trucy: What do you mean \"faceless\"? Dhurke: Images of the founder, the Holy Mother of Khura'in, never show her face. To depict it is to commit the greatest taboo in Khura'inism. Apollo: The greatest taboo, huh? (I wonder why? I mean, what could she have looked like to make them hide her face like that? Dhurke: As for the Founder's Orb, it was discovered during an excavation eight years ago... ...and has an interesting legend that goes along with it. It's said that there's a riddle to the orb, and that any who can solve it... ...will receive immense spiritual power from the founder herself. Apollo: Sounds like one big fairy tale to me. Dhurke: In any case... ...it's just what us Defiant Dragons need to get our revolution started. With it, we can gain the spiritual power, and thus, the legal authority to rule Khura'in! Apollo: Wait, suppose I believe this legend. Then, anyone could become king or queen? And THAT'S why you think it'll help you overthrow the Gar'an regime? Dhurke: Only the rulers of Khura'in have ever laid eyes on the orb, Apollo. A legendary treasure that bestows immense spiritual power... Doesn't that sound like something you'd want to see with your own two eyes? Apollo: (...That does sound just a tiny bit intriguing.) Present Attorney's Badge Dhurke: What's that? Apollo: It's my attorney's badge. Dhurke: I can relate. I used to want to show mine off, too. But don't ever show it to anyone in Khura'in. They'll run you right out of town the moment they find out you're a lawyer. Apollo: I wonder how it went for Mr. Wright. Knowing him, he probably flashed his left and right... Founder's Orb Dhurke: The Founder's Orb... They say the Holy Mother will return when the riddle of the orb is solved. And she will bestow great spiritual power upon whoever accomplishes that feat. Apollo: (I wonder if I could channel spirits if I had such power.) Photo of My Father Dhurke: Brings back memories... He was a fine young man. So cheerful and fun to be around. His big, booming singing voice would captivate everyone in the tavern. But looks-wise, he was like a grownup version of you. Apollo: Um, that still doesn't give me a sense of what my real father was like. After clearing \"The Founder's Orb\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency: May 16Kurain Village Apollo: (So this is Kurain, the mystical village of spirit channeling... ... and where ancient traditions come alive. Looks like a really peaceful place.) Dhurke: Ahh, I love the air here! Nothing beats the mountains, huh, Apollo?! Apollo: (Come to think of it... We used to live way up in the mountains, too, just like this.) Dhurke: Sure brings back memories. Those were the days. The three of us living happily in peace. Trucy: ...I still can't wrap my mind around it all, you know. That Mr. Dhurke is not only Polly's daddy, but Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's as well. And the way you two talked about it like it was nothing the whole bus ride here! Apollo: (I guess it IS a lot to take in...) Trucy: So tell me, Mr. Dhurke, what was Apollo like as a kid? Dhurke: Oh, he was full of piss and vinegar, he was. A real rascal! He and Nahyuta used to run around in the open fields, naked as jaybirds. I've even got pictures of him posing in his birthday suit! Apollo: Whoa, whoa, Dhurke! Trucy: No way! Prosecutor Sahdmadhi used to be like that, too? Dhurke: The two of 'em would end up with leeches on their butts and cry like babies, hah-ha ha! Apollo: Dhurke! Don't you think you've said enough?! Dhurke: Aw, you're no fun. Trucy: Yeah! I wanted to hear more about the misadventures of Polly! ???: Hey, what are you people doing here? Apollo: Ema? Dhurke: You know this lady, son? Apollo: Yeah, this is Ema Skye. She's a detective. Ema: Technically speaking, I'm a forensics expert, but I'll let it slide. ...Anyway, I can't say I'm surprised to see you here. You always seem to pop up whenever there's trouble afoot. Still, what are the odds of running into you here in the boonies? Apollo: By \"trouble,\" you mean you're investigating a case? Ema: Does it look like I'm here to sightsee? .........Wait, don't tell me... You're not here to see Dr. Buff, are you? Apollo: Huh? How'd you know that? We're actually on our way to meet with him right now. Ema: Figures... Well, follow me. I'll show you the way. Apollo: ...Really? Dhurke: Don't look a gift horse in the mouth, son. Just follow the nice lady. Examine Phone booth Apollo: (A phone booth and a bus stop made of wood. They both look really old. You hardly ever see phone booths in the city anymore.) Dhurke: Apollo... what's this glass box for? Apollo: (I guess you hardly see them in Khura'in, too.) Kurain Boulder Apollo: There's a big boulder towering into the sky over there. According to the sign, it's called the \"Kurain Boulder.\" It also says that a spirit dwells within it. Hmm... A rock with a spirit in it? Dhurke: It's called animism -- the belief that spirits dwell within inanimate objects. They've probably enshrined this boulder as a sacred object. Their tradition of worshiping such objects is similar to our tradition in Khura'in. Apollo: I-Interesting... (Who knew Dhurke could make sense every once in a while?) Mountains Dhurke: Seeing those mountains really takes me back. I remember when we used to live high in the mountains to escape from the government. Apollo: So, you don't live there anymore? Dhurke: Nope. I needed a more convenient place to lead the revolution from. But that old mountain hut is still there. Apollo: (Man, I miss that hut...) Dhurke: What, are you getting homesick, Apollo? You can come on back to Khura'in anytime, you know? Apollo: N-No, no, I'm fine. Besides, I've got a lot on my plate here... Fey Manor Apollo: A thatched roof... First time I've ever seen one in real life. Dhurke: It looks just like the traditional thatched roofs they use in Japan. All we need now are some samurai with topknots, a few ninjas, and a cuddly mascot. Apollo: When was the last time you were in Japan? Talk Any ideas? Dhurke: Mass transit and electronic communications... This country's infrastructure is really advanced compared to Khura'in. Apollo: Why don't you see the sights once you have the orb? Dhurke: Well... I guess I could use a break. How about you show me around? Apollo: ...Oh, um, I'll probably be busy with work, so, uh... Dhurke: ...I-I see. Trucy: What are you talking about, Polly? Your only work right now is cleaning the office. What to do Dhurke: The Founder's Orb should be with the doctor right now. What do you say we go take a gander? Apollo: What if he doesn't have it? What if you came all the way from Khura'in for nothing? Dhurke: I'll cross that bridge if and when I come to it. Besides... even if I leave empty-handed, at least I got to see you, son. Apollo: ...Oh, ha ha. Thanks? Dhurke: N-No, no -- I really mean it. May 16Kurain Village - Doctor's Study Apollo: So this is Dr. Buff's study... Trucy: Wow, look at all those books! The shelves go from floor to ceiling! It's like a library in here! Dhurke: Yes, and lots of artifacts, too. A true archeologist's paradise. Look, son! There are so many relics, they're spilling onto the floor! What a delightfully amusing room! Apollo: All I see is a mess. (And what's with that white outline...?) ...Um, Ema, where's the doctor? Ema: Well the thing is... he died last night. Apollo: Wait, what? Ema: It seems an avalanche of books knocked him off his bookshelf ladder. We're labeling it an accidental death. Apollo: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Please tell me you're joking... Ema: As if I'd come all the way out here for a few laughs, Apollo. Apollo: ...Yeah, I guess not. Dhurke: A scholar killed by his own books... Apollo: Oh man. What do we do now? I mean, how can he transfer ownership of the orb to you if he's dead? Dhurke: Yes, that is a problem. Apollo: Ema, can you please tell us exactly what happened? Examine Ema: What do you think you're doing? You can't just poke around without my permission. Apollo: (Guess I should ask her what's going on first.) Talk The doctor's death Apollo: So the doctor died in an accident? Ema: I received a call this morning saying Dr. Buff had been found dead under a pile of books. Apollo: This morning? (Talk about bad timing...) You mentioned that he had fallen off a ladder. Ema: Right. We believe he fell from the top of that big ladder there. Apparently, he triggered an avalanche of books while fumbling to reach one. And that sent him headlong on a fatal fall onto the hard floor. Trucy: How sad... Killed by his own books. But at least he was doing something he loved. Dhurke: For a scholar, I suppose it's kind of like a soldier killed in the line of duty. You could say he died an honorable death. Apollo: Ema, who was the first one to discover the body? Ema: About that... Whoever it was, it seems they wanted to remain anonymous. Apollo: What? Ema: It happens now and then. Some people would rather not get involved with the police. Dhurke: I can relate to that. Apollo: (Yeah, being a wanted man and all.) What now, Dhurke? A dead man can't exactly hand over the orb. Dhurke: We'll just have to find it. It must be around here somewhere. Apollo: Just to fill you in, Ema, we're actually here to get something. The Founder's Orb (appears after \"The doctor's death\") Apollo: Pops here had an agreement with the doctor. The doctor was supposed to hand over a sacred relic known as the Founder's Orb. Dhurke: \"P-Pops\"...? Ema: Oh, I see. That could be a problem, considering he's dead. Do you have a plan B? Apollo: Umm... Dhurke: I have an agreement in writing. My compatriot Datz should have it. Ema: Well, there shouldn't be any problems, then. So, who IS this gentleman you're escorting? Dhurke (appears after \"The Founder's Orb\") Leads to: \"Oh, right, I haven't introduced you yet. This is Dhurke. He's from the Kingdom of Khura'in.\" Present Attorney's Badge Ema: Your attorney's badge? Huh... Apollo: What, that normally gets a better reaction from you. Ema: I'm tired of collecting your fingerprints. It's kind of lost its luster. Apollo: Yeah, but who knows? There could be other people's prints on it. Ema: Ooh, that's true! Hand it over, buddy! Apollo: Ah! Ema: ............Hmph. The only prints I found were yours. Apollo: (Argh, it's all dusty now.) Founder's Orb Ema: Scientifically speaking, ancient relics are highly fascinating. Apollo: Why's that? Ema: Because of all the tests I can run. CT scans, electron microscopy, chemical analysis... The list goes on and on! If you ever do find one, you'd better bring it to me straight away! Apollo: Can I count on getting it back intact? Ema: We'll see. Scientific advances don't come without sacrifices, you know. Apollo: (...I know someone who WON'T be seeing the orb anytime soon.) Anything else Ema: You sure like to shove things in people's faces, don't you? Apollo: What about you? You're always dusting around for prints. Ema: That's my job! Apollo: Well, it's not like I'm presenting evidence for the fun of it, either. Ema: Really? Because it sure seems like you enjoy it, Apollo. Apollo: Right back at you, Ema. Apollo: Oh, right, I haven't introduced you yet. This is Dhurke. He's from the Kingdom of Khura'in. Ema: All the way from Khura'in, huh? So, what do you do there? Dhurke: I used to practice law, but I'm taking a break from all that. I'm focused now on making Khura'in a better place through... volunteer work. Ema: Volunteer work, huh? How interesting... Apollo: (...Well, it's not technically a lie.) Ema: So, how do you two know each other? Apollo: Oh, um... He's sorta my foster father. Ema: Come again? Trucy: Yeah! And he's Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's real father, too! Ema: Whaaat?! You mean you... and Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... ............I'm so sorry. It seems you've had quite a life. Apollo: (...Guess she's put a few things together.) Ema: Actually, Dhurke, you look kind of... familiar. Have we met before? Dhurke: Um, not that I recall. Apollo: (Great... She must've seen that news report on TV. It will really complicate things if she figures out he's a wanted man.) There are lots of guys who look like him. Sure you're not mistaking him for someone else? Ema: Are there, really? I mean, a middle-aged man with long hair and an eye patch? You don't see that every day. Apollo: W-Well, I'm sure you're just imagining things. Ema: So what does that sacred relic you're searching for look like? I mean, there's lots of stuff in here that's old and relic-y. Dhurke: Indeed. Unfortunately, I've no idea what it actually looks like. Apollo: So then, how are we supposed to find it? Dhurke: That, I do not know, either. We'll just have to go through each candidate one by one. Apollo: Great plan of attack there, Dhurke. Well, Ema, do you mind if we give this room a once-over? Ema: ...I guess not. But in exchange, you're going to help me in my investigation. Apollo: Sure. It can't hurt. Trucy: Ooh, I can't wait to get started! It'll be like hunting for buried treasure! Examine Body outline or pile of books Apollo: So this is where Dr. Buff died. Ema: Poor man... He fell right on his head, and probably died almost instantly. Apollo: I see some blood on the book there, but what's that dark stain? Ema: It appears to be coffee. It's still damp, so it must have gotten on there recently, perhaps even last night. Dhurke: That's a mighty big window he's next to -- big enough for someone to see inside. Ema: Exactly. That's how the local resident who reported his death found him to begin with. The doctor's body was visible from outside the window. And a passerby called in earlier this morning to report what they'd found. Apollo: So you mean this case is still only a few hours old? Dhurke: That explains why your investigation is just getting underway. Study Photo added to the Court Record. Study Diagram added to the Court Record. Body outline or pile of books (subsequent times) Apollo: So this is where Dr. Buff died. Dhurke: Yeah, the police received a call this morning... ...so their investigation is still just getting started. Glasses Apollo: There's a pair of glasses on this little pyramid here. Ema: They belonged to the doctor. Scientifically speaking, they appear to be your ordinary run-of-the-mill glasses. Trucy: I guess they don't pique her interest, scientifically speaking. Computer Apollo: This PC is password protected. Trucy, you think your magic can do something about this? Trucy: Hmm... I don't think it can override a password. Now, a locked desk... That I can get into. Like yours back at the office, Polly! Apollo: (Yikes... I'd better watch what I put in there.) Trucy: What? Do you put weird stuff in your desk? Stuff you don't want anyone to see? Apollo: Jeez, are you a mind reader, too? Trucy: No, but unlocking your thoughts is a cinch! Ladder or bookshelves Apollo: The doctor fell from the top of that ladder. Dhurke: Hmm... From that height, a fall onto a hard surface would probably kill anyone. Apollo: I don't know why anyone would want to climb that high in the first place. Trucy: Guess you can say he climbed it all the way to heaven... Raincoat Apollo: It's a two-tone raincoat. Dhurke: It's still a bit damp. I think someone might've worn it recently. Shoe shelves Apollo: There are a few pairs of shoes here. I guess there must be an entrance on this floor, too. Ema: Yeah, there's a backdoor over that way. But it's usually locked from what I can tell. The visitor's entrance is up that spiral staircase. Apollo: (That's the way we came in.) Geoglyph Apollo: There are animal drawings on the floor. They look like those famous geoglyph things. Dhurke: They remind me of the chalk outlines detectives draw around bodies. And the doctor's has [sic] just joined them. Now that's what I call dedication to one's field. Apollo: I don't think it was on purpose. Window Apollo: What a huge window. I bet you could see the entire study from the outside. Dhurke: How could he concentrate in here? I'd feel so exposed. Apollo: Well... He does have a bookshelf positioned for some privacy around his desk. Mechanical statue Dhurke: There's some sort of machinery inside this clay figure. Apollo: Whoa, it's moving! EX-TER-MI-NATE. EX-TER-MI-NATE. DES-TROY ALL TAR-GETS. EX-T-T-TERRRrrr... *scrape* *grind* Apollo: D-Do I even want to know what that thing is for?! Notebook Apollo: Look, it's one of the doctor's notebooks. Dhurke: Maybe there's something about the orb in there. It's a photo of the treasure box! The one from Tehm'pul Temple's treasure room. These must be his research notes on the Founder's Orb. Apollo: What's that on the right page? It looks like a poem or something. Dhurke: Let's see... Oh, it's the song that's performed during the Dance of Devotion. It's been sung during Khura'inese rites of offering since ancient times. Apollo: Oh, I think I've heard of that. Dhurke: There's also a legend associated with the song. Some say the solution to the orb's riddle is contained therein. Apollo: It's a song everyone in Khura'in knows? Not much of a way to keep it secret. Trucy: It's called \"hiding secrets in plain sight,\" Polly. Us magicians know all about that. Dhurke: Huh. That's strange. Apollo: What is? Dhurke: Dr. Buff's notes contain the second half of the song. Only the first half is sung during the Dance of Devotion. Most people haven't even heard the second half. Apollo: The second half? As in the part that begins, \"Offer thy prayers\"? Dhurke: I'm impressed. That's some thorough research he was conducting. Research Notes added to the Court Record. Model plane Apollo: Is this a bird? Dhurke: It looks like an airplane to me. Apollo: No, there couldn't have been any planes back when this was made. Dhurke: Yes, but it has wings and both horizontal and vertical stabilizers. That makes it an airplane. Apollo: No, it's definitely a bird. Dhurke: Open your eyes, son... As a lawyer, your job is to see the true nature of things. Apollo: (I still say it's a bird.) Misty Fey scroll Apollo: There's a brown stain on this scroll. Hm? Why does it smell like... gravy? Dhurke: Why would there be a gravy stain on it? Apollo: Who knows? But it looks like it's meant to be there. Dhurke: Maybe the artist was trying to inspire a \"gravy\" new trend: food splatter art. Apollo: That pun wounded me \"gravy-ly,\" Dhurke. Coffee machine Apollo: A coffeemaker and a bunch of coffee cups... He must've taken his coffee breaks here. Oh, and there's a filter with old coffee grounds in here. *sigh* Guess I'd better clean this up. Dhurke: What are you doing there, son? Apollo: Ah! (What AM I doing, cleaning this office?!) Dhurke: Don't tell me they have you on coffee duty back at your office. Apollo: N-No, no... It's just, if I don't keep the place clean, no one will. Ami Fey statue Apollo: It's a golden statue. Looks pretty old, too. Dhurke: Hmm... I imagine it has great archeological value... Maybe too great for a private researcher of Dr. Buff's caliber. Apollo: I wonder how he got his hands on something like this. Sacred Urn Apollo: \"Ami\"... Hmm... Why's someone's name written on here? Trucy: Maybe it's so if it ever got lost, someone could return it to its owner. You know, like how school kids put their names on things. Apollo: Yeah, but this is just an urn. And the name is written so big. Trucy: Well, I wrote my name on my magic panties. It says W-R-I-G-H-T in super big letters! Apollo: (The less said about this, the better.) Spiral staircase Apollo: It's a spiral staircase... And it's connected to a hallway up there. Why'd they have to place the second floor so high up? Ema: Wait... You're not afraid of heights, are you? Apollo: Oh, um... Well... Trucy: Oh, Polly's hilarious around high places. He gets all wobbly, like a baby deer taking its first steps. And his face turns as green as a watermelon. Apollo: It's not nice to make fun of people's phobias, you know. Dhurke: Come to think of it, the visitor's entrance is on the second floor. What an odd layout for a house... Wall relief Apollo: What a huge wall relief. Hmm... It seems to depict a spirit channeling. Dhurke: Hey... this spirit medium looks like the Holy Mother of Khura'in. Apollo: Yeah, her face was left blank, but the rest is clearly detailed and well-crafted. Dhurke: Did you know some researchers claim that the Holy Mother had three eyes? And that her third eye was able to divine the truth, just like the gods above. It is said to be on her forehead. Apollo: Like you said, you shouldn't believe everything you hear. Suitcase Apollo: That's one big suitcase. Dhurke: It's locked. Is it the doctor's? Ema: No, someone left it here last night. Apollo: So the doctor might've had a visitor? But how can you tell? Ema: That sticker there. You only see those on airport luggage. Which means, its owner is likely from overseas. Dhurke: Is there any way to figure out who it belongs to? Apollo: Not unless we can open it to see what's inside. Dhurke: Guess not... ???: Heh heh heh. Ah-ha ha ha! Ema: That's because you're not me: Ema Skye, forensics expert extraordinaire! Try as you might, you won't find the word \"impossible\" in my forensics handbook! Dhurke: I-Is she okay, son? It's like she became an entirely different person. Apollo: Oh, that's just what happens when her forensics switch gets flipped. Ema: With this, identifying the suitcase's owner will be easy as pie! Apollo: Is that fingerprint powder? Ema: That's right. And there's no better time than the present to use it! Here we go! You remember how to do this, right? Apollo: I apply the powder to where I think some prints might be, and blow any excess off? Ema: Exactly. Well, have at it! Apollo: (Hmm... Now where would I expect to find prints on a suitcase?) Examine any fingerprint on stickers closest to keyhole Leads to: \"Hey Ema, I've got a pretty clear print here.\" Examine any fingerprint on handle Ema: This one isn't clear enough for a match. Apollo: Hmm... Where else could someone leave prints behind? Dhurke: Think, son. How might someone handle a suitcase? Start by considering what you do with them. Apollo: Well, besides being wheeled or carried, they can be opened and closed. So, I should look for prints that would be left at those times. Examine any incomplete fingerprint Ema: You'll need to use more powder than that to get a clear print. Examine excess powder Ema: There's still too much powder left. Try blowing some more off. Apollo: Hey Ema, I've got a pretty clear print here. Ema: Okay, now let me know who you think it could belong to. Apollo: (Hmm, who could it be? It would have to be someone who would've paid Dr. Buff a visit.) Compare Datz Are'bal profile Analyzing...Analysis CompleteMatch Found Leads to: \"We have a match!\" Compare anyone else Analyzing...No Match Found Ema: We didn't get a match. Trucy: Any other ideas, Apollo? Apollo: Hmm... Well, we can probably assume the print belongs to the suitcase's owner. (But who could that be? It would have to be someone who would've visited the doctor.) Leads back to profile selection Ema: We have a match! Apollo: Datz... Come to think of it, he did stop by to see the doctor, didn't he? To conclude the orb transfer agreement. Dhurke: So he's the one who forgot his suitcase here. Apollo: Where do you suppose he is now? Dhurke: Haven't heard from him in a while, and he's not answering his phone. Trucy: Wait, you don't think he left his phone inside his suitcase, do you? Dhurke: I wouldn't put it past that knucklehead. Ema: Actually, I think we may have run into him earlier. Apollo: Really? Ema: A suspicious man had been reported in the area, but when one of my officers approached to question him, he took off like a shot. Apollo: What?! Dhurke: Sorry about that. Khura'inese people aren't all like him... I swear. Ema: Well, he's probably still in the village somewhere. Apollo: Maybe he knows something about the orb. Suitcase (subsequent times) Apollo: So this suitcase belongs to Datz. Dhurke: How could he leave something so big behind? Apollo: Because, you know... it's Datz. Talk Dhurke Apollo: Oh, right, I haven't introduced you yet. This is Dhurke. He's from the Kingdom of Khura'in. Ema: All the way from Khura'in, huh? So, what do you do there? Dhurke: I used to practice law, but I'm taking a break from all that. I'm focused now on making Khura'in a better place through... volunteer work. Ema: Volunteer work, huh? How interesting... Apollo: (...Well, it's not technically a lie.) Ema: So, how do you two know each other? Apollo: Oh, um... He's sorta my foster father. Ema: Come again? Trucy: Yeah! And he's Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's real father, too! Ema: Whaaat?! You mean you... and Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... ............I'm so sorry. It seems you've had quite a life. Apollo: (...Guess she's put a few things together.) Ema: Actually, Dhurke, you look kind of... familiar. Have we met before? Dhurke: Um, not that I recall. Apollo: (Great... She must've seen that news report on TV. It will really complicate things if she figures out he's a wanted man.) There are lots of guys who look like him. Sure you're not mistaking him for someone else? Ema: Are there, really? I mean, a middle-aged man with long hair and an eye patch? You don't see that every day. Apollo: W-Well, I'm sure you're just imagining things. Present Study Photo Ema: Maybe it was Dr. Buff's wish to die under a pile of his beloved books. I know I could die happily under a big pile of forensic equipment. Apollo: Well, I'll pass on dying under a big pile of evidence from my past cases. It's all murder weapons and photos of dead bodies. Ema: So, what? Are you saying you don't love your job? Apollo: Being buried in the tools of one's trade is hardly a valid way to assess dedication, Ema. After examining body outline or pile of books, ladder or bookshelves, notebook, Sacred Urn, spiral staircase, and suitcase: Dhurke: It seems the orb isn't here. Apollo: That means Datz might be our only lead at this point. Dhurke: Detective Skye said he might still be here in the village. We should try to find him. May 16Kurain Village ???: Good day to you, citizens of Kurain Village! My name is Paul Atishon, and I want your vote! Apollo: Wow, that's REALLY loud. Trucy: Look, something's coming this way. ???: Paul Atishon, savior of Kurain, has come to-- Ahhh! It's you people! Dhurke: Apollo? What is that strange conveyance coming this way? Staff: Right, left, right, left, HALT! Apollo: (It's one of those... what-do-you-call-'ems? Palanquins...?) ???: So, you finally left Dr. Buff's house! What were you doing there?! ...What a bunch of shady-looking characters. Apollo: (And you aren't?) So I take it you knew the doctor? ???: Heh, what a foolish question. I've memorized the names and faces of the entire electorate here in Kurain. After all, I am the man who's destined to be king of this fine nation someday. Apollo: Um... who are you? (And what do you mean, \"king\"?) Atishon: Ignorant fools. I am THE Paul Atishon. I am a soon-to-be eminent politician -- a man whose name will go down in history. You should be ashamed that you've never heard of me before. Dhurke: Is he really that famous of a politician, Apollo? Apollo: Not that I know of. Atishon: I'm running for a seat on the local council right now. Apollo: (I guess even Jerk Q. Public has to start somewhere.) Atishon: But my election is a sure thing, I'm told. After all, my grandfather was a famous politician with untold influence. In short, I'm the chosen one, the golden boy, the powerhouse of politics! Trucy: ...And rider-of-his-grandfather's-coattails. Atishon: Heh heh heh. Are you blinded by my majesty? Go ahead! Bask in the resplendent glory that is me, the chosen one! Apollo: Um... Sure... Atishon: ...Ah! A pleasant day to you, good people of Kurain! I am Paul Atishon! It's time to reclaim the glory of Kurain, together! A convenience store on every corner, a karaoke bar in every home! A vote for Paul Atishon is a vote for a happier, hopey-er Kurain Village! Old Man: Turn off that infernal racket, you fool! You're a stain on your grandfather's good name! Atishon: Thank you, good sir! Your support is appreciated, as always! Trucy: I guess he's one of those people who only hears what they want to hear. Apollo: ...In other words, he's a model politician. Atishon: Now where was I? Oh right, you were in the doctor's house. Just what in the world were you doing in there? Hmm? Talk Paul Atishon Apollo: Is this what you ride around in when you're campaigning? Atishon: That's right. It's perfect for the narrow roads and steep hills here in this village. It has a top speed of five miles per hour, but it suffers from serious reliability issues. (Changed from [It has a top speed of 5 miles per hour, but it suffers from serious reliability issues.] in the original release) Namely, these imbeciles tire out too quickly. Staff: *cough* *huff, puff* We'll try harder next time, sir! Apollo: (Poor guys... They're exhausted and covered in sweat.) Atishon: The Atishon family has been in politics for generations, even back in the old country. Apollo: Really? Atishon: My grandfather, Abe Atishon, was a prominent member of Congress. And he was born right here in Kurain. There isn't a person here who hasn't heard of him. Apollo: (All I asked about was his palanquin.) Atishon: You must've heard of the Atishons. I'm even reviving our old country campaigning style. Apollo: ...Oh, um... politics aren't really my thing. Trucy? Trucy: I don't recall ever reading about them at school. Atishon: Feh... Young people today. You people really need to pay more attention to politics. The doctor's house Atishon: So, what business did you people have at Dr. Buff's house? Apollo: He was going to transfer ownership of the Founder's Orb to us. It's a sacred relic from the Kingdom of Khura'in. Atishon: The Founder's Orb? So you tried to get your hands on it, did you? Apollo: Wait, what do you know about the orb? Atishon: Heh. I know that it's mine, that's what. Apollo: How do you figure that? Atishon: Because I know it's not the Founder's Orb. Its real name is the Crystal of Ami Fey. Apollo: The Crystal of Ami Fey? Atishon: That's right. It's been passed down for generations in the Atishon family. Until it was stolen, that is. But just when I had zeroed in on the culprit... ...the doctor hid it away and then kicked the bucket. Apollo: So you're saying Dr. Buff stole your family heirloom? (That's not what Dhurke said. Strange...) But I've been told the doctor himself said that... ...he had the \"Founder's Orb.\" Atishon: It's all that weird foreigner's doing! He filled the doctor's head with nonsense! Nonsense like the Crystal of Ami Fey being the Founder's Orb. Apollo: \"Weird foreigner\"? (Could he mean...?) Is this the foreigner you're talking about? Present Datz Are'bal profile Apollo: Atishon: Yes, that's him! Apollo: I thought so. (Now we really have to find Datz.) Leads back to Talk options Present anyone else Apollo: Atishon: Who's that? Wait, I know everyone around here, so this must be a new eligible voter for me! Apollo: Yes, wouldn't that be nice. (Because I certainly wouldn't vote for you. It seems this isn't the person he's talking about. But I can't imagine the doctor had contact with that many foreigners way out here.) Leads back to Talk options Datz (appears after presenting Datz Are'bal profile upon selecting \"The doctor's house\" Talk option) Dhurke: Do you know where this man is now? Atishon: I imagine he's at the Detention Center by now. I called the authorities after I found him hiding in my dog's doghouse. Apollo: Whaaat?! Dhurke: That buffoon... Apollo: Well, at least we know where he is now. Dhurke: Let's head over to the Detention Center and see what he knows about the Founder's Orb. Atishon: So, you really are after my crystal. Apollo: No, we're looking for the Founder's Orb, and we have an agreement to prove it. Atishon: Well, just so you know, you're not going to lay a finger on it. It's mine. And I intend to give it to my benefactor. Apollo: Your... benefactor? Your benefactor (appears after \"Datz\") Athison: My benefactor is ready to support my rise to the pinnacle of the political world. They have immense influence here, you see, and I intend to harness that influence. Apollo: So you're just going to give your family heirloom away to this person? Atishon: That's right. It's a purely political decision. Apollo: And in exchange, your patron will get the people of Kurain to vote for you? Atishon: Heh heh heh. Eminent politicians are skilled at leveraging all of their connections. Apollo: ......... (Isn't it illegal to buy votes?) Well, good luck with that, I guess. Atishon: Heh, you just wait. Paul Atishon will reign supreme someday. Present Attorney's Badge Apollo: Actually, I'm a lawyer. Atishon: Heh heh heh. You're so shallow. Relying on your badge to impress people... What would you be without it? I petty men like you have no sense of self. Real men make their own mark in this world. Apollo: (Says the man who's riding on his grandfather's coattails.) Anything else Apollo: What do you think about this? Atishon: Paul Atishon is the \"squeaky-clean candidate.\" So if you're going to bribe me, try to be a little more subtle about it, would you? Apollo: Huh? I wasn't trying to bribe you. Atishon: \"Don't accept any bribes unless they come in unmarked bills.\" This is but a fraction of the political wisdom my grandfather shared with me. Better luck next time. Apollo: (After a spin cycle or two with those bills, I bet I'D be \"squeaky-clean,\" too.) Wright Anything Agency (after examining body outline or pile of books, ladder or bookshelves, notebook, Sacred Urn, spiral staircase, and suitcase in Kurain Village - Doctor's Study, then visiting Kurain Village) Talk Any ideas? Dhurke: About that Paul Atishon fellow... He's aiming to be a councilman and beyond, as his famous grandfather once was, right? No doubt some would vote for him on the merits of his grandfather's achievements. I see a grim future for Kurain Village if someone like that is able to climb the ranks. Apollo: I wouldn't worry about it. Who in their right mind would vote for him with the way he's campaigning? Dhurke: So the more aggressively he campaigns, the less people will want to vote for him? That makes me want to get out there and help him fail. What to do Apollo: We turned the doctor's study upside down, but never found the orb. Dhurke: Yeah, I didn't expect this to be so hard. Trucy: Well, I think it's fun. It's like a big old treasure hunt! Dhurke: That orb is the key to Khura'in's future, you know. Trucy: Yeah, and our office's future, too! Apollo: (She does realize it's not up for sale, right?) Present Anything else Dhurke: Ah, the old show-'em-and-see-what-they-say tactic. I used to try that whenever I had nothing else to say. Apollo: Who says I have nothing else to say? Dhurke: It's written all over your face. Apollo: Like you have anything to add right now. After clearing all Talk options with Paul Atishon in Kurain Village: May 16Detention Center - Visitor's Room Datz: ......... Dhurke: .........Hey. Datz: Yipes! Apollo: What's he doing under the desk...? Datz: Foul cogs of the corrupt regime! I've nothing to say to you! Dhurke: Datz, it's me, Dhurke. Datz: Oh! Dhurke! You're a sight for sore eyes! I knew you'd come save me! Dhurke: Well, this is another fine mess you've gotten yourself into. Datz: Har har har har har! My bad, my bad! 'Least the grub here's pretty good compared to that prison back home! Ya get three squares plus a place to sleep! Why don't ya join me, Dhurke?! Dhurke: No thanks. They'd just send me back to Khura'in where I'd face immediate execution. Datz: Yeah, I guess that wouldn't be such a good idea. Apollo: (Looks like he's still the same, too.) ...Long time no see, Datz. Datz: Huh? Hey, ya look... kinda familiar... A-A-A-Apollo?! Is it really you, m'boy?! A-to-the-J, all grown up and whatnot! How've ya been?! Apollo: Fine. And you, Datz? You look good, besides the incarceration and all. Datz: ...Pffffff! Haaaaar har har har har! Those horns, AJ! Apollo: Horns? Datz: They've grown up with ya, just like a stag's antlers! I can't take it! Apollo: *sigh* You really haven't changed a bit. Anyway, there's something we needed to talk to you about. Datz: Sure, pull up a chair. I've got all the time in the world. The slammer's like my second home. It's really not so bad once ya get used to it. Trucy: He's rather laid back for someone in police custody. Talk About the orb Apollo: Datz, was what the doctor had really the Founder's Orb? Datz: Absolutely positively! The doc was sure of it! Dhurke: Really? Because someone from the village is calling the Crystal of Ami Fey. He also claims you were filling the doctor's head with lies. Datz: That ain't true! The doc said he was sure it was the real deal. All his fancy research confirmed it was the Founder's Orb. Apollo: So then that Paul Atishon character was lying? Imagine that, a politician who lies... Datz: I bet he wants the orb all to himself! Trucy: Hmm... I wonder who's telling the truth? Datz: Well, take a look at this! It proves the doc believed he had the Founder's Orb! Dhurke: Let me see that. \"I agree to hand over the Founder's Orb to the Defiant Dragons... ...if I will come to no harm.\" Signed, Dr. Archie Buff. Datz: See, I got it all down in writing! Dhurke: But Datz... ...why does it say, \"if I will come to no harm\" at the end here? Trucy: Sounds like he was scared of you. Apollo: Datz, did you threaten the doctor in any way? Datz: No, ya got it all wrong! It was the doc's friend! HE told the old man us rebels were dangerous. It's his fault the doc thought I might hurt him! Apollo: Sounds like the work of that politician. He's really made a mess of things. Orb Transfer Agreement added to the Court Record. About the orb (subsequent times) Apollo: Datz, was what the doctor had really the Founder's Orb? Datz: Absolutely positively! The doc was sure of it! Dhurke: Really? Because someone from the village is calling the Crystal of Ami Fey. He also claims you were filling the doctor's head with lies. Datz: That ain't true! The doc said he was sure it was the real deal. All his fancy research confirmed it was the Founder's Orb. Apollo: So then that Paul Atishon character was lying? Imagine that, a politician who lies... Datz: I bet he wants the orb all to himself! Trucy: Hmm... I wonder who's telling the truth? Datz: Well, take a look at this! It proves the doc believed he had the Founder's Orb! Dhurke: Let me see that. \"I agree to hand over the Founder's Orb to the Defiant Dragons... ...if I will come to no harm.\" Signed, Dr. Archie Buff. Datz: See, I got it all down in writing! Dhurke: But Datz... ...why does it say, \"if I will come to no harm\" at the end here? Trucy: Sounds like he was scared of you. Apollo: Datz, did you threaten the doctor in any way? Datz: No, ya got it all wrong! It was the doc's friend! HE told the old man us rebels were dangerous. It's his fault the doc thought I might hurt him! Apollo: Sounds like the work of that politician. He's really made a mess of things. Reason for arrest Dhurke: What have you done now, Datz? Datz: Nothing! I'm innocent, I tell ya! It all started when this dog-faced cop tried to question me! He looked so funny, I started laughing at him. That's when they came after me. But it was hilarious, I tell ya! I mean, a human police dog? How funny is that! Apollo: Right... So what happened after that? Datz: They caught me hiding in a doghouse. Dang pooch ratted me out! I guess that's what I get for laughing at one of his doggy comrades. Apollo: Sounds like the dogs got the last laugh. Dhurke: Datz, weren't you cleared of those jailbreak charges? And your capture by Lady Kee'ra deemed unlawful? Datz: Yeah, but... The cops here don't seem to like me anyway. Apollo: What are the charges this time? Datz: Unauthorized entry, or something like that. They think I'm an illegal alien! And I can't prove otherwise 'cause I lost my passport! Trucy: Is there any way they'd let you go? Datz: Not without my passport... If only I had it! Dhurke, AJ! You gotta find my passport! Apollo: ...All right, we'll find it. (One more thing to add to our to-do list. Now, where might Datz's passport be?) Examine Security camera Apollo: I hate the feeling of being constantly watched. Dhurke: Indeed. Considering my current situation, the less I'm seen, the better. Apollo: Well, it's not like there's an international arrest warrant out for you. Dhurke: True, but I seem to have made quite an international splash with that hijacking stunt. I had to sign a ton of autographs and take a load of selfies before I got to your office. Apollo: Wait, what? Dhurke: Maybe they thought the hijacking was part of some movie's promotion. Guard Apollo: He's completely uninterested in us. Dhurke: That suits me fine. It will only complicate things if I'm recognized. Apollo: Right... You're known as some sort of scary terrorist who fled from Khura'in. Though, in reality, no one would believe you're the real Dhurke of legend anyway. Microphone Apollo: Dhurke, why are you holding that mic? Dhurke: I get this strange urge to speak whenever there's a microphone before me. We, the Defiant Dragons, shall--! Apollo: No, stop! Stop...!!! Present Attorney's Badge Datz: Why, AJ! You've become a fine lawyer in your own right! Apollo: Nah, I still have a lot to learn. Datz: Aw, c'mon, don't be so hard on yourself. If I ever went to trial, I'd definitely want you on my side! Apollo: Knowing you, you'd probably skip town before the trial even started. Founder's Orb or Orb Transfer Agreement Datz: The doc agreed in writing to hand the orb over to me, but he kept stalling, like he didn't trust me or something. Dhurke: That scary mug of yours no doubt frightened him. Datz: Look who's talking! Trucy: Honestly, I think you're both about equally scary looking. Apollo: (Ouch... Both Dhurke and Datz look like they've been stabbed right in the ego.) Anything else Datz: Oh, is that for me!? Apollo: No, I was just showing it to you. Datz: Anything I could use here in the slammer is more than welcome! Apollo: Um, Datz, the guard is giving you some serious side eye. After clearing all Talk options: Datz: Oh! About the orb's whereabouts... Maybe the doc's kid knows something! Apollo: The doctor has a kid? Datz: Yeah... A bit of a shut-in, though. The poor thing's own bedroom has become like a self-imposed prison. Apollo: A shut-in? Sounds like it will be a challenge just to get a conversation going. Guard: Time for your questioning. Follow me. Datz: It must be lunchtime. Today is fried chicken, if I'm not mistaken! Guard: You'll get your lunch IF you behave yourself. Datz: Dhurke, AJ. I'll see ya guys around! Dhurke: Our only lead now is Dr. Buff's kid. But luring a shut-in out is... Apollo: ...Not going to be easy. I know. May 16Kurain Village - Doctor's Study ???: Oh, it's you again. Ema Looking for Mr. Wright? He was just here a second ago. Apollo: He was?! Trucy: What was Daddy doing here? Apollo: Good question. Ema: He said he was looking for something. Apollo: Did he say anything else? Ema: Let me think... Something about how his ride never showed up at the airport. Yes, that was it. Apollo: (I guess Athena really did get lost...) Trucy: But what's Daddy doing all the way out here in the first place? He can't be looking for us since no one told him we'd be here. Apollo: Hmm... Ema: Well, if you're here to take another look around, be my guest. I have other work to do, so if you'll excuse me. Apollo: Of course. Thanks, Ema. Dhurke: First and foremost, we'd better find Datz's passport. We should also have a word with Dr. Buff's child. Trucy: Hey, is it just me... or is there something new in here? Dhurke: ...Oh, you mean that thing? Yeah, we should take a closer look at it, too. Apollo: Let's not forget about Datz's passport. It should be around here somewhere. Examine Suitcase Apollo: Datz's suitcase... Maybe his passport's in there. Trucy: Annggh! It's no good. It's locked tight. Apollo: We should've asked him for the key. Drone Apollo: What's this? A model helicopter? Trucy: Don't you know anything, Apollo? It's a drone! They're all the rage right now. I bet it belongs to the doctor's kid. Dhurke: We need to ask them about the orb's whereabouts. Apollo: Yeah, but luring out a shut-in isn't going to be easy. Any other point of interest Apollo: Nothing new here. Let's go look somewhere else. After examining suitcase and drone: Apollo: What are we going to do about Datz's passport? It's probably right there inside his suitcase, but we can't get it open. Trucy: Why don't I take it over to Datz so he can unlock it? That way, you guys can continue looking for the orb. Apollo: Good thinking, Trucy! Trucy: Okay, here I go! ...Huh? What the...? Hrrgh...! This thing weighs a ton! Apollo: Let me try. ............Jeez, how can a suitcase be so heavy? Is it filled with bricks or something? Dhurke: Knowing Datz, he probably packed his dumbbells in there. It's certainly much too heavy to lug all the way to the detention center. Here, let me take a crack at that lock. Apollo: What, are you going to pick it? *click* *click, click* *click* *click* Dhurke: There you go. Apollo: That was fast. Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha! A lock like that is child's play to me. Especially after all the wrongly imprisoned compatriots I've busted out over the years. Apollo: You've sure seen a lot of action for an ex-lawyer. Dhurke: Aaand here we go. Datz's passport. Trucy: I'll take it over to him. Apollo: Thanks, Trucy. Trucy: No problem! Now you guys enjoy some quality father-son treasure hunting time, okay? See you later! Apollo: (There she goes. I wish she wouldn't make such a big deal out of our little \"family\" situation.) Dhurke: Father-son time, eh? Hmm... Been ages since we've had a father-son talk, huh, son? Apollo: Yeah, well over a decade. Dhurke: So, Apollo, um... how've you been? Apollo: Oh, uh... Fine. I'm fine, I guess. Dhurke: Is that so? Fine, you say? Well, fine is fine by me! Good to hear! Apollo: ...Um, okay. .................. Dhurke: ........................... Apollo: ............ (Umm... So what do we talk about now...?) Dhurke: ...Hm? Get down! Hit the dirt, son! Apollo: Huh? What the--? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! .........Unngh......Oof... ......... Dhurke: Speak to me, son! Say something! Apollo: ......Ooh... Th-that smarts... ???: Youuuu maggots! Whattaya think yer doin', invading Buff airspace?! It'll be a scorching day in Siberia before you get past me, ya yellow-bellied yahoos! Apollo: Whoa! ...It can talk?! What kind of drone is this, anyw... ...AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYY! ???: Drone, nothin'! That's Sergeant Buff to you, soldier! You got that, you lowly grunts?! Apollo: Oww... What the who now...?! Dhurke: Buff? Sounds like the doctor's son is behind the controls. Apollo: He's controlling this thing? Dhurke: Apollo, let's play along for now. At least until we can get the information we need out of him. Apollo: G-Got it. Um... Sergeant Buff? Sarge: Sergeant Buff, sir! You forgot to say, \"sir\"! Ain't you never seen a war movie before?! Apollo: Oh, right. Let me try that again. Sergeant Buff, sir! Sarge: Better. Much better. Now, state your name, unit, and rank, soldier! Apollo: Oh, um, I'm Apollo Justice. I serve at the Wright Anything Agency. And my rank is, um... fledgling lawyer? ...Sir! Sarge: Affirmative, Private Justice. Apollo: P-Private? Sarge: Listen up, diaper baby! Your commanding officer's orders are absolute! Disobedience means a one-way trip to the firing squad! Do I make myself clear?! Apollo: Oh, um... sir! Yes, sir! Sarge: Good, good, we might make a man out of you yet, private! Now for you, Cyclops! Dhurke: Huh? ...Oh, you want my name, unit, and rank, too? Um, I'm Dhurke Sahdmadhi. I command the rebel group the Defiant Dragons, and my rank is... um... leader, sir! Sarge: Excellent! Welcome aboard, Komandir Dhurke! Wait a second! What's with that ridiculous mop you call a head? Soldiers should be clean cut! Dhurke: S-Sorry, but this is my signature look. I'm not going to-- WHOOOOOOOOOA! Fine, fine! I'll get a haircut before we ship out! Sarge: Listen up, you! It's kill-or-be-killed out on that battlefield. No place for leave-in conditioners. All you've got is your life, and you're lucky to have that! Apollo: (He's oddly obsessed with field survival for someone who never goes outdoors...) Dhurke: This is going to be harder than I thought, son. Examine Anything Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Sarge: Don't let me catch you stepping out of line again. Apollo: (...Guess I'd better play along and ask what he wants.) Talk Sergeant Buff Apollo: Um, are you controlling that drone from your room, sir? Sarge: Affirmative! But I can see everything you do from here, so... Teeen-HUT, soldier! Wipe that stupid look off your face! I'm going to whip you sheltered peaceniks into shape! Apollo: (With what? Your \"charming\" personality?) Dhurke: Look, it's got a camera and speakers, too. Sarge: And that's not all, Komandir! With these arms, I can cook and clean, too! Speaking of which... Private Justice! You're on latrine duty! Snap to it, on the double! Apollo: ...*sigh*... As if I don't see enough of the toilet back at the office. Sarge's Drone added to the Court Record. Dhurke: That thing's pretty handy. Us Defiant Dragons could use one of those. Sarge: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Yes, it is a fine piece of hardware, isn't it? I modified it especially for siege defense! Apollo: Siege defense...? You mean how you won't leave your room? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! Sarge: Holing up in a stronghold to defend against an enemy is an age-old military tactic! A timeless strategy still applicable in modern warfare! I hope you're not trying to mock the wisdom of my forefathers! Apollo: I-I... I meant no offense. It was just an observation. Sarge: So the greenhorn who ain't even discharged a firearm's got something to say, does he?! Apollo: S-Sorry, sorry! It won't happen again, sir! Sarge: Darn tootin'. Now, state your intentions, soldier. Sergeant Buff (subsequent times) Apollo: Um, are you controlling that drone from your room, sir? Sarge: Affirmative! But I can see everything you do from here, so... Teeen-HUT, soldier! Wipe that stupid look off your face! I'm going to whip you sheltered peaceniks into shape! Apollo: (With what? Your \"charming\" personality?) Dhurke: Look, it's got a camera and speakers, too. Sarge: And that's not all, Komandir! With these arms, I can cook and clean, too! Speaking of which... Private Justice! You're on latrine duty! Snap to it, on the double! Apollo: ...*sigh*... As if I don't see enough of the toilet back at the office. Dhurke: That thing's pretty handy. Us Defiant Dragons could use one of those. Sarge: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Yes, it is a fine piece of hardware, isn't it? I modified it especially for siege defense! Apollo: Siege defense...?

A timeless strategy still applicable in modern warfare! I hope you're not trying to mock the wisdom of my forefathers! Apollo: I-I... I meant no offense. It was just an observation. Sarge: So the greenhorn who ain't even discharged a firearm's got something to say, does he?! Apollo: S-Sorry, sorry! It won't happen again, sir! Sarge: Darn tootin'. Now, state your intentions, soldier. Location of the orb (appears after \"Sergeant Buff\") Apollo: We had an agreement with your father. He had promised to hand over the Founder's Orb to us. Sarge: What?! Papa promised you that?! Dhurke: He did. But he died before he could tell us where it's hidden. Now we have no idea where it is. Sarge: .................. ...Oh. *sniffle* Apollo: Hm? Sarge: P-Papa... Why...? Why'd you have to die? Dhurke: It was an unfortunate accident. And I'm sorry for your loss. Apollo: If it helps at all, I know how you feel, Sergeant Bu-- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! What'd I do nowww?! Sarge: Y-You insignificant maggot! What would an unseasoned rookie like you know about how I feel?! First I lost Mama... and now I've lost Papa! Apollo: You lost your mother, too? Sarge: She's been gone for some time now. I'm... I'm all alone now. All alone... *sniffle* Dhurke: ...Sergeant Buff, would you tell us a little more about what happened to your mother? Your mother (appears after \"Location of the orb\") Sarge: Mama passed away about six months ago. We were still living in our apartment in the city. Back then, I had yet to engage in my siege defense strategy. Apollo: (In other words, something caused him to withdraw from the world.) Sarge: ...It was arson. It happened so suddenly... and before we knew it, our apartment was a sea of flames. Mama and I were trapped inside. But help never came. So Mama cradled me in her arms... ...kicked out a window... and jumped! Apollo: She did what?! Sarge: She was like a walkin', talkin' medal of valor, my mama was. She delivered me safely to terra firma with a perfectly executed PLF. It's a five-point landing technique used by paratroopers to land safely on the ground. Apollo: (She sounds like a superhero or something.) Sarge: But from that height, she suffered massive injuries in order to protect me. She... She died so that I could live! AHHHHHHHHHHHH! MAMAAAAAAAAAAAA!!! Apollo: I... I don't know what to say... Dhurke: And the person who started the fire? Sarge: He was immediately apprehended. They say he was standing outside laughing while the building burned. Dhurke: At least justice was served. I hope that brought you some solace. Sarge: I've lost both my parents now. You can't possibly know how I feel! *sniffle* *sob* Mama... Papa... Apollo: (Poor kid. It's hard losing both your parents at such a young age. He must really feel alone now.) Dhurke: Apollo... I imagine you know what he's going through. Apollo: I do? Dhurke: The road to recovery begins by talking to someone who's suffered the same hardship. I know you have something that shows you understand. Present Anything (before clearing \"Your mother\" Talk option) Sarge: What insubordination! Apollo: ARRRRRRAGH! Sarge: Petty trinkets have no place in Buff's army, soldier! Now drop and give me twenty! Apollo: (Sheesh... At least let me show the evidence before you shoot it down...) Photo of My Father (after clearing \"Your mother\" Talk option) Leads to: \"Um, sergeant, sir. Would you please take a look at this?\" Apollo: Um, sergeant, sir. Would you please take a look at this? Sarge: What do we have here? Apollo: It's a photo of my father. I wasn't even a year old when he died... in a fire. Sarge: What?! Dhurke: And like your mother, he died in an arsonist's blaze. But in his final moments, he managed to save his infant son. Sarge: P-Private Justice, you've suffered a loss just like mine. Apollo: I have... And that's why I know how you feel. Sarge: B-But... you still have your mother, don't you?! Apollo: No, I lost her, too. Sarge: What?! Apollo: She disappeared after the fire. I don't know if she's still alive or dead. Heck, I don't even know what she looks like. Sarge: Wow... Dhurke: Sergeant Buff, his experience is very much like your own. If anyone can understand the sadness in your heart, it's him. Sarge: Rrrr... Nnngh... .............................. ATTEEEEEENSHUN!!! I salute you, Comrade Justice! You are no longer a private in the Buff Army! Henceforth, you will be a corporal! Apollo: Corporal? Dhurke: Congratulations on your promotion, Corporal Justice! Apollo: ...I'm just glad that seemed to cheer him up a bit. Sarge: Now, comrade, let's toast to your new stripes! And call me Sarge! Don't be shy! We're a band of brothers now! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Dhurke: Now's our chance, corporal! Ask him about the Founder's Orb. Apollo: (Dhurke's getting waaaaay too much of a kick out of this.) Examine Ladder or bookshelves Apollo: Sarge, sir, do you ever read these books? Sarge: Why, of course! Soldiers must have extensive knowledge, as well as fighting prowess. I'm learning all I can each and every day in preparation for the big battle! Apollo: The big battle? Sarge: Um, you know... for when I go back to school. I'll need to be up to date on every subject. Stuff like... y'know, the latest comics and Hollywood gossip... Apollo: Oh, I see... (What about reading, writing and arithmetic?) Well, I'm rooting for you, Sarge! Sarge: Th-Thanks. I'll try my best. Computer Apollo: This computer could provide some useful information. Drat. It's password protected. Dhurke, you're good at getting into places you're not supposed to. Dhurke: Don't look at me. I don't know the first thing about computers. Sarge: Ha ha ha ha ha! Leave it to me! A modern day warrior must be well-versed in technology... and have a mean, mean pride! After all, he who controls information, controls the battlefield! *click clack click clack click clack* Sarge: Aaaaand I'm in! Apollo: Looks like modern day warriors have mean, mean keyboard skills, too. Dhurke: Okay, let's see what we can find. *click clack click clack click clack* Dhurke: Oh, what's this...? An e-mail message? Now this is interesting. It's a research report to whoever asked the doctor to study the orb. Sarge: Here, I put the data on this! Take it and use it well, soldier! E-Mail added to the Court Record. Computer (subsequent times) Apollo: The doctor's computer. It contains an e-mail detailing the progress of his research. Dhurke: I wonder who he prepared the report for. Glasses Apollo: Are these the doctor's? Sarge: Yes, those are Papa's reading glasses. He said he'd been having trouble reading lately. But those glasses seemed to help. Dhurke: Reading glasses, eh? I'll just hold on to these. Apollo: ...Dhurke. Don't tell me you're having trouble reading, too? Dhurke: Perish the thought! ...I-I just don't want to leave any stone unturned. Doctor's Reading Glasses added to the Court Record. Raincoat Apollo: It's a raincoat... Hm...? It's a bit wet, and there's fresh mud on it... That must mean someone wore it recently. Dhurke: Indeed. Maybe even as recently as last night. Apollo: Sarge, did it rain here last night? Sarge: Negative. There wasn't a cloud in the sky. Apollo: Hmm... Then how did this raincoat get all muddy and wet? Sarge: When I saw it last evening, it looked pretty clean and dry to me. Apollo: That means it got like this later at night. Dhurke: Good eye, son. This may very well turn out to be a vital clue. Raincoat added to the Court Record. Raincoat (subsquent times) Apollo: It's a raincoat... Hm...? It's a bit wet, and there's fresh mud on it... That must mean someone wore it recently. Dhurke: Indeed. Maybe even as recently as last night. Apollo: Sarge, did it rain here last night? Sarge: Negative. There wasn't a cloud in the sky. Apollo: Hmm... Then how did this raincoat get all muddy and wet? Sarge: When I saw it last evening, it looked pretty clean and dry to me. Apollo: That means it got like this later at night. Dhurke: Good eye, son. This may very well turn out to be a vital clue. Statue EX-TER-MI-NATE. EX-TER-MI-NATE. DES-TROY ALL HU-MANS. Apollo: What's this thing's problem...? Sarge: It's an OOPArt -- an our-of-place artifact. Papa won it in an online auction. Apollo: An online auction? Sarge: Yes, he said it's an alien weapon that destroyed an entire ancient civilization. Apollo: (...Where do I even start with an explanation like that?) Sacred Urn Apollo: This urn with \"Ami\" painted on it looks really old. But I don't think it's going to provide any info we need. Spiral staircase Apollo: Is your room upstairs, Sarge? Sarge: Yes, it's the one at the end of the hall. Dhurke: What do you say you come out, so we can enjoy a snack together? Sarge: B-But... Dhurke: I promise we won't bite! Sarge: ...............If you insist... ...then I'm not going to talk to you anymore! Dhurke: No, wait! Apollo: Dhurke, you'd better apologize quick. Dhurke: ...I'm sorry for pushing. Sarge: V-Very well. As long as you don't do it again, I'll let it slide this one time. Suitcase Apollo: It's Datz's suitcase. It's full of survival gear and questionable souvenirs. But we already got his passport, so we can leave it be for now. Shoe shelves Apollo: It's a shoe cubby. Hmm, these shoes look like they belong to Sarge and his dad. ...Ah, these boots here are a little damp! Dhurke: And it looks like there's something inside this one. Apollo: Maybe Doctor Buff wore them last night. Dhurke: They might lead us to where he hid the orb. Let's take a closer look. Examine outsole Apollo: There's a question mark on the bottom of this boot. Sarge: Papa had those custom-made for his archeological fieldwork. He had the soul of an adventurer. Dhurke: This boot had the \"sole\" of an adventurer, too. Examine residue on insole (before examining hook-and-loop fastener straps) Apollo: Something's giving off a soft glow inside this boot. But it's too dark in there to see what it is. Examine hook-and-loop fastener straps Apollo: We might get a better look inside if we undid these straps. Examine residue on insole (after examining hook-and-loop fastener straps) Leads to: \"It looks like some kind of glowing moss.\" Apollo: It looks like some kind of glowing moss. Dhurke: It could've come from wherever the doctor went last night. Must've gotten in with some of that mud. Apollo: It might be worth looking into... ...if it'll help us pinpoint where the doctor hid the orb. Glowing Moss added to the Court Record. Shoe shelves (subsequent times) Apollo: There's some glowing moss inside this boot. Dhurke: I'm willing to bet it got there from wherever the doctor went last night. Talk Location of the orb Apollo: Sarge, sir. Do you have any idea where the orb might be? Sarge: It was here in Papa's study until last night. But he said he was going to go hide it somewhere. He mentioned something about a shady character being after it. Apollo: Where do you think he could've hidden it? Sarge: Hmm... Somewhere in the village, I'd guess. He said he'd found a suitable hiding place for it. Apollo: So, it was here last night. That is, until he went out to hide it somewhere in the village. The only question is where? Dhurke: Maybe he left some clue here in his study. Let's search the place again. Apollo: (We should also find out more about Dr. Buff. It might steer us toward the hiding place.) Doctor Buff (appears after \"Location of the orb\") Apollo: So, Sarge, what was your father like? Sarge: Papa was as king as Mama was courageous. His whole reason for moving to the countryside was for me. Apollo: What do you mean? Sarge: I initiated my siege defense strategy after Mama died. Papa was so worried about me, he moved us here to the countryside. He thought the fresh air, blue skies, and natural surroundings might alter my tactics. Dhurke: What a fine father. Sarge: He even quit his position at the university to move here. Apollo: He did? Sarge: He did. He gave up his beloved research position just for me! \"A parent must be prepared to sacrifice everything for his child.\" That's what Papa said! Dhurke: ...Well, I'm feeling about two inches tall right now. Sarge: There's no one in the world I respected more than him. But that just makes his passing all the more devastating. *sniffle, sniffle* Papa, may you continue your beloved research up there with the angels! Present Attorney's Badge Sarge: What's that? Apollo: It's my attorney's badge, sir! Sarge: You mean like a medal?! What act of valor earned you such an honor? Apollo: I rescued my clients from those who would brand them as guilty, sir! Sarge: A heroic act, indeed! Apollo: Thank you for your kind words, sir! (This whole \"sir\" thing is getting real old, real quick.) Photo of My Father Sarge: Corporal Justice... you shoulder a bitter past. Apollo: You've been through quite a lot yourself, Sarge. Sarge: ...Corporal, if I may... um... Apollo: Yes? Sarge: ...Well... um... it doesn't have to be that often, but... W-W-Would you mind coming over from time to time? Apollo: You want me to visit you? Sarge: O-Only if you want to, of course! Apollo: ...Sure. I'll come by, and I'll even bring along my coworkers, Sarge. Sarge: R-Really?! Yaaaaaay! Our band of  brothers continues to grow in rank! Ha ha ha ha! Dhurke: ...Nice work, son. Glad to see you haven't changed one bit. Apollo: (What's that supposed to mean?) Study Photo or Research Notes Sarge: Why...? Why did Papa have to fall in battle? Apollo: (He's putting on a brave face, but he's still just a child.) Sarge: In honor of Papa's heroic sacrifice...  let us march on, comrade! To victory! Apollo: Huh?! I-I mean, sir! Yes, sir! Dhurke: Are you two seriously bent on waging war against that bookcase? Sarge's Drone Apollo: It looks like you can do everything by yourself. Sarge: Indeed! I can even cook and build things whenever I want! Apollo: So there's really no reason for you to leave your room, huh. Sarge: Yes, but there is still one gaping hole in my siege defense. ...Going to the bathroom. Apollo: When nature calls, it's best not to fight it. Sarge: Yes, all great tacticians will say never wage a battle you have no hope of winning. Anything else Apollo: Please take a look at this. Sarge: Let me ask you something, Corporal Justice! How does that aid you on the battlefield?! Apollo: Um, well, if you count the courtroom as a battlefield, it's a fairly useful weapon. Sarge: Good answer! A military man must know his weapons inside and out! Keep up the good work, corporal! Apollo: S-Sir, yes, sir! (I guess that's all he has to say about that.) After clearing \"Doctor Buff\" Talk option and examining computer, glasses, raincoat, and shoe shelves: Apollo: Okay, let's go over what we've learned so far. Wherever it was that Dr. Buff went, he needed a raincoat. And it was somewhere where this glowing moss grows. Any ideas where that might be, Sarge? Sarge: Negative, comrade. I hate to say my intel's a little thin on this one. I've been occupied with my siege defense strategy ever since we moved to the village. Dhurke: Well, son, it seems we have no other choice. We'll have to ask the locals if they know of a place like that. Wright Anything Agency Trucy: Ah! Apollo, Mr. Dhurke! Did you have some quality father-son time together? Talk Any ideas? Dhurke: That poor child... How is he going to survive all on his own? Apollo: Yeah, it's not like he can go out grocery shopping on his own. We should drop off some food later. Dhurke: No, that would only make it worse. We should be encouraging him to come out on his own. Once his food runs out, he'll have to leave the house if he wants to eat. Apollo: Talk about your old-school siege tactics. Sounds more like you want to starve him out... What to do Apollo: Um... Dhurke: Yes? What is it? Apollo: ............ Dhurke: ............ Apollo: (Talk about an awkward silence. I have no idea what to say.) ............ (Yeah... I've got nothing.) Dhurke: Aw, come on, son! Don't tell me you've got nothing! May 16Kurain Village Apollo: Ugh. It feels like somebody's watching me, and it's really creeping me out. Oh, it's just Paul Atishon's campaign posters. When did he put these up? (Whatever. I've got more important things to be paying attention to.) Dhurke: What great weather! It really lifts the spirits. I know! After our little treasure hunt, what do you say we go hunting, son? Apollo: Hunting? We used to do that a lot... didn't we? Dhurke: Just look at that mountain. I bet there are some feisty wild boars up there! Apollo: I... think I'll pass... but thanks. Dhurke: Oh, so hunting's a no-go. Um, well... I guess that wild boar stew will have to wait, then. .........Hm? Apollo, something seems different from the last time we were here. Apollo: Uh... You mean the posters? Dhurke: No, not those. Apollo: (What's he talking about...? Guess I should take a look around myself.) Examine Paul Atishon campaign posters Apollo: When did Paul Atishon have a chance to put up all these election posters? Old Man: That fool keeps stickin' 'em on our houses! He's a disgrace to his distinguished heritage! Apollo: He's doing this without permission? Fey Manor Apollo: A thatched roof... First time I've ever seen one in real life. Dhurke: It looks just like the traditional thatched roofs they use in Japan. All we need now are some samurai with topknots, a few ninjas, and a cuddly mascot. Apollo: When was the last time you were in Japan? Bus stop Apollo: (A phone booth and a bus stop made of wood. They both look really old. You hardly ever see phone booths in the city anymore.) Dhurke: Apollo... what's this glass box for? Apollo: (I guess you hardly see them in Khura'in, too.) Mountains Dhurke: Seeing those mountains really takes me back. I remember when we used to live high in the mountains to escape from the government. Apollo: So, you don't live there anymore? Dhurke: Nope. I needed a more convenient place to lead the revolution from. But that old mountain hut is still there. Apollo: (Man, I miss that hut...) Dhurke: What, are you getting homesick, Apollo? You can come on back to Khura'in anytime, you know? Apollo: N-No, no, I'm fine. Besides, I've got a lot on my plate here... Kurain Boulder Apollo: There's a big boulder towering into the sky over there. According to the sign, it's called the \"Kurain Boulder.\" It also says that a spirit dwells within it. Hmm... A rock with a spirit in it? Dhurke: It's called animism -- the belief that spirits dwell within inanimate objects. They've probably enshrined this boulder as a sacred object. Their tradition of worshipping such objects is similar to our tradition in Khura'in. Apollo: I-Interesting... (Who knew Dhurke could make sense every once in a while?) Canvas Leads to: \"What do we have here?\" Apollo: What do we have here? It looks like an unfinished picture... like something a little kid might paint. Dhurke: Hmm, you're right. But I can't quite tell what it's of. Apollo: I think it's supposed to be nighttime, but what's that thing on the left? Dhurke: Um... A monster, or some kind of alien, perhaps? In any case, it's a pretty poor excuse for a drawing. Apollo: Well, what did you expect from a little kid? ???: A... little kid...? Apollo: Huh? Oh, it's you, Pearl! Pearl: Why, Mr. Apollo, is that you? What a pleasant surprise! It's been quite some time. How have you been? Apollo: Fine, thanks. You're looking good, too, Pearl. Dhurke: Aren't you going to introduce me, son? Apollo: Of course. This is Pearl Fey. She's a spirit medium here in Kurain Village. Pearl, this is Dhurke, my umm... client. Pearl: Hello, sir. Pleased to meet you. If there is anything I can do to help, please let me know. Dhurke: Nice to meet you, too. And what a polite little girl you are! Pearl: ...Um, actually... I'm a high schooler. Dhurke: Whoops! Sorry about that! So, you're a spirit medium? Does that mean you can channel spirits, then? Pearl: Yes. I'm still in training, though. But I'm well-versed in the art of spirit channeling. Dhurke: Well now, isn't that something! I mean, back in my country, our little princess hasn't channeled a single spirit yet! Pretty impressive, young lady! Pearl: Oh, but compared to Mystic Maya, there is so much more I must learn! Apollo: Mystic Maya? Oh, right, Maya Fey... Mr. Wright's former courtroom assistant. He told me all about her. She's a spirit medium, too, if memory serves. Pearl: Yes, she's an amazing medium. And soon, she'll be the next lead of the Fey clan, too! Apollo: (Mediums and spirit channeling... I've heard all about it from Mr. Wright. He said that mediums will even physically become the person they're channeling. I wonder if even little Pearl would turn into a hulking giant if she hand to channel one...) Pearl: I hope you don't mind me asking, but what brings you all the way out here, Mr. Apollo? Apollo: Oh, just a small matter to take care of. Pearl: ...Wait, would it happen to be the matter Mr. Edgeworth is looking into? Apollo: Prosecutor Edgeworth? What's he doing here? Pearl: Oh, so it's a different matter, then? Because I just saw him a moment ago. He appeared to be searching for something. Apollo: Oh? Hmm... (Mr. Edgeworth is a friend of Mr. Wright's, and the district's chief prosecutor. Why would HE be here in Kurain? Well, no point obsessing over it.) Come to think of it, you live here in Kurain Village, don't you, Pearl? Pearl: Yes, I was born and raised here. Dhurke: This is perfect, Apollo. Let's ask the young lady if she knows where the doctor might have gone last night. Apollo: I was thinking the exact same thing. (Maybe I should show her what we found in the doctor's study.) Examine Paul Atishon campaign posters Pearl: Honestly! Why does he keep putting these up? And on people's houses, no less! Apollo: That's got to violate some campaigning law or something... Here, Pearl, I'll help you take them down. Apollo: Whew... Why did he have to put up so many... Pearl: Yeah... And it won't be long before he puts more up. It's really driving me crazy. Dhurke: Why don't you scribble something on them? You know, just some harmless graffiti? Pearl: ...Actually, that's just what I was thinking when I was sketching. Apollo: ...Why don't you join us for lunch at the office sometime? It'll get you away from all this. House Pearl: This is Fey Manor. Mystic Maya lives here. I hope she's doing well... Apollo: (Oh right. Ms. Fey's off studying and training in Khura'in.) Mountains Apollo: There's a lush, green mountain in the distance there. Pearl: It's home to a variety of animals. They sometimes come down to the village. I've seen foxes, badgers, and even bears. Apollo: B-Bears? Dhurke: Well, one would certainly never go hungry around here. Pearl: The poor animals! They are not for hunting or eating! Understand?! Dhurke: But badger and bear meat are so good... Canvas Dhurke: This picture looks like something you might've painted when you were little, son. Apollo: I think I would've done a little better than this. Pearl: ......... Canvas (after perceiving) Apollo: On closer inspection, there's more to this picture than meets the eye. Dhurke: Son, didn't you ever learn that honesty is the best policy? Apollo: Way to go, Dhurke! I was trying to get us out of the hole we dug ourselves into earlier! Talk Kurain Village Dhurke: What a peaceful place. Ahh... Nothing beats mountain air. Pearl: Many of the villagers have left for the city, but I just love it here. Blue skies, lush forests, star-filled skies at night, and fireflies in the summer. Plus, the big, beautiful, blue ocean is just beyond that mountain! Dhurke: The ocean?! What do you say we go for a swim, son? Apollo: ...Oh, um... I think I'll pass. (Besides, I can't swim.) ...Um, Pearl? Kurain Village is like, \"the home of spirit mediums,\" right? Pearl: Yes, and I'm a part of a long line of mediums. Apollo: I've never seen a channeling before, but... ...is it possible to channel the spirit of anyone who's passed away? Pearl: No, not just anyone. You must know their face and true name. Apollo: Really? You can channel a spirit just by knowing their face and name? That's an amazing ability. Pearl: It is, but it can only be learned by those with a gift occurring in certain bloodlines... ...and years of intense training. At present, Mystic Maya and I are the only ones in our village who can channel spirits. Dhurke: Looks like spirit mediums are highly valued here, much like they are back in Khura'in. Pearl: I heard there used to be many more of us a long time ago... ...but now, we are in very short supply. Most of the women nowadays don't want to stay; they want the thrill of the big city. Apollo: Yeah, well, you guys aren't exactly close to any shopping malls or nightclubs out here. But what about you? Are you NOT interested in things like that? Pearl: W-Who, me? Well, I... I wouldn't mind a new outfit or two, and, well... Oh, never mind. Apollo: It's okay, Pearl. You are at that age, after all. Paul Atishon (appears after \"Kurain Village\") Apollo: Oh! We met this weirdo earlier named Paul Atishon. Do you know anything about him? Pearl: Yes, he's been campaigning a lot around here lately. And the noise he's been making has become quite a problem. People are especially upset that he's campaigning at all hours of the night and day. Dhurke: Hmm, well... The local police should arrest him for disturbing the peace. Pearl: Unfortunately, there's little they can do because the Atishon family is so powerful. Apollo: (...Well, isn't HE the proverbial pampered provincial prince.) He seems pretty intent on winning here in Kurain. Is there some special reason why? Pearl: I'm not sure, but I have an idea. The spirit mediums of Kurain once held considerable sway in the political world. Judging by his slogan, maybe that's what he's after. Apollo: Great, so he's just another politician seeking powerful connections... Dhurke: The ability to commune with the dead gives comfort to those anxious about the future. Tiny Khura'in has preserved its independence by the queen's power of spirit channeling. It must play a similar role in this village. Pearl: Yes. Even today, many here revere those with spirit medium blood flowing in their veins. Apollo: So basically, as Paul Atishon's benefactor goes, so goes the whole village? (Who is this benefactor? Who could hold this much sway over Kurain Village?) Where the doctor went (appears after presenting Glowing Moss) Apollo: Pearl... Do you have any idea where Dr. Buff might've gone last night? Pearl: Umm... Well... Apollo: ......... Pearl: ...Uhh, about that... ...All I know is Dr. Buff was somewhere on Mt. Mitama. BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: ...! (My bracelet...! It's reacting! Which means Pearl is hiding something from me.) Present Bracelet Pearl: All I know is Dr. Buff was somewhere on Mt. Mitama. Percieve twitching left thumb on \"Mt. Mitama.\" Apollo: Apollo: Pearl, you seem anxious around the topic of Mt. Mitama. I could tell because you'd rub your thumb over a splotch of dried paint as you said it. Pearl: Oh! U-Um, well...! Apollo: That nighttime painting is yours, isn't it? Pearl: .........! ...This is so embarrassing. As you saw, I'm not a very good artist. But that picture has nothing to do with Dr. Buff! Apollo: I'm not so sure about that. In fact, I'm going to guess that while you were out here painting last night... ...you actually saw the good doctor heading out to Mt. Mitama from the bus stop. Pearl: N-No! I-I didn't see anything like that! I swear! Apollo: ...No, I'm positive you saw the doctor. After all, he's right here in your picture. Present human-like figure Apollo: Leads to: \"Y-You think that's the doctor?\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: See? Isn't the doctor right there? Pearl: Really? That doesn't look like him to me. Apollo: Well, I guess it IS pretty abstract. Pearl: Oh... Is it really that hard to make out? Er, what I mean is, it has nothing to do with Dr. Buff! After all, I never even saw him that night! Leads back to: \"...No, I'm positive you saw the doctor. After all, he's right here in your picture.\" Pearl: Y-You think that's the doctor? I may not be a very good artist, but at least I know how to draw a person! Apollo: Okay, if this isn't a person, then what is it? Pearl: Er... Th-That's a... a rain spirit! Apollo: ......... Pearl: .................. Apollo: ...Um, and what's a rain spirit doing at a bus stop? Pearl: Oh, umm, rain spirits have places to go, too! Apollo: ........ (This is getting ridiculous.) Sorry, Pearl, but you're not a very good liar. That is Dr. Buff, and this piece of evidence proves it! Present Raincoat Apollo: Leads to: \"This is the raincoat we found in the doctor's study.\" Present anything else Apollo: Pearl: The only thing I'm guilty of is being a terrible artist. But you're taking advantage of that to claim the picture is something it's not! Apollo: N-No no, it's... (...totally like that, but...) Pearl: That isn't a person! It's a rain spirit, I tell you! Apollo: No, Pearl, that isn't a rain spirit. Leads back to: \"That is Dr. Buff, and this piece of evidence proves it!\" Apollo: This is the raincoat we found in the doctor's study. It's still wet and muddy, so we know that someone wore it last night. Now, let's see how this pattern is the same as the \"rain spirit\" in your picture? Pearl: ...Ah! Apollo: You didn't see a rain spirit last night. You saw Dr. Buff wearing this raincoat! Pearl: Ah! ...I... I'm sorry. I know I'm not supposed to lie, but... Leads back to Talk options Percieve wrong area Apollo: Apollo: Pearl, you seem uneasy about something. Pearl: Anyone would feel uneasy being stared at like that! Apollo: Huh? But I...! Dhurke: I'd be unnerved, too. I mean, your eyes are practically popping out of your head. Apollo: I-I get it. I'll tone it down a little. (Guess I was wrong.) Leads back to Talk options Where the doctor went (after perceiving) Pearl: I'm sorry I didn't tell you before, Mr. Apollo, but I did see the doctor last night. Apollo: It's all right. Just, please, tell me everything you know. Pearl: ...Of course. I was painting out here last night... when the doctor came up to the bus stop. He was wearing a raincoat, even though it wasn't raining, and a helmet with a light on it. Apollo: Sounds like he was well-prepared for something. Pearl: I know. That's why I asked him if he was going off exploring again. He looked startled, like he hadn't noticed me there. And then, he suddenly said... \"Please don't tell anyone you saw me here.\" Apollo: Why would he want to silence you like that? Dhurke: Something must've happened to spook him. And he didn't want anyone to know where he was going to hide the orb. Apollo: But where could he have been going dressed like that? Pearl: My best guess is a cave somewhere on Mt. Mitama. I heard there's a cave there where mediums of the Kurain tradition went to train long ago. Legend has it, there are some sort of mystical ruins in there. Apollo: Mystical ruins? Sounds like the exact sort of place an archeologist might go. Present Attorney's Badge Pearl: Hee hee. Seeing you present your badge like that... ...reminds me of when I used to investigate cases alongside Mr. Nick. Apollo: You used to help Mr. Wright all the time, I hear. Pearl: That I did! Doing so helped me expand mu horizons beyond this tiny little village. So please, Mr. Apollo! If there's anything I can help you with, you just let me know! Apollo: I will. (What I'd really like is her help with cleaning the office again.) Glowing Moss Apollo: Pearl, do you have any idea where this moss might grow? Pearl: That looks like... Mitama Moss. It grows on Mt. Mitama, and gives off a soft glow in the dark. Apollo: Mt. Mitama? Pearl: See that mountain over there? That's Mt. Mitama. Dhurke: And how would one get there? Pearl: You can take a bus from that bus stop over there. ...Um, may I ask why you're so interested in that moss? Apollo: Well, Dr. Buff was supposed to give us something. But it seems he hid it somewhere last night. Pearl: H-He did? Maybe that's why he, um... Apollo: Pearl? Do you know something that might help us? Pearl: Um, well... Apollo: (Sounds like I'd better find out what she knows.) Anything else Pearl: Oh, um... Sorry, I wish I could help, but... Apollo: No, don't worry about it! I'm sorry I wasted your time like that. Pearl: Um... At least let me offer you some tea. I mean, you must be tired from all your investigating. Pearl: Oh, no, you don't have to do that. We'll be just fine, thank you. (She's so polite, it's hard NOT to feel rude around her.) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: Well, we should get going now, but thanks for all your help, Pearl. Pearl: You're welcome, Mr. Apollo. Please take care. Dhurke: What do you say we go find that cave, son? I sense that the orb might finally be within our grasp. Apollo: This treasure hunt is shaping up to be the real deal. Dhurke: Hah hah hah. Really gets the blood pumping, doesn't it?! Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go! May 16Mt. Mitama - Cave Entrance Apollo: Whew, I'm all out of breath. Dhurke: Aw, come on, that was nothing. And you're so much younger than me. Apollo: I, uh... *huff* *puff* ...don't normally get this much exercise... *cough* *sputter* Dhurke: Need a break? Apollo: N-No, I'm fine. *huff* *puff* Dhurke! Look! There's Mitama Moss growing in that cave over there. Dhurke: This must be where the doctor was last night. Let's take a look inside. May 16Mt. Mitama - Cave Apollo: ............ I can't see a thing. Dhurke: Relax. Your eyes will adjust eventually. Now, follow me. Apollo: I-I really think we need a flashlight, Dhurke. Dhurke: Should've brought one along then, son. ???: ...Here, use mine. Apollo: Thanks! Wait, were you holding out on me? Dhurke: Um... who are you talking to, Apollo? Apollo: ...You...? Whoa! (Someone just pushed me!) Dhurke: Apollo? What the--?! Apollo! Ah... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Apollo: Oww... Dhurke: Are you all right, son? Apollo: Y-Yeah... Looks like someone got the drop on us. Dhurke: Quite literally. Apollo: But who--? I mean, we could've died from that fall! Dhurke: I don't know... Hmm... But I don't think we'll be getting out the way we came in. Looks like we're in a pretty deep cave. Nothing to do but press on, son. Apollo: How can you even see in here? Dhurke: ...Come on, let's go. Apollo: H-Hey, wait! (One false step and we're dead... What in the world should we do...?) Wait here Apollo: How about we wait for help to come? Dhurke: And how are we to call for said help, hmm? Apollo: With my phone, obviously. I'll just-- Argh...! Of course we're in a dead zone... *sigh* Dhurke: Guess that's that. Apollo: (Just great...) Leads back to: \"What in the world should we do...?\" Go forward Leads to: \"I guess we keep going.\" Climb back up Apollo: Let's try climbing back up. Dhurke: Can you even see the wall in front of you? Apollo: ...No... Dhurke: Well, I can tell you it's far too steep. Apollo: You never know until you try! Here goes nothing! Hrrrgh... Annngh... Dhurke: Your loud voice may move mountains... ...but you've barely moved an inch, son. Apollo: (Argh!) Leads back to: \"What in the world should we do...?\" Apollo: I guess we keep going. There must've been some path for Dr. Buff to follow when he came to hide the orb. Dhurke: Right. By the way, it looks like our attacker left us with this useful parting gift. Apollo: From lawyer to spelunker... How do I always get myself into these situations...? We're never going to make it out alive, I hope you know. Dhurke: Don't tell me you're scared, son. We're just getting started. The greatest treasures are only ever found at the point of a blade, or the edge of a cliff. Apollo: Yeah, sure... If I'd known I'd wind up at the bottom of some dark, damp cave... ...I would've never taken your request, Dhurke. Dhurke: Save your breath, Apollo. Just keep putting one foot ahead of the other. Apollo: There'd really better be a way out of here. Dhurke: We'll find one before you know it. You'll see. .................................................................. May 16Mt. Mitama - Cave Apollo: *huff* *puff* We've been walking for over an hour. It's like a maze in here. I couldn't go back to where we started if I wanted to. Dhurke: Y-Yeah... This cave goes deeper than I thought. Apollo: Wait, don't tell me there really is no way out... Dhurke: ...Where there's a will, there's a way. Apollo: Ever the optimist, aren't you... (Maybe we should cut our losses while we still can...) Forge ahead Leads to: \"Even if we were to turn back, we wouldn't make it up that wall of solid rock.\" Turn back Apollo: I seriously think we're going to get completely turned around if we go any further, Dhurke. I mean, we don't even know if there's a way out up ahead. Dhurke: But we DO know we can't climb up that wall. Apollo: Yeah, but... Dhurke: I still know the way back from here. Don't worry, son. We can always go back there any time we want. Apollo: I-If you say so. (Famous last words if I've ever heard some...) Leads back to: \"Maybe we should cut our losses while we still can...\" Put my foot down Apollo: I'm not taking another step, Dhurke! Dhurke: Come on, now... Be reasonable... Apollo: No! I'm done, and that's final. Dhurke: I remember when you used to throw tantrums like this. Apollo: W-Well, I'm not a child anymore! Dhurke: There, there! It's okay. Daddy'll buy anything you want once we get home, son. Apollo: (...I'd better quit while I still have some manhood left to salvage... But it doesn't seem like Dhurke's about to quit any time soon. Even still...) Leads back to: \"Maybe we should cut our losses while we still can...\" Apollo: (Even if we were to turn back, we wouldn't make it up that wall of solid rock. So, I guess we keep going.) ............*sigh* How did I get stuck wandering around in a dark cave again? It's definitely not in my job description. Dhurke: Heh heh. Listen, son. Only the truly accomplished have the luxury of being so choosy. When I was just starting out, I did everything from street performing to yak milking. Apollo: And... that helped you become an accomplished attorney, how? Dhurke: It didn't. But when you need to make a living, you'll take on any job just to survive. ...Say, how IS your career going, by the way? Apollo: Well, it's been a harrowing adventure so far, to say the least. My first trial really put me through the wringer. And my next case had me investigating a pair of stolen panties. And just when I was hitting my stride, this one prosecutor branded me as \"Herr Forehead.\" Oh, and there's this other, ridiculous prosecutor who wields a samurai sword. Dhurke: ...Sounds like you've, um... seen quite a bit. Apollo: You're telling me. Dhurke: ...Listen, Apollo... I'm, uh, I'm sorry I didn't contact you for so long. Apollo: ............It's fine, Dhurke. What happened, happened. Dhurke: ...Hm? Careful, the ground doesn't feel as solid here. Apollo: What? Yikes! The cave floor's collapsing! Dhurke: Argh! Not agaaaain! Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH! May 16??? ???: Hey, Apollo. Can you hear me? Apollo: ...Unngh. (.........Dhurke?) Huh? Where are we? Whoa! What is this place?! Dhurke: I was shocked, too. These ruins look really old. Apollo: It's not exactly something you'd expect to find in the middle of a cave system, that's for sure. Maybe the doctor hid the orb here? I mean, those look like footprints over there. Dhurke: Son, I think our little adventure is about to pay dividends! Time to find that orb! Examine Plastic bottle Apollo: What's a plastic bottle doing here? Dhurke: There's seaweed stuck to it, which means it probably came from the ocean. Hmm... It's possible this cavern is connected to the sea somehow. Driftwood Apollo: Driftwood? How'd that get in here? Dhurke: By drifting on in, I'd assume. The only question is, from where? Cavern wall near stone altar Apollo: So that's the hole we fell through. Doesn't look like we'll be going back that way. We're lucky we survived the fall from way up there. Dhurke: Indeed. If that hole hadn't been above the lake, we'd be history. You passed out the moment you hit the water. Apollo: Yeah, well, water's not really my thing. Dhurke: Hmm, this cavern is solid rock all around. Looks like we either go back through that hole... ...or find some other way out. Apollo: Ugh. Why am I always between a rock and a hard place? Stone altar Apollo: It's a big stone altar. One false move, and some god might come and smite us. Dhurke: Oh, come on. It's not all doom and gloom. Apollo: ...I dare you to look at our surroundings and say that again, Dhurke. Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! You've got me there, son. Apollo: (Dear gods, please smite me now.) Water Apollo: This lake looks really deep. I can't even see the bottom. (A bottomless lake in the depths of a mountain cave system. My blood runs cold at the thought of falling in there.) Dhurke: The water... It's salty. This lake may very well lead to the ocean. Apollo: Didn't Pearl mention something about the ocean? ...Like how it's on the other side of the mountain? Can't imagine she meant it literally. Footprints Apollo: These have gotta be the doctor's footprints. They match the bottoms of the boots we saw in his study. Dhurke: So he made it all the way down here. Hmm... The water's washed and most of them away, but his footprints are everywhere. Apollo: Really? 'Cause these are the only sets I see. Dhurke: He must've been looking for something. ...Ah. Those prints... They're coming out of that lake. Apollo: Hey, you're right. But that would mean Dr. Buff came walking out of the water. Box on altar Apollo: This box looks pretty new. I'm guessing... the doctor's the one who brought it down here. Dhurke: It's no good. It's locked tight. Apollo: There's no way to open it? Dhurke: Doesn't look like it. There isn't even a keyhole. Which means... there must be a trick to opening it. We'll have to figure it out if we want to see what's inside. Talk Any ideas? Apollo: I wonder what this place was for before it was... well, ruins. Dhurke: I'm guessing it was a place for spirit mediums to perform their rites. But earthquakes and the changing landscape eventually buried it. Apollo: If you're right, that would mean that it hasn't been used in ages. After examining cavern wall near stone altar, water, footprints, and box on altar: Dhurke: Let's sum up what we know so far. The orb is almost definitely inside this box contraption that we can't open. As for this cave, there doesn't seem to be any way out. Apollo: Nnrgh... We're THIS close to the orb... Dhurke: Aww, come now, son. Don't be like that. It's just a bit of bad luck. That's all. Apollo: A bit? Murphy called. He wants his law back. Dhurke: What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger, right? Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (How can he laugh at a time like this?) Dhurke: We're stuck here for now, so we might as well try to open this thing. Apollo: Okay, let's see what we're dealing with. Examine button Apollo: There's a big button here. ...Huh. Nothing happened. Examine pictures Apollo: This thing is covered with pictures. And, hey! Each section also rotates! Dhurke: Take a look at this, son. See the picture of a dragon battling a tiger? And this green and purple one... ...is of a Khura'inese butterfly and a mitamah. Apollo: ...I wonder if they're clues for figuring out how to open this box. After examining button and pictures: Dhurke: It appears this box uses a picture-based combination lock. We'll have to arrange the pictures on each side in the correct sequence. Apollo: Let's see... There's the dragon and tiger fight, a Khura'inese butterfly with a mitamah... Dhurke: ...And a number of pictures, too. Apollo: Dhurke, I was thinking... Maybe we should check the evidence we've collected so far. I think we have something that just might help us open it. Dhurke: You read my mind, son. Apollo: I think this will help us open the puzzle box. Present Research Notes Apollo: Leads to: \"Dr. Buff's research notes mention the Song of Ceremony.\" Present anything else Apollo: Dhurke: I don't see how that would help us. Apollo: Really? (Guess that wasn't it.) Dhurke: There's a dragon and tiger fighting, and a Khura'inese butterfly with a mitamah. We've gotta have something related to those things, don't we? Apollo: Hmm... Leads back to: \"I think this will help us open the puzzle box.\" Apollo: Dr. Buff's research notes mention the Song of Ceremony. Maybe its lyrics and the pictures on the box correspond somehow. Dhurke: I think you're on to something, son. Apollo: Okay, let's give it a shot. Each dial has six pictures... ...and there are four dials in all. The box should open once the pictures are arranged in the right order. Funky puzzle box... here comes Justice! Input tiger and dragon picture on top row, Khura'inese butterfly and mitamah picture on middle-top row, praying people and Holy Mother picture halves on middle-bottom row, and Holy Mother's spiritual blessing picture on bottom row Leads to: \"It opened!\" Input any other combination Apollo: It won't open. Dhurke: Maybe the pictures aren't in the right order. The case should open if the pictures are arranged properly, but... Apollo: I know. I should carefully consider which part of the song corresponds to which picture. Apollo: It opened! So this is the Founder's Orb... Dhurke: We did it, son! The orb is finally ours! Founder's Orb updated in the Court Record. Dhurke: At last, the Founder's Orb is ours! And it's all thanks to you, son! Well done! Then again, I'd expect nothing less from my boy! Apollo: Oh, uh, ha ha. It's no big deal. Dhurke: Don't sell yourself short! You may think it's nothing... ...but your insights and reasoning led us here. And I'd say that's truly impressive! Apollo: I don't know about that, ha ha ha. Dhurke: All those battles you fought in the courtroom have shaped you into the man you are today. And I couldn't be prouder! Apollo: ...W-Will you cut it out, already? (...Before I turn into a sun-ripened tomato.) Dhurke: With this orb, I can finally deliver a fatal blow to the Ga'ran regime. Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: So, how exactly do you plan on using it? You're not going to try to become a spirit medium, are you? Dhurke: Don't be ridiculous. I don't need supernatural powers like that. Apollo: So then, are you going to use it as a bargaining chip with Queen Ga'ran? Like demanding she abolishes the Defense Culpability Act? Dhurke: Well, the thought had crossed my mind, but... ...the main thing is returning this to the Kingdom of Khura'in. After all, as a sacred relic of Khura'inism, that is where it belongs. Apollo: Really? That's all you wanted to do? Dhurke: Mm-hm. Because my true objective has always been... ...to find out who asked Dr. Buff to study it and why. Apollo: I'm not sure I follow. Examine Box on altar Apollo: That was one fancy puzzle box. Dhurke: The fact that he chose to use such an elaborate box... ...makes me think that Dr. Buff must've had a rather playful side to him. Apollo: I can almost imagine him saying, \"Go ahead. Open it if you can.\" Talk The orb's significance Dhurke: The official story is that the orb was stolen from the Tehm'pul Temple treasure room. Apollo: Yeah, I heard about that on the news. They also said your group was behind the theft. Dhurke: That's not good... We're probably on an international most-wanted list now. ...Let me ask you something, Apollo: Who do YOU think really stole the orb? Apollo: Umm, I really haven't a clue. Dhurke: Well, I think it was one of the royals. Apollo: Really? Someone from the royal family? Dhurke: Yeah, and I've got a pretty good idea which one it was. Apollo: (He knows who it is?) Care to share your hunch? Dhurke: All I'll say at this point is this: Security is pretty tight, but the royals have unfettered access to the treasure room. Plus, they seem to be turning a blind eye to the orb's loss. Apollo: But why would a member of the royal family do that? Dhurke: ...That, I haven't figured out yet. But whatever the reason, it can't be good. I mean, a Khura'inese royal stealing a national treasure of such religious significance? And then pinning the crime on us, the Defiant Dragons? Apollo: Sounds like a conspiracy or something. Dhurke: I agree. And if the truth were to come to light, it would be a scandal of epic proportions. To allow a foreign national to study a treasure so sacred that it's off limits to the public... It would be seen as an utter sacrilege to those who truly revere the Holy Mother. Apollo: So if this were to go public, support for the Ga'ran regime would weaken. Dhurke: But that's not all. This is just a hunch, but I believe there's something even bigger here. Something that would explain why the orb was being studied in the first place. Something that would shake the Kingdom of Khura'in to its very core. And I'm going to find out what. Apollo: (.........He's probably right. His intuition is usually spot on.) Dhurke, why are you so bent on revolution, anyway? Is it to reform the legal system in Khura'in? Dhurke: There's that. But I'm  also doing this for my children... I want to save Nahyuta. Apollo: What do you mean? Dhurke: ...This is for your ears only. It's the other reason why this revolution needs to succeed. Nahyuta (appears after \"The orb's significance\") Apollo: Nahyuta... I never thought that our reunion would take place in a courtroom. Dhurke: Oh, so you've run into each other already. Apollo: Yeah, but it was like he was a different person. He used to be such a kind, cheerful kid -- always smiling and stuff. But now... He tried to convict Trucy for a crime she didn't even commit. Plus, he kept telling me I had a \"putrid mind\" and to \"let it go, and move on.\" Dhurke: Has it really gotten that bad? It must be Ga'ran's influence. He wasn't like that when he first stepped into the courtroom. Back then, he still had a keen sense of justice. \"I vow to bring the Ga'ran regime down and reform the legal system.\" Dhurke: That's what he swore to do... but that was also five years ago. He'd been the shining star of the Defiant Dragons, and our greatest hope. Apollo: Wait, Nahyuta was a Dragon? Dhurke: He was. But these days, he's more like Ga'ran's lapdog. Apollo: Talk about a complete about-face. Why would he do that? Dhurke: Something must have happened to him. Something that sparked a radical change. Still... I don't think he truly believes in the new path he's taken. It's not conviction that fills his heart; it's resignation and despair. Apollo: I-I see... Dhurke: ...The only thing I know for sure is... Nahyuta is suffering... and he is suffering in silence. Apollo: Nahyuta... is suffering...? Dhurke: Yes. He knows the rightful state of Khura'in's legal system... ...but something forces him to bend to Ga'ran's will, and it's tearing him apart. Apollo: But it's been five years. Do you really think he even still wants to reform the legal system? Dhurke: ...As long as he carries what I've taught him in his heart, I do. Dhurke's teachings (appears after \"Nahyuta\") Leads to: \"\"A dragon never yields.\" ...That's what you always told us.\" Present Founder's Orb Dhurke: The orb is ours at last! Apollo: I'm just glad we were able to make what you said in your broadcast a reality. Dhurke: Me, too. I didn't want to admit it before, but I was starting to have second thoughts about making such a big, bold move. I kept thinking, \"What would happen if we failed to get the orb?\" Apollo: Just another example of how a bluff can be the starting point in the quest for the truth. Dhurke: And what a hard-won truth it was. But I couldn't have done it without you, son. Apollo: \"A dragon never yields.\" ...That's what you always told us. Dhurke: That I did. It's a belief I've held since back when I was lawyer. [sic] The dragon stands at the pinnacle of the natural world. Nothing and no one can bend its will. Apollo: That's why we lawyers must pursue the truth like an unyielding dragon, right? We must fight for truth to the bitter end, no matter what it takes... (Dhurke and Mr. Wright... they have that much in common.) Dhurke: That's why I've held onto this badge, even though there are no more lawyers in Khura'in. I believe that one day, our legal system will return to its former glory. And this badge here is a testament to that belief. Apollo: ...Hmm... I wonder if Nahyuta still believes in what you taught us? Dhurke: He does. That much I'm sure of. A dragon never yields. Dhurke: I know that belief is etched deep in his heart. ...I'd bet my life on it. After all, he is my flesh and blood! Apollo: ............ (This unshakable faith and confidence... It's what draws people to him, whether they like it or not. ...Even people like me.) You know, I remember back when we were kids... ...Nahyuta used to say with great pride, \"I have the blood of the dragon within me.\" Dhurke: Yes, and that's why I want to free him. Free him from the poisonous clutches of the Ga'ran regime. Apollo: So that's your other reason for starting a revolution... Dhurke: Yes. I need to smack some sense into that boy of mine. I mean, what else are fathers for? Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: ...I... I wouldn't know.) Dhurke: Now that we have the orb, on to the next problem -- getting out of here. Apollo: Well, we're not going back the way we came. That's for sure. That hole we fell through is way too high to climb back up to. Dhurke: Actually, I have an idea. That lake water tastes salty, which means it must connect to the ocean. Apollo: W-Wait a second. You're not suggesting we SWIM our way out of here...? Dhurke: That's exactly what I'm suggesting. Apollo: But we have no idea how deep that lake goes. It's pitch black down there. Dhurke: Not a problem. Apollo: How is that not a problem? I mean, how do you even know if there's really a passage to the ocean? Dhurke: Well, one of us has to try, and I'm the better swimmer. Time's a wastin'! I'll be back before you know it, son. Apollo: Dhurke! ...He's gone. I sure hope he knows what he's doing. May 16Mt. Mitama - Kurainese Ruins Apollo: ......... (It's been twenty minutes. I hope he's okay.) What's going on? Uh-oh. Th-The water...! It's rising! And fast! Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! (N-Need... air...) *cough* *sputter* *cough* *cough* ...Ahhh! I don't know how to swim! If I don't grab onto something that floats...! .................. *cough* *sputter* *cough* *cough* ...This is bad! I-I better think of something -- quick! Examine Plastic bottle Apollo: Hey, maybe I can use this like an oxygen tank! ...Wait, what am I thinking?! I need to stay calm and be more rational about this! Driftwood Apollo: I've got it! As long as I hold onto this, I should be able to stay afloat! Stone altar Apollo: This is not good. The water's almost up to the top of the altar. It won't be long before it reaches the roof of the cave. Box on altar Apollo: The puzzle box is still at the base of the altar. It must've been designed to stay put, even at high tide. Wait, that's it! Dr. Buff must've gotten in here from some ocean-side entrance at low tide. That's why his footprints were leading OUT of the lake. So it really DOES connect to the ocean. Not that that helps. I'd drown before I made it out. Top of cavern Apollo: Nnrrgh... It's no use! The hole's still too high up! I'll have to find another way -- and quick -- before I drown! After examining plastic bottle, driftwood, box on altar, and top of cavern: Apollo: The water won't stop rising! Aaaah! I-I'm getting swept away! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh! Please...! STOPPPP! Examine Plastic bottle Apollo: If only that bottle were a little bigger, it'd store that much more air... No, it wouldn't make that much of a difference... I need to stop with these harebrained ideas, and come up with a real way to escape! Cavern ceiling Apollo: The water's almost to the top now. At this rate, I'll run out of breathing room! I'm a goner if I don't find a way out quick! Hole in cavern Leads to: \"The water's just high enough for me to reach the hole!\" Apollo: The water's just high enough for me to reach the hole! I'm saved! All I have to do is go back the way we came! The water might even lift me all the way back up, over that wall of rock! Here goes! ...Huh? The hole! It's full of rubble. The tunnel collapsing above must've filled it in after we fell through it. Nngh... This... This can't be happening! No, I can't give up now. I refuse to die here! Th-The water...! I can't--! *cough* *sputter* I can't... I can't... breathe... .................. (Is this... the end?) .................. (Dhurke... I wonder if he made it out.) .................. (So this is what it feels like to drown. I would've eaten that sushi if I'd known it would be my last meal. ...I feel like I've been through this before. ...Ah, now I remember. It was back when all three of us were living in that shack in the mountains. Nahyuta and I were playing by the riverside when we got swept up in the rapids.) Apollo: AAAAAAHHH! Nahyuta: AAAAAAAGH! Apollo: (I thought we were goners, but then...) Dhurke: Nahyuta! Apollo! Hold on! I'm coming! Apollo: ...*sniffle*... *sniffle*... *sniffle*... Wahhhhh!!! Nahyuta: Waaahhhh!!! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! That was a close one! Thought I'd lost you two! Apollo: I-I'm sorry, Dhuuuuuuurke! Dhurke: All right, that's enough now. Didn't I teach you that boys don't cry? Nahyuta: ...Thank you, Father. Apollo: *sniffle* *hiccup* *hiccup* Nahyuta: You... You could've been killed... But you risked your life... to save us... Why...? Dhurke: What a silly question. What father wouldn't risk his life to save his own children? Nahyuta, Apollo... Don't you ever hesitate to call when you need me. Understand? Apollo: ...Hey Dhurke? This isn't forever, right? You'll bring me back from America someday, right? Dhurke: Of course... I'll come pick you up as soon as things settle down here. Promise. Apollo: Okay! You promised! Apollo: ...Dhurke. I waited and waited. For the day you'd come and take me home. But you never came. That's why I tried to forget about you... ...and my life back in Khura'in. ...Dhurke... Why...? Why... didn't you...? .................. ..................... ???: A... ...lo... A... pol... lo...! Apollo! Can you hear me?! Apollo: *cough* *sputter* *cough* .........D-Dhurke? Dhurke: Still can't swim, eh? Apollo: You... You came back? But why? Dhurke: I said I'd come for you, didn't I? Apollo: Yeah... But you can't hold me and swim...! We're both going to...! Dhurke: Stop talking. You'll bite your tongue. Apollo: What? Whoa whoa whoa! (We're being pulled under! What's going on?! Why is this happeniiiiing?!) .................. May 16??? Apollo: *cough* ...Uuuuugh. Wh-Where...? ???: Ahh, you finally came to, son. Dhurke: Get your fill of seawater? Good thing your name's not Neptune, huh! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: D-Dhurke... Datz: Har har har har har har! You're telling me! Check it out, snot's coming out of his nose! Trucy: What a miraculous escape! Not even some of the escape-artist greats could pull that off! Apollo: ...Wh-What on earth happened? Dhurke: Sorry it took me so long, son. I made it to the ocean, but I figured you still couldn't swim. So I found a local fisherman and had him take us out near the undersea cavern. He tied a rope to me, and I came and grabbed you. Then he yanked me back. Apollo: Oh, so that's what pulled us under with such force. Trucy: Don't forget about me! I assisted in your escape act, too, Polly! Dhurke: I've helped compatriots escape from all sorts of places -- mountain jails, island prisons... But an undersea cavern? Now that was a first! Apollo: ......... (Dhurke... He risked his life for me.) .........Dhurke. I'm only alive because of you. ...Thank you. Dhurke: Oh, uh... Y-You're welcome. I, uh... just did what any father would do for his son. Apollo: (.........He saved my life yet again.) *growl* ...Um... Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! I guess seawater doesn't make for much of a meal! Trucy: It's 'cause Polly didn't have any sushi! Apollo: (Oh, yeah. I haven't eaten anything since this morning.) Datz: ...Oh, that's right! Hey, AJ! Dhurke had me buy this for ya. Apollo: ! Dhurke: Thought you might be hungry. Ready to have some this time around? Apollo: .........Yeah. Thanks! *chomp* *nom nom nom* Oh wow, this is delicious! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Glad you approve! I'd better get some before you eat them all! *chomp* *chew chew chew* Apollo: (Just like old times. Dhurke used to slice up the fish he caught, and we'd all eat fresh sashimi together. He used to talk about all the vitamins and minerals packed in the raw fish.) Datz: *chomp* *munch munch munch* Hey, by the way! Lemme see that orb, AJ! Apollo: Here you go. Datz: Hoa, so that's what it looks like! Trucy: You found the legendary treasure! Nice work, Polly! Apollo: Thanks. ...Guess you could say, mission accomplished! Dhurke: With the orb, our revolution can take a big step forward. Let's celebrate the eve of our revolution! We'll all get dressed up and feast till dawn! Datz: Yeah! Now you're talkin'! Time to party! Apollo: ......... (After all that? I just want to go to bed. Sure wish Nahyuta was here. Maybe one day, we'll enjoy times like these together again. ...The revolution. If it can bring back those happy days... ...you can sign me up for--) ???: Sorry to interrupt your little party, but I'm here for my crystal. Staff: Right, left, right, left, HALT! Apollo: Ah! It's him again! Atishon: Heh heh heh. Well done. Then again, I always knew you could do it. After all, we politicians must be excellent judges of character. Still, I'm impressed you both made it out of there alive. Apollo: ...W-Wait a second. YOU'RE the one who shoved us into that pit? Atishon: It sounds so bad when you say it like that. All I did was give you a little nudge in the right direction. Dhurke: ...So... it was you... ............................................................... You no good, son of a--! Atishon: ...EEP! D-Don't look at me like that! The Crystal of Ami Fey is mine! Now, hand it over! Dhurke: Over my dead body! Atishon: EEK! Detective! Help! Ema: Yeah yeah, I know. Apollo: Ema? What's going on here? Ema: He filed a police report. He claims you're trying to steal his family heirloom. Atishon: Th-That's him! The one with the long hair! Arrest him this instant! He's the thief that made off with the Atishon family's most precious heirloom! Ema: Well, I suppose I should ask you to come in for questioning. Dhurke: Down at the police station? I... think I'll pass. After all, Mr. Atishon seems bent on having me arrested on theft charges. Apollo: (This is not good! If Dhurke gets arrested, he'll be sent back to Khura'in to face execution!) Ema: Sorry, but now that I know you have the crystal, or orb as you call it, I must insist. Will you please come with me, sir? Apollo: Apollo: Ema! I'm afraid I can't let you take Dhurke in! He received the orb from Dr. Buff in a perfectly legal transaction. Ema: Is that so? Can you prove it? Apollo: Of course. This should sufficiently prove that the orb now belongs to Dhurke. Present Orb Transfer Agreement Apollo: Leads to: \"Take a look at this agreement.\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: Look at this! It's proof that the orb is Dhurke's. Ema: Umm... All this proves is you're completely our of your mind. Apollo: Oops... (I guess that wasn't it.) But the doctor definitely transferred it over to us. Leads back to: \"This should sufficiently prove that the orb now belongs to Dhurke.\" Apollo: Take a look at this agreement. Ema: What do we have here? Let's see... \"I agree to hand over the Founder's Orb to the Defiant Dragons if I will come to no harm.\" Hmm... It appears to be a perfectly legal agreement. Atishon: Not so fast! That's not the Founder's Orb! It's the Crystal of Ami Fey, which means their agreement is null and void! Ema: Hmm, this is going nowhere fast. Apollo: You can say that again. ???: Then it will just have to go to trial. Right, Apollo? Apollo: M-M-Mr. Wright? Trucy: Daddy! Phoenix: What's with you two? You look like you just saw a ghost. Apollo: (...Oh yeah. Ema mentioned she had seen him around.) ...Um, what're you doing in Kurain Village, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Mr. Atishon has retained me as his lawyer. Apollo: Wait, you're his... lawyer? Examine Mountains Apollo: You can see Mt. Mitama from here. We're lucky we found the Founder's Orb, and even luckier we got out of there alive. I hope I never have to go through anything like that again. Talk Legal advisor Apollo: Mr. Wright, why are you serving as Mr. Atishon's lawyer? Phoenix: Because he hired me. He needed my help in getting a family heirloom back from Dr. Buff. And it seems he correctly foresaw that something like this might happen. Atishon: It's because those shifty insurgents were harassing poor Dr. Buff. So I knew I might need a lawyer if things went south. I figured with a celebrated lawyer like Phoenix Wright, I couldn't go wrong. Apollo: Is this what you came back from Khura'in for, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: It was just good timing. My work over there just happened to wrap up, so here I am. Plus... Mr. Atishon is a very important client. Apollo: (They know each other? But I've never heard Mr. Wright mention his name before.) The Crystal of Ami Fey Apollo: Mr. Wright, are you sure this is Mr. Atishon's family heirloom? Phoenix: That's my client's assertion. He says it's the Crystal of Ami Fey. Apparently, it's the crystal she once used when channeling spirits. Apollo: Who's Ami Fey? Phoenix: She brought Khura'inese channeling to Japan, and her descendants brought it here. Her true origins are still rather murky... ...but what's clear is she is the founder of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Apollo: Oh, so she's like the one they call the founder in Khura'in -- the Holy Mother. Present Anything Phoenix: I'd think you would have more pressing things to ask me about. Apollo: Y-Yeah... (I'd better ask what I can while I can.) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ...Apollo, I don't plan to betray my client's confidence. I may not know all the facts yet, but I do know we won't be handing the crystal over to you. Apollo: What? Are you saying...? Phoenix: .................. I'm really sorry it's come to this, but... Apollo: Mr. Wright? I don't understand. Phoenix: Let me spell it out then. If you continue to claim that the crystal belongs to your client... ...then I will be seeing you in court. Apollo: Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! Trucy: ...Wh-What's gotten into you, Daddy? Phoenix: Nothing. This is strictly business. Atishon: Heh heh heh. Two lawyers from the same firm facing off? What are the odds! Lucky for me, I believe I have the \"right\" man for the job! What ever are you going to do? Remember, he IS your boss. Apollo: Ngrrrgh... (How did it come to this?!) M-Mr. Wright! Please! Don't do this! Phoenix: Apollo, there's no point in arguing about it here... ...when it's now clear we're headed to court. That's where we'll find out who the crystal really belongs to. Apollo: (I don't believe it. Am I really going to face Mr. Wright in court?) Trucy: Daddy! Apollo! No! We can't have our agency's talent competing against each other! Phoenix: It's too late, Trucy. The die has been cast. We each have to fight for our clients' best interests. Trucy: B-But... Phoenix: So, what's it going to be, Apollo. Are we going to have to take this to trial? Apollo: (I have to battle Mr. Wright in court? THE legendary Phoenix Wright? No matter how many trials of his I've watched... ...no matter how dire the situation, he's always pulled out a win in the end. Can I do it? Can I really take on the man whose footsteps I've been following in...? I owe it to Dhurke to at least try. I... What should I do?) Battle Mr. Wright Leads to: \"There's no turning back now.\" Throw in the towel Apollo: (I can't do this. I mean, how can I go up against a man like him? I couldn't possibly win! ...But do I really want to give up without a fight? If I do, I'll be forever walking in his shadow! Plus, I'd be letting Dhurke down! And I can't let that happen!) Leads to: \"There's no turning back now.\" Apollo: (There's no turning back now.) If it's a trial you want, Mr. Wright, I'm more than happy to oblige! I'm ready to fight for my client... ...even if it means facing off against you! Phoenix: .................................... .................. ...All right. I won't be pulling any punches, either, Apollo. The kid gloves are officially off. May the best attorney win. Apollo: You got it! Trucy: Whoa whoa whoa! First Daddy, now you! Polly! You're not seriously... Apollo: ...Sorry, Trucy. But I have to do this. Phoenix: .................. Apollo... All right, then, I'd better go prepare for tomorrow. See you in court. Trucy: Daddy, no! Wait! Dhurke: A fine mess I've gotten you into, son. I mean, of all the lawyers we could've faced, it had to be him? He's practically a celebrity in Khura'in now. They're calling him the Fighting Phoenix. Apollo: ...I-I'll be fine! (After all, I've come a long way, too! Who knows? I could even end up winning. There's always a chance...... right?) Dhurke: You know, this may be a blessing in disguise. If the trial proves what we found is indeed the Founder's Orb... ...then whoever asked Dr. Buff to study it may be revealed, too. This is our chance to finally pull them out of the shadows! Apollo: ...The first step of your revolution, huh? Dhurke: Yes. The revolution to restore Khura'in to its former glory, and save Nahyuta's soul! Apollo: Dhurke... I swear to fight as hard as I can in court to make that a reality. We're going to win this one. You'll see. Dhurke: I know you can do it... son. Apollo: (It doesn't matter that I'll be going up against Mr. Wright. I have to win this for Dhurke... ...and for Nahyuta. His salvation, along with all of Khura'in, depends on it!) To be continued Nothing to examine during investigation Apollo: Nothing particularly interesting here. Area already examined Apollo: We've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around. Nothing to examine during fingerprinting session Apollo: Doesn't look like there are any prints here. Examine insignificant area on evidence Apollo: (Nothing particularly interesting here.) Consult (while opening puzzle box) Apollo: Hmm, this is harder than I imagined. I thought all we had to do was arrange the pictures according to the song. Dhurke: It's times like these you have to think outside the puzzle-box. Sometimes the truth can only be found when you look at things from a different angle. Apollo: A different angle? (Come to think of it, one of the pictures from the song is missing. Does this mean the pictures don't line up exactly one-to-one?)

Dhurke: I'm sorry, too, little lady. This is all my fault. Trucy: I'm just worried things will never be the same between Daddy and Apollo... ...if they go through with this. Dhurke: Is that all? Well, I wouldn't worry about that. That's the way it is with us men. We may fight, but we don't burn bridges. Trucy: Really? Dhurke: Sure. One minute we're trading blows, and the next, we're having drinks together. We're simple creatures at heart. Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Trucy: I sure hope you're right... Athena: Sorry I'm late, Apollo! Apollo: Athena! There you are! What happened with you and Mr. Wright yesterday? Athena: O-Oh, about that... I ended up going to the wrong airport. I was waiting there, thinking his flight was really late... and before I knew it, I dozed off. By the time I woke up, it was already dark. Apollo: I figured something like that had happened. Being late and dozing off are the two things you do best. Athena: Ugh. Guilty as charged. Apollo: So then, I take it you have no idea what today's case is about? Athena: Not a clue. Sorry... Um, what IS today's case about, if I might ask? Another locked-room mystery? A suspect with a flimsy alibi? Ooh, or a dying message? Apollo: Sorry, strike three, you're out. It's a civil case. Athena: ...A civil case? Apollo: You act like I'm speaking Swahili here. Athena: It's just, the Wright Anything Agency specializes in criminal law, or so I thought. In civil cases, there are no prosecutors, right? Instead, both parties retain an attorney. Apollo: Right. And the other attorney is someone you know very well. Athena: Really? Who? Bailiff: The trial will begin shortly. Please proceed to the courtroom at once. Apollo: (...Okay, let's do this!) Athena: Apollo, wait. Who's the other attorney? And where is Mr. Wright? Apollo: No time to explain. Let's go. Athena: O-Okay! Right behind you! May 17, 10:30 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 6 Judge: Court is now in session. Oh, um... Uh, is this some sort of practice session? A mock trial, perhaps? Apollo: Um... no. No, it's not, Your Honor. Phoenix: It's the real deal, Your Honor. Judge: Hmm... So then you two have had a falling out? I won't have you use my courtroom for that, you know! Apollo: I-It's nothing like that, Your Honor! Phoenix: Exactly. It just so happens that we have different clients in this case. Judge: I see... Well, here's to hoping this has no adverse effect on your working relationship. Athena: You can say that again! I had no idea we'd be going up against the boss today! Ugh... You sure this is a good idea, Apollo? Apollo: ...What? Do you want to switch sides? Athena: Honestly, I'd rather be anywhere but here right now. Apollo: (Well, at least she IS here. I'm really going to need her help.) Phoenix: ...Mr. Justice. Apollo: Yes?! Phoenix: Don't expect me to pull any punches just because you're the opposing lawyer. As I said, the kid gloves are off, and come what may, they'll stay off. Apollo: ...Same here, Mr. Wright! If it's a fight you want, it's a fight you'll get! Phoenix: .................. Apollo: .................. Athena: Yeesh, you guys are really chomping at the bit, aren't you? Judge: Hmm... I don't mind a good fight between co-workers. Just keep this civil case civil. Now then, if the plaintiff would take the stand, we may begin. Staff: Right, left, right, left, HALT! Atishon: Noble judge, members of the gallery! Good day to you! I am Paul Atishon! This is but the start of my epic campaign! And you all have the honor of witnessing it! I believe the youth of this country are our very future. Too long have they been looked down on and given the cold shoulder! So, to them I say! Ask not what you can do for your country! Ask what you can do for me! Judge: M-Mr. Atishon! What is that crazy contraption you're riding in?! Atishon: Heh heh heh. It's my custom-made, election-winning campaign mobile. Beautiful, isn't it? Judge: You're at a witness stand, not a campaign podium. So come out of there this instant! Atishon: Feh... Judge: All right. Now, would the plaintiff's attorney, Mr. Wright... ...please explain the complaint filed against the defendant. Phoenix: Mr. Atishon's complaint against the defendant is simple. The defendant, one Dhurke Sahdmadhi... ...stole my client's family heirloom -- the Crystal of Ami Fey. Mr. Atishon merely seeks its return. Atishon: This wouldn't have happened if that archeologist hadn't kicked the bucket. Judge: ...I see. Well, Mr. Justice, let's have your opening statement, if you would. Apollo: The defense asserts the item in question is the Founder's Orb, a sacred relic from Khura'in. Judge: Hmm... Go on. Apollo: It seems someone asked an archeologist -- Dr. Archie Buff -- to study the orb. Dr. Buff determined that it was a Khura'inese national treasure known as the Founder's Orb. The very orb that was stolen from a treasure room in Khura'in several weeks ago. Judge: Why yes, I saw a news report about that! The theft of a Khura'inese national treasure caused quite an uproar in the kingdom. Apollo: Well, we believe it was not, in fact, a theft in the traditional sense. But rather, that it was spirited out of Khura'in by someone for Dr. Buff to study. Judge: You don't say... And...? Apollo: Around that time, an acquaintance of the defendant learned of Dr. Buff. He made contact with the doctor, who agreed to hand over the orb. Apparently, the doctor wanted nothing to do with it once he'd learned it had been stolen. Judge: Hmm... It seems you even have a transfer agreement between both parties. Apollo: Mr. Sahdmadhi also agreed to return the Founder's Orb to the Kingdom of Khura'in... ...once the doctor verified it was the real thing. Judge: I see... So this dispute centers on... ...whether the item is the Founder's Orb or the Crystal of Ami Fey. That, in turn, will determine the object's rightful owner. Apollo: (I'd better bring my A game. Going up against Mr. Wright won't be a walk in the park.) Judge: Hmm... Come to think of it, the name Dhurke Sahdmadhi sounds awfully familiar. But I can't recall where I've heard it. Apollo: ...Oh. umm, it's probably your imagination, Your Honor. He's just a tourist, after all. Judge: Hmm... My imagination, you say? Athena: Are you sure about this, Apollo? He's a wanted criminal in Khura'in, isn't he? Apollo: ...In Khura'in, yes. Here, he's just a tourist. Judge: Very well, let's begin the proceedings. Bailiff, would you bring in the first witness? Apollo: ...Ema? Ema: Show some manners. We're in court. Apollo: I know, it's just... This is a civil trial, so I was surprised to see a detective take the stand. Phoenix: I had her do some digging on Dr. Buff. Apollo: (What for?) Ema: You disappoint me, Apollo. First, you know I'm not just a detective. I'm a forensic scientist. Do try to remember that. Second, you owe Mr. Wright an apology. After all he's done for you, you have some nerve! Apollo: First, I'm sorry. And second, I'm really just trying to do my job. Ema: You'll never get anywhere with that attitude. Take some advice from someone who's been there. Apollo: Why do I feel like I'm on trial here? Judge: Detective Skye, your testimony, if you please. Witness Testimony -- The Doctor's Dark Secret -- Ema: The police have had their eye on Dr. Buff for some time. And just today, a number of stolen artifacts were discovered in his study. Among them were a priceless urn and a statue that were stolen from the Fey clan. It seems the doctor would do anything to study artifacts, including steal them. As for the relic at the center of this dispute, he likely stole it from the Atishon residence. Apollo: The doctor... is a thief? Why am I just hearing about this now? Ema: Well, \"cat burglar\" isn't something he'd put on his résumé. He was more careful than that. But the fact is, he was a classic treasure hunter. Athena: A treasure hunter, huh... Like people who have thrilling adventures in exotic places, risking life and limb for glory? Apollo: I doubt Dr. Buff was the star of his own hit movie series, Athena. Phoenix: Out of respect for the dead, I will say that Dr. Buff wasn't doing it to get rich. Apparently, he only wanted to borrow artifacts to study them. He would then return them as soon as his research was finished. Ema: According to the doctor's child... ...he would even repair or restore some of the artifacts he stole before returning them. He believed he was honoring the dead by discovering their history through artifacts. But whatever lofty ideals he had, it makes no difference. Larceny is larceny. Judge: Yes, he certainly sounds no different than a regular thief to me. Apollo: So, let's say for a moment that the doctor really did moonlight in stealing artifacts... Might he not have stolen the Founder's Orb in Khura'in and brought it back here himself? Phoenix: Nope. There's no records of him traveling overseas over the past few years. Plus, he couldn't very well leave his reclusive child at home all alone. Judge: Hmm... Then this really must be the Crystal of Ami Fey. Phoenix: Yes. He stole it from the Atishon residence, probably so he could study it. Apollo: ......... (This is the left hook I did not need.) Athena: I bet you never saw that coming, Apollo. Apollo: Yeah, when Mr. Wright said the kid gloves were off, he wasn't kidding. Phoenix: ......... Judge: Mr. Justice, you may proceed with your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- The Doctor's Dark Secret -- Ema: The police have had their eye on Dr. Buff for some time. Press Apollo: Apollo: How exactly did Dr. Buff arouse the suspicion of the police anyway? Ema: Chalk it up to good, old-fashioned sleuthing. After investigating countless artifact thefts over the years... ...the police finally zeroed in on him, and the doctor became their prime suspect. Phoenix: A number of those artifact thefts occurred in Kurain Village, too, if I might add. And they started right around the time the doctor moved there. Apollo: But he was never arrested. I take it there was nothing concrete linking him to a crime? Ema: No. Which is why we were never able to get a search warrant in the first place. It's hard to arrest artifact thieves unless you catch them red-handed. Still, the police had him under constant surveillance. Ema: And just today, a number of stolen artifacts were discovered in his study. Press Apollo: Apollo: Are you sure these allegedly stolen artifacts are the real deal? Ema: They're not fakes, that's for sure. Take the urn, for example. Apparently, it's an extremely intricate work of art. Its design, cracks, and other features would be impossible to replicate perfectly. Phoenix: Actually, I've had a few run-ins with that urn myself. So I was shocked to see it there in the doctor's study. I can say without a doubt, that that urn was stolen from the Fey clan. Apollo: I-I see... Judge: Detective Skye, please continue your testimony, if you would. Ema: Among them were a priceless urn and a statue that were stolen from the Fey clan. Press Apollo: Apollo: Were any other stolen artifacts found besides those belonging to the Feys? Ema: Yes. For instance... Remember the large relief on the wall? It was chiseled out some ancient ruins in the Kingdom of Khura'in several years ago. Apollo: Ch-Chiseled out...? Didn't that damage it? Ema: Well, he did restore the parts that were so faded you could barely see them anymore. It seems he intended to return it someday, so one could say his intentions were good. But good intentions are no get-out-of-jail-free card. That's a fact. Phoenix: If I might add, with respect for the deceased... ...the quality of the restorations was apparently exceptional. It seems the doctor invested a lot of money in hiring an extremely talented specialist. Athena: He sounds like a good man... who took a wrong turn somewhere. Apollo: (I guess Sarge takes after him in that way.) Ema: Any further questions? If not... Ema: It seems the doctor would do anything to study artifacts, including steal them. Press Apollo: Apollo: Had these alleged thefts been going on for some time? Ema: At least five years, as far as we can tell. All the recent thefts had been local... ...but before moving to Kurain Village, he had been stealing from ruins around the world. Apollo: (Dr. Buff was an international criminal?) Ema: This data lends itself to but one conclusion: Dr. Buff was a thief. Ema: As for the relic at the center of this dispute, he likely stole it from the Atishon residence. Press Apollo: Apollo: You claim he stole a family heirloom from the Atishon residence. But claiming something doesn't make it true. Ema: Unfortunately, it IS true. Apollo: How can you be so sure? Ema: A police report was filed concerning the theft -- one year ago, in fact. Apollo: What?! A whole year ago? Ema: August 25 of last year, to be exact. The report state, and I quote... \"The Crystal of Ami Fey was discovered to be missing... ...from the Atishon storehouse at 10 AM. The storehouse lock had been picked. Signed, Paul Atishon-Wimperson.\" Judge: Well, a year-old report certainly lends the the plaintiff's claim credence. The doctor could really have stolen the Crystal of Ami Fey. Phoenix: Not only that, Your Honor... ...but the Founder's Orb was only found to be missing several weeks ago. That is nearly a year after the crystal's theft was reported. Therefore, I believe we must consider the orb and the crystal to be two separate items. Apollo: ......... Athena: Paul Atishon-Wimperson? Not the most awe-inspiring tail end, is it? I see why he cut it. Apollo: Not that he inspires confidence without it. Still, I'd probably do the same in his shoes. Robbery Report added to the Court Record. Press (subsequent times) Apollo: Apollo: This police report say say the \"Crystal of Ami Fey,\" but... ...how do you know it's this relic right here? Ema: Because Mr. Atishon has stated as much. Apollo: (...Well, I'm not buying it.) Athena: Apollo, I was thinking... The plaintiff's legal name is pretty distinctive. Paul Atishon-Wimperson... Do we have any evidence related to his initials or his name? Apollo: We just might. It might even point out a flaw in something Ema said. Athena: You think her logic's faulty? Apollo: Yeah. If the doctor stole the relic from Mr. Atishon... er, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson... ...then there's one thing the doctor did that doesn't make any sense. Athena: Especially if Paul Atishon-Wimperson was desperately searching for his stolen relic. Apollo: (Okay, time to go over the evidence again.) Present E-Mail (after pressing fifth statement) Apollo: Leads to: \"The doctor stole the relic from the plaintiff?\" Before pressing fifth statement Athena: The trial's barely started and we're already backed into a corner. Apollo: To make matters worse the judge seems to agree with the plaintiff's case. But we've still got to give it our all. After pressing fifth statement Athena: A police report was filed about the crystal's theft a year ago. Apollo: But the theft of the Founder's Orb was only reported a few weeks ago. So the crystal's report was filed way before the orb was found missing. Athena: That suggests the stolen relic is the Crystal of Ami Fey, as Mr. Atishon-Wimperson asserts. Hmm... I doubt the police report is a fake. After all, Ema is the one who submitted it as evidence. Apollo: (Still, I feel like something we learned in the police report is important somehow...) Apollo: The doctor stole the relic from the plaintiff? Are you sure? Because that statement doesn't agree with a certain piece of evidence. Ema: What do you mean? Apollo: Take a look at this. Ema: What about it? Apollo: This contains an e-mail from the doctor's computer. Judge: ...E-mail? In that little piece of plastic? ......... I'm afraid I don't understand. Apollo: Oh, umm... This stick here can store all sorts of computer data. Judge: I still don't get it. Apollo: H-Here, just look at this! Apparently, the doctor was reporting his research findings to a certain individual. Now, take a look at this. It's the police report that Detective Skye presented to this court. You can see the plaintiff's legal name on it. Paul Atishon-Wimperson. Judge: I can see why'd he drop \"Wimperson\" from his name, but that's hardly breaking news. Apollo: Look closer, Your Honor. Phoenix: .........Ah! H-His initials! Apollo: Right. The plaintiff's full legal name is Paul Atishon-Wimperson. Now consider this... The e-mail's recipient address starts with three letters. Ema: P-A-W...? Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Don't tell me--! Apollo: Oh, but I will anyway. The individual who hired the doctor to study the disputed item... ...is none other than Paul Atishon-Wimperson. Ema: Wait, th-then that means... Apollo: Exactly. He wouldn't have asked the man who stole his family heirloom to study it. Therefore, how could this possibly be the Crystal of Ami Fey?! Ema: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! ...We never checked the doctor's e-mails. We couldn't even figure out the password to his computer. Apollo: The plaintiff willingly left the orb in the doctor's care so he could study it... ...at the behest of his \"benefactor\"! Ema: ...Wait. Then what about the police report? I have all the details of the theft right here! Apollo: It's probably for another relic -- the real Crystal of Ami Fey. He's just using the report as a way to claim that our orb is actually his stolen crystal. Phoenix: Phoenix: And how are you certain that \"PAW\" refers to my client's initials? Maybe the e-mail's recipient was a dog lover. Apollo: Perhaps. So let's get to know your client a little better, shall we? Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson! Atishon: Feh. I suppose shutting down detractors is all part of a politician's job. Apollo: Answer me this, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson: what is... Your shoe size? Apollo: What's your shoe size? Atishon: How should I know? Apollo: Wait, you don't know your own shoe size? Atishon: I have all my shoes handcrafted in Italy. And the shoemaker comes to my residence to take the necessary measurements. I have better things to do than memorize trivial information like that. Apollo: (Makes we wish I'd memorized the Italian for \"entitled jerk.\") Judge: Maybe this will help you memorize what happens to those who waste the court's time. Apollo: (I really put my foot in it this time.) Athena: Apollo, no matter what his shoe size is, there wouldn't be enough digits. We're looking for a three-digit number. Apollo: Oh, right. Let's see... Leads back to: \"Answer me this, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson: what is...\" Your favorite food? Apollo: What's your favorite food? Atishon: Curry rice. It's an old family favorite. Apollo: Really? As in, boil up some rice and dump some curry sauce on top? THAT curry rice? Atishon: Heh, I bet you assumed I would say French cuisine... ...just because I'm a member of the political elite. But nothing beats the delectable curry recipe my ancestors bright over from Japan. And I'm the kind of representative who upholds the value of such traditions! Apollo: (Is his entire strategy really just to pander to \"traditional values\" voters?) Judge: Your penalty is served, Mr. Justice. Let this be some food for thought! Athena: Apollo, why don't we take another look at the e-mail address? Apollo: No, it's fine! I just need another crack at this. Leads back to: \"Answer me this, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson: what is...\" Your birthday? Leads to: \"What is your birthday?\" Apollo: What is your birthday? Atishon: My birthday? It's July 11th, but what's it to you? (Changed from [My birthday? It's July 11, but what's it to you?] in the original release) ...Oh, I see. You can address birthday gifts to my office. But, full disclosure... I only accept gifts valued at one thousand dollars or more. (Changed from [But, full disclosure... I only accept gifts valued at $1,000 or more.] in the original release) Phoenix: ......... Judge: ......... Atishon: ...Hm? Why has everyone gone silent? Apollo: (How can anyone be that self-centered? Oh, right... politician.) Did everyone hear that? He said, \"July 11th.\" (Changed from [He said, 'July 11.'] in the original release) July 11 -- or rather, \"711\" -- matches the numbers in the e-mail address. Both the name and birthday are a match! I hardly think that's a coincidence! Atishon: .........Wait... Why you sneaky little--! Apollo: (Looks like someone finally decided to join the conversation.) Would the plaintiff care to explain? Atishon: I-I would like to say... that is q-quite... Apollo: Quite what? Atishon: Q-Quite... a thing... you've said. ......... Apollo Um... Any other thoughts? Atishon: No further comments. I stand by my previous statement. Apollo: Apollo: You can't just walk away. Even politicians have to explain themselves in a court of law! Atishon: ...I'm afraid I simply don't know how it happened. I can't possibly explain matters out of my purview. Perhaps it was a mistake on the part of my secretary? Apollo: (Oh no you don't, you slippery eel.) Mr. Wright, would you care to respond? Phoenix: ...I won't argue your assertion. My client lent the treasure in question to the doctor and asked him to study it. It seems that much is a fact. Apollo: (Now we're getting somewhere!) Phoenix: However, it has no bearing on the issue of ownership. Apollo: ...How so? Phoenix: Mr. Atishon, I fully understand your position here. You HAD to hide the fact that you sent the crystal out to be studied. Your family would've been very upset if they had found out. It's a family heirloom, after all. Apollo: You've got to be kidding me! Atishon: Mr. Wright is, well, right, of course. But then, he always is. That's why he's my lawyer. The crystal is a precious Atishon family heirloom, and has been for centuries. But Dr. Buff was so eager to study its proud heritage, I just couldn't say no. I didn't even tell my grandfather. Apollo: Apollo: But in order to win the backing of your so-called \"benefactor\"... ...you were going to give what you claim to be the Crystal of Ami Fey to that person? You were going to give a precious family heirloom away, just like that? Atishon: ...I-I was going to explain everything to grandfather later! Honest! Phoenix: My client's grandfather is very proud of his grandson for following in his footsteps. And if refusing him would've meant dashing the dreams of his darling grandson... ...I doubt the kindly old man could've said no. Judge: Well, grandchildren ARE meant to be spoiled. That's what grandfathers are for. Apollo: Your Honor... Please. (I mean, it's been in the family for centuries.) Atishon: My grandfather thinks highly of my talents as a politician. That's why he entrusted me with this very important name placard today. So I'm sure he would've been okay with me using the crystal as I saw fit. Apollo: (Grrr... Grandpa's spoiled little brat.) Athena: I think the judge is buying it, Apollo. Apollo: No surprise there. He's always going on and on about his own grandchild, after all. Ema: ...Excuse me. Can I leave now, Mr. Wright? I believe my work here is done. Phoenix: By all means, Detective Skye. Thank you for your assistance. Ema: You're welcome. It's nice to testify at a civil trial once in a while. See you around. Judge: Hmm... It seems the facts have changed somewhat. Mr. Atishon-Wimperson apparently lent his family heirloom to Dr. Buff. Mr. Justice. How would the defense like to proceed? Apollo: Oh, umm... (All right, now what?) Athena: Apollo, let's hear what what they know about this so-called \"Crystal of Ami Fey.\" Maybe we can find some inconsistencies in their statements. Apollo: Right... Okay then, Mr. Wright. If the item in question really is an Atishon family heirloom... ...then let's hear all your client knows about it. Phoenix: ...Of course. Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Please tell the defense everything you know about the crystal's origin. Atishon: All right. Now then, listen and learn. This is the tale of the Crystal of Ami Fey, and the illustrious history of the Atishon clan! Are you ready? Our story begins back in the old country, when the Atishon family reigned supreme... Witness Testimony -- The Illustrious History of the Atishon Clan -- Atishon: My ancestor was praised as a benevolent ruler. He protected the spirit mediums, a minority back then, from the rest of the locals. Some discriminated against them, you see, while others tried to abuse their power. As thanks, Ami Fey gave the crystal she had specially made as a gift to him. I am a descendent of that great lord. As such, my political power and influence is backed by centuries of history! Apollo: (Well, that devolved into a great load of self-aggrandizing propaganda fast.) Phoenix: As you can see... ...the Crystal of Ami Fey is an heirloom of the esteemed House of Atishon. Apollo: And you have proof that it has always been in the Atishon family? Phoenix: ...I have someone who gave a statement to that effect. My client's neighbor -- one Ives Shineto, age eighty-five -- gave the following statement: (Changed from [My client's neighbor -- one Ives Shineto, age 85 -- gave the following statement:] in the original release) \"The Atishons showed me the Crystal back when I was but a lad.\" Apollo: Apollo: Can we really trust the memory of an old man? Phoenix: ...Mr. Justice. Would you care you to explain that statement to the judge? Apollo: Oh... Er, I didn't mean-- What I'm trying to say is, um... Judge: Never underestimate the memory of your elders. I may forget my verdicts the next day, but the memories of my past are clear as day! Therefore, I find Mr. Ives Shineto's statement to be perfectly credible. Athena: Wow, did you see how Mr. Wright got the judge on his side? That's definitely a trick I want up my sleeve. Apollo: *sigh* You're not helping, Athena... Judge: You may cross-examine the witness, Mr. Justice. Cross Examination -- The Illustrious History of the Atishon Clan -- Atishon: My ancestor was praised as a benevolent ruler. Press Apollo: Apollo: Um, that object you set down there... Is it something of importance to you? Atishon: It's a name placard. This one here belonged to my grandfather, Abraham Atishon. He had it custom-made during his distinguished political career. It's special because it was crafted from the finest Italian plastic. Apollo: (I wasn't aware the Italians were famous for their fine plastic...) Atishon: Heh heh heh. You can touch it if you want. Apollo: No, I'm fine. Atishon: Very well. I'll just continue with my testimony. My ancestor was praised as a benevolent ruler. But he was also an eminent politician. Atishon: He protected the spirit mediums, a minority back then, from the rest of the locals. Press Apollo: Apollo: So I take it the relationship with the Fey clan was a close one. Atishon: A smooth and open line of communication with my entire electorate... That is the Paul Atishon way. Apollo: Huh...? Oh, sorry. I was asking about your ancestor. Atishon: Heh. Whether it's about me or my ancestor... ...feel free to ask me anything you'd like. Transparency in government! That's the Paul Atishon way. Apollo: (More like: Dodging questions! That's the Paul Atishon way.) Thanks. I'll be sure to ask when I have something you'll actually answer. Atishon: As I was saying, the Atishon family protected the Fey spirit mediums back then. Atishon: Some discriminated against them, you see, while others tried to abuse their power. Press Apollo: Apollo: Spirit mediums were targets of discrimination? Atishon: Yes. Some people even treated them like they were monsters. The transformation the mediums underwent when channeling spirits frightened the locals. And then there were those who tried to use them. Apollo: You mean they sought to control the channeling powers of the mediums? Atishon: Discriminating against a minority is absolutely despicable. A vote for me is a vote to end discrimination. I vow to root it out wherever it may be! That is my promise to you! Athena: He's totally ignoring your questions. It's like you're a moderator at a political debate. Apollo: Yeah, and only HE cares about his talking points. As thrilling as your campaign is, could we please get back to your testimony? Atishon: Feh. As you wish. Now then, as for the Crystal of Ami Fey... Atishon: As thanks, Ami Fey gave the crystal she had specially made as a gift to him. Press Apollo: Apollo: You said she had it made. So then it was made in Japan? Atishon: That's right. They say she hired a famous craftsman to make it. And they say it's quite valuable, too. Apollo: And you were going to take such a priceless family heirloom... ...and just give it to your patron? Atishon: Feh. That's so typical of you ignorant, common types. Making difficult decisions when the chips are down is what being a politician is all about. Apollo: (But only when it's in service of your own political career, you mean.) Atishon: The crystal is a testament to my ancestor's remarkable achievements. And furthermore... Present Research Notes Apollo: Leads to: \"You stated that Ami Fey had the crystal made for your ancestor.\" Atishon: I am a descendent of that great lord. Press Apollo: Apollo: So tell me, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, are you famous in Kurain Village? Atishon: You could say that. But I find my popularity to be rather bemusing. Apollo: Bemusing? Atishon: Yes, my campaign posters keep going missing as soon as I put them up. My avid supporters and female fans are likely taking them home to hang in their bedrooms. Apollo: (...I guess ignorance really is bliss.) Atishon: Heh heh heh. All this only proves my fine lineage. Atishon: As such, my political power and influence is backed by centuries of history! Press Apollo: Apollo: I'm sorry, but is any of that relevant to the issue of the relic's rightful owner? Atishon: ...Have you never heard of kingcraft? Apollo: Kingcraft? Atishon: It's the art of ruling as a king. My father drilled it into my head from a young age. And one of its precepts states: \"Ruin awaits a ruler who responds to every single issue posed by the masses.\" Apollo: (Well, that answered my question about what he meant by \"king of this nation.\" Progress.) Athena: Apollo, who is this Ami Fey, anyway? Apollo: I believe she was the founder of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Athena: The plaintiff claims she had the crystal made for his ancestor. That would mean it was made in Japan, right? Apollo: Yes, I suppose it would. Apollo: You stated that Ami Fey had the crystal made for your ancestor. So, am I to assume it was made in Japan? Atishon: That's right. The craftsmanship is unbeatable! Apollo: Well, that's strange. I don't see how your so-called crystal could've been made there. Atishon: What are you talking about? Apollo: It's quite obvious if you take a closer look at this. Present motif on Founder's Orb pedestal Apollo: Leads to: \"Take a look at the distinctive design here. According to Dr. Buff...\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: See this part right here? Doesn't it exude a mysterious, exotic charm? Judge: Hmm... I don't know about that. Phoenix: What I do know, Mr. Justice, is your assertion exudes a mysterious amount of nonsense. Apollo: ...Oops. Judge: And I assure you there's no mystery behind a penalty for aimless speculation, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Nope. No mystery there, Your Honor. Athena: Apollo, let's go over everything we have on the orb once more. Maybe there's something that can help us prove it wasn't made in Japan. Apollo: Your Honor, I can prove the orb wasn't made in Japan. Leads back to: \"It's quite obvious if you take a closer look at this.\" Apollo: Take a look at the distinctive design here. According to Dr. Buff... ...it's a mitamah motif dating back to the early days of the Kingdom of Khura'in. Judge: The Kingdom of Khura'in, hmm? And you base this on...? Apollo: Here, this piece of evidence, Your Honor. These are the doctor's research notes on the Founder's Orb. This is the box in which the orb was originally stored. It features the same pattern as the one found on the orb. Judge: Hmm... They do look like the same pattern. Apollo: Therefore, I assert that... ...the disputed item must have been made in the Kingdom of Khura'in! Atishon: AAAAAAAAAHHHH! Eeeeeeek! M-My placard...!!! Phoenix: Phoenix: The Kurain Channeling Technique originated in the Kingdom of Khura'in. And Ami Fey is known to have traveled there to train. With that in mind, what's to say she didn't bring that pattern back with her? Apollo: Apollo: But since this is CLEARLY a Khura'inese design... ...not even you can deny... ...the possibility that it was made there -- in the Kingdom of Khura'in! Phoenix: Phoenix: Anything is possible to some extent. That doesn't make it true. So you can't conclude that the orb is from Khura'in based solely on that pattern. If it were that simple... ...I could just as easily say it's Japanese. Judge: I have to agree with Mr. Wright. The pattern alone proves nothing. But that also means there's no basis to claim that the item in dispute was made in Japan, either. Hmm... At this rate, we're going nowhere fast. Apollo: (...Argh. He's right -- we're just spinning our wheels here.) Athena: I wonder if we have any evidence that could break this stalemate. Apollo: (Hmm... Evidence that could break this stalemate...) Exists Apollo: The defense would like to present a piece of evidence to the court. A piece that will finally break this stalemate! Phoenix: Oh? Well, you've sure piqued my interest. Let's see what you've got. Apollo: ...All right. I will now prove that this is, in fact, the Founder's Orb! Present anything Apollo: Phoenix: And just how does that piece of evidence prove that the relic is the Founder's Orb? Apollo: .........It doesn't, does it? Phoenix: Not by any means I can fathom. Athena: Sorry, Apollo, but I have to agree with the boss on this. Apollo: ...Me too, actually. Judge: Me three, defense! Apollo: Yikes! Judge: Time to think that one over again, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Y-Yes, Your Honor... Leads back to: \"Hmm... Evidence that could break this stalemate...\" Does not exist Leads to: \"There doesn't seem to be anything we can use. At least, not at this point.\" Apollo: There doesn't seem to be anything we can use. At least, not at this point. Athena: Well, unless we can find something, this trial won't be going anywhere. Atishon: ......... *whew* That's much better. Apollo: (What's his deal?) Phoenix: ...I have a suggestion. Why don't we consider this from a different angle? Apollo: I'm listening... Phoenix: What if... ...the Defiant Dragons really were authorized to take possession of the relic? Judge: Hmm... I'm afraid I don't know where you're going with this, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Consider the Orb Transfer Agreement, which states: \"I agree to hand over the Founder's Orb to the Defiant Dragons if I will come to no harm.\" What if, as the last part suggests, this was written under duress? That would render the agreement null and void. Apollo: ...What are you suggesting, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: While you were on your little cave expedition, I was investigating Dr. Buff's accident. And there was something you overlooked, Mr. Justice. Namely, that his \"accident\" might have actually been murder. Apollo: What?! (M-Murder?) Judge: M-Mr. Wright! You do realize such statements are not to be made lightly? Are you suggesting the doctor was murdered by the Defiant Dragons? Phoenix: Yes, but follow me on this for a sec. The books that came tumbling down were from the archeology shelf. However, among that mountain of books was a single volume on psychology. What's more, there was blood on it. Apollo: And you feel this is important because...? Phoenix: The took that came tumbling down were from the top shelf -- the archeology books. We know this because the doctor's books were meticulously organized by subject. Archeology took up the entire shelf, so that psychology book is completely out of place. Apollo: (Come to think of it, the shelves were arranged quite carefully.) Phoenix: It's also worth noting that psychology books only take up a tiny part of the bottom shelf. You might wonder why a book on psychology was found amid the pile of archeology books. But I believe I can explain what that single out-of-place book was doing there. The doctor was struck from behind while selecting a psychology book from the shelf. Apollo: And that's when the blood got on the book? Phoenix: Precisely. And to make it look like an accident... ...he was buried under a mountain of archeology books. Apollo: Apollo: W-Wait a second. This is all just speculation, right? Or do you have proof it was murder? Phoenix: Of course I do. Apollo: Y-You do? Phoenix: On a hunch, I had Detective Skye examine the doctor's head wound. She found that he'd been struck by the corner of some object or another. Apollo: Wait, what?! Phoenix: A would like that couldn't have resulted from a fall to a floor, you know. Do you understand what this means, Mr. Justice? The wound makes it crystal clear that Dr. Buff was murdered! Apollo: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Athena: Well, THAT was unexpected! Who'd have thought we'd break out of the stalemate like this! He pulled the ladder right out from under us. Apollo: (Still, if he thinks that's enough to make me back down, he's got another thing coming!) Even if the cause of death was murder, what makes you think it was the Defiant Dragons? You should know better than to hurl baseless accusations! Phoenix: Phoenix: Did you forget who you were up against, Mr. Justice? Apollo: Huh? Phoenix: You didn't actually think I'd come to court without witnesses and evidence, did you? Apollo: Wh-What are you talking about? Phoenix: I would like to request further testimony from the plaintiff. Specifically... ...I would like the court to hear how he saw one of the rebels leaving the crime scene! Apollo: He-- He-- He saw whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! Athena: If he can prove it was murder, that's the end of our client's right to the orb! Did he have this up his sleeve the whole time?! Apollo: Grrr... How could Mr. Wright do this to us? (He was just waiting to spring this trap!) Phoenix: ...Heh. Judge: Hmm... This trial has taken another unexpected turn. But I must mention, Mr. Wright, that you have yet to identify the murder weapon. Phoenix: The object used to commit the murder was not located at the scene of the crime. The murderer likely disposed of it elsewhere. Dr. Buff's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Judge: Well, I never thought we'd be deliberating the issue of murder at a civil trial. All right, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, your testimony, if you please. Atishon: Heh. Prepare to be dazzled! Dazzled by charismatic oration forged in the crucible of campaign battles! Witness Testimony -- The Rebel's Crime -- Atishon: That evening, I was walking alone, lost in thought. I passed by the doctor's house... and that's when I saw Mr. Are'bal. He was running out the front door. It was around 10 at night. Surely that must've been him fleeing the scene of his crime. A vote for me is a vote to end such violence. That is my promise to you! Judge: So the plaintiff saw a possible suspect fleeing from the doctor's residence? And it was within the window of the estimated time of death? Apollo: ......... (Datz Are'bal! What in the world were you doing there then?!) Study Photo updated in the Court Record. Phoenix: It seems that Mr. Are'bal was loitering about Kurain Village that day. There's evidence that he was in the doctor's study as well. Isn't that right, Mr. Justice? Apollo: ......Ah! You mean the suitcase? Phoenix: Exactly. He must have been in quite a rush to leave that behind. Oh, and by the way, Your Honor... ...Mr. Are'bal just so happens to be sitting in the gallery today. Datz: Ack! Phoenix: See? That's him trying to escape as we speak. Judge: Bailiff! Don't let that man get away! Datz: Wright, you backstabber! Why are you doing this to meeee?! Judge: All right. The... counsel-slash-defense may question the plaintiff-slash-witness once more. ...Ahem. Please proceed, Mr. Justice. Cross Examination -- The Rebel's Crime -- Atishon: That evening, I was walking alone, lost in thought. Press Apollo: Apollo: Why were you taking a walk? Atishon: Society is inundated with serious problems that must be solved. And as a politician... ...I'm always on the job, thinking hard about possible solutions, even on my walks. Apollo: Umm... (Thanks for the non-answer.) Atishon: While we live out our comfy lives... ...there are starving children who suffer in the back alleys of our major cities. It's not in me to ignore such suffering! A vote for me, is a vote to end hunger. ...And for world peace! Phoenix: Yes, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, we are well aware of your outstanding character. Now, please continue with your testimony. Atishon: Heh heh heh. I can practically hear my poll numbers surging. Now, on with my speech. After all, the voting public must be informed of the magnificence that is me! Atishon: I passed by the doctor's house... and that's when I saw Mr. Are'bal. Press Apollo: Apollo: Where exactly were you when you saw Mr. Are'bal? Atishon: Right here, under this tree. I saw him dashing out of Dr. Buff's front door. Apollo: And he didn't notice you? Atishon: No. I was hidden by the tree. Judge: Is it really all that important to know from where the plaintiff saw Dr. Buff? No, it isn't Apollo: No, I don't believe it bears any relevance to this case. Judge: All right, then. Will the witness please continue with his testimony? Leads back to cross-examination Yes, it is Apollo: Yes, I believe it matters a lot. I ask that it please be added to the witness's testimony. Adds statement \"I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal.\" if not already added Atishon: I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal. Press Apollo: Apollo: What were you doing under that tree? Atishon: A lack of lateral thinking... That is a politician's downfall. Apollo: What? Atishon: That is why, if I'm elected... I promise to think outside the box! Apollo: Um... uh... The question was, what were you doing under the tree, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. Atishon: Feh... I suppose I can't expect a plebeian such as yourself to understand my grand design. Apollo: (Oh, yeah? Try me, O Lord of Plebs.) Phoenix: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. I believe the court is well aware of your grand political vision. Now, let's have the rest of your testimony, if you please. Atishon: Heh, I can hardly wait for the upcoming election. Atishon: He was running out the front door. Press Apollo: Apollo: Did you notice anything unusual? Atishon: Yes, his behavior was incredibly suspicious. His eyes were darting all around as he ran off in total panic. As soon as I saw that, I knew he had done something, and it probably wasn't good. Apollo: Despite that, you still didn't report it to the police? Atishon: Who would've thought he had killed Dr. Buff? Not me. That's why I didn't report him. Judge: So the witness didn't notify the police. Is that an important statement, Mr. Justice? No, it isn't Apollo: No, it's not important. Judge: Hmm... All right, then. Let's have the witness continue with his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Yes, it is Apollo: Yes, it's important. I request that the witness add it to his testimony. Atishon: ...Feh. Sure, why not. Adds statement \"I had no idea Dr. Buff was dead. That's why I didn't call the police.\" if not already added Atishon: I had no idea Dr. Buff was dead. That's why I didn't call the police. Press Apollo: Apollo: You had no idea he was dead. In other words, you knew nothing about what had happened? Atishon: I am truly ashamed of myself. Apollo: What? Atishon: There's been a gruesome murder in my beloved village. What a fool I've been! I was thinking only of the village's future and world peace! It seems my earnest attitude and industrious nature have come back to haunt me! Apollo: (Only a politician would try to pass off self-aggrandizement as self-deprecation.) Athena: Apollo, you think this is how all politicians will be from now on? Apollo: We're all doomed if they are... Atishon: If you don't mind, I'd like to continue with my testimony. Present Study Photo or Study Diagram (after adding statement \"I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal.\") Apollo: Leads to: \"Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, rather than Mr. Are'bal...\" Atishon: It was around 10 at night. Surely that must've been him fleeing the scene of his crime. Press Apollo: Apollo: But at the time, you didn't know the doctor was dead. Is that correct? Atishon: ...It's true that I've been known as a prodigy from a very young age. Apollo: Huh? Atishon: I graduated high school and college with exceptional grades. As class president... ...I reformed stale old school traditions. My exploits were even covered in local papers. But as exceptional as I am, I can't possibly be expected to know everything at all times. Apollo: (This isn't working. He keeps bending the questions to serve his own needs.) Athena: Hang in there, Apollo! Phoenix: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. I believe the court is well aware of your exceptional nature. Now, would you please continue with your testimony? Atishon: Heh heh heh. I have the upcoming election in the bag. Atishon: A vote for me is a vote to end such violence. That is my promise to you! Press Apollo: Apollo: So, how do you actually intend to end such violence? Atishon: Elite politicians such as myself never reveal their strategies. Did you really think I would divulge such sensitive information to the likes of you? Apollo: Yeah, but, surely you have some sort of campaign platform you're running on? Atishon: ................................... ...No comment. Apollo: (Clearly, his is a platform, told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.) Before adding either statement Athena: They're accusing the Defiant Dragons of murder. If this sticks, we'll lose the orb! Apollo: Yeah, we need to sink Paul Atishon's testimony before it's too late. (Mr. Wright is pulling out all the stops. Then again, I'd expect nothing less from him.) After adding statement \"I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal.\", but before adding statement \"I had no idea Dr. Buff was dead. That's why I didn't call the police.\" Athena: He saw Mr. Are'bal from under that tree? Apollo, maybe there's some sort of an inconsistency there. Apollo: Hmm, I wonder... Athena: Why don't we review the evidence? Apollo: (Yeah. Maybe there's something we overlooked.) After adding statement \"I had no idea Dr. Buff was dead. That's why I didn't call the police.\", but before adding statement \"I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal.\" Athena: He didn't know the doctor was dead? Well, I guess that makes sense, considering the body was inside the study. Apollo: Right, how could he have known? (Guess I could find out where our weaselly witness was when he saw Datz.) After adding both statements Apollo: He said he saw Datz from under the tree. If that's true, then... Athena: Did you figure something out? Apollo: Yeah, I think he's hiding something. Let's take another look at the evidence, Athena. Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, rather than Mr. Are'bal... ...wasn't there's something else that should've had your undivided attention? Atishon: Like what? ...Oh, yes, of course! A politician must also keep his finger on the electorate's pulse, and focus on the nation's-- Apollo: Sorry, but you're way off. Atishon: I am? Hmm... Judge: Would you care to explain, Mr. Justice? Apollo: If the witness saw Mr. Are'bal from his position here... ...then he should've also been able to see the doctor's body. After all, it was right next to a huge window. Judge: Why, I believe you have a point there! Apollo: With the body THAT clearly visible to the witness... ...it's unthinkable that he wouldn't have reported it to the police! Phoenix: Ah! Judge: Hmm... Would the witness care to respond? Atishon: ........................... Apollo: ......... (Did he... fall asleep?) Judge: ...Um, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Atishon: ........................... Judge: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson!!! Atishon: Huh?! Oh, um. Hmm... There are many sides to any issue. Apollo: (What did I ever do to deserve this?) In any case, I'd like the court to acknowledge in the inconsistency in the witness's testimony. Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, did you really see Mr. Are'bal? Atishon: Yes! .................. Apollo: Apollo: Where do you think you're going?! Atishon: Oh, I thought I would return to my seat, seeing as I had already answered the question. Apollo: This isn't some small town hall debate, so you just stay right there until I say we're through. Atishon: I-I'll have to run that by my campaign manager before I... Apollo: Apollo: .........*glare* Atishon: *gulp* Phoenix: ...Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. I think it's time for you to come clean. Atishon: Huh?! Apollo: ...So then, does this mean he DIDN'T see Mr. Are'bal? Phoenix: As your lawyer, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson... ...I advise you divulge that matter we discussed. Silence is no longer an option. Atishon: ...Err, are you sure about this? I'm in the midst of running for office! I can't afford to let any strange rumors get out. Phoenix: Don't worry. You won't suffer any blowback for what you're about to reveal. Judge: \"Blowback\"? I'm not sure I like the sound of that, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Not to worry, Your Honor. Nothing untoward will come of this, I promise. Now then, Mr. Justice. Remember how it was an anonymous caller that reported the doctor's death? Apollo: Come to think of it... Apollo: Ema, who was the first one to discover the body? Ema: About that... Whoever it was, it seems they wanted to remain anonymous. Apollo: What? Ema: It happens now and then. Some people would rather not get involved with the police. Apollo: Wait... You're not saying that... Phoenix: Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. The anonymous source who contacted the police after discovering the body was... ...my client, Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson. Apollo: Wh-What?! (Y-You don't say...) Phoenix: So you see, he played his part as a concerned citizen -- quite admirably, if I may say so. Isn't that right? Atishon: .........Y-Yes, indeed... In our society today, there are too many who choose indifference over righteous action. But I don't number among them. That's why I did my duty as a concerned citizen. One might call me THE model citizen -- one worthy of standing above all the rest! Apollo: (What a real standard-bearer he is, reporting it anonymously.) Phoenix: ...Oh, and by the way, Mr. Justice. Wasn't there someone else at the scene of the crime when my client discovered the body? Apollo: ...Oh, um, you mean Mr. Are'bal? He would have been leaving the doctor's house right around then... Wait, th-that means...! Phoenix: Yes, it does. In short... ...what my client witnessed was Mr. Are'bal fleeing the scene of a heinous murder! Apollo: ...Aaaaaaah! Phoenix: And that's not all! Based on what we've heard so far... ...Mr. Are'bal looked exceedingly suspicious, and that's putting it mildly. We already know the Defiant Dragons threatened the doctor with bodily harm. And now that they've killed him, the so-called Orb Transfer Agreement is null and void! Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Athena: A-Apollo! If we don't come up wit with some sort of counterargument...! Apollo: A-And what sort of evidence do you have? Can you actually prove that it was Mr. Are'bal who killed the doctor? Athena: That move had \"desperate\" written all over it. Apollo: It's all I've got, so I'm going with it! Phoenix: ...Evidence? I suppose it's true that I don't have any... Apollo: I-I knew it! Phoenix: But I do have another witness. Apollo: You do? Phoenix: You should know I always come fully prepared, Mr. Justice. And my new witness will provide testimony proving Mr. Are'bal's guilt. Apollo: ...Gnrggh! Athena: A new witness? I wonder who it could be. Judge: ...Very well. Bailiff, please summon our new witness. In the meantime, the court will take a brief recess. I would like both sides to use this time to prepare properly, understood? May 17District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Apollo: Wow. I knew Mr. Wright would put up a tough fight, but... Athena: Yeah! Just when I thought we had him, he'd turn the tables on us. He really is the Turnabout Terror. Apollo: (We can't let him blindside us again.) Datz: Looks like they've got me again! Three times in one year! \"Datz\" a new record! Har har har har har har! Apollo: Datz, please... No more new records -- or bad puns, while you're at it. It's hard enough trying to help you as it is. Datz: Roger that. I'll be more careful next time! Dhurke: Datz, is what Mr. Wright said true? Did you really pay a visit to Dr. Buff that night? Datz: Sure did. Can't remember the exact time, though. All I know is he wouldn't hand over the orb. Someone put it in his head that we rebels were dangerous. That's why he threw me out. Apollo: So the doctor was still alive when Datz last saw him. Athena: We'll still have to prove it, though. Dhurke: ...Better brace yourself, son. The next witness's testimony could make or break this case. Apollo: Yeah, I know. Hey, where's Trucy? Athena: She went to go see her dad. Apollo: Hmm... Maybe she's still mad. Athena: More like worried. Worried that this trial will create a rift between you two... ...and that you might then leave the agency. Apollo: Ha ha ha. She has an active imagination. Bailiff: Excuse me. The trial will be resuming shortly. Apollo: Well, let's go see what new testimony awaits us. May 17District Court - Courtroom No. 6 Judge: All right, court is back in session. Mr. Wright, you said you had a witness...? Phoenix: Your Honor, I would like to call the lone survivor of the doctor's murder to the stand. Apollo: (Wait.. He can't mean... that Sarge is here?) You mean Dr. Buff's reclusive son? How did you get him to cooperate? Phoenix: ...Nothing a little persuasion couldn't handle. The poor child only agreed to help if it meant catching the killer. Apollo: (Getting a kid like that to overcome his fear... Now that's impressive.) Athena: This must be really important testimony for the kid to come out in public like this. Judge: Very well, Mr. Wright. Please call your witness to the stand. Judge: .........Oh, my! Sarge: Sergeant Buff at your service, sir! Apollo: ...He's here as the drone? Really? Judge: ...Um, Mr. Wright? What exactly is the meaning of this? Phoenix: Past trauma has rendered it impossible for the witness to venture into public. Leaving home was hard enough. And it seems leaving the witness lobby was just too much. But I would still like to continue with testimony delivered via this drone. Judge: Hmm... I understand it must be terrible to lose one's father like that... ...but testimony via a remote control toy? .........Well, let's take things for a spin and see how it goes. Apollo: (Just who's piloting this trial, anyway?!) Athena: The judge sure warmed up to the idea fast. Apollo: I think the phrase you're looking for is \"gave up.\" Sarge: You disappoint me, Corporal Justice! To think I once called you comrade! Apollo: AAAAAAAAAGH! Sarge: Defending the man who killed Papa?! That's full-on treason, soldier! I hereby demote you back to \"private\"! Athena: \"Corporal\"? \"Private\"? What's he talking about, Apollo? Apollo: It's... a long story. Judge: Now then, are you ready to testify, youngster? Sarge: Locked and loaded, sir! Ready to rain lead down upon the perpetrator! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Witness Testimony -- What Happened That Evening -- Sarge: Papa met with someone the night he died. I didn't have eyes on the ground, as I'd already mounted my siege defense, but... ...I did hear him arguing with someone in his study! From my window, I saw the one designated \"Datz\" getting ejected from the premises. After that, the man lingered around the perimeter for some time. He must have regrouped and killed my papa in the study later -- I just know it! Judge: Hmm... So he was thrown out, but later returned and committed the murder, did he? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. So the man my client saw... ...really must have been the fleeing Mr. Are'bal. Datz: Datz: Objeeeeection! Wright, you backstabbing, no good--! I-I didn't kill no one! Sarge: It's the enemy! Ready all missiles! And... FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRE!! Datz: WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA!!! Sarge: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Capitalist pig! I'll turn you into pork stroganoff! And that's just a taste of my ultimate anti-swine weapon! Apollo: (Whoa! It fires missiles, too?!) Judge: ...Yes, well, the witness is all yours, Mr. Justice. Cross Examination -- What Happened That Evening -- Sarge: Papa met with someone the night he died. Press Apollo: Apollo: Your father met with \"someone\"? Could you be more specific? Sarge: No. I was in the midst of a crucial defensive siege operation. Apollo: Right... You're referring to how you don't leave your room, correct? Sarge: You never know where the enemy might be lurking outside the siege perimeter. Apollo: What about, you know, school? Sarge: Oh, uhhh... I don't go to boot camp! I'm a soldier! A sergeant doesn't associate with rookies still too green to fight! Apollo: (With a kid like this, I bet Dr. Buff won't be getting any rest in the afterlife, either.) Judge: Hmm... It was very brave of you to come to the courthouse today. But what was that you said about a siege defense? Sarge: Oh, that? Well... Sarge: I didn't have eyes on the ground, as I'd already mounted my siege defense, but... Press Apollo: Apollo: Um, Sarge? I've always wondered... ...who or what are you battling? Sarge: ! Th-That's... classified. Apollo: Even so, it may be relevant to this case. Phoenix: Phoenix: Umm... I don't know if YOU'RE the right person to be asking things like that... Athena: That's right. Such matter need to be handled with a certain delicacy. Apollo: Oh, ha ha ha. I guess curiosity got the better of me. Sarge: You're all talk and no action, soldier! Out on the battlefield, it ain't the number of pretty words in yer repertoire... ...but the number of bullets in yer gun belt that counts! Apollo: (Easy for you to say. You're the one with all of them. Judge: Would the witness please tell the court what he saw and heard that night? Present Sarge's Drone Apollo: Leads to: \"Sarge, are you hiding something from me?\" Sarge: ...I did hear him arguing with someone in his study! Press Apollo: Apollo: What was the argument about? Sarge: I heard things like, \"Where's the orb?!\" and \"Are you Defiant Dragons really criminals?!\" It sounded real volatile, like a war might break out any second! Apollo: (So the two of them had an argument when Datz came to get the orb.) Did you see or hear anything else? Sarge: Yeah. I heard them arguing, and then, silence. Sarge: From my window, I saw the one designated \"Datz\" getting ejected from the premises. Press Apollo: Apollo: How was Mr. Are'bal acting? Sarge: Like a conquered trooper retreating with his tail between his legs. Apollo: A \"trooper\"...? Well, I guess he does dress like he's in the military. Athena: I bet those two would have really hit it off had they met under different circumstances. Apollo: Yeah, I can see that. Sarge: And so, the defeated soldier was expelled. But that wasn't the end. Sarge: After that, the man lingered around the perimeter for some time. Press Apollo: Apollo: That... does seem suspicious. Sarge: He kept hiding behind trees and telephone poles, and stealing glances at our house. Apollo: Well, he couldn't exactly leave without the orb...) Sarge: I bet he was angry that he'd been kicked out. Sarge: He must have regrouped and killed my papa in the study later -- I just know it! Press Apollo: Apollo: But don't you keep your front door unlocked? If so, anyone could've gotten in.. Sarge: That's true. Papa didn't keep our house locked up. He said there was no need because there were only good people in Kurain Village. Apollo: (Yet he ended up dead, anyway.) Sarge: Only a monster could do what they did to my kind, trusting Papa! There will be no mercy! I vow swift and terrible vengeance! I'll carpet-bomb the killer with everything in my arsenal! FIIIIIIRE!!! Judge: While I sympathize with you, witness, you will refrain from firing Gatling guns in this court. Athena: So Sarge saw Datz, too. Apollo: And just when I thought things couldn't get any worse. I wonder why he hung around after getting thrown out? Athena: I hate to say this, but if Datz is proven to be the killer... ...we'll lose the orb to the plaintiff. So our only option is to prove the Defiant Dragons had nothing to do with the murder! Apollo: Sarge, are you hiding something from me? Sarge: H-How dare you question your superior officer like that! You wanna get in on this stroganoff action with pig-boy over there, soldier?! Apollo: Sorry, but I'm afraid lawyers are missile-proof. Sarge: Wh-What?! Judge: Would the defense care to explain? Apollo: It's simple, Your Honor. Just as he is able to see what is happening in court right now... ...Sarge was able to see what happening in the study then. With his cherished drone, of course. Judge: Ahhh! Now that you mention it... And to think, the answer was right before our eyes this whole time. Apollo: Sarge! You were perfectly capable of patrolling the study that night! So you must've seen something! Sarge: Aaaaaaaaaagh! I'm hit! What is this strange new weaponry you're using against me?! Apollo: Courtroom warriors don't use guns or missiles, because evidence is our weapon of choice! And the evidence has exposed your bald-faced lie! My truth bomb, Sarge... has stripped your defenses bare! Sarge: A t-t... truth bomb?! Noooooooooooo! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH! Mayday, mayday!!! I'm going doooooooown!!! Judge: Oh, my! Are you all right?! Sarge: *cough* *sputter* Evidence... Never have I seen such fearsome ordnance. Apollo: Tell it to us straight, Sarge. After all, you want to help your father, don't you? Sarge: Papa... Apollo: Yes. You want to find out who killed him, don't you? So please. Tell us what you saw that night. Sarge: ...It's... It's... It's not what you think. I-I... I... I didn't see anything. I swear...! Apollo: ...You sure? You seem awfully stressed for someone who didn't see anything. Sarge: ...Grrrrrrr! Apollo: UWAAAAAAHHH! ...S-Sarge. You need to answer my question. Sarge: Shut your piehole, maggot! It'll be a scorching day in Siberia before a lowly private like you orders me around! Apollo: (...What's with him and Siberia, of all places? But if a scorching day is what it'll take, then maybe it's time to turn up the heat.) Hey, Athena. You think a therapy session might help? Athena: Well, it could help alleviate some of his anxiety. NOISE LEVEL100% Athena: ...Plus, I'm picking up a lot of discord in Sarge's voice. That usually means the patient wants to say something, but can't for some reason. Apollo: And in Sarge's case, I imagine whatever's plaguing him is pretty severe. In that case, I leave it to you and your Mood Matrix magic! Athena: You got it! Your Honor, I believe I can be of help here. Judge: Time for a therapy session, is it, Ms. Cykes? Athena: Yes. It will help the witness with his anxiety -- maybe even enough to testify! Judge: Then by all means, please bring the poor child out into the light of day. ...Oh, but I assume this will be all right with you, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Why not? It's not like we all haven't been through this before. Sarge: Wh-What are you butting in for, lady?! There ain't a place on this battlefield for you! Athena: Athena: I beg to differ, Sarge. This G.I. Jane's always ready for a fight in the courtroom! And wait until you see what I've got in my arsenal -- analytical psychology! With it, I'm going to blow a big ol' hole in the armor you've built around your heart! Sarge: UWAAAAAAH! First evidence, now analytical psychology?! Where are these WMDs coming from?! ...W-Well, if it's a battle you want, bring it on! You may have started this war, but I'm going to end it, Corpswoman Cykes! Athena: You got it, Sarge. Time to seek out the agony buried deep in your heart. Widget: Brace yourself! Sarge: I stayed in my room with my drone that evening. Sarge: I heard Datz and Papa arguing with each other. Sarge: Datz got kicked out, but I saw him still hanging around outside. Pinpoint Surprised marker Apollo: Leads to: \"That's strange...\" Sarge: I was in my room, so I didn't know Papa was dead until the next day. Pinpoint Surprised marker Apollo: Leads to: \"That's strange... You reacted with shock when you discovered your father's body... \" Apollo: So I'm looking for unexpected emotions and unnatural reactions, right? Athena: Right -- emotions and reactions that don't fit the content of his testimony. When you find one, make sure you point it out to me. Also, remember not to view his emotional reactions in isolation. Sometimes, it's important to see how they change from one statement to the next. Apollo: Okay, I'll give it a try. Apollo: That's strange... You reacted with shock when you discovered your father's body... ...yet, you weren't nearly as shocked then as when you saw Mr. Are'bal. Normally, you'd expect the death of one's father to be much more impactful. Sarge: ...Enemy fire! Direct hit!!! Athena: That IS strange. I wonder what it could mean. Apollo: Well, we know he wasn't as affected by his father's death as he should've been. And I think I know why. Athena: Oh? Apollo: Sarge, you weren't as shocked at seeing your father's body as seeing Mr. Are'bal because... You're scared of Mr. Are'bal Apollo: Maybe you were scared of him? Sarge: Why you--! How could you even THINK I was scared of that capitalist pig! Apollo: So you weren't scared? Sarge: Listen up, trainee! You feckless amateurs don't even know what true fear is! Naïve little babies like you wouldn't last two seconds out there. So he's your first lesson, private! A heaping spoonful of true, battlefield terror! Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Athena: I think that means you were wrong. But there's no need to look so bitter about it, Apollo. Apollo: No, but that was some bitter medicine... (Ugh, the aftertaste of failure...) Leads back to: \"Sarge, you weren't as shocked at seeing your father's body as seeing Mr. Are'bal because...\" You'd already seen his body Leads to: \"Sarge...\" Something else shocked you Apollo: Did... something else shock you when you saw Mr. Are'bal? Something even more shocking than your father's death? Athena: Hmm, like what exactly, Apollo? Apollo: I don't know... Maybe a mouse or a cockroach? Athena: Eeeuuuwww, gross!!! Sarge: Foolish cannon fodder! Vermin are powerless in the fact of my deadly arsenal! I'll pump 'em full of lead! Apollo: Sounds kinda messy, don't you think? Sarge: ...Ah! Th-Then I'll develop new weaponry! Maybe a flamethrower'd do the trick... Apollo: S-Sure... As long as you keep it \"for vermin use only\"... Athena: Guess it wasn't something like mice or cockroaches after all, huh. Apollo: No, but it was worth a try -- especially to see your reaction. (*sigh* What else could it be...?) Leads back to: \"Sarge, you weren't as shocked at seeing your father's body as seeing Mr. Are'bal because...\" Apollo: Sarge... Maybe the truth is, you left your room that night. And that's when you saw it -- your father's body. Sarge: I-I saw no such thing! Apollo: Really? You didn't see his body? All right then, what DID you see? Sarge: Err... NOISE LEVEL70% Athena: Look, Apollo! We've lost some noise! Apollo: So, just as I suspected... he really did see something. Sarge! Please. Tell us what you saw. Sarge: Ooh... B-B-But... .................. ........................... I-I... The moment I saw it, ooh... ...I-I.. I couldn't bear it. I couldn't stand to lose yet another loved one. Apollo: Huh? (Am I missing something here?) Is that you weren't very shocked when you found out your father was dead? Because you had already sensed he was a goner somehow? Sarge: M-Maybe... Apollo: Please, Sarge. What was it you saw on the night of your father's murder? Sarge: Ooh... Gah gah gah gah. I-I... I saw... ...Agh. Gah. Hrgh. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! UHWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Apollo: Wh-What's happening?! (I don't like where this is going...) Sarge: YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH! NO MORE! NO MORE, PLEEEEEEAAASE!!! Athena: Eeeeeek! Widget: Help! Sarge: I've confiscated your little toy! The battlefield has no place for unauthorized equipment! Athena: W-Widget...! A-Apollo! I can't continue the rest of the session without him! Judge: C-Calm yourself this instant, witness! I hereby order you to submit to your therapy session! What in blazes...?! Sarge: Lookit me! I'm judge, jury, and executioner now! I hereby convene a military tribunal! Apollo: Whoa, whoa... This has gone way too far. Judge: B-Bailiff! Arrest that drone this instant! Sarge: RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWRRRRRR! Bailiff: Stop resisting! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGHHHHH! If you don't come quietly, I'll--! Sarge: FIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRE! Bailiff: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Athena: Give Widget back right-- EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEKKK!!! .................................................................. Athena: *huff* *puff* *cough, cough* Whew, finally got him back. Apollo: Nice work. Judge: Hmm... This witness is truly a handful. Sarge: Ooh... hup, two, three, four... Uwoooooooooooooooooooooooooooh! Phoenix: Ms. Cykes, what is the witness's current psychological state? Athena: Let's see... He's emotionally all over the map. Apollo: So his out-of-control emotions are in control of him, huh. Does that mean we can calm him down if we can figure out the root cause? Athena: Yes. So let's see what we can find. Sarge! Can you hear me? Sarge: Ooh... I-Is that you, Corpswoman Cykes? Athena: I'm here. Now, I want you to take a few deep breaths. Just try to relax. Try it with me. Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out. Sarge: In... Out... In... Out... Athena: And now... Let your emotions take you where they will. Go on, just let it all out! Sarge: UHWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!!! All forces, attaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack! Apollo: (...That's the LEAST relaxing breathing exercise I've ever seen.) Sarge: Datz was still hanging around after he got kicked out when... Sarge: ...I heard more fighting, and I got worried about Papa. Sarge: So I left my room, but suddenly... Sarge: ...I got dizzy and passed out. Sarge: I remember a flame lighting up the room... Probe Flames Apollo: Leads to: \"That's it!\" Sarge: ...and Papa grinning with delight. Probe Flames Apollo: Leads to: \"That's it!\" Sarge: That's when he must have been killed. If only I hadn't passed out! Apollo: So he has two out-of-control emotions, huh. And all we have to do is find out what's causing them to run wild like this? Athena: Yes. Whatever the cause, it should appear somewhere in the Mood Matrix. Let me know if you think you've found it. Apollo: Ugh... Easier said than done. Don't suppose you have any ideas on where to start? Athena: Well... I would think about Sarge's personality and his past. Those are the things that shape a person's emotions. You should be able to find something to work with from there! Apollo: That's it! Sarge... You were overcome with shock and fear when you saw those flames, weren't you? Sarge: Was I...? Apollo: Yes. Just six months ago... ...you and your mother were caught up in an arsonist's blaze. So it's no wonder you would be extremely scared of fire. Sarge: ...Y-Yes, that does make sense. Athena: And maybe, just maybe... ...your subconscious fear of fire was what caused you to withdraw from the world. Sarge: What do you mean, Corpswoman Cykes? Athena: In the outside world, you were bound to come across all sorts of fire. Candles, cigarettes... heck, even the grill at a diner. Even if it's not that often, just the idea that you might see them... ...grew bigger and bigger until you couldn't shut it out. Sarge: ...! I... I think you might be onto something. Candles, cigarettes... Just thinking about them sends a chill down my spine. Apollo: (Wow, the things I take for granted.) Sarge: Now I see. I was afraid... Afraid of the fire. Strange, I didn't even realize it myself. Apollo: About that fire, Sarge... Can you tell me what it was burning? Athena: Just stay calm and maybe something will come to you. Sarge: Oh, umm... ............. ..................Oh! I'm starting to remember! I-It was...! It was that relic! That relic Papa was studying... It was on fire! Apollo: The orb... was on fire? Sarge: Mm-hm. It's still kind of fuzzy...  ...but yes, the \"orb\" was burning right in front of Papa. And there... in the flames was... ...Mama? Yes! Now I remember... I saw Mama appear amid the dancing flames! Apollo: Wait... WHAAAAAAAAAT?! NOISE LEVEL30% Apollo: Wh-What's going on here? Athena: Maybe it's a memory from the fire that killed his mother. Hmm... He might be confusing it with what really happened when his father died. Apollo: So let me guess... More therapy? Athena: Yep. But this time, it seems there's an inconsistency in his statements. And I think we should be able to prove that with the evidence at hand. Apollo: (I hope this inconsistency is the key... ...to proving that the relic is really the Founder's Orb!) Sarge: Datz was still hanging around after he got kicked out when... Sarge: ...I heard more fighting, and I got worried about Papa. Sarge: So I left my room, but suddenly, I got dizzy and passed out. Sarge: I remember a flame lighting up the room, and Papa grinning with delight. Sarge: The relic was on fire, and I saw Mama's face inside. Sarge: That's when he must have been killed. If only I hadn't passed out! Present Founder's Orb Apollo: Leads to: \"Don't blame yourself, Sarge.\" Athena: I believe Sarge's fear of fire is triggering a past memory. As a result, the memory of what he really saw is being suppressed. When he tries to remember, the past memory is being overlaid onto the more recent one. Apollo: Wow, the mind sure is a tricky beast. So, I'll just have to find an inconsistency? Athena: Right. Once you find an inconsistent statement... ...present the evidence that proves it. Apollo: (The main issue here is when the doctor was murdered. Was he really killed while Datz was there?) Apollo: Don't blame yourself, Sarge. After all, even if you hadn't passed out... ...the outcome would've been the same. Sarge: What do you mean? Apollo: I'm talking about the time of death. Your father wasn't killed right after you left your room. Sarge: Wh-What?! Explain yourself at once, Private Justice! Apollo: You said you saw your father burning the orb, right? But that night, he went out to hide it in a cave. So, what you saw, Sarge... ...was something that happened before your father left to hide the orb. Sarge: Ah! Apollo: So you see, you didn't pass out right before he was killed. You passed out right before he left for the cave, to hide the orb in the ruins within. Sarge: S-So, even if I hadn't passed out... Apollo: That's right. The outcome would've been exactly the same. That's because your father, Dr. Buff, was killed after he returned from the ruins. And therefore, Sarge, there's no need to blame yourself. Sarge: Oh... I see... .............. ................................ Private Justice... Can... Can you really say I bear no blame in this? Apollo: ...Why do you ask? Sarge: .........Because... the truth is... ...if I hadn't engaged in my siege defense, Papa would still be alive. Apollo: Sarge... Sarge: Papa wished nothing more than for me to lead a happy, healthy life. That's why he quit his job and moved us out, away from the big city. But even then, I didn't have the courage to set foot into the outside world. And in the end... ...I failed to make Papa's wish come true. Sarge: ..................... ???: ...Um, Sarge? Athena: If you want to make your father's wish come true... If that's what you really want... ...then who's to say it's too late? Why don't you take the first step now? Sarge: ...My first step? Athena: That's right. You can cast off all your regret. You can stop standing still and start moving forward. You have the power within you. I know from experience. I know what's it like to feel like you do. But only you... only you can decide to take the first step! Sarge: ................................ Apollo: If you don't change your tactics now, Sarge... ...the victory you seek in the war you're waging will always lie beyond your grasp. Sarge: ................................................ Hmm... I think I understand now. I've... I've made up my mind! Apollo: ! Sarge: As of this moment... ...I will suspend my siege defense indefinitely! Apollo: ...............Huh? ???: S-Sergeant Buff, r-reporting for duty. Apollo: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! I-I-I thought you were a guy! Athena: You're DEFINTELY not the gruff drill sergeant I envisioned! ???: W-Well, my mama was in the Russian army. Phoenix: I was just as shocked, but it certainly explained a few things when I found out, too. May I introduce to you Miss Armie Buff, age twelve. (Changed from [May I introduce to you Miss Armie Buff, age 12.] in the original release) Apollo: N-No way... Armie: Careful, soldier! Don't forget I could blow you away at a moment's notice! Athena: S-She's just too cute... Apollo: So... Have you always been in a wheelchair, Sarge? Armie: Negative. Only since I was injured... in the fire. Judge: Umm... Your voice sounds awfully different from before. Armie: My drone features a voice modulation device. It's just one of my army's many technological marvels. Judge: Well, you fooled me. I thought some twenty-something military fanatic was at the controls. Armie: I-If it's all the same to you, troops, I'd like to continue my testimony! I've just remembered something! And it's as crisp and clear as a trumpet at roll call. Apollo: What did you remember? Armie: It wasn't my mother who appeared in the burning orb. It was some lady Papa had shown me a picture of a long time ago. He said it was the Holy Mother, the founder of Khura'inism. She appeared right there, right in the burning orb! Apollo: Huh...?! Phoenix: What did you just say?! NOISE LEVEL0%BYE BYE Athena: The Holy Mother of Khura'inism was in the burning orb? Wh-What does that even mean? Phoenix: ...I have a bad feeling about this. Apollo: Could it be...? Could this explain what Sarge means by the Holy Mother appearing in the burning orb? Present Research Notes Apollo: Leads to: \"Dr. Buff's research notes? What do they have to do with this?\" Present anything else Apollo: Armie: What's that? Apollo: A piece of related evidence. Wouldn't you agree? Although, to be honest, I'd have to plead the fifth if you asked me how certain I was. Sarge: Private! Did you really think such a cockamamie plan would rout out the enemy?! Apollo: Yiiiiiikes! {I'd better be more careful!) Athena: If the orb was burning, maybe the evidence you're looking for has to do with fire. Apollo: Yeah, I know. Leads back to: \"Could this explain what Sarge means by the Holy Mother appearing in the burning orb?\" Athena: Dr. Buff's research notes? What do they have to do with this? Apollo: Look at this! The burning orb, the appearance of the founder -- this part points to both! Present third stanza of Song of Ceremony Apollo: Leads to: \"There's a legend about the orb involving a mysterious riddle.\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: It's all... right here! Athena: Umm.. I'm not seeing it. Apollo: Well, it's... Maybe you can explain it, Athena. Athena: I'M not the one who's supposed to explain things when YOU'RE the one presenting! Apollo: (Yikes, she's really mad. I'd better come up with something before her anger burns me to a crisp.) Leads back to: \"Look at this! The burning orb, the appearance of the founder -- this part points to both!\" Apollo: There's a legend about the orb involving a mysterious riddle. And this song, in turn, is said to contain the key to solving it. If the legend is true, then I believe the answer lies in this part of the song: \"Offer thy prayers as fervent as fire Only then shall the Holy Mother return.\" ...Well? Anyone see where I'm going with this? Phoenix: Prayers as fervent as fire... ...Ah! You're supposed to... set the orb on fire? Apollo: The whole stanza seems to suggest that the founder will appear if the orb is set on fire. Athena: ...Wait! S-So the doctor! He...! Apollo: ...Yes, Athena. He had solved the ancient riddle of the Founder's Orb! Judge: Oh, my! Armie: Papa was a great archeologist. So I believe in him... and I want to believe... I want to believe he achieved his long-time dream of solving that riddle before he died. Apollo: Well, we won't know for sure... until we try it for ourselves. Armie: Yes, do it, Private Justice. Please! I want to see what Papa was searching for with my own eyes! Phoenix: Phoenix: The, uh... The plaintiff must object to this! Apollo: Apollo: The plaintiff will stand down and be quiet! Phoenix: Phoenix: Y-You don't have the right to set a precious relic like that on fire! Apollo: Apollo: Oh, but I do. All I needed was Sarge's permission. Since we still don't know if this treasure if the Founder's Orb or the Crystal of Ami Fey... ...any ownership rights the doctor had now belong to his daughter. Therefore, you have absolutely no right to stop us! Phoenix ...Gnrk! Judge: Very well, Mr. Justice. I never thought I'd be saying this, but you may burn the evidence. Apollo: All right, here we go! Apollo: Look! Athena: A-Apollo! The inside of the orb... It's melting! Apollo: There's something in there... Ahhhhhhhhhh! Dh-Dhurke! Isn't she...? Dhurke: Her garb leaves no room for doubt. It's the founder herself! Face and all... Dhurke: I-I don't understand. The greatest of taboos in Khura'inism... ...is the depiction of the founder's face. Yet here it is, hidden within this orb! Founder's Orb updated in the Court Record. Apollo: Sorry, Mr. Wright, but as you can see, the issue is \"crystal\" clear. This figure is the Holy Mother, founder of Khura'inism. And based on that, this must be none other than the Founder's Orb! Phoenix: Phoenix: B-Be that as it may, Mr. Are'bal still may have killed the doctor! If so, it would render the Orb Transfer Agreement null and void! Apollo: Don't play dumb, Mr. Wright. The truth of the matter has already been proven! Dr. Buff wasn't killed right after Sarge saw Mr. Are'bal. It happened after the doctor came back from hiding the orb. And you've no proof that Mr. Are'bal was still around at the time! Phoenix: ...Urrrrrrrgh. Apollo: Your claim that the Defiant Dragons were behind the crime doesn't hold water. And that means the Orb Transfer Agreement is still perfectly valid. Phoenix: ...Arrrrrrrgh. Apollo: Admit it, Mr. Wright. I just burned your whole case to the ground! Phoenix: Ooh... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Apollo: (I won? I actually won?) Judge: M-Mr. Wright! Would you care to respond? Phoenix: .........R-Respond? ...Um... Apollo: (I didn't think so!) Athena: Wait, did we just win? Did we actually beat the Turnabout Terror?! You're amazing, Apollo! Atishon: Don't just stand there, Wright! Do something! Phoenix: ...Umm, well... I don't think there's any digging out of this hole. Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, I think it's time for your concession speech. I have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that this is the Founder's Orb. The facts don't lie, but you obviously do. How's that for a campaign slogan? Atishon: Wh-Why you contemptuous peasant...! Judge: ...Hmmm. I think this is a good time to wrap up this trial. If both parties have no further objections, I will render my verdict. Apollo: No objections here, Your Honor. Phoenix: Err... Um... No ob-- Atishon: Atishon: You can't do this. The crystal is mine! I'll lose the election if I lose that crystal! Phoenix: I'm sorry, but there's really nothing more I can do. Atishon: ...You haven't forgotten about our little chat... have you? Phoenix: ! .......... Apollo: (What's going on here?) Phoenix: Phoenix: ...Y-Your Honor. I...I object to the defense's last claim! Apollo: What?! Phoenix: I don't believe they have truly proven that the relic is indeed the Founder's Orb. Apollo: Apollo: Mr. Wright. I don't think even you could bluff your way out of this one! What possible argument could you have to claim that this isn't the Founder's Orb? Phoenix .........Um, about that... ...................Oh, of course! Apollo: .......... (H-He can't possibly have hit on something...) Phoenix The defense's assertion is incomplete, and here's why. Their claim that this relic is the Founder's Orb is based on a legend. (Changed from [The defense is basing their claim that this relic is the Founder's Orb on a legend.] in the original release) And that legend claims that the founder will return when the riddle is solved at last. Apollo: Right. And that's what happened. The founder was revealed for all to see. Phoenix: But Mr. Justice, what about the rest of the legend? Apollo: Huh? Phoenix: According to the legend, once the founder returned... ...she would bestow spiritual power onto the person who solved the riddle. Apollo: ..........Y-You're kidding, right? Phoenix: Well, Mr. Justice? Do you feel great spiritual power coursing through your veins? Apollo: Um.......... no. B-But receiving spiritual powers and stuff... It's all just mystic mumbo-jumbo, right? Phoenix: Maybe so, but you're the one basing your claim on said legend. And what we saw here does not fully fulfill it, does it? Apollo: N-No, but... Phoenix: Consequently... You cannot rightfully claim that this is the Founder's Orb! Judge: .......... Atishon: .......... Apollo: .......... .......... Apollo: (What's gotten into him? Why is Mr. Wright doing this?) Judge: Hmm... It would appear that Mr. Wright has lost a few of his marbles. Phoenix: ...Th-That couldn't be further from the truth, Your Honor. Judge: In any case... I believe this a good time for a recess. Both sides will have twenty minutes to prepare. (Changed from [I believe this a good time for a recess. Both sides will have 20 minutes to prepare.] in the original release) I ask that all arguments be ready by then. Oh, and Mr. Wright? You'd do well to wash up and find your missing marbles by then, too. Phoenix: .................... May 17District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Athena: Mr. Wright is sure acting funny. I mean, he's famous for going out on a limb, but that last assertion was just plain crazy. Apollo: It's either a bluff or a Hail Mary. Either way, it doesn't make much sense. Trucy: ...Maybe there's something we're missing here. Although, he seemed perfectly normal when we spoke earlier. Athena: ...Apollo, I have a bad feeling about this. I'm going to go check up on him. Apollo: (What's going on with you, Mr. Wright...?) ???: Hey. Private Justice. Apollo: ...Oh, Sarge. Armie: I forgot to mention something. O-On the night of Papa's murder, a strange thing happened. Apollo: Oh? But why are you only telling me about it now? Armie: Well... I didn't say anything before because I thought Papa's death was an accident. But now that we know otherwise, I figured it might be important. Apollo: (There's still more to this case?) Armie: When I left my room and lost consciousness, I passed out right here. Apollo: That's right above the coffee bar. Armie: Mm-hm. But when I came to... ...someone was pushing my wheelchair. Apollo: What?! Armie: I was so scared, I beat a hasty retreat -- as fast as my wheels could take me! Apollo: Do you know who it was? Armie: No. It was pitch black. Plus, I fled to my room so fast, I didn't even have a chance to turn on the lights. Apollo: Maybe it was your father. Armie: No, he would have said something to me. Besides, I'd have known if it was him. Apollo: So then, it could've been... ...your father's real killer? Armie: My thoughts exactly. Apollo: But you didn't report this to the police? Armie: ...I-It didn't even occur to me. Apollo: It's okay. You were obviously still upset, so don't bear yourself up over it. Dhurke: Apollo, this could be really important information. I think the act of pushing Sarge's wheelchair could be part of some bigger scheme. It's hard to see why else the killer would do such a thing. Apollo: (Guess I should take her statement down as evidence.) Armie's Statement added to the Court Record. Apollo: Oh, welcome back, Athena. ...Hm? (What's with the long face?) Athena: .......... Apollo: How'd it go with Mr. Wright? Athena: .......... What should I...? Apollo: Athena? Athena: Oops, sorry! Zoned out there for a sec. The recess is almost over, so let's go! Ha, a-ha ha. Apollo: ........ (What was that all about?) May 17District Court - Courtroom No. 6 Judge: All right. Court is, once again, back in session. Now, umm... Mr. Wright. About that last objection you raised... Phoenix: We, the plaintiffs, still believe that the defense has yet to sufficiently prove its case. They claim that, according to legend, the Founder's Orb would bestow spiritual power... ...yet the relic in question has failed to do so. Therefore, it has failed its own test. Judge: I-I see... Apollo: (He's sticking with that ridiculous argument?) Phoenix: Furthermore... ...even if is the Founder's Orb, it can't be awarded to the Defiant Dragons. After all, they were the ones who killed Dr. Buff. Apollo: Apollo: What are you talking about? That was already proven to be false. There are no grounds for asserting that the Defiant Dragons murdered the doctor! Phoenix: Oh, but I'm afraid there are, Mr. Justice. ...Your Honor. I would like to present new testimony to this court. Testimony that will show that Datz Are'bal did, in fact, kill Dr. Buff! Apollo: What?! Judge: Very well. You may call your witness. Athena: I guess Mr. Wright found another new angle. Apollo: What new testimony could there be this late in the game? Atishon: Fellow citizens! It is I, Paul Atishon, the once and future representative of the people! Apollo: (Jeez, not him again.) Phoenix: My client divulged new information to me during the recess. He remembered something he saw, you see -- something crucial to this case. Apollo: (How very convenient...) Witness Testimony -- Datz's Crime -- Atishon: It was around 11 at night, and I was out on a mobile meet-and-greet around the village. That's when I saw Dr. Buff being murdered from outside his study window! Mr. Are'bal snuck up from behind and struck him on the head. His weapon of choice: a suitcase. A big, strong man like him could easily swing a heavy suitcase into someone's head. Apollo: You saw the murder as it happened?! And you're just telling us now because...? Atishon: Heh heh heh. I saved the best for last. It's a tactic known to all the political greats. Phoenix: The murder weapon was a complete mystery... ...but my client's eyewitness account has finally brought it to light. Judge: According to the autopsy report... ...Dr. Buff was struck in the head by the corner of some object. I suppose that could very well be the corner of a suitcase. Apollo: Apollo: But eyewitness testimony isn't the same as hard evidence! Phoenix: Oh, I wouldn't worry about that if I were you. Apollo: What's that supposed to mean? Phoenix: We have physical evidence, too. A luminol test revealed... ...the doctor's blood on Mr. Are'bal's suitcase. Apollo: R-Really?! But how does that prove that Mr. Are'bal used it as a weapon? Phoenix: Phoenix: You should know the answer to that, Mr. Justice. Since you know was well as I that the suitcase is covered in his fingerprints. Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! (I forgot we'd dusted it right in front of Ema!) Athena: The Turnabout Terror strikes again. Judge: Hmm... This is quite convincing testimony and evidence. Nevertheless, you may proceed with your cross-examination, Mr. Justice. Cross Examination -- Datz's Crime -- Atishon: It was around 11 at night, and I was out on a mobile meet-and-greet around the village. Press Apollo: Apollo: You were on a so-called \"mobile-meet-and-greet\" at 11 at night? Atishon: That's right. It's the perfect time because everyone is at home. You should have seen how the villagers' eyes teared up when they heard what I had to say. Apollo: (With tears of frustration, no doubt.) You weren't riding around in your palanquin? Atishon: That's right. Some village idiot reported me to the police. I've been banned from using it after dark. Athena: No wonder, what with all the noise he makes. Apollo: So, what exactly did you see, then? Atishon: That's when I saw Dr. Buff being murdered from outside his study window! Press Apollo: Apollo: Sounds like you witnessed something rather shocking. Atishon: Indeed. I didn't even believe it at first. I mean, a vicious murder, in Kurain? Apollo: There haven't been many murders there, I take it? Atishon: If I'm elected, I promise you that such a terrible tragedy will never happen again! A vote for me is a vote to banish murder forever from our beloved Kurain Village! Apollo: (Yeah, good luck with that.) Judge: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, please tell the court what you saw at the scene of the crime. Atishon: Mr. Are'bal snuck up from behind and struck him on the head. Press Apollo: Apollo: He snuck up from behind? So you're saying the doctor never even realized Mr. Are'bal was there? Atishon: That's right. He was utterly absorbed in a book. Apollo: ...I see. What did you see Mr. Are'bal do next? Atishon: He climbed up the bookshelf ladder and dumped a bunch of books down on the body. I believe he was trying to make it look like an accident. But that idiot didn't realize I could see everything from outside the window. Apollo: (One of those statements doesn't feel right.) Your Honor, I believe the witness made an important statement just now about how... The crime was clearly visible Apollo: If the crime was visible through the window, that's earth-shattering testimony! Judge: ...Is it? Because to my ears, it sounds like a rather obvious fact. Apollo: ...Oh, sorry. I'm good, then. Judge: Hmmm... Very well. Will the witness please continue with his testimony? Leads back to cross-examination The doctor was reading a book Apollo: The doctor was reading a book at the time of the murder...? That's vital testimony! Judge: Very well. The witness will please add that statement to his testimony. Adds statement \"The doctor was standing in front of the bookshelves, absorbed in a book.\" if not already added Datz is an idiot Apollo: The witness said Mr. Are'bal is an idiot. That's a key piece of information! Datz: Don't you jump on the bandwagon, AJ! I'm no idiot, you hear! Judge: Hmm... I fail to see how that is a key piece of information. Apollo: ...Yeah, I guess it's not, is it? Judge: Then it seems there is no need to add it into the witness's testimony. So let's get on with it, shall we? Leads back to cross-examination Atishon: The doctor was standing in front of the bookshelves, absorbed in a book. Press Apollo: Apollo: You watched a murderer commit his crime and did nothing to stop it? That doesn't sound like a good way to score points with the voting public. Atishon: I'm a politician, not a superhero! I'm under no obligation to risk life and limb. Athena: He's sure quick to deny his obligations when there's nothing in it for him. Apollo: I'm getting tired of listening to his endless campaigning and flimsy rationalizations. Phoenix: About your testimony, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson... You said Mr. Are'bal struck the doctor from behind when he was absorbed in a book. Atishon: Yes, that's exactly what happened. Present Doctor's Reading Glasses Apollo: Leads to: \"The doctor was standing in front of the bookshelves, absorbed in a book, you say?\" Atishon: His weapon of choice: a suitcase. Press Apollo: Apollo: Are you sure? Atishon: Positive. I saw it with my own two eyes. Apollo: Yet, despite your certainty, you kept quiet about it until now? Atishon: No, I was waiting. I knew there would be a perfect chance to talk about it later. Information must always be disclosed in a strategic manner. That is one of the lessons of kingcraft, as taught by the Atishon clan. Apollo: (Is there a lesson, by chance, in the Atishon Kingcraft Guidebook on being honest?) Atishon: Anyway, I saw Mr. Are'bal commit that heinous crime. Atishon: A big, strong man like him could easily swing a heavy suitcase into someone's head. Press Apollo: Apollo: I would have to agree, that suitcase is really heavy. ...Wait a second. How did you know it was so heavy? For all you knew, it could've been empty. Atishon: Gnrk! Phoenix: Phoenix: My client witnessed the crime in progress. So naturally, he saw Mr. Are'bal straining to lift what was obviously a heavy suitcase. I can't say I'm a fan of you trying to discredit my client by tripping him up, Mr. Justice. Apollo: (But I'm just doing what you always do, Mr. Wright!) Before adding statement Athena: Talk about new testimony. He's totally changed his story. Apollo: If he had really seen the murder taking place, you'd think he'd have said so from the start. Athena: Maybe he had some reason to hide what he really saw? Apollo: (If so, that might be our only opening.) After adding statement Athena: Dr. Buff was struck from behind while he was absorbed in a book? He must've been really into it. Apollo: Hmm... It doesn't add up. Athena: What doesn't? Apollo: (That Paul Atishon is lying. I'm sure of it.) Apollo: The doctor was standing in front of the bookshelves, absorbed in a book, you say? I'm sorry, but it seems your testimony is completely unreliable. Atishon: That's quite a bold statement. Well, let's hear you back it up. I challenge you to prove that I am anything but one hundred percent reliable. (Changed from [I challenge you to prove that I am anything but 100% reliable.] in the original release) Apollo: It would be my pleasure. Lately, it seems that the doctor's eyes had gotten so bad, he needed reading glasses. However, his reading glasses were over on his desk. So you see, there's no way he could've been reading a book in front of the bookshelves! Atishon: Hrrrrrrngh! Apollo: I'm sorry, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, but... ...I'm going to have to ask you to explain this discrepancy to the voting public! Atishon: Ngah, gah gah gah! I-I-I... Apollo: You what? Atishon: I-I'll explain it, you lowly cur! I simply made a mistake, you see. The doctor was actually sitting at his desk when Mr. Are'bal hit him over the head! Apollo: But then the doctor would have been facing him. Surely he would've seen him and tried to run? Atishon: D-Dr. Buff was nodding off! I could tell because he his eyes were closed, and he wasn't moving! Apollo: (Sounds more like what you would do.) Then how do you explain the back that he was struck in the back of the head? Isn't that something that should be impossible from the front of the desk? Atishon: ...Oh, um... About that... H-He... He bowed his head when he nodded off. That's when he was clobbered. Judge: Hmm... So that's what you saw. Well, Mr. Justice, that sounds like a perfectly reasonable explanation to me. Do you have a problem with the proposal that the doctor was struck while nodding off? No problem Apollo: No problem here, Your Honor. The doctor was probably dozing, just as the witness said. Athena: N-No, Apollo! Wait! If you accept that, then you might as well admit Datz killed the doctor. Apollo: ...Your Honor! I, uh, actually do have a problem with that statement... Judge: Very well. But let's avoid careless answers like that, or I will have a problem with you! Apollo: (Guess I blew that one.) Judge: Now, as you were saying, Mr. Justice? Leads to: \"There is a problem. A very big problem.\" A big problem Leads to: \"There is a problem. A very big problem.\" Apollo: There is a problem. A very big problem. The witness's statement doesn't hold up under the slightest bit of scrutiny! Judge: Is that so? Then will you please show this court what evidence you have to justify this? Apollo: Gladly, Your Honor. This shows the problem with the witness's claim that he saw the doctor nodding off! Present Study Diagram Apollo: Leads to: \"...A diagram of the study?\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: This shows the glaring problem with the witness's statement! Atishon: ...............Zzz... Apollo: See? The witness has passed out from the overwhelming power of my evidence! Phoenix: No, Mr. Justice. Your lackadaisical attempt to refute him put my client to sleep. That's all. Judge: I feel a yawn coming on myself. Perhaps giving you this penalty will wake me up. Apollo: Surely there are better ways to stay awake, Your Honor? Athena: Apollo, think about the relative positions of the witness and doctor again. Apollo: Right. That's where we'll find the contradiction. Judge: Now then, Mr. Justice. See that you avoid these snooze-incusing answers in the future. Leads back to: \"This shows the problem with the witness's claim that he saw the doctor nodding off!\" Judge: ...A diagram of the study? Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson allegedly viewed the murder from... ...here. And the doctor was allegedly nodding off... ...here. But from his vantage point, the bookcase would've blocked the witness's line of sight. Judge: Why, yes, I believe you're right! Atishon: B-B-But...! Arrrgh! Phoenix: Phoenix: The fact remains, my client knew that the suitcase was the murder weapon. So he definitely had first-hand knowledge of the crime scene! Apollo: I'm afraid I have to agree with you there, Mr. Wright. But then we have to ask ourselves, from what vantage point did he see the murder? Phoenix: What are you insinuating, Mr. Justice? Apollo: From what vantage point could Mr. Atishon-Wimperson have seen the dozing doctor? Once we determine that, I believe we'll finally see the truth behind this incident. The witness saw the murder from... right here! Present area between Bookshelf and Coffee Bar Apollo: Leads to: \"You've got to be kidding!\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Phoenix: How could he have seen it from there? Apollo: Oh, umm... He just did somehow? I mean, I just feel like it must've been from there. Athena: Um, Apollo? for some reason, I feel like you're wrong. Judge: Hmm... And for some reason, I feel like giving you a penalty. Apollo: (So much for that spot.) Athena: Hmm... Looking at it in another way... ...where must Mr. Atishon-Wimperson have been standing to see the doctor nodding off? Apollo: Someplace where the bookcase wasn't blocking his view, I guess. Judge: Now then. Will the defense please indicate where the witness saw the murder from? Leads back to: \"The witness saw the murder from... right here!\" Phoenix: You've got to be kidding! Judge: B-But that's--! Apollo: It is indeed. But everything only makes sense if the witness was there in the study. Athena: I-Inside the study? But that's the scene of the crime! Apollo: I know. Mr. Atishon-Wimperson -- the man who claims to be a witness to the murder... ...was most certainly in that very room. Athena: A-Apollo, are you suggesting...? Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson! Weren't YOU the one who actually swung that suitcase? Atishon: Gaaaaaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Phoenix: What you're proposing is ludicrous! My client is a small, thin man, whereas Mr. Are'bal had the musculature to pull it off. Apollo: ......... (He has a point... I gave up trying to lift that thing after one go.) Atishon: That's right. He's the only one who could've lifted such a heavy object. Now do you understand? The rebel Datz Are'bal is the doctor's killer! Athena: As long as the suitcase is the murder weapon, the suspicion falls entirely on Datz. You'll have to poke a hole in Mr. Wright's argument somehow, Apollo. Apollo: Oh, I will. And with his own technique, no less. If Mr. Atishon-Wimperson couldn't swing the suitcase around... ...we'll just have to consider another way he could've used it as a murder weapon instead. I'm going to turn this case on its head, Mr. Wright, just like you taught me. Phoenix: ...You talk big, Mr. Justice, but do you have what it takes? Judge: Well, this should be interesting... Apollo:: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson's testimony has been filled with one inaccuracy after another. First he stated Dr. Buff was in front of the bookshelves. Now he claims that the doctor was sitting at his desk. So where was the victim REALLY when he was killed? Also, where was his killer, and how was the murder weapon REALLY used? Judge: So the important thing here is the position of the victim and killer related to each other? Apollo: Yes, Your Honor. If they were positioned a certain way... ...it would be possible to use the suitcase as a weapon without lifting a finger. Phoenix: You can't mean...! Apollo: I would ask the court to recall the study's layout. It's quite distinctive, as you can see. Now, if Dr. Buff were sitting in a certain spot, and his killer was at a certain other spot... ...the suitcase would become a weapon ANYONE could use! Judge: Hmm... Very well, Mr. Justice. Where was Dr. Buff's killer at the time of the crime? Present balcony west of Coffee Bar Apollo: Leads to: \"Th-There...?!\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Judge: How could the murder have been committed from there? Phoenix: Yes, I would love to see a demonstration. Apollo: ...Um, well... I can't from here. Judge: Well, I have a demonstration for you from here... on how to give a penalty. Apollo: (So much for that spot.) Athena: If the killer didn't swing the suit case, there aren't many other ways to use it as a weapon. Apollo: I know. And there aren't that many places to use it from, either. Judge: Now then. I hope the defense is ready to try again. Leads back to: \"Where was Dr. Buff's killer at the time of the crime?\" Judge: Th-There...?! Phoenix: Oh... That's... Apollo: This should wrap things up nice and pretty for you, Mr. Wright. I would ask the court to recall the study's layout. But this time, instead of thinking in two dimensions... ...let's think in three. Only then can we clearly see the killer's method at work. The killer didn't have to swing the suitcase. ...If he used gravity to his advantage, that is. That's right. It was the plaintiff -- one Paul Atishon-Wimperson -- who used the suitcase. He pushed it from the second floor... ...and sent it hurtling down onto Dr. Buff, who was sitting at the coffee bar! Atishon: Yaaaaaaargh! Apollo: That psychology book had been at the coffee bar, no doubt. The doctor must have set it down there after he'd finished reading it, or the like. But his blood got on it, which is why the killer thought to hide it in that mountain of books! Phoenix: Phoenix: That's quite an entertaining theory you have there, Mr. Justice. But there's no evidence that the murder took place at the coffee bar. Apollo: ......... (I'm not so sure about that, Mr. Wright. I'd say that evidence of the murder occurring at the coffee bar...) Exists Leads to: \"The evidence does exist, and I'm going to show you.\" Does not exist Apollo: Obviously, there is none! Phoenix: Just as I thought. So, if the coffee bar isn't where the doctor was killed... ...the defense's little theory fails to bear fruit Judge: Hmm... Mr. Wright is correct, of course. Apollo: Urk! ...Umm... Athena: Don't just stand there, Apollo! If you don't do something quick, we're going to lose both the orb AND the creep, together! Apollo: I'm thinking... I'm thinking... Oh! (Wait a second... There IS a piece of evidence that proves the doctor was killed at the coffee bar!) Phoenix: So, such evidence never existed in the first place, did it? Leads to: \"The evidence does exist, and I'm going to show you.\" Apollo: The evidence does exist, and I'm going to show you. Phoenix: Y-You are? Apollo: This, right here, is proof that the murder took place at the coffee bar. Present stained book Apollo: Leads to: \"This brown stain was determined to be coffee.\" Present anything else Apollo: Judge: Hmm... I don't understand how that could be proof of anything. Apollo: You don't, Your Honor? Well, I believe Mr. Wright understands perfectly. Phoenix: All I know is, it's perfectly clear you don't understand what you're talking about. Judge: Now that is something I can understand. Apollo: (Me too... Oww.) Athena: Apollo, let's take another look at that crime scene photo. Maybe there's something in it related to the coffee bar. Apollo: I've got it this time! Leads back to: \"This, right here, is proof that the murder took place at the coffee bar.\" Apollo: This brown stain was determined to be coffee. What's more, it was still a bit damp when we saw it yesterday morning. Phoenix: Ah! Apollo: One look at this book speaks volumes, I'm afraid, Mr. Wright. It tells us the doctor was having a cup of coffee at the coffee bar. That's when the suitcase came hurtling down, striking him on the head... ...causing both his blood and his coffee to spatter onto it! Phoenix: Ack! Atishon: Aaaaaaagh! Apollo: Well, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson?! Atishon: .........Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh... What motive could I have possibly had to kill Dr. Buff?! Apollo: (And there it is. That final excuse cornered killers are so fond of.) Well, the doctor never returned your \"crystal\" to you, did he? Instead, he hid it in the cave ruins. Atishon: Nngh... Apollo: Telling him that the Defiant Dragons were a dangerous bunch was a huge blunder. All it did was make him hide the orb. Your lie came back to bite you in the end. Atishon: Uhhh... Apollo: Even worse, the doctor saw the news reports, so he knew the relic was the Founder's Orb. Being the conscientious researcher he was, he knew he had to return it to its rightful place... ...and that meant keeping it out of your hands. Atishon: Aaaaaaaaaaaaah... Apollo: You were so angry that he refused to return the relic to you... ...that you killed him with your own hands. Isn't that right, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Atishon: Arrrrrraaaaaagh! .........I-I-I... Th-That is... Phoenix: Phoenix: ...A-Apollo! Don't! Please don't accuse my client of murder! Apollo: .........Huh? What do you mean, \"don't accuse him\"? Why would you even say that, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: ...Er, what I meant was, um... He's a promising politician with a bright future ahead of him. It's in our nation's best interests to avoid burdening him with the taint of scandal. Apollo: Say what? Atishon: Wright! You'd better do something to change the current courtroom climate... ...or I'll be charged with murder! And you know what will happen to her if that happens. Phoenix: ...Arngh! Apollo: (What's he talking about? Well, I can ponder that later. For now...) Mr. Wright, you can't possibly believe that Mr. Are'bal is the killer. Are you really going to send an innocent man to prison? I thought you were better than that. Phoenix: Uhhh... Ummm... Apollo: Well, Mr. Wright? Answer me! Phoenix: Errr... Ummm... UUHWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH! Apollo: M-M-Mr. Wright? ...What in the world's going on here? Athena: ......... Apollo: ...If you won't say anything, then...! Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, the defense hereby accuses you of-- Athena: Athena: A-Apollo! Wait! Apollo: Not you, too, Athena! Athena: Umm... It's just, uhhh... I wasn't sure whether I should say anything, but... ...during that last recess, when I went to check on Mr. Wright... ...I overheard something I shouldn't have. Phoenix: I trust Maya is unharmed. Atishon: I can't really say. But just remember... If I'm arrested or fail to obtain the treasure... ...there will be consequences. Consequences of the worst kind, if you catch my drift. Phoenix: Augh! Atishon: Relax. All you have to do is ensure I get my hands on that relic. I must deliver it to my benefactor at all costs. Phoenix: What do they want that relic for anyway? Atishon: Heh heh heh. It's something to do with an old legend. My patron seeks the great power said to be granted to whoever solves its secret. Apollo: ....Maya? As in Maya Fey? Athena: Yes, the boss's legendary former assistant. Apollo: Ms. Fey's being held hostage? Athena: So it seems. Apollo: Why didn't you tell me as soon as you heard this? Athena: Sorry. It's just, Mr. Wright spotted me before I could slip away... ...and made me promise not to tell you. He said it would make things more difficult if you found out. Apollo: Arngh! As if things weren't already hard enough! (So that's why Mr. Wright was acting so strange. I had no idea. This must've been excruciating for him. Think, Justice... There's got to be something you can do!) Judge: Mr. Justice, about that last statement of yours... I believe you were in the middle of accusing the plaintiff of murdering Dr. Buff... Would you care to continue? Apollo: Ack! I-I... Phoenix: Nngh... I'm sorry, Apollo... I'm really, really sorry. Judge: What's gotten into you two? Apollo: ......... (If I accuse that slimebag, I put Ms. Fey's life in jeopardy.) Atishon: Heh heh heh. It seems you've finally caught on. I'm far too important to be accused of murder. After all, our nation's future rests squarely on my shoulders. Apollo: (Nnrgh... Either I give up, or...) Atishon: Once I present the crystal to my patron, my victory is assured! Then one day, I'll become president -- and then, king! I'll have every politician at my command! Now, retract your accusation! Apollo: Arrrrrrnnngh! (I can't kowtow to him, but... but...) The defense would... It would like to retract... the previous accusati-- ???: Dhurke: ...Apollo. Apollo: Dh-Dhurke? Dhurke: I don't know what's going on here... ...but a lawyer should never look the way you do right now... ... with \"defeat\" and \"resignation\" written all over your face. Apollo: ! .........A dragon never yields. Dhurke: Even when wounded, a dragon bites down hard, and never lets go till its dying breath. It glares, it roars, and it latches its jaws firmly onto its prey till the bitter end. That's what lawyers do to get to the truth! Apollo: ...Dhurke. (A dragon never yields... ...He's right. It's all over if I give up now! If Mr. Wright's hands are tied, it's up to me to do what must be done! He's saved my neck so many times. Now... it's my turn to save his!) ...Dhurke, thanks for that wake up call. Dhurke: Heh, now that's the face of a lawyer you've got there, son. Apollo: (Where there's a will, there's a way. And I'm going to find the way to save Ms. Fey AND see that justice is served!) Apollo: That scumbag is holding Ms. Fey hostage to ensure he gets the orb for his patron. And it seems said patron believes in the orb's legend. Thing is, the founder DID appear when the orb was exposed to fire, as the legend said. If the legend is true, then we've already solved the riddle, right? Yes, we have Apollo: Yes, we've definitely solved the riddle! ...And yet... ...we still don't understand what the part about \"bestowing power\" is talking about. I need to rethink this! Leads back to: \"If the legend is true, then we've already solved the riddle, right?\" No, not yet Leads to: \"We have not solved the riddle yet\" We have not solved the riddle yet Apollo: The legend says that the founder will bestow great spiritual power when she returns. But if that's true, it means we haven't solved the whole riddle yet. But how can that be? Are we missing something? ...Wait, maybe... Maybe the part about the founder returning should be taken literally. But how would it be possible for a dead person to return to the world of the living? Cloning Apollo: Oh, I know! Cloning technology! I bet some of the founder's DNA is hidden somewhere in the orb. ...Argh, what am I talking about? They didn't know about DNA and cloning back then. I'd better think of something else. Leads back to: \"But how would it be possible for a dead person to return to the world of the living?\" Channeling Leads to: \"The founder can return though channeling\" Time travel Apollo: Oh, I know! Time travel! We could go back to the past and bring the founder here to the present. ...Wait, what am I saying? Maybe I should cut back on the sci-fi movies. I'd better think of something else. Leads back to: \"But how would it be possible for a dead person to return to the world of the living?\" The founder can return though channeling Apollo: Oh, I know! here IS a way for the dead to return -- spirit channeling! Of course, you'd have to know what he founder looks like first... ...but the orb has revealed her face to us, so what if it's a sign that we should channel her? Given the facts, in order to solve the riddle and receive the founder's power, I'd need... A spirit medium Leads to: \"A MEDIUM IS NEEDED TO OBTAIN THE POWER\" To practice channeling Apollo: All I have to do is train as a spirit medium, so I can channel spirits myself! ...Wait, it can't be that easy. And if I ever did become a medium, I wouldn't need the founder's power anymore anyway. Leads back to: \"Given the facts, in order to solve the riddle and receive the founder's power, I'd need...\" A MEDIUM IS NEEDED TO OBTAIN THE POWER Apollo: The ability of a medium to channel spirits is the final key to unlocking the orb's secret. That means Mr. Atishon-Wimperson's patron will need one, too. And once that slimy politician realizes that, he won't be able to lay a finger on Ms. Fey! Apollo: Everything is going to be okay, Mr. Wright. Because Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson can't afford to harm a hair on Ms. Fey's head. Phoenix: ............Huh? Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson! It seems you've chosen the wrong person to take hostage. Atishon: Wh-What do you mean? Apollo: Your patron seeks to solve the orb's riddle... ...and thereby receive great spiritual power. However, only Maya Fey can truly give them what they really want. Phoenix: She can? Atishon: What do you mean, \"only Maya Fey\"? Apollo: Think about what the return of the founder really means. We should have considered it more literally. After all, the orb was made in the Kingdom of Khura'in -- the birthplace of spirit mediums. Phoenix: ...Ahh, I think I see now. You need to know what the deceased looks like in order to channel them. But in Khura'inism, depicting the face of the founder is taboo. However, her true face was hidden in the orb. So maybe the orb is telling us... to try channeling the founder. Apollo: Exactly. Through a spirit medium, the founder can quite literally return. And if the legend is true... ...the founder just might bestow spiritual power on someone when she does. Phoenix: It's like when Pearls imbued my magatama with spiritual power. If a human could be imbued with such power in a similar manner... Dhurke: It is said the founder possesses immense spiritual power. Such a great feat would not necessarily be beyond her-- W-Wait a second! Th-Then the legend is true?! Apollo: Do you understand now, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? You are holding hostage the final key to unlocking the orb's secret. And if anything were to happen to her, the riddle would remain unsolved, forever! Atishon: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Atishon: Atishon: Th-Th-There's always Pearl Fey! I could simply ask her to help! If she wants money, I have plenty to offer! Apollo: She's not the kind of person to be tempted by material gain. And she certainly wouldn't help you if anything were to happen to her cousin. Atishon: Urhgk. Apollo: Or maybe you'd like to go ask the queen of Khura'in to channel the founder for you. Phoenix: He could, but he'd probably get executed for requesting such a thing. Apollo: ...It's over. Now, confess! You killed Dr. Buff, didn't you? Atishon: Ack! Hrrrrrrrrrrrrrngh! It wasn't supposed to end this way! Judge: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. Are you admitting to committing the crime? Atishon: Errr... Um, I-I-I... You're my lawyer, Wright! Do something! Phoenix: It's true that I'm your lawyer. And as such, it's my job to defend you. ...However, defending my client isn't the only job a lawyer has. There's something else that's equally as important. And that is finding the truth. Atishon: Wh-What? Phoenix Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, you have sought to twist the truth in the dirtiest of ways. I was complicit in your hostage-taking, but in a way, I was being held hostage, too. Even so, there's still time for me to make things right. And I owe it all to you, Apollo. Apollo: ! (Mr. Wright...) Phoenix: I can't allow a murderer to walk away scot-free! Therefore, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, I must resign as your attorney. Atishon: No no no no noooo! D-Does this mean... I'm under arrest? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! ........................ ............... .................................... ........................ Apollo: ...Well? Atishon: ...I've nothing to confess. Apollo: What?! Atishon: I said, I've nothing to confess! I don't and I won't, especially not to a plebeian like you! Apollo: (This guy doesn't know when to give up.) Atishon: Besides, there's no truth to these allegations! I mean, look at the suitcase. You won't find a single print of mine on it! Apollo: All that means is that you wiped them off, taking care to only leave Mr. Are'bal's. Atishon: Heh heh heh. As many a great politician has said before me: no comment. Phoenix: In that case, try switching things up, Apollo. Look at the situation from a different angle. Is there really nothing that points to the suitcase being dropped from up above? Apollo: Hmmm... Evidence that points to the suitcase being dropped from the second floor... Athena: Hmm... If the killer pushed the suitcase from the second floor hallway over the coffee bar... ...that would place him right around here. Apollo: Ah! Maybe... Just maybe...! Phoenix: Thought of something, Apollo? Apollo: I believe this piece of evidence to be connected to the dropping of the suitcase. Present Armie's Statement Apollo: Leads to: \"That... appears to be a statement. But how is that related to this case?\" Present anything else Apollo: Atishon: Wh-What is that?! Phoenix: Apollo, I don't see how that could possibly be related. Atishon: ...Oh, it's not? Tsk, I just wasted a perfectly good reaction! Your Honor! Penalize this pernicious peon! Judge: Hmm.. Yes, well, we all must be held accountable for our words and actions. Apollo: (What do you think I'm trying to do with Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, Your Honor?!) Athena: So the killer dropped the suitcase from above the coffee bar. Apollo: Right. Let's look again to see if we have any evidence related to that event. Phoenix: Come on, Apollo. I'm counting on you. Leads back to: \"I believe this piece of evidence to be connected to the dropping of the suitcase.\" Judge: That... appears to be a statement. But how is that related to this case? Apollo: On the night of the murder, Your Honor, Miss Armie Buff physically left her room. That's when she saw the doctor burning the orb, and subsequently passed out. ...Right above the coffee bar. But with her there in her wheelchair... ...the killer wouldn't have been able to drop the suitcase down onto the doctor. Phoenix: Good point! Apollo: However, according to Sarge... ...she woke up just as someone was trying to move her in her wheelchair. Phoenix: Ah! Armie: ...someone was pushing my wheelchair. Apollo: What?! Armie: I was so scared, I beat a hasty retreat -- as fast as my wheels could take me! Apollo: She must've been in the killer's way and had to be moved. Isn't that right, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Atishon: ...Agrk! Phoenix: And if the killer had pushed the wheelchair with his bare hands... ...we may yet find the conclusive evidence we need. Apollo: Exactly. Fortunately for us, that evidence slipped right through the killer's fingers. If only he'd been able to hold on to it just a little tighter. But now, he is neither able to discard nor alter it. Phoenix: Honestly, that piece of evidence wasn't even supposed to be here in this courtroom today. And yet... it looks like sometimes, things DO get better. Atishon: Unngh! B-B-B-B-But...! Th-This... This wasn't supposed to happen! Apollo: No? Well, too bad. Because the evidence that sped away from you that night... ...has come back to haunt you! Right here at this very trial! Atishon: ARGH! UHWAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! Apollo: Your Honor! The defense's final piece of evidence is on this person! Present Armie Buff profile Apollo: Leads to: \"Th-That's...!\" Present anyone else Apollo: Phoenix: ...Apollo? Apollo: Yes, Mr. Wright? Athena: Umm, I think he's saying that that doesn't jive with anything you've said so far. Judge: It seems Ms. Cykes is the more sensible of you two. Apollo: (Ugh... No need to compare the two of us...) Phoenix: What did the killer have to move in order to drop the suitcase? Consider that, and the rest should follow. Apollo: Okay, I'll get it for sure this time! Leads back to: \"Your Honor! The defense's final piece of evidence is on this person!\" Atishon: Th-That's...! Apollo: On the night of the murder, Sarge passed out... ...only to come to and find that someone was pushing her wheelchair. That's when she fled back into her room. Phoenix: She didn't physically see a single soul after that... Not until Athena drew her out through that therapy session, that is. Apollo: While the killer was able to wipe the prints on the suitcase off... (Changed from [While the killer was able to wipe the prints on the suitcase...] in the original release) ...the same can't be said for the prints that got away. Atishon: Ah. Ah. M-My fellow Kurainians... Apollo: Well, Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson? Try to explain your way out of this one! The podium is all yours! Atishon: Ah. Ah. P-Paul Atishon, savior of Kurain... I-I... I am not a crook... I... My political career...! It can't end like this! I-I'm destined for great things! Something's wrong... This isn't real! It's a dream! No, a nightmare! Ooooooooooooh. Huh? What? ...Wait? ...Really? Ah! Election ResultsWINNER Atishon: Ahhhhhh! Whoa, no waaaaaaaaay!!! BANZAI! BANZAI! BANZAI! BANZAI!!! Breaking NewsPaul Atishon arrested on murder charges and stripped of his electoral win. Atishon: ...Wait, what? ...............No, please. Wait. Don't go! No... No... Please...Whoa! Grandpaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! ........................ Judge: M-Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Are you all right? ...B-Bailiff! Get him to the first-aid station, on the double! Judge: Well, this was yet another unexpected turn of events. In light of everything that's been revealed, it seems that this relic is indeed the Founder's Orb. And it seems Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson can be considered a suspect in Dr. Buff's murder. Phoenix: Apollo, I want to thank you for everything. Apollo: ! Phoenix: Thanks to you, I didn't have to keep bending the truth. I don't know what I would've done without you. Apollo: Er, don't mention it, ha ha ha... Athena: You were amazing today, Apollo! Apollo: (Well, I couldn't have done it without Dhurke.) .........A dragon never yields. Dhurke: Even when wounded, a dragon bites down hard, and never lets go till its dying breath. It glares, it roars, and it latches its jaws firmly onto its prey till the bitter end. That's what lawyers do to get the truth! Apollo: (A dragon never yields... Every lawyer should take that to heart.) Judge: As it seems both sides have no further objections... ...would Dhurke Sahdmadhi please take the stand? Dhurke: .......... Judge: This court awards the orb to the Defiant Dragons per the stated transfer agreement. Should the Kingdom of Khura'in claim ownership... ...the matter may have to be deliberated in court all over again. I just hope, or shall I say pray, that I'm not the judge presiding over that one! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Indeed! A trial like that might spark an international incident. Still, there are bigger and more momentous things astir in the air! Apollo: (The revolution... Dhurke's really serious about this.) Judge: This court is adjourned! May 17District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Dhurke: Nice work, son! We've finally broken through the last obstacle on the road to revolution! Apollo: Revolution... It just doesn't seem real. Dhurke: Yes, well, to think you actually defeated the Fighting Phoenix... All I can say is, that's my boy! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (Well, Mr. Wright did have his hands tied. Who knows if I'd have won if he'd been able to fight me head-on.) Athena: I see it more like you saved Mr. Wright. Apollo: ...Saved him? Athena: Yeah, remember what he said? He didn't have to bend the truth anymore, and it was all thanks to you! Apollo: I don't know about that. (Still, I guess it IS kinda nice to be appreciated.) Trucy: ...Um, Mr. Dhurke? Now that the Holy Mother's face has been revealed... ...are you going to have a spirit medium try channeling her? I, for one, would love to see the return of the legendary founder! Apollo: Yeah, just think about it. Being able to speak to someone right out of the history books... Dhurke: Unfortunately, it's not that easy. Apollo: What? Why? Dhurke: A face isn't enough. You also need the true name of the one you're attempting to channel. Apollo: Oh, right. Pearl mentioned something like that. Dhurke: And the founder's name is only known to the priestess who's been crowned queen. In short, the only living person who knows it is the current queen of Khura'in, Ga'ran. Apollo: Oh, so without her help, we won't be seeing the founder anytime soon? Trucy: Tsk, that's no fun. Founder's Orb updated in the Court Record. Apollo: So, Dhurke, what will you do now? Dhurke: First, I'll start by tracing the route by which the orb came into Dr. Buff's hands. Apollo: Since we now know it was Paul Atishon that asked the doctor to study it... ...isn't he the one who stole it? Dhurke: No, a political nobody like him couldn't get anywhere near the orb, let alone steal it. He must've had inside help. My money is on someone connected to the royal family. Apollo: Oh, right. You said something to that effect back in the cave. Dhurke: Whoever it may be, we need to expose their dirty scheme to the light of day. Apollo: Well, I'm sure Mr. Wright has plenty of information, courtesy of his dirty client. He might be able to shed some light on this. ???: Private Justice! Sarge: That was fine work you did at the trial today! You did your sergeant proud! Apollo: Back at you, Sarge! It took real courage to leave your room like that. Armie: It's all thanks to you and Corpswoman Cykes. With my siege defense over, I can finally sally forth. Sarge: But the battle's only just begun! One for me, and me alone, to fight! Athena: To lose your mother, and then your father... What a terrible thing to endure. Apollo: Yeah... (And being wheelchair-bound doesn't help.) Armie: ...Private Justice! I've been thinking... It's about time I stood on my own two feet. After all, I no longer have Papa to coddle me! Apollo: Huh? I'm afraid I don't follow. Armie: ...Take a good look, soldier. This is one small step for man... ...and one giant leap for me! ......... Hold my drone for me, would you, Private Justice? Apollo: Y-Yes, sir. (What she is up to?) Armie: .........Hrgh! Wh-Whoa... Apollo: Sh-Sh-She's... standing?! Dhurke: Wh-What's this?! Sarge! You mean your legs... They're...?! Armie: The doctor told me that I was ready to walk again months ago. But if I admitted I could walk, I knew I would have to leave the house. So I... I faked it. Apollo: (Makes sense, but...) Armie: I kept pretending I couldn't walk. But I know Papa is watching over me now, and I'd hate to disappoint him. So, from this day forth, I'm going to march forward on my own two feet! Apollo: (What a brave kid, trying to move forward like this. But it must be so hard this soon after her father's death.) Dhurke: Don't you ever stop. You just keep on walking... comrade. Stay brave, because there will be days when you want to stop... ...but I have faith you'll find a way to muster the strength to push through them. Apollo: Yeah, you can do it. Trucy: Hey, Daddy's back! Phoenix: .................. Apollo: Mr. Wright! (What's that look on his face for?) Phoenix: Oh, Apollo! Apollo: Um, is everything all right with Ms. Fey? Phoenix: She's safe... for now. Athena: Well then, we'd better go save her, quick! Where is she, anyway? Phoenix: ...I'm afraid I have some bad news. Apollo: Huh? Phoenix: Maya's... not here in the States. She's still in Khura'in. And she's still being held hostage by the mastermind behind this whole thing. Apollo: The mastermind? Phoenix: ...That's right. Paul Atishon-Wimperson was nothing more than a pawn. Maya's true abductor is in the Kingdom of Khura'in. Apollo: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaat?! I-I don't understand, Mr. Wright! What in the world's going on over there?! Apollo: But as shocking as that news was... ...it was only the beginning. The beginning of something big -- big enough to shake Khura'in to its very core. ...Revolution. I was being swept up in a mighty wave that nothing could stop. Of course, at the time... I had no idea what the days ahead had in store for us... To be continued Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: Please take a look at this piece of evidence. Judge: I'm looking... But what am I supposed to see? Apollo: Oh, um... Uhhh... Phoenix: As your boss and mentor, here's a bit of advice: Never present evidence before you have a good grasp of the situation at hand. Apollo: R-Right... Sorry... Judge: And as the presiding judge, here's a penalty. Apollo: (Ouch. Double-teamed for doing what Mr. Wright always does anyway.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: That statement contradicts with this piece of evidence! Judge: Hmmm... And just how does it contradict with the evidence, Mr. Justice? Apollo: Um... Could I have about five minutes to figure out the answer to that? Judge: The defense will figure it out before he presents his evidence next time! Apollo: (Sounds like a plan...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: There's... something off about that statement... Judge: Hmm... It seemed perfectly reasonable to me. Apollo: No, something's definitely not right if you listen really carefully! Phoenix: A gambler once sang, you've got to know when to hold 'em, when to fold 'em... Judge: Oh, I love this one! ...Know when to walk away, know when to run! Apollo: (I don't know which penalty hurts more: the judge's or their singing.) Consult (when evidence must be presented) Athena: Is it just me, or does that statement sound a bit dubious? Apollo: You know what... you're right. Thanks, Athena! Athena: Anytime! Apollo: (Now to take another look at the evidence...) Consult (when statements must be pressed) Athena: You look like you've hit a brick wall, Apollo. Apollo: Yeah. It feels like I have, too. Athena: Maybe you just haven't brought all the facts to light. Why don't you try pressing a little more? Apollo: Good idea. (Okay, time to turn up the pressure!) Pinpoint wrong emotion (during Mood Matrix segment in the chapter \"Cross-Examining Sarge\") Apollo: Athena: Hmm... This emotion isn't that out of place, given this statement... Apollo, are you just looking at his emotions as they relate to only a single statement? It's really important to look for emotional fluctuation between different statements, too. Apollo: Oh, right. Thanks for the reminder, Athena. (All right, let's try that again.) Probe wrong area (during Mood Matrix segment in the chapter \"Cross-Examining Sarge\") Apollo: Athena: That doesn't seem to be the cause of his current emotional state. Apollo: I could sure use a clue or two right about now. Athena: A person's personality and past shapes their emotional responses. Consider everything you know about Sarge. That's where you'll find the clues you need. Apollo: (Everything I know about Sarge...) Presenting wrong evidence during the Mood Matrix Apollo: Apollo: There's an inconsistency in Sarge's testimony! Judge: Is that so? Would you be so kind as to point it out to the court? Apollo: ...Well if you're going to put me on the spot like that, I admit my confidence is waning. Judge: ...I could say the same about my confidence in you, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Ugh. (I wish you wouldn't, Your Honor.) Athena: Say, Apollo... Sarge is saying that his father was burning the orb when he was killed... ...but doesn't that seem funny to you? Considering what the doctor was up that night, it doesn't add up. Apollo: Well, now that you mention it... (All right, I'd better look through the evidence one more time.) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The Defiant Dragons have failed to sufficiently show their right to the item in question. Therefore, ownership is hereby awarded to... ...the plaintiff, Mr. Paul Atishon. Apollo: That creep Paul Atishon stole the Founder's Orb right out of our hands. The dream of revolution in the Kingdom of Khura'in died that day. And we returned to our daily lives. As for my relationship with Mr. Wright... The word awkward comes to mind. Let's just say it was never really the same. Turnabout Revolution Image Gallery Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 May 17District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Apollo: What do you mean Ms. Fey is still being held hostage? And who's this \"mastermind\"? Phoenix: ...Paul Atishon-Wimperson was nothing more than a puppet. His benefactor was the one pulling the strings. But I have no idea who they are. Apollo: So all we know is it's the person he was trying to give the orb to? Phoenix: Right. He was just following orders. Whoever it is, it seems they really want to get their hands on the orb. Apollo: So then, Ms. Fey's abduction is the work of this so-called \"benefactor,\" too? Phoenix: Right again. Whoever they are, they're in Khura'in... ...along with Maya. Apollo: I wonder who they could be. Dhurke: Wright, this Maya -- the spirit medium you've been talking about... She wouldn't happen to be that bun-haired young lady you defended back in Khura'in? Phoenix: That's her. Why do you ask? Dhurke: I see... I think I know what's going on here.  I've got good news for you, Wright. Maya is somewhere safe. That much I'm sure of. Phoenix: ...I'm afraid you've lost me. Dhurke: Heh heh heh. So that's who the little snot's patron is. It's all starting to make sense. That fool has no idea I'm here in the States with you all. Apollo: Dhurke, you mind filling us in? Phone: .......................................... Phoenix: ...! ...No caller ID. I wonder who's calling? Phone: *beep* Phoenix: Hello? Phone: Mr. Phoenix Wright, yes? Let me start by thanking you... ...for taking such good care of my subordinate. Phoenix: Wh-Who is this? Phone: I believe you know me as Mr. Atishon's... \"benefactor.\" Phoenix: Ah! Apollo: (Sounds like they're using a voice changer or something to disguise themself.) Phoenix: Where's Maya?! Is she safe?! Phone: ...I had my ears on today's proceedings. What a shock it was to hear that the key to solving the orb's riddle is a spirit medium. I admit, I did not see that coming. Apollo: (Wait, did they plant a listening device in here somehow?) Phone: Nevertheless, don't think for a minute that it will guarantee Maya Fey's safety. She is not the only medium within my reach, you see. Phoenix: You harm a hair on Maya's head and you'll have to answer to me! Dhurke: ...Wright, give it here a sec. Phoenix: Wait! Dhurke: Hey, there. How's it going, stranger? Phone: ...Who is this? Dhurke: Why, it's your friendly neighborhood dragon. I just happen to be in the U.S. on a little trip. ...Minister of Justice Inga Karkhuul Khura'in. Phoenix: I-Inga?! Apollo: What?! Phoenix: Maya's kidnapper... Apollo: ...Is Khura'in's... Minister of Justice? Inga: Dh-Dhurke?! Is that you, ya dirty turncoat?! How in the--! What in blazes is going on here?! Dhurke: Oh, you know, just popped over to the States for a little R&R. But enough about me, Inga. That was a poor excuse for a bluff you pulled just now. We both know your threats are as empty as your head. You can't lay a hand on Maya Fey, and I do mean that literally. Inga: Ugh! Apollo: (What is he talking about?) Dhurke: You can kiss your chances of getting the orb goodbye. Inga: ...Heh heh heh. Maya Fey ain't my only... how shall I say... insurance, you know, Dhurke. Dhurke: What? Inga: I've got someone dear to you right in the palm of my hand, see? Now that one, well... You can imagine what kinds of things I could do, right? Dhurke: ! ............ Inga: Heh heh. Glad you're seeing things my way. Meet me at Amara's Tomb tomorrow, 3 PM sharp. And you better come alone, got it? If all goes well, the orb is all you'll need to get Maya Fey back. Dhurke: ......... Apollo: Dh-Dhurke, what's going on? Dhurke: You heard him. I have to get back to Khura'in at once. Apollo: What?! Why?! Dhurke: No time to explain. Apollo: But are you even going to make it? What if there are no seats left on the next flight? Plus, you're a wanted man. They're not just going to let you get on a plane. ???: Let me worry about that, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Ch-Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth? What are you doing here? Edgeworth: Taking care of the hostage situation. Apollo: Oh, now that you mention it... ...Pearl did say that she saw you around in Kurain Village. Phoenix: I had him look into a few things while I was on my way back from Khura'in. ...Including Maya's situation, of course. Edgeworth: I was astonished to hear she was still in Khura'in earlier... ...but it explained why I found no connection between her and Mr. Atishon. Apollo: Sorry to interrupt, but going back to the plane situation... Edgeworth: I've taken the liberty of chartering one for us. It's ready to take off at any time. And I will do what's necessary to hide the fact that Dhurke Sahdmadhi is onboard. Apollo: ...Wow. (Must be nice to be chief prosecutor...) Edgeworth: Wright, we have no time to lose. We must head for Khura'in at once. Phoenix: ...Right. Athena: I'm going, too! After all, you're bound to need my help! Trucy: No fair! I wanna go, too! Phoenix: This isn't a vacation, Trucy. Besides, I'll need you to hold down the fort. Trucy: But Daddy! Apollo: (Guess I should also only bring what's necessary.) ...Sorry Trucy, but would you mind holding on to this stuff for me? Unnecessary evidence foisted onto Trucy. Trucy: Fine. But you'd better bring me back something besides just more evidence. Dhurke: Excellent. Now, let us make haste... to Khura'in! Apollo: And that's how our sudden trip to the Kingdom of Khura'in began. I never imagined I'd return to the country of my youth under such circumstances, though... May 18, 2:30 PMTehm'pul Temple Apollo: That was a long flight. It's already 2:30 in the afternoon. Talk about cutting it close. ........... (The Kingdom of Khura'in... This is no time to reminisce, but... ...I gotta say, this place sure brings back memories.) Phoenix: Hurry up, Apollo! Apollo: Right behind you! Dhurke: Amara's Tomb is located in the courtyard of Ga'ran Palace. We should have just enough time to get there. Athena: Then let's sprint there! Think you can keep up, Apollo? Apollo: S-Sure, no sweat! Edgeworth: I'll contact the royal family and the local police, and inform them of our arrival. Phoenix: Thanks, Edgeworth. Examine Athena: Apollo. I'm sure this place brings back memories, but could you reminisce later? Time's running out! Apollo: You're right. We have to find Ms. Fey before it's too late. Talk Any ideas? Athena: I know you probably want to reminisce and all, but there's no time for that right now! Apollo: You're right. We've got to get to Amara's Tomb with Ms. Fey is being held captive! Present Anything Athena: Apollo! Don't go showing me stuff for no reason! We have to find Ms. Fey before it's too late! May 18, 2:45 PMGa'ran Palace - Royal Residence Apollo: *huff, puff* *huff, puff* I wasn't made for all the running and climbing and near-drowning I've done this week. Phoenix: It's 2:45... Only fifteen minutes left. (Changed from [It's 2:45... Only 15 minutes left.] in the original release) Dhurke: See that cylindrical building rising in the distance? That's Amara's Tomb. Phoenix: Amara... Wasn't that the previous queen? The one who was assassinated? Dhurke: Yes. And I'm the one they pinned it on. Apollo: It will take a few minutes to get to the tomb from here. ???: So, you have returned... Barbed Head. Phoenix: Ah...! Apollo: (I've seen her before on the news. If I remember correctly, this is the crown princess Rayfa Padma Khura'in.) Rayfa: What are you people doing here? This is the Royal Residence! Commoners are not allowed entry without permission. Phoenix: A prosecutor from the States... ...should've already called and requested permission for us to enter. As to why we're here, Your Benevolence... Have you seen Minister Inga? Rayfa: If you seek my father, I just saw him heading toward Amara's Tomb. Phoenix: Was he with anyone? You know, like some shady-looking underlings or something? Rayfa: No, he was alone. Why do you ask? Apollo: (Looks like she has no idea about Ms. Fey's abduction.) Athena: You hear that? I think we have company. *stomp, stomp, stomp* Royal Guard: Bow down before her glooooooory!!! Her Eminence Queen Ga'ran, grand priestess of Khura'in approooooooooaches!!! Apollo: Huh? ...Ga'ran? Ahhh! I-It's--! Phoenix: ...Q-Queen Ga'ran! Ga'ran: ............... Guards... Surround Amara's Tomb at once! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence! Ur di'hara Ga'ran! Apollo: (What's she doing? Is she going to help us?) Phoenix: Excuse me, Your Eminence... Ga'ran: So, our \"Barbed Head\" lawyer returns. May we presume you are here for Maya Fey, the spirit medium who has been abducted? Phoenix: Y-Yes, you may! Ga'ran: Allow us to apologize for the criminal actions of our husband. Phoenix: Oh, um... no need to apologize for him! Ga'ran: Honestly, Inga... Abducting a guest in our country? How could you? Rayfa: Father... abducted someone? Phoenix: Your Eminence, what about those soldiers over there? Ga'ran: They are the Ga'ran Royal Guard, soldiers who serve the crown and no other. Apollo: Royal guard? Ga'ran: They are an elite force selected from only the most loyal and outstanding of our subjects. Apollo: And why have you ordered them to surround the tomb? Ga'ran: The police will not come if it is my husband who is committing the crime. We shall have to storm the tomb and take Minister Inga into custody ourselves! Apollo: Whaaat?! Y-You mean...? Dhurke: Ga'ran! No! His hostage is in there! Ga'ran: Dhurke! How dare you set foot in the palace! Have you come to turn yourself in?! Dhurke: Listen, we need to call a truce for now! Ga'ran: Ga'ran Royal Guard! Seize this traitor of the crown! Royal Guard: As you wiiiiiiish, Your Eminence! Resist and you diiiiiie! Apollo: W-Wait a second! Dhurke: Dhurke: Slow down there, Ga'ran. I'm here to conduct a hostage exchange. But if you take me in now, Maya Fey is as good as dead. Ga'ran: ...A hostage exchange? And why would he choose to do such a thing with you? Dhurke: We can talk about that later. Right now, I need to get in there before it's too late. If I can't resolve this in twenty minutes, you can storm the palace. Now then... if you'll excuse me... Ga'ran: Dhurke, wait! ... *sigh* Guards, allow the insurgent Dhurke Sahdmadhi to pass. Rayfa: Barbed Head, you have some explaining to do! Phoenix: Right... Well, while we're waiting here... ...Apollo, why don't you explain the situation? Apollo: Whaaat?! M-Me? Rayfa: Leave nothing out, Horn Head, or I'll dehorn you where you stand! Apollo: (Horn Head? She doesn't waste any time coming up with nicknames. And what's with the attitude? Her father is the one who abducted Ms. Fey!) Examine Amara's Tomb Apollo: (Dhurke's in there right now.) Guards Athena: The Ga'ran Royal Guard has the tomb surrounded. Apollo: Yeah, and it looks like they might storm the place at any moment. Phoenix: If Her Eminence gives the order, they'll have no choice but to follow through. And I have the feeling she's about ready to do so. Apollo: All we can do is wait and hope for the best, huh... (I hope Dhurke and Ms. Fey both come out of this in one piece.) Any other point of interest Apollo: (This is no time to be looking around. Not until Dhurke gets back.) Move Rayfa: Where do you think you are going?! Apollo: (Oh, right. We're supposed to wait for Dhurke to return.) Talk Hostage taking by Inga Rayfa: Do my ears deceive me, or did I hear talk about my father abducting someone? Apollo: Oh, um, you heard right. He abducted Maya Fey, and... Rayfa: I-Insolent fool! Apollo: P-Pardon my rudeness! Rayfa: A gentle soul such as my father could not possibly have committed such a crime! Phoenix: \"Gentle\"? You think he's gentle? Apollo: I'm afraid it's true, Your Benevolence. He's holed up in that tomb as we speak. Rayfa: Really? I find this difficult to believe. Why would he do such a thing? Inga Karkhuul Khura'in Apollo: Umm, Your Benevolence? You saw your father heading toward the tomb? Rayfa: I did. I was over on that veranda, deep in thought... ...when I saw him hurrying toward the tomb. I'd say it was about ten minutes ago. (Changed from [...when I saw him hurrying toward the tomb. I'd say it was about 10 minutes ago.] in the original release) Apollo: (Why was he rushing? Maybe he was worried he'd be late?) Did you see anyone else heading for the tomb? Rayfa: I saw no one else after he entered. Apollo: So Minister Inga and Ms. Fey are the only ones in there besides Dhurke? Phoenix: Who knows? But I wouldn't be surprised if he had a minion or two with him. Apollo: Dhurke... I sure hope he's all right. Present Anything Rayfa: Horn Head! Stop wasting time and explain what's going on here! And make it quick, or I'll yank those horns right off your head. Apollo: Nngh... How about we keep our hands to ourselves and I'll explain everything...? (Guess I'd better start talking...) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: ...It's only been five minutes? (Argh, it feels like an eternity.) Phoenix: Patience, Apollo, patience. Ga'ran: ................. May 18, 3:20 PMGa'ran Palace - Royal Residence Apollo: It's been almost twenty minutes. What's taking Dhurke so long? Ga'ran: ...The appointed time has come. Our royal guard shall now storm in. Apollo: Umm, can't you wait just a little longer? Ga'ran: No, we cannot. Every second we wait puts the hostage's life in even more danger. Therefore, we see no alternative but to order our guards to storm in. Apollo: (But that'll put Ms. Fey's life in danger, too!) Ga'ran: Guards! Storm the tomb and seize Minister Inga, along with the insurgent Dhurke Sahdmadhi! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence! Apollo: What?! Dhurke's under arrest, too? Ga'ran: Naturally. That traitorous snake assassinated my predecessor, Queen Amara. Now go! Seize them both! Royal Guard: Raaaaaaaaah! We're going in! Follow me, men! For Her Eminence! Ur dihara Ga'raaaaaaaan! Apollo: ............ (I hope no one gets hurt.) Royal Guard: Ah! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Your Eminineeeeeeeence! Apollo: What the--? Why are they running back out?! Ga'ran: What is the meaning of this? Royal Guard: S-Something terrible has happened! Dhurke...! Th-Th-The minister...! H-H-He's dead! Ga'ran: What's this?! Apollo: WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Phoenix: Apollo, quick! Apollo: I'm right behind you! Ga'ran: No one enters without our--! ...Hmph! Come, let us see what has transpired! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence! May 18Ga'ran Palace - Amara's Tomb Apollo: Wh-Where's Dhurke?! Phoenix: Apollo, over there! Apollo: .........Dhurke? Dhurke: ................ Apollo: Dhurke! Wh-Wh-What... What have you done? Dhurke: ..........Apollo? Phoenix: L-Look! Ga'ran: So it is... Minister Inga who has fallen? ...! Guards! Seize this murderous man at once! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence! Surrender or peeeeeeerish, rebel scum! Dhurke: N-No, wait! Aaaaaaaaargh! .............................. ............................................................ Apollo: Dhurke! (They're taking him away...) *thud* Apollo: Oww! (Dhurke just threw something at me.) Wait, this is the... (Is he telling me to keep it safe?) ???: ......Nick? ...Is that you? Phoenix: M-Maya! Are you all right?! Maya: Dh-Dhurke, he... he saved me. ...I feel... exhausted. I can't keep my eyes... open... Phoenix: Maya! Apollo: (Minister Inga -- the man behind Ms. Fey's abduction -- had been killed. And Dhurke was arrested for his murder. So it was that the abduction of Maya Fey came to a sudden and unexpected resolution. With this, the curtain fell on the minister, but things were far from over.) May 18Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence Athena: Apollo! What happened?! Apollo: ......I can't say for sure. But from what I can tell, it seems Dhurke has killed Minister Inga. Athena: Whaaaaaaaaaaat?! You think he did it to save Ms. Fey? Apollo: Most likely... But who knows? I'm really confused right now... Rayfa: M-My father... He's...? This cannot be! I must see for myself! Royal Guard: Your Benevolence! We cannot allow you to pass! Rayfa: Fools! Stand aside! Royal Guard: Forgive us! But we have direct orders from Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran! Rayfa: Uuuuuuuuuuuh! Father... Oh, Father...! Dhuuuuuurke! You will pay for this! Phoenix: ...Apollo, let's go regroup somewhere. Apollo: Y-Yeah... (Dhurke... It wasn't really you that did it... right?) May 18Tehm'pul Temple Apollo: ......... Athena: Are you okay, Apollo? Apollo: ...Y-Yeah. Phoenix: Edgeworth's speaking with the local police... ...so let's sit tight until he returns. Apollo: ...O-Okay. ............... Phoenix: ...I know you must be in a state of shock right now, but I need you to stay with us, Apollo. Apollo: (He's right. I can't go to pieces now!) Thanks, Mr. Wright. I'll be fine! May 18Tehm'pul Temple Edgeworth: Wright, Mr. Justice... I'm afraid I have some bad news. It looks like things will only get more complicated from here. Apollo: Prosecutor Edgeworth... What's happening with Dhurke? Edgeworth: As I understand it, he has been officially charged with the murder of Minister Inga. Apollo: H-He has? Edgeworth: However, I did manage to get us permission to investigate the crime scene. And I expect we'll be allowed to visit Mr. Sahdmadhi shortly. Apollo: ...Thank you. (I'm sure glad Prosecutor Edgeworth is here with us.) Edgeworth: Also, it just so happens that Detective Skye is here in Khura'in... ...so I have asked her to assist us with our investigation. Apollo: What?! What's she doing here? Edgeworth: It seems Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has grown quite fond of her. He's been ferrying her around all over the place. A few days here, a few days there... They've almost become a team of sorts. Apollo: (Despite what Nahyuta says... ...it seems he thinks highly of Ema's skills.) Athena: So what now, Apollo? Apollo: I think I'll go pay Dhurke a visit at the Detention Center. Phoenix: I... want to go check in on Maya at the hospital. What about you, Athena? Athena: Well... If there's footwork to be done, I'd better stick with Apollo and give him a hand. Edgeworth: Very well. Then I will accompany Wright. Apollo: Okay, we'll go our separate ways for now. Phoenix: All right. If anything comes up, you have my cell number. Athena: Do you know your way around here, Apollo? Apollo: It's been over ten years since I left... but I'll try not to get us hopelessly lost. Examine Temple Athena: Mr. Wright stayed there the entire time he was here, apparently. Apollo: Why would he stay at a temple instead of a hotel? Athena: He says it helped to cut costs. Long stays at a hotel really add up, you know. But he had to sleep on the floor with a load of strangers. There weren't any showers, either. Apollo: Wow, that's worse than staying at a youth hostel for backpackers. Spring Apollo: (This is said to be a sacred spring, and a pathway for souls to follow. The people of Khura'in believe the spring draws souls to the temple... ...and by the truth gained in the Hall of Justice beyond, they are memorialized. It seems that legal trials and funeral rites are inseparable in this country.) Background temples Apollo: (There sure are a lot of temples around here. In fact, it looks like most of the buildings around here are related to Khura'inism.) Talk Any ideas? Athena: Queen Ga'ran sure has a lot of personal attendants. Apollo: Yeah. The Ga'ran Royal Guard... They're like her own private army. Athena: More like an elite fan club made up of carefully selected soldiers who adore her. That's how I see it anyway. Apollo: That's... a pretty blunt way of putting it. What to do Athena: Dhurke Sahdmadhi -- the charismatic leader of the Defiant Dragons -- arrested. This is going to deal a major blow to the rebels. Apollo: Yeah. I can already see Datz having a heart attack when he finds out. Athena: Speaking of Datz, he was on the plane with us... ...but I haven't seen him since we landed. Apollo: Dhurke said he wanted Datz to go to him before he caused any more trouble. Athena: ...Yeah, he strikes me as a troublemaker. Apollo: ...I just hope he doesn't do anything crazy, like trying to break Dhurke out of jail. Present Attorney's Badge Athena: I thought that attorney badges were the same around the world. But I just realized this type is only used back home. Apollo: You've had your badge for a while now, and you're JUST noticing that? Athena: Hey, I'm still getting used to things after all the time I spent in Europe. But as they say, when in Rome! Apollo: Wait, what are we even talking about anymore? Founder's Orb Athena: The orb... It was a real surprise to find out that it's hollow on the inside, wasn't it? Apollo: Yeah, and an even bigger surprise to find that the founder's face was hidden within. Athena: But now that the orb's secret has been revealed... ...how are you supposed to restore it to its original state? Apollo: ...Well, it was probably wax or something that melted to reveal the figure inside, so... ...if we turned it upside down and heated it up again, it should go back to the way it was. Athena: Ohhh, I get it! That's one clever little contraption. Photo of My Father Athena: I've been thinking about that photo. Your father was quite the manly man, Apollo. Apollo: Ha ha ha. I sense a compliment in there somewhere. Athena: Huh? Where'd you get that idea? Apollo: Oh, um... N-Never mind. Athena: Never mind what? Apollo: ......... Er, nice weather we're having today. Athena: ......... Aww... Is there something you wanted to hear me say, Apollo? Apollo: L-Look! Just forget I said anything, okay?! Royal Residence Examine Inga's residence Apollo: (Somebody got a little carried away decorating this place. There's a golden lion keeping watch at the entrance.) ...That frog looks like it's cowering under the lion's glare. Athena: Really? 'Cause to me, it looks like the frog is glaring at the lion. Apollo: Come on, Athena. How does that make any sense? Athena: Huh? I just call 'em as I see 'em. Apollo: (I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.) Ga'ran's palace Apollo: The palace of Queen Ga'ran is built to impress. Its white walls and gold ornamentation lend it an imposing air. Athena: It makes Minister Inga's residence look downright humble by comparison. Apollo: Yeah. It shows the difference in their tastes... and which one wears the pants, so to speak Amara's tomb Apollo: The previous queen, Amara, was laid to rest in her own private tomb. Pretty impressive. Athena: They say it cost $800 million to build, and took 400 workers five years to complete. Special memorial rites were also conducted at various points of its construction. Apollo: That's quite an undertaking. Athena: It was built with donations from her devoted subjects and royalty of neighboring countries. It ended up giving a huge boost to the national economy. Apollo: Wow, Queen Amara must've been one charismatic lady... Rayfa's residence Athena: Ooh, look at those flowers! They give the whole house such a cute vibe! I wonder if this is where Princess Rayfa lives. Apollo: ...I doubt it. She doesn't look like the type to decorate with cute flowers. I mean, I may not know her well, but she seems awfully serious and snobby. I bet she uses nothing but roses and peonies - stuffy old people flowers, you know? Athena: ......Apollo. I guess it's too much to ask that you not judge a book by its cover, huh. Apollo: What's that supposed to mean? Footprints Apollo: Are these... Inga's footprints? They appear to be heading toward the tomb. Athena: Didn't Princess Rayfa mention something about that? You know, something about him rushing over to the tomb before we arrived? Apollo: I wonder if he had accidentally dozed off before the exchange or something. Pond or bridge Apollo: Vibrant lotus flowers floating on still waters... Butterflies dancing about... It's almost supernatural in its beauty. Athena: And at the center of it all rises the tomb where Amara's soul slumbers.  It makes you wonder if that bridge there is a getaway to the hereafter. Apollo: Yeah... Especially after both Dhurke and Inga crossed that bridge earlier. Urns Apollo: This overturned urn has spilled water everywhere. Everything around it is soaking wet. Athena: D-Don't look at me! Apollo: (Rightly or wrongly, I'm guessing Athena's the type who gets blamed for a lot of things. And the more people accuse her, the more defensive she becomes. Even to the point of preemptively denying any wrongdoing.) Athena: I said, it wasn't me! Apollo: I never said it was. Amara's Tomb Examine Athena: Apollo, I know you can't help but want to start investigating, but... Apollo: I know. We should pay Dhurke a visit over at the Detention Center. May 18Detention Center - Visitor's Room Dhurke: Apollo! Here to see your old man, are you? Apollo: Dhurke. Are they done interrogating you? Dhurke: Nope, the fun hasn't even started. I imagine they'll really take me over the coals though. Athena: I don't even want to think about how harsh their interrogation method will be. Apollo: ...Yeah, but that's nothing compared to what they'll do if they find him guilty. Dhurke: They've branded me a terrorist who killed the previous queen, and now the justice minister. If found guilty of these crimes, I'll be facing a very public execution. Apollo: P-Public execution...?! (This is worse than I thought!) Dhurke: Come on, son. Turn that frown upside down! You'll jinx us. As soon as I get out of here, I'll take you to this tasty hash house I know. Apollo: .........I'd like that. (I really need to find out what happened. Time to switch to work mode.) Dhurke, can you tell me what happened? ...Oh, and there's also something I want you to take a look at. Examine Bell Athena: .................. Apollo: ...Don't do it, Athena. Don't ring that bell. Athena: Ack! Wh-Who, me...?! Perish the thought. I mean, would I ever do something so childish? Apollo: .................. Athena: All right, all right! Put your bracelet away already. Talk about unfair! Guard Apollo: That guard's standing so still, and with such great posture... I wonder if he spends his days just watching the dust dance in the sunlight. Wait a second. Don't you do that in court sometimes, Athena? Athena: Eep! You mean you noticed? Apollo: Don't think you can take it easy just because I'm the lead lawyer on this one. Talk The incident Apollo: Dhurke, what happened in there? You didn't really kill Minister Inga, did you? Dhurke: Well, the thing is... ...I really don't know. Apollo: Huh? Dhurke: I remember seeing the mural of the founder right as I entered the tomb... ...but I got all dizzy immediately after that. The next thing I knew, I was standing there with a bloody knife in my hand... ...and covered in Inga's blood. Apollo: So you don't remember meeting with him? Dhurke: No. The last thing I remember after entering the tomb is feeling really dizzy. Athena: There's no way he can explain what happened if he can't remember anything. Apollo: Y-Yeah... Dhurke: .........Hmm. I suppose there's no getting out of this one. Apollo: But we can't give up yet! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! I was just messing with you, son. Apollo: Well, stop. It's not funny. Dhurke: S-Sorry. Apollo: (Sheesh. Nothing seems to faze him. Not even being arrested for murder.) Dhurke: This is going to be one tough case, Apollo. Not only have I been charged with Inga's murder... ...but I've also been charged with Amara's assassination from twenty-three years ago. Apollo: You're on trial for two charges? Dhurke: Ga'ran is practically licking her chops just thinking about my public execution. Guess it means we can't afford to lose our heads, huh. Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: I... I don't know how you can laugh at a time like this. Dhurke: ...So, son, I take it you'll be defending me at my trial? Apollo: ...Of course. You can count on me. Dhurke: That's my boy! Looks like your nerves are as steely as those vocal chords of yours! After all, you've got the Defense Culpability Ace to contend with, too. Apollo: ...Oh, right... So if you're found guilty... ...then I'll be charged with the same double homicide, huh. Dhurke: Don't tell me you forgot about that...! Apollo: I'll-- I'll be fine. I-I just have to make sure we win this one. Dhurke: You sure? Because you don't sound very fine. Athena: ...Um, Apollo? What was that about an assassination twenty-three years ago? 23 years ago (appears after \"The incident\") Apollo: About that incident twenty-three years ago... That was when the previous queen, Amara, was assassinated, wasn't it? Dhurke: Yes. Someone set her private residence on fire. She lost her life in the ensuing blaze. Apollo: And you were arrested for the crime? Athena: Why would they arrest you, Mr. Sahdmadhi? Weren't you just a lawyer back then? What relation could you have had with the queen? Dhurke: Um, about that... Amara was... well... she was my wife. I may not look the part, but I was once husband to a queen. In short, I was royalty. Athena: What? No waaaaaay! Are you saying you won the heart of the reigning queen? Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! C'mon, you're talking to a guy who hones his prowess against witnesses on the stand. Even a queen is no match for this dragon's glare! Athena: W-Wow, you're really something else. Apollo: So was a verdict ever reached, Dhurke? Dhurke: I acted as my own attorney and won. ...Until I was accused of fabricating evidence, that is. Then it all went south. Apollo: (...Now where have I heard a story like that before?) Athena: What happened after that? Dhurke: I, uh... I made a run for it. Athena: You ran?! But why? Dhurke: I didn't kill Amara, and I didn't fabricate any evidence. But if I had stuck around for a retrial, I'd have been found guilty for sure. I couldn't allow that to happen; Amara's true killer would never face justice if I did. So I left my law practice behind and went underground. Apollo: But that was twenty-three years ago. ...Are you telling me that after all these years... ...you still haven't discovered the truth? Dhurke: Yeah... The fact that it was arson means that the crime scene was reduced to ashes. There is little in the way of evidence left. It's just been brick wall after brick wall. Apollo: (I guess that means it's all up to me to figure it out, huh. Along with Minister Inga's murder, of course. ...I think I'm going to be sick.) Dhurke: Come on, son. Don't look so down. With you on the case, it'll work out somehow. Apollo: (I hope he's right.) Dhurke: Say, son, do you remember my office? Apollo: ...Sure. (I remember that messy, dimly lit room.) Dhurke: The file I've amassed on Amara's assassination is kept there. I think it might help you on this case. Do you remember how to get there? Apollo: (Let me think... I recall going in through a manhole...) How can I not, Dhurke. I hated how I always got so dirty getting there. And that stench... (That old case is important, too, but I should probably focus on the minister's murder first.) Present Attorney's Badge Dhurke: I'm proud of you, son. You've really become a fine lawyer. Apollo: Well, at least it means I'm qualified to defend you. Dhurke: ...To think the day would come where you'd come to my defense. I'm one lucky man. Now I can die in peace. Apollo: Whoa, slow down! I'm going to prove you innocent, so...! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Just pulling your leg, son! Apollo: (...Even when he's in the slammer, Dhurke is Dhurke.) Founder's Orb Dhurke: I see you got it safely out of the tomb! Apollo: Why did you throw it at me like that? Dhurke: I want you to listen carefully, son. The orb must not fall into Ga'ran's hands... Not ever. Apollo: I thought Minister Inga was the one who was after it. He was the one who lent it to Professor Buff to study, after all. So haven't you exposed his crime now? Dhurke: I have, but... ...there's more connected to this relic than meets the eye... Much more. And whatever it is, I can't help feeling that it could turn this entire kingdom upside down. Apollo: You said something like that before. (Looks like Dhurke's intuition is at it again.) Dhurke: Ga'ran will do anything to retrieve this... ...so guard it well, son -- at least until tomorrow's trial. Photo of My Father Dhurke: That's the only remaining photo of your father. Take good care of it. Apollo: I will. ...I'm just surprised to see it after all these years. Dhurke: I had a tough time tracking it down and retrieving it. It was taken by some European tourists who just happened to be watching your father. I had one of my men go to Europe to look them up and ask whether we could have it. Apollo: Y-You went through all that trouble? Dhurke: ...I did. So don't go losing it or anything. Apollo: I said I'd take good care of it, didn't I? After clearing \"23 years ago\" Talk option and presenting Founder's Orb: ???: I'm afraid your time is up. Apollo: ! N-Nahyuta. Nahyuta: It's time for the prisoner's interrogation. So begone, you putrid-headed, criminal-abetting lawyer. Apollo: Wait! Don't tell me... you're the prosecuting attorney? Athena: What?! But that would mean... Nahyuta: ...Is there a problem here? Apollo: You bet there is. He's your father! Nahyuta: ...And your point is...? My relation to the accused is irrelevant. The fact remains, I am a prosecutor. Apollo: N-No, that's not what I... (I don't think I'm getting through to him.) Dhurke: .........Nahyuta. Long time no see, son. How've you been? Nahyuta: ......... Dhurke: Look... I hear you've been serving Ga'ran -- rather faithfully, in fact. Whatever happened to our dream of taking her down and changing this country, son? Nahyuta: .........The past is the past. Dhurke: What do you mean? Why are you doing this? Nahyuta: .........It's simple. People change. The Nahyuta you knew exists no more. Dhurke: Listen, son, I don't know what made you change like this... ...but you're still my boy, even if you prosecute my case. The rest of the Defiant Dragons and I eagerly await your return. Whenever you're ready, we'll welcome you back with open arms. Nahyuta: ........Ngh! .........As I said, I've moved on. Now, let us waste no more time; for flowers do not blossom simply from talk of the past. Apollo: ......... (Nahyuta... Why do I get the feeling there's something he wants to say, but can't?) Nahyuta: ...Guard, move the accused to the interrogation room. Guard: Yes, sir! This way, you rebel scum! Dhurke: Ow! Watch it! Not so rough, will you! Apollo: (...Nahyuta. Is he seriously going to prosecute his own father?) May 18Ga'ran Palace - Amara's Tomb Apollo: So, this is the tomb of Amara, the previous queen of Khura'in. It's really lavish. I guess you could say it's fit for a queen. Athena: Is the faceless woman in that mural over there Amara? Apollo: No, that's the Holy Mother. She's the one who brought spirit channeling to Khura'in. Athena: Oh, right. The woman in the orb. ???: Oh, it's you two. Getting right down to business, I see. Apollo: Hi, Ema. We heard you'd give us a hand if we needed it. Ema: Yep. Mr. Edgeworth asked me to help where I could. So, it's been quite a while since you've been back in Khura'in, I hear. Apollo: Yeah, more than ten years, in fact. Ema: Well, you sure didn't waste any time. I mean, you're already mixed up in a murder. You're as big a trouble magnet as Mr. Wright. Apollo: P-Please don't say that. My luck's already bad enough as it is. Athena: Ema, I hear Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has requested your services again. He seems to have really taken a liking to you. Ema: You mean His Ephemeral Holiness? MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. I don't mind that he approves of me and my abilities. It's just, his people skills need some serious work. But when he manages a smile and compliments my work, it's hard to say no. Plus, working on investigations overseas is a priceless experience. But flying back and forth between here and home every few days with no days off... That's been tough, and the lack of sleep has been brutal on my skin. To make matters worse, the defendant in this case is someone I know. I mean, how could this get any worse?! MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. Apollo: (Sounds like they've got one complicated prosecutor-detective relationship going on.) Examine Apollo: (We better get Ema's okay before we start snooping around.) Talk The incident Apollo: Ema, have you determined the cause of death? Ema: Blood loss from a stab wound. A single stab in the back was enough to cause the victim to bleed to death. The estimated time of death is 3 PM, which is when Dhurke came onto the scene. Inga's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Apollo: Any suspects besides Dhurke? Ema: No. He, Maya, and the minister were the only ones here. And Maya had been tied up until she was freed by the queen's royal guard. Apollo: Could someone have been hiding somewhere in here? Ema: Not likely. I was told this tomb was searched from top to bottom right after the murder. And during that time, the royal guard set up a perimeter to prevent anyone from escaping. Athena: In other words, the crime scene was completely sealed off? Ema: It would appear so. Apollo: Hmm... No way for a third party to escape without being spotted, so... (Great. It's another one of those convoluted locked-room mysteries.) The incident (subsequent times) Apollo: Ema, have you determined the cause of death? Ema: Blood loss from a stab wound. A single stab in the back was enough to cause the victim to bleed to death. The estimated time of death is 3 PM, which is when Dhurke came onto the scene. Apollo: Any suspects besides Dhurke? Ema: No. He, Maya, and the minister were the only ones here. And Maya had been tied up until she was freed by the queen's royal guard. Apollo: Could someone have been hiding somewhere in here? Ema: Not likely. I was told this tomb was searched from top to bottom right after the murder. And during that time, the royal guard set up a perimeter to prevent anyone from escaping. Athena: In other words, the crime scene was completely sealed off? Ema: It would appear so. Apollo: Hmm... No way for a third party to escape without being spotted, so... (Great. It's another one of those convoluted locked-room mysteries.) The victim Apollo: About the victim, Minister Inga... He was the kingdom's Minister of Justice, correct? Ema: Yes. Inga Karkhuul Khura'in was the second most powerful figure in Khura'in. Plus, he was married to the queen. Apollo: Seems strange that someone of his status would abduct someone. Ema: Apparently, he only told a few of his most loyal subordinates about his plan. That way, there was little chance of the police or even the queen finding out. Apollo: What was Inga hoping to gain by getting his hands on the orb? Ema: That I don't know. But I'm working on it. Apollo: (...I wonder if it really was for what Paul Atishon-Wimperson said...?) Atishon: I must deliver it to my benefactor at all costs. Phoenix: What do they want that relic for anyway? Atishon: Heh heh heh. It's something to do with an old legend. My patron seeks the great power said to be granted to whoever solves its secret. Apollo: (A great power that is said to be bestowed on whoever solves the orb's secret. In Khura'in, only those who can channel spirits are said to be fit to rule. Was that why Inga wanted such power? Did he want to be king?) Amara's tomb Apollo: So this is the tomb of the previous queen? Ema: Yes, Queen Amara was laid to rest here. She lost her life in an arsonist's blaze. What a tragic end. I heard this tomb sits on the actual site of her residence before it was burned down. They built it on the same spot so her soul could rest in peace. Apollo: (So this is where the fire happened, huh.) Athena: Why do you think Minister Inga was holding Ms. Fey captive here? Ema: It's the perfect spot, if you think about it. It's close to his private quarters, which made it easy to keep an eye on his prisoner. And the courtyard is only open to the royal family, so he had little fear of prying eyes. Plus, the tomb is normally locked, and only the royal family is allowed access. Athena: So that's why he picked this place. Apollo: How long had Ms. Fey been held captive? Ema: About six days. Apollo: Really?! That long?! Ema: It appears that she was severely weakened by her prolonged confinement. She passed out as soon as she was freed, and is now on an IV drip at the hospital. She's been asleep ever since. Athena: Poor Ms. Fey. I hope she gets better soon. Present Attorney's Badge Ema: Your attorney's badge? Huh... Apollo: What, that normally gets a better reaction from you. Ema: I'm tired of collecting your fingerprints. It's kind of lost its luster. Apollo: Yeah, but who knows? There could be other people's prints on it. Ema: Ooh, that's true! Hand it over, buddy! Apollo: Ah! Ema: ............Hmph. The only prints I found were yours. Apollo: (Argh, it's all dusty now.) Anything else Ema: Oh, you must need my forensic expertise! Just leave it to me! Apollo: Oh, um... Actually, I was wondering if you see anything strange about this. Ema: ...Oh. .................................... Apollo: (Why isn't she saying anything?) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: Ema, do you mind if we start looking around? Ema: Sure, I've already got the okay. Knock yourselves out. Oh, and here. It's a diagram the police drew of the tomb. I thought I'd give you a copy to help your investigation along. Apollo: Thank you. Tomb Diagram added to the Court Record. Ema: Oh, and let me know if you need my forensic expertise. Don't you dare keep all the fun to yourselves, you hear?! Apollo: You don't need to worry about that. (Besides, I'd hardly classify this as \"fun\".) Examine Front of Amara's sarcophagus Apollo: So this is Amara's sarcophagus. Let's take a closer look. Sarcophagus curtains Athena: Hey, these curtains open, Apollo. Sarcophagus keyhole Apollo: ...That's one big sarcophagus. Ema: They say the mummy of Amara, the former queen, rests inside. Apollo: A mummy, huh? ...Rats, it's locked. Ema: Hey, don't touch that! Apollo: You mean we can't search inside it? Ema: Not a chance. Besides, it's not something anyone'd try opening, anyway. Apollo: What if the real killer's hiding inside? Athena: Hey! Anyone in there? Ema: D-Don't do that! You're going to get us cursed! Athena: C-C-Cursed? Ema: The queen likely bears a grudge toward the living after such a violent, painful death. So no one dares touch the sarcophagus for fear of incurring her wrath. Athena: .........Oh no, Apollo. What am I going to do? Apollo: Don't look at me. Ema: ...In any case, the sarcophagus is temperature controlled. It's kept really cold to preserve the mummy. So even if someone did decide to hide inside it, they would eventually freeze to death. Apollo: I see... (Still, if they bundled up, I bet a person could hide in there for a little while.) Sides of Amara's sarcophagus Apollo: The sarcophagus is surrounded by a curtain. I bet someone could've hidden behind it. Ema: True, but that's one of the many places the royal guard checked after storming in. Athena: Wow, they were really thorough. Ema: Yes, well, apparently, one of their members loves mystery novels. He peered into every nook and cranny with an almost frightening amount of gusto. And when he was done, he said: \"Very interesting. It's like one of those locked-room mysteries.\" Apollo: Sounds like he's in the wrong line of work. Bloodstain on Amara's sarcophagus Athena: Wow, it's covered in blood. Apollo: With a blood spatter this large, it must've gotten all over the killer, too. Come to think of it... There was blood on Dhurke's clothes. Athena: The circumstantial evidence points to Dhurke being the killer. Apollo: That's what I'd conclude if I were a cop, too. (Why are things always so bleak for me...?) Holy Mother mural Apollo: It looks like the Holy Mother was painted here to watch over Amara's sarcophagus. Athena: So it's like, this tomb is protected by the founder? That must be so reassuring to those she left behind. Apollo: Only one problem: they didn't paint the eyes she needs to do said watching. Athena: Come to think of it, she doesn't have a mouth to smile down on the tomb with, either. It's actually kind of creepy. I wonder if being watched over by something like that gives the queen nightmares. Apollo: ...Hey, hey. Keep that up, and the founder just might come and \"watch over\" you, too. Broken statue (while facing Holy Mother painting) Apollo: Look, one of the statues is broken. Athena: Yeah, but it's kind of hard to see from here. Apollo: Let's check it out when we get a little closer. Front of broken statue Apollo: One of the statues is broken. Let's take a closer look. Broken statue Apollo: This thing's more splinter than statue now. Ema: The bullet from the victim's gun did a real number on it. Athena: It seems like something you'd get cursed for, you know? Apollo: In Minister Inga's case, I'd say getting your ticket punched is curse enough. Athena: Yeah, but don't curses extend to the afterlife? Apollo: You need to stop taking what Nahyuta says so seriously. Athena: I-I'm perfectly capable of thinking for myself! Brown magatamas Apollo: It's a magatama... I think. Did it come from the broken statue? Athena: Look, Apollo, there's another one. But the other statues only have one each. Apollo: Hey, you're right. Maybe this statue was special or something. Bullet Apollo: Look, there's a bullet here. Ema: It's from the pistol the victim was carrying. My guess is he tried to shoot his attacker, but missed, and the bullet ended up here. We've already determined the rifling marks to be a match to his gun. Athena: Rifling marks? Aren't those...? Ema: Oh ho! Shall I explain? The science behind it is absolutely fascinating. Apollo: No, no, we're good. Ema: Hmph, lawyers... Think they're so smart. Apollo: You do realize we can hear you. Sparkling object Apollo: Hm? There's something shiny down there. It's a pendant... Athena: There's blood on it. I wonder who it belongs to. Ema: All we know is it's not the victims. No one in the royal family recognized it. Apollo: ...Ema, did you lift any fingerprints from it? Ema: I did, but... ...I wasn't able to get a clean one. Apollo: That's too bad. Ema: But the blood turned out to be the victim's. Apollo: That means it must have fallen here in the course of the murder. (It might be Dhurke's. I should ask him about it later.) Pink Butterfly Pendant added to the Court Record. Body outline Apollo: Guess this is where Inga collapsed when he died. Better take a closer look. Body outline Apollo: They've already taken the body away. It's kind of sad how familiar I've become with body outlines. Ema: I have a photo of the body if you're interested. He was stabbed right in the back; the poor guy was practically skewered. Athena: What's he wearing on his arms? Ema: Those are the Cuffs of Justice. Seems to be a tradition here for the Minister of Justice to wear those forearm cuffs. Apollo: They look like they're made of a thick fabric, so I guess they aren't for protection. Athena: Maybe they're for keeping his sleeves out of the way when handling documents. Apollo: Yeah, that's probably their original purpose. But over the years, the reason for wearing them was probably forgotten. So now, they're just one of many traditional things that people do without knowing why. Athena: ...Oh, I get it. Kind of like the way you roll up your sleeves, huh? Apollo: ...Or your psychology, if we're going there. Athena: I happen to know why I started, thank you very much! Tomb Crime Photo added to the Court Record. Body outline (subsequent times) Apollo: These white lines indicate where the minister's body fell. Athena: Hey, didn't Ema give us a photo of the crime scene before they took the body away? Apollo: Looks like he was stabbed in the back. Athena: Those things on his arms... They're called the \"Cuffs of Justice,\" right? Apollo: Yeah, they're supposedly a traditional part of the minister's outfit. Knife Apollo: So, this is the murder weapon. Ema, did you find any prints on it? Ema: Yep, and they were super clear. They belong to one Dhurke Sahdmadhi. Apollo: That's not good. Were there any others? Ema: There was one more print from another individual... ...but it was too smudged to identify. It's probably an old print from someone else who had handled the knife. Apollo: Oh... (Yet another piece of unhelpful info to add to our ever-growing pile... *sigh*) Knife (subsequent times) Apollo: The murder weapon... Athena: Apparently, Dhurke's prints were found on it. Apollo: That's not very helpful, is it. Cell phone Apollo: I wonder if this is Inga's cell phone. Ema: It should be. His fingerprints are all over it. Apollo: Do you know if he talked with anyone recently? Ema: There were a few calls logged between him and his underlings. They're all members of the secret police, who were directly under the minister's control. Athena: You mean like spies? Apollo: I don't think that's quite it. Pistol Apollo: So the minister was armed, huh. Ema: Mm-hm. That's a four-shot pistol. He had it for self-defense, apparently. But it won't be firing anything any time soon. Apollo: Huh? Athena: He was carrying a broken gun around for show? Ema: No, we recovered a bullet here. Which means the gun probably broke as the minister fired its last round. Thing is... the gun's chambers are all empty. Yet, that one bullet is the only bullet we could find. Apollo: That is strange. Where did the other three go? Athena: ...Maybe Dhurke ate them. Apollo: We can ask the next time we see him. Just be ready for his predictably \"shocking\" answer. Pistol (subsequent times) Apollo: Inga's pistol... He used to carry it for self-defense. Athena: Apparently, he fired all four rounds. Apollo: Yeah, but only one slug was recovered in this tomb. Rows of statues Apollo: It's like a small army of monks, all neatly lined up. It looks like they're facing the sarcophagus in prayer. Athena: If you look carefully, each one has a slightly different expression. Apollo: I wonder if they used real people as models. Athena: Some are frowning, some are smiling... Hm? There's one that looks like he's trying his hardest not to burst out laughing. Apollo: ...Really? Hmm, I wonder why. Athena: Maybe it's like those times when things are so intense, you can't help but laugh. You know, like at funerals and stuff. Apollo: They went through all the trouble of depicting that? Talk about going overboard... Right incense burner Apollo: It's full of ash. My guess would be this is an incense burner. Athena: Hey, look, Apollo. There's something in the ashes. Apollo: ...Let's see what it is. Ash Apollo: It's full of ash. They must burn incense in here. Athena: So, I was wondering, Apollo... Did the ash come from the incense sticks that were burned in this? Or do people put their incense in after there was already she in here to hold them up? Apollo: Don't be silly, Athena. The answer's simple. The ash is the product of prayers from countless visitors who came here. It's not a chicken-or-the-egg kind of thing. Apollo: Oh, that's an interesting take on it. It's so much more poetic than mine! Gemstone Apollo: Is that... a gemstone? Wonder what it's doing here. Athena: Heh heh heh, I've got this one covered, Apollo. Would you like to hear my brilliant theory? Apollo: Well, I guess it wouldn't do any harm. Athena: You know how people make wishes by throwing coins into a fountain, right? Well-- Apollo: You know, on second thought, I'm good. Athena: Whaaat?! Y-You sure you don't need to hear my theory? I was just about to get to the good part! Apollo: Let's just ask Ema. That'll be much quicker. Excuse me, Ema? What's this gemstone doing here? Ema: Oh, that... It's not a gem, it's a button -- albeit a very expensive one -- from the victim's jacket. Must've fallen off and gotten in there somehow. Apollo: See? Every puzzle has an answer, Athena. Athena: Well, I thought my idea was pretty good... Wait... What's with this soot? See here, on the gemstone. Apollo: ...Hey, you're right. Gemstone added to the Court Record. Right incense burner (after examining gemstone) Apollo: It's full of ash. My guess would be this is an incense burner. Grape juice Apollo: This is the grape juice Inga was drinking. He was probably nervous before his meeting with Dhurke. Athena: So he drank grape juice? I'm not seeing the logic here. Apollo: Mr. Wright told me all about it when he was hospitalized a few years ago. He said grape juice has something in it that helps you relax. Athena: Really? ...Um, are you sure he was talking about regular, plain old grape juice? Because it sounds like he was talking about the fermented variety. Apollo: No, he couldn't have meant that. I mean, we're talking about a medical facility. They wouldn't have allowed something like that in. Athena: R-Right... Let's just leave it at that. Side paintings (while facing Holy Mother mural) Apollo: There's a painting up there, but I can't see it very well from here. Paintings right of Holy Mother mural Apollo: A baby on a lotus blossom? That's one strange painting. Ema: Apparently, that's part of a mural depicting the life and times of Queen Amara. You know, like a storyboard or something. Apollo: So that baby's supposed to be Amara? Athena: This one depicts Amara preaching to the faithful. Apollo: It's hard to put into words, but I've never seen anything like it. Let's see, the next one is... I-Is that... Dhurke? Why does he have horns? Athena: My best guess is... ...it depicts the first time Amara and Dhurke met. Apollo: So he's supposed to be some kind of demon who's seducing her? Athena: Well, he WAS successful since they got married after that. Apollo: ...The mural continues on the opposite wall. Paintings left of Holy Mother mural Athena Is this supposed to be Amara channeling a spirit? Apollo: It looks like the spirit of some country's sultan or something. And she seems to be conveying something to his retainers. Athena: ...Sh-She's on fire. Apollo: This must be Amara's assassination as allegedly carried out by Dhurke. They really made him look evil. Athena: ...This is the weirdest one of all. Apollo: Is that supposed to be Dhurke facing his punishment in the afterlife? Anyway... Hm? I guess that's the last one. Athena: I guess we're supposed to see this as a happy ending. Apollo: Yeah, except nobody came out of this story happy. Chair Apollo: Ms. Fey was apparently tied to this chair. Let's take a closer look. We should try to cover every angle possible here. Let's use [left analog stick / WASD] to change our perspective and take a careful look around. (Changed from [Slide the Touch Screen...] in the original release) * (Line [...or use the Circle Pad ([Circle Pad]) to look around carefully in this area.] removed in the Trilogy release) Seat, rails, or legs of chair Apollo: (...Poor Ms. Fey. She must've been tied up to this chair.) Athena: I can just imagine how much her backside must've hurt after sitting here for so long. Apollo: It would've been torture for you, I bet. I mean, you don't know how to sit still. Athena: If by that you mean I like to stay active, then I have to agree with you. Rope Athena: I bet you didn't know, but I happen to be a bit of an escape artist myself. Trucy showed me how to do her rope escape trick. Apollo: Uh-huh. And why would you bother learning something like that? Athena: Because we're always getting into trouble when working cases with Mr. Wright. So I thought it might come in handy someday. Apollo: Well, I guess you're right about that. Ms. Fey could've definitely used that knowledge. Athena: That's right! So now, you just sit right here and we'll get started. Apollo: What in the world gave you the idea I wanted to learn?! Bloodstain on chair leg Apollo: Look, there's a bloodstain on one of the chair legs. Ema: Really?! Hey, you're right. I completely missed that. Apollo: Let's move the chair so we can check under it. ...There's more blood under the chair leg. Ema: Hmm... I wonder what it's doing there. I have some luminol here. Why don't you do some testing around it? Spray floor near rope Leads to: \"Look!\" Apollo: Look! The bloodstain leads all the way to the sarcophagus! Athena: Ema, is this Minister Inga's blood? Ema: Hold on one second... .........Huh? That's strange. I didn't get a match. Apollo: So then... whose blood is it? Dhurke and Ms. Fey weren't wounded as far as we know. Athena: And the blood's been wiped up by someone for some reason. Apollo: Yeah, that's strange, too. Mysterious Bloodstain added to the Court Record. Bloodstain on floor (after examining bloodstain on chair leg) Apollo: There's a bloodstain on the floor. Athena: It's already been mostly wiped up, but the stain leads all the way to the sarcophagus. Apollo: I wonder whose blood it is. Wall curtains Apollo: Someone could have hid behind these curtains. Athena: Here, I'll go give it a try! Well, can you tell I'm hiding here? Apollo: No, I can't tell at all. That's it! That's the perfect hiding place! Athena: We did it, Apollo! We solved the case! Ema: Sorry to burst your bubble, but... ...the royal guard searched the tomb high and low right after they stormed in. And they said no one else was in here besides Minister Inga, Dhurke, and Ms. Fey. Apollo: ...Well. Back to the drawing board, I guess. Athena: My brilliant deduction -- destroyed in three sentences. After examining sarcophagus keyhole, sides of Amara's sarcophagus, bloodstain on Amara's sarcophagus, Holy Mother mural, broken statue (zoomed in), brown magatamas, sparkling object, body outline (zoomed in), knife, cell phone, pistol, gemstone, bloodstain on chair leg, and wall curtains: Apollo: I think we've covered just about everything. Maybe we should go over what we've learned so far. Athena: Umm... For starters, we're dealing with a locked-room murder. But instead of the tomb being locked, it was being cordoned off by the royal guard. And after the murder, no one was found to be hiding inside. Apollo: Right. In addition... ...we also know that Dhurke's fingerprints are all over the murder weapon. Athena: The curtain around the sarcophagus was drenched in the victim's blood on one side. The blood must've also gotten on the killer when they stabbed the minister from behind. Apollo: Dhurke had blood on him when the crime was first discovered. Unfortunately, he doesn't remember what happened. .................. Athena: ............ Apollo: (This is not good.) Athena: So, what we know so far is... ...things couldn't be worse for our case. And that's still and understatement somehow. Apollo: Yeah, it's looking pretty grim. Ema: Oh, uh! If you two are done here, I'll have to ask you to leave. Go on, scoot! Apollo: Something wrong, Ema? Why are you trying to give us the boot? Ema: ...It's just easier if you're not here when His Ephemeral Holiness arrives. ...Ah! Apollo: (Speak of the devil.) Ema: P-Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... Nahyuta: Detective Skye... It seems you've spoken at length with these two lawyers. I do hope you've also kept an eye on them. Ema: Y-Yes, of course! Like a hawk! They didn't touch a single thing! Ha, a-ha ha ha! Nahyuta: ...Give a lawyer an inch, and they'll take a mile. Never forget that. Apollo: (There's that look of distrust again.) ...Hey, Nahyuta. Do you really believe that Dhurke's guilty? Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: And are you seriously going to prosecute this case? I mean, he's your father. You were once part of the Defiant Dragons, weren't you? Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: Hey! Nahyuta! Wait! I said wait! Come on, Athena, after him! Athena: Huh? ...Oh, uh, right behind you! May 18Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence Apollo: Nahyuta, would you stop already?! Nahyuta: .........What do you want? Apollo: It's about Dhurke. Would you please hear me out? Nahyuta: ...I fail to see why I should. Now, if you'll excuse me... Apollo: Apollo: Nahyuta! ...Are you afraid of what I might have to say? If not, there's no harm in listening, right? Nahyuta: .........Very well. Speak. But make it quick. There is much I must do. Apollo: (Why does everything have to be so difficult with you?) Talk Prosecuting Dhurke Apollo: So, I know you'll be prosecuting Dhurke's case, but... ...aren't there any other prosecutors in this country? Why does it have to be you? Nahyuta: ...Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran, personally requested that I serve as prosecutor. Apollo: Sh-She did? That WOULD make it hard to say no. Nahyuta: Her Eminence thinks highly of my prosecutorial skills. Apollo: Still, she didn't have to ask you to handle a case against your own father. Be honest. You really don't want to do this, do you? Nahyuta: ...Ahh. You speak of love and sentiment. Apollo: Er, I guess so. Nahyuta: I do not deny such human emotions. But... the law is the law. And placing personal feelings above it is beyond reprieve. ...Do you disagree? Apollo: W-Well... No, I don't disagree, but... Nahyuta: Civilizations only exist due to the confines of the law. Without them, love and sentiment would lack the fertile they need to flourish. Do you disagree? Apollo: No, but... Nahyuta: The law must be obeyed. This truth sits above all else, including personal feelings. Therefore, whether or not I am the son of the accused is of no consequence. It is that simple, or would you say otherwise? Apollo: Nnnngh... B-But... Athena: Come on, Apollo! Tell him how wrong he is! Apollo: B...But don't you... you know... wish it wasn't that way...? Nahyuta: ............... Athena: ......... Nahyuta: It appears I've wasted my breath on you. Athena: And the winner is... Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! Nahyuta: ...Hmph. Still spewing empty words devoid of meaning or consequence, I see... ...you putrid red pepper. Apollo: Argh! ........ (I know I'm right... But did he have to be so eloquent about his point? It's like he's trying to cover something up with his pretty words.) Athena: Apollo, I'd cut back on the debates with him if I were you. Just stick to questions, like the one you wanted to ask. Who Dhurke cares about (appears after \"Prosecuting Dhurke\") Leads to: \"Nahyuta, I wanted to ask you about that hostage situation.\" Present Attorney's Badge Nahyuta: Why is that badge before me? Apollo: Remember how we used to talk about what we wanted to be back when we were kids? I wanted to be a lawyer, and you, a prosecutor. You said you wanted to prosecute bad guys to make sure they got punished. Nahyuta: Yes, passing judgment upon evil... That is my calling. And it is why I have taken this case. Apollo: Are you saying Dhurke is evil? Nahyuta: He who goes against what is righteous and holy... ...I shall reap his soul with all my power, whoever he may be, for that is my role. Apollo: (Then I'll just have to defend his soul with all MY power, Nahyuta.) Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Nahyuta: Alas... Another soul has departed this world, and must now be guided to the Twilight Realm. Apollo: You would even hold last rites for a kidnapper like Minister Inga? Nahyuta: Criminals, too, must be given funerary rites. Deny that, and their soul will turn malevolent, bringing woe upon the living. That is why all who pass on must receive a proper requiem. Apollo: Makes sense. I mean, if I were murdered, I'd probably be pretty keen on revenge, too. Anything else Nahyuta: The putrid-minded lawyer seeks information from me? Apollo: Come on, throw me a bone here. Nahyuta: I think not. Apollo: Well, aren't we stingy? Apollo: Nahyuta, I wanted to ask you about that hostage situation. Inga said he had someone dear to Dhurke in the palm of his hand. And he was using that person, along with his hostage, as leverage in obtaining the orb. Nahyuta: ...! That's news to me. Apollo: Well, that's what Inga said. Dhurke: You can kiss your chances of getting the orb goodbye. Inga: ...Heh heh heh. Maya Fey ain't my only... how shall I say... insurance, you know, Dhurke. Dhurke: What? Inga: I've got someone dear to you right in the palm of my hand, see? Now that one, well... You can imagine what kinds of things I could do, right? Dhurke: What? Inga: I've got someone dear to you right in the palm of my hand, see? Now that one, well... You can imagine what kinds of things I could do, right? Dhurke: ! ............ Inga: Heh heh. Glad you're seeing things my way. Apollo: I got the impression Dhurke had no choice but to follow Inga's demands after he heard that. So who do you suppose this special person is? Nahyuta: .........I wouldn't know. BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: ! (My bracelet's reacting!) Hey, Nahyuta, about what you just said-- Nahyuta: Apollo: Ack! Ow-ow-ouch! M-My bracelet is crushing my wrist! Youch! That really hurts! Wh-What the heck's going on?! Nahyuta: ...I'm wise to your tricks, you putrid pepper. That bracelet reacts to the anxieties around you by squeezing your wrist. But now that I know how it works, I can make it tighten around your wrist any time I wish. Consider this a warning. Apollo: Argh... (I don't know how he did it, but this renders my bracelet useless.) Nahyuta: Such devilry is powerless in the face of the Holy Mother's blessings. Athena: Looks like your special power won't work against Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, Apollo. We'll have to try something else. Apollo: Argh, you're right. We'll just have to ask Dhurke about this. Nahyuta: .........It appears... Apollo: ? Nahyuta: ...You intend to go through with a trial you have no hope of winning. Grow up, Mr. Justice. We are no longer children, you and I. Apollo: I'm not the one who needs to grow up, Nahyuta. In case you didn't hear, I won my last case against none other than Mr. Wright. Nahyuta: ! Athena: You tell him, Apollo! Nahyuta: ............... Apollo: (Is he mad? I can never tell with him.) Nahyuta: ...This trial is different. Your foolishness will only earn you a death sentence for aiding and abetting a criminal. And those who die as criminals... ...are doomed to be reborn in the next life as something lower than a bug or vegetable. You would be lucky to return to this realm as a patch of mold. Apollo: M-Mold? That's pretty harsh. Nahyuta: If you wish to avert such a fate, abandon this folly before it is too late. Apollo: ...I don't care if I end up as a dollop of blue cheese dressing in my next life! I'm going to defend Dhurke in court! Nahyuta: .........You fool. Know this... I intend to prosecute the accused with all my might -- no matter what you say or do. Consider yourself forewarned. ...Now, if you will excuse me. Athena: Prosecutor Sahdmadhi knows his father will be publicly executed if he's found guilty. Yet he won't show even an ounce of mercy. Apollo: ............... (...Nahyuta. Is this the real you? Have you really changed? Do you really plan on sending Dhurke to his death? Do you even hear me? Don't Dhurke and I matter to you anymore?) To be continued May 18Tem'phul Temple Phoenix: (Maya passed out right after we found her in the tomb.) Maya: ...I feel... exhausted. I can't keep my eyes... open... Phoenix: (She's been out cold ever since. We haven't been able to get a word out of her. The doctor says it's just exhaustion, but I can't help but worry...) Edgeworth: What is it, Wright? Are you all right? Phoenix: ...Yeah. Just thinking is all. I'm glad you're here, Edgeworth. We wouldn't have gotten the permissions we have without you. Edgeworth: ...Well, I didn't come all the way to Khura'in to be useless. Speaking of the investigation, I received a few things from Detective Skye. These should prove to be useful to us as well. Inga's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Tomb Diagram added to the Court Record. Tomb Crime Photo added to the Court Record. Phoenix: I can't thank you enough, Edgeworth. (Honestly, I'd have been so lost without him these past few days.) ???: You there! The \"Barbed Head\" lawyer, Phoenix Wriiiiiight! Phoenix: Huh? .........You're... from the Ga'ran Royal Guard, right...? Royal Guard: I am Lah'kee, royal guard member and Her Eminence's shoooooulder rubber!!! Phoenix: That's... very specific... And what does the royal shoulder rubber want with me? Wait, come to think of it, my shoulders ARE a bit stiff-- Royal Guard: Don't be absuuurd!!! I am here for one purpose ooonly!!! I am to bring you before Her Eminence... ...Queen Ga'ran, grand priestess of Khura'in!! Will you complyyy?!!! Phoenix: The queen? What could she want with me? (And why does he have to shout like that?) Edgeworth: Hmm... I can't fathom why Queen Ga'ran would summon you... ...but I advise you to accept Her Eminence's gracious invitation. .........Royal shoulder rubber Lahkee, was it? May I join Mr. Wright in his audience with the queen? Royal Guard: The name's Lah'kee! L-A-H apostrophe K-E-E!!! And...! All praise the omnipotent Queen Ga'raaan!!! For she has already foreseen and approved your request, Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth!!! You are both to come with meeeee!!! Edgeworth: You mean to say that Queen Ga'ran sees our every move? Royal Guard: Yes indeeeed! Her Eminence's spiritual power is immeeeeeeense!!! She can even see what's going on thoooousands of miiiiiiiiles away!!! Edgeworth: .........Wright. I fear I'll lose my hearing next if we don't hurry. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Me, too... Why would the queen herself summon me personally? What could she possibly be up to? Examine Temple Phoenix: There weren't any hotels available, so this is our home for tonight. It's a bed to sleep in and a roof over our heads. Phoenix: Sorry to disappoint, but... there aren't any beds here. We'll have to sleep on the floor next to a bunch of strangers. Edgeworth: Wh-What? ...Tell me there's a shower at the very least. Phoenix: The kitchen sink works just fine, I hear. Edgeworth: Of all the-- Wright, you will work to bring this case to a swift resolution. The sooner the better. Edgeworth: .........I suppose it will do. Spring Phoenix: The water's so clear, it's like a window into the soul. Edgeworth: I wouldn't stare too hard into it, Wright. Or you may find all your bluffs staring right back at you. Phoenix: No pool-gazing in front of a client. Got it. Temples in background Edgeworth: There appears to be many temples in this area. Phoenix: Yeah, there are always a lot of monks and worshippers praying around here. And then there's tourists like us. Edgeworth: It's unfortunate that we have more pressing matters to attend to. Then again, sightseeing with you of all people isn't exactly at the top of my list. Phoenix: (As if you have the luxury to be so picky, Edgeworth.) Talk Any Ideas? Edgeworth: So you'd been here all this time. I wondered where you had gone. Phoenix: ...Don't tell me you missed me, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: As if. The courts have been so peaceful without you around. Phoenix: You make it sound like I leave legal devastation in my wake. Edgeworth: Heh... Well, don't you? What to do Edgeworth: Well, Wright, what do you intend to do now? Phoenix: I was thinking... I want to help Apollo win this case. So why don't we try to gather whatever information we can? Edgeworth: You're quite the considerate boss. Phoenix: Well, I kinda forced him to take care of the office in my absence, so... ...it's the least I can do. Present Attorney's Badge or Tomb Diagram Edgeworth: Still at it, I see. I guess borders mean little in the face of your incurable habit. Phoenix: Well, I heard you used to present evidence left and right during your investigations, too. Edgeworth: That was a long time ago. ...Besides, who did you hear that from? Phoenix: Oh, I have my sources. Edgeworth: Oh? Well, tell your \"source\" that I look forward to his next salary review. Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Edgeworth: It's ironic that the man tasked with upholding the law should end up breaking it. Phoenix: Well, it's not like we don't have our fair share of that back home. Edgeworth: Hmph, that is a thing of the past. The worst offenders have already been removed. Phoenix: Now that you mention it, wasn't Gaspen Payne expelled from the prosecutor's office? Edgeworth: Yes, he was a particularly troublesome individual. I was shocked to see him resurface here in Khura'in, and with considerable sway, no less. I just hope he doesn't end up making a mess of things here as well. Royal Residence Examine Ga'ran Palace Phoenix: Ga'ran Palace, the heart of the kingdom's government and religion. Edgeworth: Yes, the two are inseparably intertwined here in Khura'in. The religious beliefs of its people touch every aspect of their lives, including legal affairs. Phoenix: Right. Like how they commune with spirits in court. I suppose Khura'inism is the glue that binds their faith, law, and politics together. It may seem strange to foreigners like us, but for them, it's perfectly natural. Landscape Phoenix: What a beautiful place this is. But I'd be enjoying this a whole lot more if we weren't investigating a murder. Edgeworth: Commoners aren't normally allowed access to the royal residence, you know. Under ordinary circumstances, it would be impossible to take in such a spectacular view. Though murder is certainly a unique reason to be offered such a rare opportunity. Rayfa's residence Phoenix: This place is decorated with all sorts of colorful flowers. And that view from the veranda looks like it would be amazing. If I had to guess, I'd say Rayfa must live here. Amara's Tomb Phoenix: Amara's Tomb -- the scene of Inga's murder. Poor Maya was held captive in there. Edgeworth: To think she was actually being held here in Khura'in. If only we had found out sooner. Phoenix: ...No point dwelling on that now. All we can do is to keep moving forward. Edgeworth: Yes, of course. Footprints Edgeworth: There are footprints coming from this residence. Phoenix: Too bad they just kinda end. I wonder who made them and where they went. Urns Phoenix: This overturned urn spilled its water all over the place. It was already knocked over when we got here earlier this afternoon, so... ...we can rule out Athena at least. Edgeworth: .........Wright. What does it say about you if your first suspect is your own subordinate? Inga's residence Phoenix: ...What a gaudy building. Looks like something you'd appreciate, Edgworth. Edgeworth: ...For the record, Wright, I have absolutely no interest in such ostentatious things. Phoenix: (Says the man who rides around in a red sports car, wearing that frilly cravat thing.) Amara's Tomb Examine Anywhere Phoenix: Apollo and Athena are already working this area. Edgeworth and I should try someplace else. Detention Center Examine Bell Edgeworth: This bell must be for summoning the guard. Phoenix: I bet one of your detectives would come running if you rang it. Edgeworth: Let's find out, shall we? Phoenix: Th-They're not seriously going to show up, are they? Guard Phoenix: Oh, the guard's asleep. And here I thought he was stoically doing his duty. Impressive. May 18Ga'ran Palace - Audience Chamber Ga'ran: Ah, the \"Barbed Head\" lawyer has arrived. We bid you welcome. And you, as well, Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth. Phoenix: Th-Thank you. (This place is still as magnificent as last time.) Ga'ran: We have heard much about you, Barbed One. It seems your bluffs and tomfoolery tend to leave our court devastated in their wake. Phoenix: Uh... Is that what people have been saying about me? Edgworth: ...Wright! Where are your manners?! Your Eminence. I am both humbled and delighted to be in your presence. Phoenix: Oh, umm... Your Eminence... Um, glad to be here. Looks like you're doing well. Ga'ran: ...Heh. It is all right. There is no need to keep your head bowed all day. Edgeworth: Yes, Your Eminence. Rayfa: ............ Phoenix: (Rayfa's not looking too good. I guess even she can't just bounce back from her father's murder...) ...So what can I do for you, Your Eminence? Ga'ran: We wish to question you about something related to the case at hand. Phoenix: (Perfect. Because I have a few questions of my own.) Examine Throne Phoenix: That's one swanky throne. I wouldn't mind taking a seat there myself. Edgeworth: The jester and the crown. I imagine it'd make quite the interesting picture. Phoenix: You know Edgeworth... I hate to say this, but you're absolutely right. Guards Phoenix: It's the Ga'ran Royal Guard. The one who came for us earlier said that he's the royal shoulder rubber. ...Um, excuse me. But are each of you charged with your own specific task? Royal Guard: I'm the royal teeeeeaaaa server! Royal Guard: I'm the royal taaaaaaster! Royal Guard: I'm the royal bed maaaaaaaker! Royal Guard: I'm the royal fitness traaaaiiiiine-- Phoenix: All right, all right... I'm sorry I asked. Edgeworth: At this rate, one has to wonder if there is no task left unassigned by Her Eminence. Talk Inga's crime Ga'ran: We fear we do not fully comprehend what has transpired. So it is that we summoned you here to further elucidate the situation. Is it true that our husband Inga had been seeking the Founder's Orb? Phoenix: That's right. He wanted to trade a hostage for it. That's why he abducted Maya Fey. Rayfa: Insolent fool! *ka-tonk!* Phoenix: Oww! Rayfa: That is a lie! A lie, I say! Father would have never done such a thing! Phoenix: B-But he did abduct Maya. That much is-- Rayfa: I will not stand here and listen to this nonsense! You will pay for this, you... you...! *ka-tonk!* *ka-tonk!* *ka-tonk!* Phoenix: Ow-Ow-Oww! P-Please, Your Benevolence! Ga'ran: That is quite enough, Rayfa. We understand your feelings, but we fear he speaks the truth. For we believe we know why your father would do such a thing. Rayfa: Huh? Ga'ran: We believe he was seeking the orb as a means of obtaining spiritual power. And with it, he intended to usurp the throne. Rayfa: .........M-Mother... Phoenix: What do you mean, Your Eminence? Ga'ran: Inga was planning a coup, for he was dissatisfied with the current administration... ...and his secret police was the primary instrument of his treason. Phoenix: The secret police... They came up during the high priest's murder trial, too. An elite force under the direct command of the Minister of Justice -- in this case, Inga. The man who was hunting down rebels as Lady Kee'ra was a member of that group. Ga'ran: Indeed. Inga turned that once proud force into his own private army. And he intended on using them to launch a coup and assassinate us. Edgeworth: So Your Eminence had no control over them? Ga'ran: As much as it shames us to admit it, Khura'in is not the unified realm it would appear to be. We are truly sorry you have had to witness the dirty underbelly of our kingdom. Rayfa: H...How could Father...? Ga'ran: But know that Inga could not have become king simply through our assassination. For in Khura'in, only those who possess spiritual power may sit on the throne. Edgeworth: I see... That explains why Minister Inga was seeking the Founder's Orb. Ga'ran: Barbed One, do you recall the man known as Pees'lubn Andistan'dhin? Phoenix: ...What about him? Ga'ran: He, too, was involved in Inga's machinations. Inga had bought his loyalty, ordered the man to steal the orb, and covered up the theft. Phoenix: And then, he sent the orb to the U.S. for Dr. Buff to study... It's all coming together... Dhurke the criminal Ga'ran: The capture of the infamous villain Dhurke Sahdmadhi... It may prove to be the crowning achievement of our reign. Now, perhaps, the kingdom may return to the peace it once knew. Oh, what a joyous day. Royal Guard: Hail to Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran, Grand Priestess of Khura'in! Her Eminence's spiritual power invoked a blessing straight from the Holy Mother! Phoenix: (I could see how her cronies would be elated at the prospect. But the queen herself seems almost giddy for someone whose husband was just murdered.) Rayfa: Father... Phoenix: (Rayfa, on the other hand, doesn't appear to be taking it so well.) About that incident that occurred twenty-three years ago... The one in which Dhurke was accused of assassinating Queen Amara. Ga'ran: Yes, he set fire to her private residence, burning my dear sister alive. Phoenix: Murder by arson... Ga'ran: ONly a demon would be capable of such a heinous crime. Phoenix: (But that event also set the stage for you to become queen...) What did you do before you were crowned queen, Your Eminence? Ga'ran: As part of our training to be queen, we served in many different governmental positions. The longest of which was as the previous Minister of Justice. It was in that position that we were best able to support our elder sister, Queen Amara. Phoenix: (Interesting... That's her husband's position, or at least it was.) And when you ascended to the throne, you passed the Defense Culpability Act. Defense Culpability Act (appears after \"Dhurke the criminal\") Phoenix: \"...those who would support criminals will be deemed just as guilty.\" What prompted you to pass something like the Defense Culpability Act, Your Eminence? Ga'ran: ...The assassination of our dear sister Amara. When the infamous villain Dhurke Sahdmadhi was apprehended... ...he announced that he would act as his own lawyer. Phoenix: (That's right... Dhurke used to be a lawyer.) Ga'ran: Dhurke had been an extraordinarily talented lawyer, and highly esteemed by the people. But he falsified evidence in an attempt to win his own case. Phoenix: I see... Ga'ran: But when the truth of his fabrications and the assassination of the queen came to light... ...the people were devastated. And trust in the legal system plummeted. Edgeworth: .........Now why does that sound so familiar? Phoenix: Yeah, I wonder, aha-hah-hah... Ga'ran: In Khura'in, the Hall of Justice is a sacred space where victims receive their last rites. Should the people lose their faith in it, the kingdom would be shaken to its very core. That is why the Defense Culpability Act had to be passed. It was the only way to keep our legal system from tumbling into the abyss. Phoenix: So that's how you sought to eliminate the use of perjury and phony evidence, huh. But that law is what made lawyers go extinct in your kingdom. Now there's no one left to defend those who have been accused. Ga'ran: .........We see how you could take issue with such a reality. However, we have not banned the act of lawyering itself. Those who are confident that they can prove their client's innocence... ...are always welcome to mount a vigorous defense, as you yourself have shown. Phoenix: W-Well, I guess so, but... Without lawyers, there's the possibility of false charges being filed and prosecuted. Ga'ran: So long as our prosecutors continue to run nothing but perfect trials... ...there needn't be fear of such nefarious dealings. Do you disagree? Phoenix: (Perfect prosecutors and their perfect trials, huh...) Edgeworth: Let's not get started down THIS path... Ga'ran: Furthermore, here in Khura'in, we have the Divination Séance. And so it is we no longer need lawyers, for the dead do not lie. Phoenix: Well, in the short time I've been here, I've beaten back false charges twice. And I've found that cases built on the memories of the dead are less than perfect. So yes, I do take issue with the Defense Culpability Act, to say the least. Ga'ran: ...Ho ho ho. Such relentless rhetoric. Your reputation precedes you, Barbed One. It feels as if we ourselves were being cross-examined. Phoenix: O-Oh, no, that wasn't my intention. Ga'ran: ...It is true that some feel that the Defense Culpability Act is a necessary evil at best. But it is a small sacrifice upon which the peace of our kingdom has been forged. Phoenix: (If you consider executing innocent lawyers a small sacrifice, then sure.) Ga'ran: The fact is that following its passage... ...the crime rate here in Khura'in dropped markedly. Therefore, we have no regrets concerning the enactment of the Defense Culpability Act. Phoenix: (Really? None at all?) Edgeworth: Wright, why don't we leave it at that? This isn't a court of law, after all. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Present Anything Phoenix: Um, please take a look at this... Ga'ran: ...That reminds us of when Dhurke was still practicing law. So, we see that lawyers in your country also present evidence... ...simply to gauge the other party's reaction when all else has failed. Do not presume to use such simplistic methods upon us. Phoenix: S-Sorry. After clearing all Talk options: Ga'ran: About the Founder's Orb that was to be exchanged for the hostage... It went missing after the murder. Would you happen to know anything about that? Phoenix: It's missing? I'm sure Dhurke had it when he went into the tomb. If it wasn't there, I have no idea where it could be, Your Eminence. Ga'ran: ...In that case, then perhaps Dhurke has hidden it somewhere. ...Incidentally... there is the matter of that horned youth you were with. Phoenix: Oh, you must mean Apollo. Ga'ran: From his odd hairstyle, may we assume him to be a relative? Perhaps, your younger brother? Phoenix: N-No, no! You've got it all wrong. He's Dhurke's son. Well, more like foster son -- they're not actually related by blood. Ga'ran: Dhurke's...? .........Royal guard! Royal Guard: Your Eminence! Phoenix: Hm? (What's she whispering in that one guy's ear?) Ga'ran: .........Thank you for your time. The two of you may go now. Edgeworth: Yes, Your Eminence. We'll be on our way. Phoenix: (Okay, now what? Apollo and Athena have the murder scene investigation covered, so... ...maybe we should go speak with the locals over at the bazaar.) May 18Khura'in - Bazaar RAWWWRRR! Edgeworth: Wh-What... Was that a lion? Phoenix: Oh, that? Caught me by surprise, too, when I first heard it. It's the cry of a local bird known as a warbaa'd. Edgeworth: A bird? That sounds like that? Warbaa'd: RAWWWRRR! Edgeworth: Sounds more like a beast than a bird, if you ask me. Phoenix: It's a form of mimicry. You know, to help protect them against predators and stuff. Edgeworth: Yes, well... Can't say I've heard one quite like that before. Phoenix: Oh, it's more than unusual -- it's endangered. It's extremely rare to encounter one in the wild these days. Edgeworth: ...If it's so rare, then what's one doing out here in the middle of the bazaar? Phoenix: You got me. Maybe it's got something to do with it being their national bird. *BANG* Phoenix: Aaahh! (Was that a gunshot?!) ???: Har har har har har! Startle ya, PW? Phoenix: Wh-What was that, Datz?! Datz: The Defiant Dragons' newest weapon. I call these puppies... Dragon Snot Snaps! Phoenix: Uh, huh... And you need those... why? Datz: Because our hard work is starting to pay off! Thanks to our TV signal hijacking and stuff, more and more people are joining our cause. But on account o' that, the regime's been cracking down on us real tough-like. Phoenix: Yeah, there's been a lot going on lately. Datz: You can say that again. I mean, what with the high priest's fake-murder-slash-suicide. People are calling it the \"DCA Tragedy,\" and it's causing a real public uproar. Phoenix: (Hopefully this means Tahrust's death won't be in vain after all.) ...So how exactly is a handful of firecrackers going to be of help to you guys anyway? Datz: Simple. First, I supply 'em to our fellow rebels. Then we use 'em as a diversion when we need to shake Ga'ran's goons. Phoenix: Huh? Datz: Like this! *BANG!* Phoenix: Whoa! W-Will you cut that out?! I'm not with the regime, and I'm not chasing you! Datz: Har har har har har har! Haaaar har har har har! Your reaction! That was priceless, PW! Warbaa'd: RAWWWRRR! Datz: Har har har har har har! Guess I startled that warbaa'd, too! Phoenix: (It's a miracle no one's trying to arrest him while he's too busy laughing.) ???: You there. Datz: ! Rayfa: You are one of those insurgents, are you not? Datz: Yikes! ...Take that! *BANG!* Rayfa: Eek! Phoenix: Aaand he's gone. Those firecrackers are more useful than I thought. Rayfa: Barbed Head! Phoenix: Your Benevolence. What can I do for you? Rayfa: I... I wanted to speak with you. .........About what my mother said... I do not believe a word of it. My father could not have been planning a coup. Phoenix: Well, I can understand why you'd feel like that, but... Rayfa: It was a setup! Someone must have been plotting against him. Phoenix: Um, and how do you know that? Rayfa: I just do. Because the Holy Mother guides me. And as the royal priestess, I must uncover the truth for all to see. Phoenix: (Hmm... Maybe this is just how Rayfa expresses her sense of duty.) Rayfa: You're investigating this matter, are you not? Then rejoice, for I shall accompany you, and bestow upon you the royal priestess's wisdom. Phoenix: Ha, a-ha ha. That's the best news I've heard all day, Your Benevolence. (No one would dare get in our way with Rayfa by our side.) We humbly accept your offer, don't we, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: As you wish, Wright. Rayfa: Excellent. Then let us begin with my father's private quarters. We should be able to find some clues there. I shall expose this false charge for what it is, if it is the last thing I do! Phoenix: (Could it be? Is the reason she's so defensive about Inga because she's a daddy's girl?) Rayfa: Barbed Head! Let us not waste any time! My father's private quarters are located within the royal residence. Now, follow me! Phoenix: Wait! She's sure in a hurry. Edgeworth: Wright, the minister's private quarters may hold evidence related to his murder as well. Phoenix: Yeah, maybe we can kill two birds with one stone. (Rayfa's awfully fired up. I just hope she'll be ready for the truth we find. After all, it's hard to believe that Inga was not in full control of the whole affair.) Examine Any point of interest Edgeworth: I never thought the day would come when we'd be investigating a case side by side. Phoenix: Oh? 'Cause I never thought the day would come when you'd get sentimental on me. Edgeworth: Nghrk! Come on, Wright! Time's a wasting! Phoenix: Wait, exactly which one of us was wasting time here? May 18Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence Phoenix: Now, if we could figure out which of these buildings houses Inga's private quarters... That's where we'll find Rayfa. Examine Inga's residence Phoenix: Now that's what I call an extravagant exterior. Is this where Inga's private quarters are? Edgeworth: Watch your step, Wright. That urn's been knocked over, spilling water everywhere. Phoenix: Yeah, the ground's soaked. I wonder who did this? ???: .........*sob* Phoenix: Hm? ...I think someone's in there. ???: *sob* Father... *sniffle* Phoenix: Is that... Princess Rayfa? Rayfa: There were still so many things I wished to tell you... Phoenix: (...She always puts on such a brave face. But hearing her crying all alone... I... I can't help but think of Trucy.) Rayfa: *sob* Father... ............... Phoenix: ...Um, Princess Rayfa? Are you in there? Rayfa: Ah! J-Just a moment! I'll be right out! .........I see you are finally here. Well, let us commence our investigation, shall we? Phoenix: ...Um, Your Benevolence? Maybe you should rest for a minute first. Rayfa: ...! You were eavesdropping on me! Weren't you?! Phoenix: Um, no! I mean, yes... Sorry. I couldn't help overhearing... Rayfa: .........Grrrr. Phoenix: I-It wasn't like I was spying on you or anything! Rayfa: ...You stupid... stupid... Barbed Head! *ka-tonk!* Phoenix: Yeowch! Edgeworth: ...You could've feigned ignorance. It's as if your brain-to-mouth filter shuts off the moment you step out of the courtroom. Phoenix: Ugh... I'm not THAT bad, Edgeworth. Rayfa: ...Anyway, what took you so long? I thought you would never get here. You have a lot of nerve, keeping the crown princess waiting. Phoenix: Oh, um... sorry? Rayfa: This was my father's residence. I have already unlocked it, so you can go right in. Oh, and... Be careful. Some dingbat dog in the courtyard and spilled water over there. Phoenix: A dingbat dog? Rayfa: That's right. The yappy mutt spilled a whole urn's worth. Phoenix: I wonder how it got into this area. Do you know what it looked like? Rayfa: Hmph. I have better things to do than to memorize what some stray dog looks like. Anyway, it is not worth talking about. Let's search my father's room, shall we? Phoenix: (...I really hope she's all right.) Inga's residence (subsequent times) Edgeworth: The Minister of Justice used to live here. Phoenix: Yeah, the decor looks like something he'd choose. After examining Inga's residence in Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence: May 18Ga'ran Palace - Inga's Private Quarters Phoenix: (What a mess. You can definitely tell a guy used to live in this room. I guess Inga and I had at least that much in common.) Rayfa: ...Bah, this staff keeps getting in the way. Nayna! .................. ...Oh. Phoenix: (Huh? Where's Nayna? Normally... ...she comes running whenever Rayfa calls.) Rayfa: ...That's right. Nayna is... Phoenix: (Nayna is... what?) Rayfa: Oh, well. You, Barbed Head! Come, hold this staff for me. Phoenix: Wh-Why me? Rayfa: Just take it! It's too heavy, and I am tired of holding it! Phoenix: (*sigh* How does Nayna put up with this day in and day out?) Um... I'll just set it over here for now. Examine Shoeprints Phoenix: There are some muddy shoeprints here. (Come to think of it... There was some spilled water by the entrance. Somebody must've stepped in it before coming in here.) Edgeworth: They're already dry. That means they're at least several hours old. Rayfa: Then someone must have been in here today in the early afternoon... ...for our servants clean this room each day. Here in Khura'in we have a saying: \"Leave not today's untidiness to the morrow.\" Phoenix: (Mine is: \"Why clean up today what you can leave for tomorrow?\") Hair dye bottle Phoenix: What's this? ...\"Je suis L'Belle!\"? Never thought I'd see THIS brand again... Edgeworth: It appears to be a sample of some sort of spray-on hair color. Phoenix: \"Color: Jet Black\"... I wonder if Inga was going grey. Here, Edgeworth. Maybe you can use it. Edgeworth: I like my natural hair color just fine, thank you very much! Desk Phoenix: His desk is crammed full of documents! Edgeworth: Hmm... They appear to be paperwork for executions. Phoenix: B-But for this many cases?! Edgeworth: Indeed. Something is rotten in the Kingdom of Khura'in. Hm? This one dates back to five years ago. Phoenix: Something tells me he simply kept putting them off because he hated doing paperwork. Bed Phoenix: That's one luxurious and comfy-looking bed. I've slept on nothing but hard floors since coming to Khura'in. Can't wait to sleep in a nice, soft bed again. Rayfa: Then take it. It's yours, if you wish. ......We'll have to clean this room out, anyway, now that my father's gone. Phoenix: But don't you want to keep these things as a memento of your father? Besides... I don't need his spirit haunting me late at night. Rayfa: .........Do you suppose if I slept on it, I could see my father once more? Phoenix: P-Princess Rayfa... (I honestly don't know how to answer that...) Bust Phoenix: Wow... That's one gaudy sculpture. Rayfa: My father sculpted it himself from a block of solid gold. Phoenix: (Why does it not surprise me that he was also a narcissist?) Ha ha ha. It's pretty detailed. He even included that personal stamp of his. Hey, the stamp's a little loose. Ah! Edgeworth: Look. There's a secret safe inside! Rayfa: Oh, my! To think such a thing was here all this time! Phoenix: Rats. Looks like we'll need the combination to get in. Bust (subsequent times) Edgeworth: To have a secret safe in his own bedroom... It seems the minister was a rather cagey man. Phoenix: Let's take a look inside. Who knows what we might find. Safe (after examining bust) Phoenix: We can't open this without the combination, but I doubt Princess Rayfa would know it... Edgeworth: Well, if we can't open it, we can't open it. For now, let's continue our investigation, and come back to this dilemma later. Syringe Phoenix: It's a syringe and a vial... Rayfa: Those were for my father's back pain. He said it really helped when the pain was particularly unbearable. Phoenix: It was that bad, huh. Edgeworth: He must've been injecting some sort of painkiller directly into his back, then. Rayfa: Yes, my father said his back pain could knock him off his feet. Phoenix: I know the feeling. I've experienced some pretty severe back pain of my own... Rayfa: Well, we can't have you throwing your back out in court, so why don't you take a vial? Phoenix: Oh, uh, no thanks. I hear your body builds up a tolerance to that sort of thing. Painkiller Shots ninja'd into pocket. Rayfa: I thought you didn't want them. Phoenix: (I'm going straight to a chiropractor as soon as I get home.) Syringe (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's a syringe and a vial... Rayfa: Those were for my father's back pain. He said it really helped when the pain was particularly unbearable. Phoenix: It was that bad, huh. Edgeworth: He must've been injecting some sort of painkiller directly into his back, then. Rayfa: Yes, my father said his back pain could knock him off his feet. Phoenix: I know the feeling. I've experienced some pretty severe back pain of my own... Backrest of chair Phoenix: This chair looks like it was modeled after Inga's suit jacket. Edgeworth: Hmm... The backrest even has those fancy buttons of his. I imagine they make the chair awfully uncomfortable to sit on. Rayfa: Actually, they served to massage the pressure points on his back. My father suffered from terrible back pain, you see. Phoenix: ...I wonder if it really works. Notepad Phoenix: This notepad must've belonged to Inga. Let's see... That's strange. Edgeworth: These appear to be notes detailing people's most prominent characteristics. Phoenix: Hey, there's even some stuff about me in here. Why would he bother doing this? Rayfa: Hmm... I am afraid even I can't answer that. Phoenix: (Whatever the reason, it's giving me a case of the heebie-jeebies.) Edgeworth: Hmm... It's as though he was taking down descriptions of people over the phone... That's what it reminds me of, anyway. Rayfa: What a brilliant deduction! One fitting of a chief prosecutor such as yourself. I commend you. Edgeworth: ...Heh, that's high praise coming from you, Your Benevolence. Phoenix: (Edgeworth's right. They do look like dictation notes, but... I don't know... I mean, why bother describing Nayna, who he must've seen every day?) Inga's Notepad added to the Court Record. Notepad (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's the notepad with those descriptions of various people in it. I wonder what Inga was using it for. Move Rayfa: Barbed Head. First you make me wait, and now you're simply going to leave?! Phoenix: (Guess I should stay put for a while.) Talk The kidnapping Rayfa: Barbed Head... I, the Royal Priestess of Khura'in, shall share my thoughts on the abduction. Phoenix: You will? Rayfa: ......Listen carefully, for such opportunities do not come often. Phoenix: Y-Yes, of course. We'd be grateful to hear anything you'd like to share. Rayfa: ...My father was very likely seeking to obtain the Founder's Orb. But it was not for the purposes of a coup d'état. It was all... for my sake! Phoenix: For your sake? Rayfa: The Founder's Orb is capable of bestowing great spiritual power. My father truly believed that. And he wanted that power to be mine. I haven't finished my training, and I still can't channel spirits! He was doing it for me! Phoenix: ......Right, I see. Rayfa: Well? Do you understand why he did it now? Phoenix: ............I do, but... ...it doesn't change the fact that Minister Inga was a kidnapper. Rayfa: Ah! Phoenix: But I guess you don't believe he is, do you? Rayfa: Ooooooh! New information is sure to surface upon further investigation. S-Suffice to say, he did this all for me. End of story! Phoenix: (Was he really trying to obtain the orb for Rayfa? Somehow, I doubt it. Speaking of powers... ...I wonder if Rayfa will be performing the Divination Séance tomorrow. I should probably ask her about that. Nayna Phoenix: Your Benevolence, I noticed Nayna isn't with you today. Rayfa: .........I know not where she has gone. I have not spoken with her since this morning. I assume she must be quite busy today. I did catch a glimpse of her a little after two o'clock. I tried calling out to her... ...but she went off somewhere again. Phoenix: A little after two? That's about an hour before the murder. Rayfa: ...Indeed. Of all the times for this to happen... She normally comes to me the moment I call her name. Phoenix: (I know it's hard to believe, but even nannies have lives, you know...) Edgeworth: Your inability to find her after the murder is slightly alarming. I wonder if her absence is related to today's incidents somehow. Rayfa: Do you think she was unwittingly caught up in them? Phoenix: Who knows... At the very least I don't think she was at the scene of the crime. Rayfa: Nayna... I hope she is all right. Phoenix: (Rayfa seems really worried for Nayna.) Tomorrow's Séance (appears after \"The kidnapping\") Phoenix: I take it you'll be conducting tomorrow's Divination Séance? Rayfa: Who else, if not I? Phoenix: Good point. (The thing is... ...Divination Séances are all about what victims experienced in their final moments. So, tomorrow... ...Rayfa will experience her own father's death, exactly as it happened. That's more than anyone should ever have to deal with.) ...Do you really have to go through with the Séance tomorrow? There's really no one else? What about just calling the whole thing off? Rayfa: ............It's not as if... ...It's not as if I'm doing this because I want to. Phoenix: No? Rayfa: Ah! N-Never mind. I misspoke! The Divination Séance is a very important duty of the royal priestess. And it is one I intend to fulfill. Phoenix: (There's that word: duty.) Maya: ...Your Benevolence. As crown princess, you are destined to rule this kingdom one day. That means there will be many things that you alone must determine. Things like how to keep your people happy, and what is true and what is false... And most importantly, what role you must play therein. Rayfa: .................. I wonder if I am even up to the task. Phoenix: (Performing the Divination Séance IS very important for a priestess... ...but duty or not, it's a heavy burden for someone so young. Even worse, she'll be forced to watch her father's murder. Will it be a weight too heavy for her to bear?) Nayna and Rayfa (appears after \"Nayna\") Phoenix: Your Benevolence, has Nayna served you long? Rayfa: Yes, she has been at my beck and call for as long as I can remember. I have heard she even cared for me as an infant, right down to changing my diapers. Phoenix: Your diapers? It almost sounds like she could be your mother. Rayfa: Indeed. But that is a simple fact of life when your mother is busy being queen. Nayna takes care of my every need. She is my teacher in all things, as well. Phoenix: (Rayfa's pool of knowledge seems rather lopsided in some respects. Could that be the result of Nayna's teachings?) Rayfa: Nayna... Could it be that my trusted attendant has come to dislike me? Now that I think about it, perhaps I've been acting rather spoiled as of late. Phoenix: Oh, I'm sure she'll be back. Rayfa: ...Yes, I suppose Nayna would never truly abandon me. Upon her return, I will do something nice for her. Perhaps she'd like a shoulder massage. Phoenix: (And yet, I can't shake the feeling that Nayna's connected to this case in some way.) Present Attorney's Badge Rayfa: Remove that vile badge from my sight! If you insist on tormenting me, I will take matters into my own hands! Phoenix: Hey, don't bite it! Rayfa: ............ Hmm, it's much harder than I thought. Phoenix: ...What did you think it's made of? Tomb Crime Photo Rayfa: ...! ............ Phoenix: Um, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: .........Father. Phoenix: Whoops, s-sorry! Didn't mean to hurt you like that. Rayfa: Hmph! Do not underestimate me! I am the royal priestess, and as such I will experience my father's death tomorrow. So hand it over! A photo of a corpse... will not... phase... Phoenix: Your Benevolence! Edgeworth: Wright, you fool! Put that picture away! Rayfa: ...Nngh. There is no need to worry. I simply lost my footing, that's all. Phoenix: (Now I'm REALLY worried about tomorrow.) Painkiller Shots Rayfa: My father's back used to cause him considerable pain. I would give him massages from time to time. He seemed to truly enjoy them. Phoenix: Hmm, I didn't peg you as the dutiful daughter type. Rayfa: But never again... will I... Phoenix: Your Benevolence... Um... I could stand in for your father if you'd like-- Rayfa: ............Rrgh! *WHAM* Phoenix: Youch! M-My back! I think you broke something! Rayfa: Hmph. That's what I call the royal treatment. Inga's Notepad Rayfa: These are notes my father took on the characteristics of those around him. I wonder what he wrote about me. Phoenix: Let's see... Pink raiment... Tattoos on face... Ch-Childishly cute?! Rayfa: Huh?! Phoenix: That last one's rather subjective, isn't it... Anything else Phoenix: Your Benevolence, I wanted to ask you about this. Rayfa: Nayna! Nayna! Where are you?! Phoenix: Um, I thought you said she wasn't around... Rayfa: ...Oh, yes, of course......... Well, you're sadly mistaken if you think questioning Nayna will clear things up. Phoenix: (But I'm trying to question you, not Nayna.) After clearing all Talk options and examining shoeprints, hair dye bottle, bust, syringe, and notepad: Phoenix: I'm really beginning to wonder what's inside that safe. Any idea what the combination might be, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: None whatsoever. Phoenix: (It looks like a four-digit combo lock, so maybe it's a date. But it's probably not anything that would be easy to guess.) Well, let's try some dates and see what happens. I wonder what date Inga would use as a combination? Date the DC Act was enacted Phoenix: How about the date the Defense Culpability Act was enacted? Do you know when that was, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: Nayna! Nayna! Edgeworth: Your Benevolence... *whisper, whisper*... Rayfa: Yes, of course... I believe the date would be: June 14! Phoenix: (Really, Edgeworth? Is whispering in the ears of elites the secret to your success?) All right, let's give 0-6-1-4 a try. Nope, that's not it. Time to try something else. Leads back to: \"I wonder what date Inga would use as a combination?\" Parents' anniversary Phoenix: How about your parents' anniversary? Rayfa: Hmm... I have not the faintest idea of when it is. Phoenix: Yeah, I guess you wouldn't, huh. Edgeworth: ...It's December 11. Phoenix: H-How in the world do you know THAT fact, Edgeworth?! Edgeworth: Hmph, I don't. I simply deduced it using elementary school-level logic. Though I doubt you'd grasp how I arrived at my conclusion, so I'll save my breath. Phoenix: (There's no way you didn't use some kind of superpower to come up with that...) Anyway, here goes... 1-2-1-1. ...No good. It won't open. Let's try another number, shall we? Leads back to: \"I wonder what date Inga would use as a combination?\" Rayfa's birthday Leads to: \"When's your birthday, Your Benevolence?\" Phoenix: When's your birthday, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: Hmph, you are wasting your time. It could not possibly be my birthday. Phoenix: Aw, come on. It's worth a shot. Rayfa: ...Fine. It's December 24. Phoenix: Christmas Eve? Well, let's give it a try. 1-2-2-4... Ahhh! ...I-It... It opened! Rayfa: It did?! Phoenix: Yep. And it looks like the bottom safe was a fake. Edgeworth: Something meant to mislead would-be thieves, no doubt. Still, it was rendered quite ineffective by his use of such an easily-guessed combination. Rayfa: Wh-Why, Father...? Why my birthdate...? Examine Open safe Phoenix: Okay, let's see what's in here. Hm? This looks like a letter or something. Let's see... \"Dear Father... I wanted to wish you a happy birthday. You're always so kind, and I love you very much. I hope you live to be a hundred years old! Love, Rayfa.\" ............... Rayfa: I-I wrote this to my father when I was eight years old. F-Father... Why would you hold on to... something so childish and stupid...? Phoenix: .........There are some other papers in here. Hmm... Ah! This... This is the plan for his coup d'état! Rayfa: Wh-What?! Give me that! .........I... I don't understand. Edgeworth: It seems Justice Minister Inga was plotting the assassination of the queen. Rayfa: This... This can't be true. Father would never harm Mother. Phoenix: (Poor Rayfa. This has to come as a terrible shock.) ...What's this? There's a photo in here, too. Hmm... It's of a woman and a baby. I wonder who they are. ...On the far left, there's a law book with the mark of the Defiant Dragons branded on it. Rayfa: .........Wait! Th-Th-That's...! Phoenix: Your Benevolence? Rayfa: ...How... How can this be? *thud* Phoenix: P-Princess Rayfa! Rayfa: ............... Phoenix: (She's looking incredibly pale.) Your Benevolence. Are you all right? Rayfa: .........All right? How can I be all right? Phoenix: Huh? Rayfa: .........All that I have believed... It was all lies. Phoenix: I'm afraid I don't follow. (What the heck's she talking about?) Um... Can I ask who the woman is in this picture? Rayfa: ...H-How should I know?! .........It seems I didn't know ANYTHING that was going on! Phoenix: (...Doesn't look like I'm going to get much more out of her while she's like this.) Woman's Photo added to the Court Record. Rayfa: .........Mother. Phoenix: Huh? Rayfa: I must ask my mother... about the secret she is hiding. Phoenix: Um, what secret...? Rayfa: ...I must go. Goodbye. Phoenix: Wait! ...What was that all about? It's like her mind was off somewhere else. Edgeworth: It appears this photo really upset her. Phoenix: (I wonder who the lady in this picture is.) ???: Stop! Shah'do! Come back here! ???: Ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff! Phoenix: Wait, that sounds like... Ahlbi and Shah'do. Edgeworth: That's odd. Commoners aren't normally allowed in this area. I wonder what's afoot. Any point of interest (after examining open safe) Phoenix: I better not touch anything without Rayfa's permission. Who knows what she might say... or do if she finds out. After examining open safe in Ga'ran Palace - Inga's Private Quarters: May 18Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence Shah'do: Ruff ruff ruff! Edgeworth: Nghoooooooooh! Phoenix: Ahhh! Edgewooooorth! Edgeworth: .........I hope one of you has a good explanation for this. Ahlbi: Ahhhhhh! I'm SO sorry! Phoenix: Hi, Ahlbi... Ahlbi: No, Shah'do! Bad dog! Leave the man's frilly thingamajig alone! Shah'do: Grrrrrrrrr... Edgeworth: If you would kindly detach your dog from my cravat. Ahlbi: R-Right away, sir! Just hold still, and... Edgeworth: And...? Shah'do: Grrrrrr... Ahlbi: Hrrrrrgh! Hrrrrrrrrrrrgh! Edgeworth: Nghoooh! Stop pulling like that! You'll only stretch the fabric! Ahlbi: Come on, Shah'do...! Let go of his... carava-chamacallit! Shah'do: Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! Ahlbi: Hmm... This isn't working. I'll just have to pull harder, then... One, two... Edgeworth: Wait! What are you--?! Ahlbi: THREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! RRRRRRRNNNNNNNNGH! .........Come OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON! Edgeworth: NNNNGHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH! AAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! I NEED AAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRRRRR! *huff... huff... huff...* Were you trying to kill me?! Ahlbi: I'm really sorry, mister. My dog has a habit of attacking frilly things like that. Phoenix: (Maybe for his sake, he should stick to more traditional targets, like cars, or his tail...) Ahlbi: What's worse, he snuck in here again today and stole some weird-looking hat. I don't know what to do anymore. Bad dog! You're a very bad dog! Shah'da: *whine* Phoenix: (Wait a second... I've seen that hat before.) Examine Urns (after clearing \"Ahlbi in the courtyard\" Talk option) Leads to: \"Ahlbi, you wouldn't happen to know how this urn got knocked over, would you?\" Talk The frilly hat Phoenix: Ahlbi, could I see that hat again? Ahlbi: Sure! Phoenix: (Wait... Isn't this... Isn't this Nayna's hat? But I thought she'd disappeared.) Ahlbi: Shah'do swiped it from someone. Phoenix: Um, Ahlbi? How exactly did Shah'do get this? Ahlbi: Allow me to explain! It all started while we were on a walk through the bazaar today. When, suddenly, Datz popped out of a manhole! Datz: Hah! Ahlbi: Whoa! Datz: The fangs of the Defiant Dragons... ...Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaah... ...Datz Are'bal is here! .........Say, you wanna join our cause, kid? Ahlbi: (Misattributed to Datz Are'bal in the original release) Huh? Ahlbi: Naturally, I was super startled by that weirdo's sudden appearance. Warbaa'd: RAWWWWWWRRRRRR! Shah'do: Ruff ruff! Datz: Back! Dog of the Ga'ran regime! Ahlbi: (Misattributed to Datz Are'bal in the original release) Huh? But this is my dog, Shah'do... Datz: Defiant Dragon secret weapon: Dragon Snot Snaps! ACHOOOO! *BANG* Ahlbi: WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOA! Oof! Datz: Har har har har har! Aw man, the look on your face! That was classic! Ahlbi: The sudden bang of the firecracker spooked Shah'do, and he ran off into the crowds. Shah'do: Ruff ruff ruff ruff! Ahlbi: Ahhhhhh! Shah'do, come back here! Datz: Har har har har har! That'll teach ya, Ga'ran's lapdog! Policeman: You there! What do you think you're doing?! Datz: ...Ack! Not good! Ahlbi: That's when a policeman came running over and hauled Datz away. That happened right around 2 PM, if I remember correctly. Phoenix: (...I'm not even going to pretend I know what Datz was trying to do.) Ahlbi: I chased right after Shah'do, and... ...when I finally caught up to him here in the palace courtyard, he had this in his mouth. Edgeworth: 2 PM, hmm? That's about an hour before the minister's death. Phoenix: Nayna supposedly went missing after the murder... ...but this would place her here at the palace at around two. (Changed from [...but this would place her here at the palace at around 2.] in the original release) Ahlbi's Statement added to the Court Record. Ahlbi: Actually! I just remembered I saw something pretty amazing around that time, too! Phoenix: Something amazing? The frilly hat (subsequent times) Phoenix: Ahlbi, could I see that hat again? Ahlbi: Sure! Phoenix: (Wait... Isn't this... Isn't this Nayna's hat? But I thought she'd disappeared.) Ahlbi: Shah'do swiped it from someone. Phoenix: Um, Ahlbi? How exactly did Shah'do get this? Ahlbi: Allow me to explain! It all started while we were on a walk through the bazaar today. When, suddenly, Datz popped out of a manhole! Datz: Hah! Ahlbi: Whoa!

Datz: Back! Dog of the Ga'ran regime! Ahlbi: (Misattributed to Datz Are'bal in the original release) Huh? But this is my dog, Shah'do... Datz: Defiant Dragon secret weapon: Dragon Snot Snaps! ACHOOOO! *BANG* Ahlbi: WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOA! Oof! Datz: Har har har har har! Aw man, the look on your face! That was classic! Ahlbi: The sudden bang of the firecracker spooked Shah'do, and he ran off into the crowds. Shah'do: Ruff ruff ruff ruff! Ahlbi: Ahhhhhh! Shah'do, come back here! Datz: Har har har har har!

(Changed from [...but this would place her here at the palace at around 2.] in the original release) Ahlbi: Actually! I just remembered I saw something pretty amazing around that time, too! Phoenix: Something amazing? Something amazing (appears after \"The frilly hat\") Phoenix: So, Ahlbi, what was it you saw that was so amazing? Ahlbi: I saw Her Eminence Queen Ga'ran channeling a spirit! Phoenix: Is it really that big of a deal to see her channeling someone? Ahlbi: You bet it is! Commoners are never allowed to behold the sacred rite. Phoenix: Oh? Can you tell me more? Ahlbi: Of course! I'm always happy to explain! Um... I believe it was around 2:10 PM today. I got lost on the palace grounds while looking for Shah'do. Ahlbi: Ooh... What is this place? It gives me the creeps. Where could Shah'do have gone? Ahlbi: In my search, I took a peek into a small room and... ...that's when I saw Queen Ga'ran! She was channeling a spirit for a neighboring kingdom's king! I saw her transform right before my eyes! I was so excited, I had to take a picture of it! Phoenix: You... You took a picture? Ahlbi: I know I shouldn't have... ...but I just couldn't help myself! Phoenix: (Between this and the treasure room, Ahlbi's not exactly the picture of self-restraint...) Ahlbi: Her channeling rite ended right after that, so I ran off before anyone could spot me. Phoenix: You could've been arrested again, you know. Ahlbi: ...Yeah, I know... ........................ Anyway, here's a copy of the picture. Just don't tell anyone I was the one who took it. Phoenix: (...I worry about his future sometimes.) Channeling Photo added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Come to think of it... ...how did you and Shah'do get into the royal residence anyway? It's not open to commoners, after all. Ahlbi: Allow me to explain! Something amazing (subsequent times) Phoenix: So, Ahlbi, what was it you saw that was so amazing? Ahlbi: I saw Her Eminence Queen Ga'ran channeling a spirit! Phoenix: Is it really that big of a deal to see her channeling someone? Ahlbi: You bet it is!

Phoenix: You could've been arrested again, you know. Ahlbi: ...Yeah, I know... ........................ Anyway, here's a copy of the picture. Just don't tell anyone I was the one who took it. Phoenix: (...I worry about his future sometimes.) Come to think of it... ...how did you and Shah'do get into the royal residence anyway? It's not open to commoners, after all. Ahlbi: Allow me to explain! Ahlbi in the courtyard (appears after \"Something amazing\") Ahlbi: There's a way to get into the palace from the bazaar. It's a bit of a tight squeeze, though. Shah'do can easily fit, but anyone bigger than me is out of luck. Phoenix: You don't say... Ahlbi: Yeah, part of the palace wall is damaged, and there's a hole I can just make it through. Phoenix: Go on. Ahlbi: Heh heh heh. Betcha didn't know they have some really tasty food here! Phoenix: Oh? Then this isn't your first time in here, huh. ...Trespassing is illegal, you know. Ahlbi: N-No, it's not like that! I didn't mean any harm. It's just... I want to help change this kingdom. Phoenix: What do you mean? Ahlbi: Well, after Ms. Fey's trial, I started thinking. Like maybe... Maybe there was something I could do to help the revolution, too. Phoenix: (...Maya's trial, huh. That tragedy only happened because of how twisted Khura'in's legal system has become.) Nahyuta: How utterly foolish to cast away one's life for such a reason! There must have been other ways to cover up the crime! Tahrust: Yet, had I done so, my wife would rush to my defense. And when the case went to trial... ...she would suffer the same fate as I under the Defense Culpability Act. I could not have lived with myself had she been convicted because of that fiendish man! Rayfa: Th-This... This cannot be... All I have done under the laws of our kingdom... It has all been... Phoenix: (The DC Act led to the false charges against Maya and the high priest's suicide. But that trial also caused the public to start questioning the current state of things. And it seems even Ahlbi has some pretty strong feelings on the matter.) Ahlbi: I knew there had to be something I could do to help! That's when I remembered the hole in the palace wall, and started thinking... ...maybe I could sneak in and take a picture of one of the royals up to no good. I just want to do my part! Edgeworth: The spirit of revolution seems to be catching on, even with one so young. Wright, the momentum is steadily building, and the tipping point is fast approaching. It's just a matter of when. Phoenix: I agree. And the public's perception of the Defiant Dragons seems to be changing, too. But Ahlbi... You can't go trespassing like that. Even if it's for a good cause, it's not right. Ahlbi: Okay. I won't do it again. Phoenix: Ahlbi, is that really all you have to confess? You haven't been up to any other mischief? And when I say \"you,\" I mean Shah'do. Ahlbi: Huh?! Oh, um... I-I... I don't know what you're talking about. Aheh... heh heh heh... Phoenix: (Nice try, Ahlbi, but the proof is literally right in front of us.) Present Attorney's Badge Ahlbi: Oh, that's an attorney's badge from your homeland, right?! I've studied all about it. Allow me to explain! There's a reason why the badge is shaped like a sunflower. You know how sunflowers always turn to face the sun -- the source of their well-being? Well, lawyers are like that -- they will chase after anything that will make them money! Phoenix: Whaaat?! Ahlbi: ...I guess people hate lawyers in your country, too, huh. Phoenix: Umm... Where did you get your information from again? Ahlbi: A proud sermon Chief Prosecutor Payne gave in the middle of the bazaar the other day. Phoenix: Nngh... Lawyers already have a bad enough time here without his lies. Channeling Photo Ahlbi: I know I shouldn't have taken that picture... But it was the first time I'd ever seen a spirit medium at work! I couldn't help myself. Phoenix: (At least he knows what he did was wrong.) Ahlbi: .........100-- no, 400 dahmas per copy sounds about right. Phoenix: Ahlbi... You're not planning to sell this photo to tourists, are you? Ahlbi: ...! Ah-ha ha ha! Come on, Mr. Wright, You don't really think I'd do that, do you? Phoenix: (Now I REALLY fear for his future.) Anything else Phoenix: What do you know about this, Ahlbi? Ahlbi: .........S-Sorry. I don't know anything about that. I'm the worst tour guide ever. Phoenix: N-No, no, it's my fault for randomly whipping it out and asking you about it. Ahlbi: Don't worry. I'll study hard, so I'll be ready to answer all your questions next time! Phoenix: (Argh, now I feel like a jerk.) Phoenix: Ahlbi, you wouldn't happen to know how this urn got knocked over, would you? Ahlbi: Ah! Phoenix: Because Her Benevolence told me something rather interesting. Rayfa: Be careful. Some dingbat dog got in the courtyard and spilled water over there. Phoenix: A dingbat dog? Rayfa: That's right. The yappy mutt spilled a whole urn's worth. Phoenix: The \"dingbat dog\" she mentioned wouldn't happen to be Shah'do, would it? Ahlbi: ...Ooh...! ......... I guess the dog's out of the bag. Sorry I lied. But I was worried I'd get in trouble. I know I shouldn't lie to a lawyer like that. Phoenix: No, it's not good to lie to anyone like that. So let's try to only tell the truth. Okay, Ahlbi? Ahlbi: Oh, Mr. Wright! I almost forgot. I saw a couple of Americans a moment ago. They had really weird haircuts, so I thought they might be friends of yours. Phoenix: ...R-Really, now... Um... Edgeworth: It seems your little friend thinks all us Americans have strange hairstyles. I suppose we have you to thank for that, Wright? Phoenix: ......... So, what exactly did their hair look like? Ahlbi: There was a guy with two crops of hair sticking out of his forehead like antennae. Then there was this lady with a long bunch of hair that looked like a big, orange spider leg. Phoenix: Oh, that sounds like Apollo and Athena. What were they doing? Ahlbi: They were racing through the bazaar... ... with the Ga'ran Royal Guard in hot pursuit! Phoenix: Wait, whaaaaaat?! Edgeworth: Why were they being pursued...? Phoenix: I'm not sure, but I have my suspicions. I just hope they're all right. Ahlbi: S-Sorry for not mentioning it before. It just kind of slipped my mind, heh heh... To be continued May 18Khura'in - Bazaar Apollo: *huff, puff, huff, puff* Those... Those guys... sure are... persistent! Athena: *huff, puff, huff, puff* Yeah. They even wore ME out, and that doesn't happen often. Apollo: Why are they after us, anyway?! Athena: Ah, Apollo! It's the royal guards again! Apollo: Argh! Q-Quick, hide! Royal Guard: Hey! Where'd Horn Head and Spidey Hair gooooooo?!! Athena: ...Spidey Hair? They're not talking about me, are they? Apollo: I-Is that a trick question...? Royal Guard: We know you're hiding somewhere around heeeeeeeeeeere!!! RAWWWRRR! Athena: A-Apollo, that weird-looking bird over there... Did it just...?! Apollo: ...Yeah, it did. It's called a warbaa'd and... You know what? I'll tell you all about it later when we're not being chased by masked men! Royal Guard: Come out, come out, wherever you aaaaare!!! ...Hand over the Founder's Orb, if you know what's good for yooooouuuuuu!!! Apollo: (It figures they're after the orb.) Athena: I don't want to know what they'll do to us if we were captured. If they grill us in those obnoxious, loud voices... ...I'd cave after the first hour and confess to whatever they wanted, truth or no! Royal Guard: Come out now, you foreign deeeeevils!!! This has gone faaaaaar enough!!! You must not keep Her Eminence waiting any looooooonger!!! RAWWWRRR! Apollo: W-We've gotta get out of here! There must be a safe place to hide somewhere! Examine Manhole cover Leads to: \"Look, a manhole.\" Any other point of interest Apollo: Maybe we could hide here. Athena: No way! They'd find us in no time! Royal Guard: Stay where you aaaare!!! Athena: Th-They're closing in on us! Apollo: We've gotta find a place to hide! Talk Any ideas? Athena: Apollo! We shouldn't be standing around talking like this! Who knows what they'll do to us if they catch us! Apollo: You're right. Let's find somewhere safe to hide! Present Anything Athena: Apollo! Do you really HAVE to show that to me right this second?! Apollo: S-Sorry. It's just... something I do now when I'm stuck... Anyway, your shouting isn't helping, either. Royal Guard: That voice! It's Spidey Hair!!! Athena: Eeeeek! ...Hiii-yaaaaaa!!! Royal Guard: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!! Apollo: (Sh-She sent him flying!) Athena: L-Let's find somewhere else to hide before the other guards get here! Apollo: Look, a manhole. ...Ahhh! That's right! Dhurke: Say, son, do you remember my office? Apollo: ...Sure. (I remember that messy, dimly lit room.) Dhurke: The file I've amassed on Amara's assassination is kept there. I think it might help you on this case. Do you remember how to get there? Apollo: Athena! I know where we can hide! Follow me! Athena: Oh?! Where are we going?! Apollo: Hrrrrrrrnngh! Athena: W-Wait. You're not seriously thinking about going down there? It smells like rotten eggs. And are those rats I hear?! Apollo: We've got no choice! I can get us somewhere safe, but this is the only way in. Quick, before it's too late! Athena: Ugh. It's going to take forever to get this stench out of my hair. May 18Former Sahdmadhi Law Offices Apollo: .........Looks like we lost them. That was close. .................. (Dhurke's office... How long has it been since I last set foot in here?) At least we're safe now, but... (Why is Athena all huddled over in the corner like that?) Datz: Ah! Apollo: Datz? Datz: AJ! What the heck are ya doing here? Apollo: Ga'ran's royal guards are after us. Datz: Har har har! Once a rebel, always a rebel. Don't worry. The regime doesn't know about this place, so ya can relax now. Apollo: Good. But since when am I part of the rebellion? I don't recall signing up. ???: Apollo! Apollo: Mr. Wright? What are you doing here? Phoenix: We saw you two go into that manhole. Edgeworth: You narrowly escaped the guards' notice. Phoenix: It was like watching a pair of ostriches burying their heads in the sand. Apollo: (I guess that was a closer shave than I had thought...) Phoenix: Anyway, you're safe and sound now, and that's what really counts. Oh, I also have some evidence for you. Apollo: Thanks, Mr. Wright. Case evidence received from the boss. Edgeworth: So, what is this dubious hovel we've found ourselves in, anyway? Apollo: It's the Defiant Dragons' safe house... also known as the former Sahdmadhi Law Offices. Edgeworth: I see... Well. Though it might just be happenstance... ...here I am -- a chief prosecutor -- hiding out in a rebel base. Apollo: Um, please don't report this place to the local police, Prosecutor Edgeworth... (Might as well take a look around while we're waiting for the heat to die down out there.) Come on, Athena. Stop moping over there and help me check this place out. Athena: *shudder* Please tell me there's a shower here. Apollo: There's a sink in the kitchen. And if you're lucky, maybe even some soap. Athena: .........I'm sorry I even asked. Examine Picture of Ga'ran Apollo: There's a scary-looking knife sticking out of the queen's picture. If anyone saw this, they'd think the Defiant Dragons were a violent group. Datz: Oh, that? That was actually me trying to kill a fly. I threw that knife at it and whiffed, and the thing ended up stuck right between her eyes. Apollo: You mean this wasn't on purpose?! White flowers Apollo: Datz, what's with the altar? Datz: It's where we pay our respects to the victims of the Defense Culpability Act. The DC Act is a heinous law that puts innocent people to death! Apollo: (A law that's supposed to protect the people sends them to their graves instead... Talk about insane.) Ladder Athena: Wait... Don't tell me we have to go back through the manhole to get out of here... Apollo: The only reason this safe house is still safe is because the front door's been boarded up. Athena: Fine, then I'll just have to live here till the revolution begins! Apollo: ...What if I told you rats come out at night? Athena; Then we'll just have to start the revolution before sundown! Apollo: (I bet the revolution never thought it'd get a new ally this way.) Photos Athena: Hm? Who's the kid... Wait a second! That's YOU, Apollo! I'd recognize those horns anywhere! Apollo: Is that really the only way ANYBODY recognizes me?! Athena: Hee hee hee. You were so cute! ...And who's THAT fine-looking young man? Apollo: That's Nahyuta, back when he used to smile. Athena: ...Wow. His smile is absolutely angelic. Datz: Sure brings back memories! That was taken the day we all went out fishing. Athena: What was Prosecutor Sahdmadhi like when he was younger? Datz: He was kinda quiet, but passionate when it came to his convictions. When he finally made prosecutor, he was all fired up to change Khura'in for the better. But now he's nothing more than Ga'ran's lackey! Apollo: (Seems like Datz has a lot to say about Nahyuta. I'll ask him about his thoughts later. Photos (subsequent times) Apollo: These pictures sure bring back memories. Nahyuta is cheerfully smiling in this one. That quiet smile he gives in court now seems almost fake by comparison. Lizards Athena: Eeewww... Is that a newt? Apollo: Come on, Athena. Can't you tell a gecko when you see one? Athena: What's the difference? Apollo: Geckos like to live in houses, while newts prefer to be outside near water. They're totally different creatures. Athena: Well, how do you know this one wasn't caught outside near some water? It could very well be a gecko. Apollo: No, I'm pretty sure it's a newt. Athena: Oh, so then you agree it's a newt, Apollo? Apollo: Ack! (I fell right into her trap!) Phoenix: You're both wrong. It's just a plain old lizard. TV Apollo: I'm surprised to see so many appliances here. There's even a TV. Datz: Speaking of which, we gave the people of Khura'in quite a shock... ...when \"The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm\" was last on TV. Apollo: You mean that show where actors play the parts of Dhurke and Rayfa? You hijacked that in the middle of its broadcast, right? Datz: Yep. All their writers do each week is try to ruin the Defiant Dragons' good name. So we decided to hit 'em where it hurts! Har har har har har har! Apollo: That must've been real shocking, especially for the kids who'd waited all week to see it. I mean, the show's main villain was actually hijacking the very show he's in! Coat Athena: Dhurke's jacket... You should try it on, Apollo. It might actually suit you. Apollo: R-Really? Datz: There's also a spare eye patch here. Why not try that on, too? Athena: ...Pffft. ...*snicker* Hee hee hee! S-Sorry, sorry. Just picturing you in all that... Ha ha ha ha! It's just too funny! Apollo: (Oww... My pride...) Sign Apollo: Sahdmadhi Law Offices... That's the sign Dhurke used to display out front. Hey, Datz. I heard the office used [sic]do quite a bit of business. Datz: That it did. Dhurke was a famous lawyer with countless courtroom victories, after all. He was the Dauntless Dragon who turned trials upside down... ...snatching victory from the jaws of defeat! His fame as a lawyer spread far and wide across Khura'in back in the day. Apollo: ...I hope the day comes when he can proudly display this sign again. Spider Apollo: What's with all the spider webs, Datz? Don't you ever clean the place? Datz: Not the webs! We have what ya call a symbiotic relationship. They catch the bugs that get in here, and I don't clean 'em up! Apollo: You know... that actually makes a lot of sense. Law book Apollo: This is Dhurke's old law book. Athena: Look, there's a mark on the cover. It looks like it was branded with a hot iron. Apollo: Yeah, I think it was done in protest against the Defense Culpability Act. There's an entry on the DC Act right here. See? Athena: Oh, so this is the infamous anti-lawyer law you guys are always talking about... Dhurke's Law Book added to the Court Record. Law book (subsequent times) Apollo: This is Dhurke's old law book. Athena: Look, there's a mark on the cover. It looks like it was branded with a hot iron. Apollo: Yeah, I think it was done in protest against the Defense Culpability Act. There's an entry on the DC Act right here. See? Athena: Oh, so this is the infamous anti-lawyer law you guys are always talking about... File Athena: I wonder what's in this file. Oh, it's full of newspaper clippings. Apollo: It seems to be a collection of documents and information on Amara's assassination. (So this is what Dhurke was talking about.) Athena: We already know most of the stuff here on top. Let's see what else there is. Wow, where did he get all this? Umm... Anything important here...? Hmm, what about this... \"Apollo's roving musician father got caught up in this incident and lost his life.\" ...Whaaat?! Th-This is about your father, Apollo! Apollo: Looks like it. But I was never told much more than what's written here. Athena: Really? How come? Apollo: Dhurke always skated around the subject. Maybe he thought I was still too young. Plus, I always thought of Dhurke as my dad, so I never really brought it up. Athena: ...Oh, I see. Still... I feel kind of sorry for your real dad. Apollo: (My real dad... I was never really interested in learning about him. But after seeing his picture, I can't help but feel a little curious. I wonder if Datz could tell me anything about him.) Amara's Assassination File added to the Court Record. Athena: ...Apollo, this file looks like it might be useful. But there are so many pages, I can't tell what's important. Apollo: We need someone to help organize all of this. (And I think I know just the person to ask.) File (subsequent times) Apollo: This file has a ton of information on Amara's assassination. We should go over the important parts later. Talk Sahdmadhi Law Offices Apollo: So, Datz, you guys are still using this office, I see. Datz: Yep. 'Cept now it's the official HQ of the Defiant Dragons. But as Dhurke said, and I quote... \"We must keep it for the day when Khura'in needs lawyers once more.\" Phoenix: Restoring the legal system to its rightful form through popular uprising... You can tell how much Dhurke believes in his cause. Datz: Oh, and AJ. Dhurke said something else that might interest ya. He said he hopes you'll come back and take over this office someday. Apollo: T-Take over?! Me? Datz: Those were his words. He may've been half joking though. Datz: Dhurke! Guess what I heard from PW! AJ's become a lawyer! Dhurke: ...Yeah, I've been meaning to tell you. Datz: Must've been because of you, Dhurke! Dhurke: I'm not so sure about that. I imagine he's already forgotten about me. Datz: Whaddaya talking about? I bet he can't wait to follow in your footsteps. Dhurke: Hah, ha ha ha. Nothing would make me happier. Maybe one day he'll return to Khura'in and take over this office. ...Heh. It's just a pipe dream, though. Apollo: .........Dhurke really said that? Datz: Dhurke was never a hands-on kinda dad... ...but not a day went by that he wasn't thinking of ya. That much I'm sure of. Athena: Doesn't get more paternal than that. Apollo: (Dhurke... And to think, I really did spend my days trying to forget you. I'm looking forward to a nice, long talk once you're free.) Nahyuta (appears after examining photos) Apollo: Datz, wasn't Nahyuta once part of the Defiant Dragons? Datz: Yep. Yuty was a rising star in the resistance! He vowed to fight for the cause through the legal system. Said he'd become a prosecutor, and give Inga and Ga'ran the smackdown they deserved! Apollo: But now he's... Datz: Yeah... a puppet of the Ga'ran regime. Not only that, but now he's gonna prosecute his own dad. It doesn't add up! Athena: I wonder what happened to him. Datz: Me, too. But if I had to guess... ...I'd say Ga'ran has some serious leverage over him. Apollo: Leverage? Like what? Datz: Wish I knew. But it seems like Dhurke knows. I tried to press him about it, but he wouldn't say. Apollo: (Come to think of it, Dhurke did say...) Apollo: Nahyuta... is suffering...? Dhurke: Yes. He knows the rightful state of Khura'in's legal system... ...but something forces him to bend to Ga'ran's will, and it's tearing him apart. Apollo: (If that's the case... ...I bet Nahyuta doesn't really want to go through with Dhurke's prosecution.) My father (appears after presenting Photo of My Father) Apollo: Do you know what my biological father was like? Datz: Dhurke once told me about him. He was a modern minstrel, walking the world and making music in his travels. Athena: This file also has some information on your real dad. It says he died in the blaze at Queen Amara's residence twenty-three years ago. Datz: That's right. Dhurke had invited him over. Dhurke's the kinda guy who can become fast friends with just about anyone. And it seems your pops was like that, too, AJ. They hit it off at a bar... ...and the next thing ya know, Dhurke's asked him over to play some tunes. Apollo: And then the place went up in flames... Datz: Yeah. Dhurke had just stepped out for a sec when the fire broke out. .........Apollo. You were there, too, but you were still just a baby. Apollo: ...I remember hearing about that when I was little. Datz: Yeah, it was a crying shame. Your pops just happened to take you along that day. So you were there with him when the fire broke out. But Dhurke risked his life to save you! Apollo: (It's like Dhurke's done nothing but save me all my life...) Datz: All your pops's stuff got burned up. Including anything that could've helped us identify him. All we knew about him at first was his stage name, \"Jangly Justice\" or something like that. Dhurke did everything he could just to dig up what little we know now. Apollo: ...Um, what about my mother? Do you know anything about her? Datz: All we know is she was traveling with your pops. But that day, she was off doing something on her own. Apollo: So then, she probably didn't even know my father had been with Dhurke, huh. Athena: But she must've been desperate to find you and your father once you'd gone missing. Datz: No doubt. But the queen's assassination threw the kingdom into chaos. The police were so overwhelmed, they were probably hardly of any help to her. We searched and searched till our legs gave out, too, but we never found her. And with your father's stuff all burned up, we had zero leads -- not even a photo. Apollo: So that's how I became an orphan... Datz: Yeah... Who knows? Maybe your mom read about the details of the fire in the newspaper. And maybe she figured you'd died along with your pops. Athena: Wow, I had no idea you'd been through all that, Apollo. Present Photo of My Father Apollo: Datz, I wanted to ask you about this picture. Datz: That's the picture of your pops that Dhurke found. And he had a heck of a time tracking it down. He said he searched all over for it! Apollo: Why...? Why would he go through all that trouble? Athena: Datz, please tell us everything you know about Apollo's dad! Dhurke's Law Book Datz: The Mark of the Dragon... That's the symbol of our group, the Defiant Dragons. Apollo: Dhurke has the same mark tattooed on the palm of his hand, right? Datz: Yep. And I've got one, too. Apollo: Really? Where? Datz: On my heart! Apollo: ...Oh, you mean metaphorically. Like you're ready to die at any time for the cause or something like that? Datz: You got that right. Dead or alive, I'll always be a Defiant Dragon! Amara's Assassination File Apollo: Datz, about this file... Can you help me figure out whihc pages are the most relevant? Datz: Yup, sure can. I got the whole thing memorized. See this page? It's definitely worth a look. Athena: Oh, that's right! Prosecutor Sahdmadhi was part of the royal family, wasn't he! Datz: Yep. But he was expelled after that whole thing with Dhurke happened. He must've gone through hell once he entered the legal world though. Apollo: Because of the whole \"the sins of the father are visited upon his children\" thing? Datz: Yep. In the eyes of the people, Dhurke is not only a traitor to his kingdom... ...he's also the terrorist who assassinated the previous queen. So, as his son, Yuty no doubt got the cold shoulder at every turn. Apollo: That must've been really hard on him. Datz: Yeah, the ties between father and son aren't something you could break, even if you tried. No matter where he went, he was probably labeled the son of a criminal. But despite it all, he made a name for himself through blood, sweat, and tears. I mean, just look at him now. He's a star prosecutor working cases around the globe. He's become a hero! The pride and joy of Khura'in! Apollo: (Now that's the Nahyuta I know -- super smart and never willing to give in. He must've studied and fought like his life depended on it to get to where he is today.) Amaras Assassination File updated in the Court Record. Anything else Datz: Ahhhhhh! Apollo: What? Do you know something about this? Datz: Nope. Just felt like shouting is all. Apollo: (He had me going there for a sec...) After clearing all Talk options, examining law book, and presenting Amara's Assassination File: Old Man: So then you believe me? You believe in my son's innocence?! Beh'leeb: Your poor son -- imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit... Let's petition the government for his release and a declaration of innocence! Old Man: Oh, thank you, thank you! I'm forever in your debt! Apollo: Hm? Who's that? Datz: Hey there, Mrs. Inmee. Hard at work, I see. Beh'leeb: Yes, I have my own battle that I must wage. After all, there are many who suffer under the Defense Culpability Act. Rebel: Mrs. Inmee! Please don't forget about our case, too! Beh'leeb: I won't! I will look into it as soon as I am able. Phoenix: Um, Datz? What's Mrs. Inmee doing here? Datz: She's lending an ear to all those suffering under the regime's wrongful accusations. A lady whose husband's been imprisoned, parents whose son's been falsely charged... She's helping all those types of people. Phoenix: So she's trying to help the revolution along... ...in her own special way. Datz: Yep. And thanks to her, more and more folks are coming over to our side! All the people who've been unhappy with the regime have been waiting for just this chance! And they're starting to speak out in support of us! Apollo: (The people are responding... and a grassroots movement is growing... Dhurke's dream of revolution may finally come true.) Athena: What should we do about the Founder's Orb? We'll probably run into the royal guards again the moment we leave this place. Phoenix: Well, we can't stay here forever, so we'll have to think of something. Apollo: ...I've got it. Why don't you hold on to it, Datz? It should be safe here, right? Datz: You can count on me! I'll get it back to you in time for tomorrow's trial at the Hall of Justice. Founder's Orb left with Datz. Athena: What now, Apollo? Apollo: Well, we've got a handle on what happened twenty-three years ago. Maybe we should pay Dhurke a visit. There's something I want to show him. Phoenix: I'll join you. I want to talk to him before tomorrow's trial. Edgeworth: Maybe I should wait here, then. We'll attract undue attention if we go in too large of a group. Bazaar Examine Yak Apollo: It's a yak. They used to serve as a beast of burden here. Athena: They're actually kind of cute up-close. Hello there, big fella! Or are you a girl...? Apollo: Umm, if you stick your face that close to it, it's liable to-- *sluuuuurp* Athena: Eeewwww, gross! .................. Apollo: ...Need some tissues? Athena: I-I could use a handful of wet naps, if you've got 'em... Bird Athena: What's this bird doing here? Apollo: I wouldn't get too close to it if I were you. ???: RAWWWWWWRRRRRR! Athena: Eeeeeeeeek! Apollo: ...Athena, meet the warbaa'd. Its cry resembles a lion's roar to scare off predators. Athena: Wow... that's one gutsy little bird. But I bet it's not really all that tough. Apollo: How about we just leave the bird alone? Cart Apollo: (So many street stalls... And they all have stuff you can't find back home.) Athena: We should spend some time shopping here when this case is over. I'd like to buy Trucy a souvenir or something. Poster Apollo: There's a poster here... \"The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm\"...? Phoenix: It's a special-effects-driven action-here show that's become a huge hit here in Khura'in. Apollo: (Maybe it's a cultural thing, but she totally looks like a villain to me.) Steaming buns Phoenix: Khura'in's national delicacy, magatah'man -- or \"soul buns,\" if that makes it easier. Apparently, they're so delicious, they'll send your soul straight to the Twilight Realm. Apollo: \"Delicious\"? More like \"deadly.\" Phoenix: Actually, in one of the commercials, an old man literally drops dead after taking a bite. And at the very end, there's a warning that goes, \"Enjoy at your own risk.\" Apollo: Like I said: deadly. Manhole cover Apollo: (This is the manhole that leads to Dhurke's office-turned-safe house. It's the only way in or out. And for obvious reasons, there's no doorbell or welcome mat.) Souvenir stands Apollo: (The souvenir stands sure are popular with the tourists. I should check them out later.) Tehm'pul Temple Apollo: Tehm'pul Temple is just up ahead. When I was a kid, I used to race Nahyuta and my friends to the top. Present Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Athena: The victim was the Minister of Justice, the second most powerful person here in Khura'in. In Wright Anything Agency terms... ...I guess that would be you, Apollo. Apollo: Ha ha ha. Thanks, but... ...everyone knows it's Trucy. Athena: ...Yeah, you're probably right. On second thought, she might actually be number one. I mean, even Mr. Wright is no match for her. Apollo: .........Remind me not to forget to buy her a souvenir. Dhurke's Law Book Athena: I can't believe Dhurke's been fighting the good fight for over twenty years. Fighting for the truth and the repeal of the Defense Culpability Act... Apollo: Yeah. And being branded a traitor for it. That's got to be extremely hard on him. Athena: Whatever happens, we can't let them find him guilty! We have to help him achieve his life's dream! Anything else Athena: .........What? Are you just going to show that to me without a word? Apollo: (I guess she doesn't have anything to say about it.) Athena: W-Well?! Are you going to at least say SOMETHING?! Inga's Private Quarters Examine Phoenix: Edgeworth and I already searched this room. Apollo: Oh, okay. (I wonder if anything interesting turned up?) Hair dye bottle Athena: \"Je suis L'Belle! SAMPLE\"... Now THERE'S a brand I know well... Apollo: .........Yeah... Me, too. Athena: Let's see what it says on the back. \"The hair care sensation celebrities have been RAVING about! Guaranteed to make you WANT to proclaim, 'Je suis L'Belle!' to the world! This product is NOT FOR SALE. EVER. Even if you come to really like it, PEASANT.\" Apollo: I REALLY still don't get his sales strategy... Any other point of interest Phoenix: We already investigated that, Apollo. May 18Detention Center - Visitor's Room Dhurke: Hey there, son. Came to see your old man again? Apollo: Hi, Dhurke. Guess they're done questioning you? Dhurke: Yeah... You'd think Nahyuta might've cut his old man a little slack, but no. He really laid into me. Seems they're really keen on recovering the Founder's Orb. When I wouldn't tell them where it was, he confiscated what few possessions I had left. Apollo: (...Wait, Dhurke's not wearing his attorney's badge. They even took THAT from him? *sigh*) Talk Nahyuta Dhurke: He confiscated all my prized jailbreaking tools. Apollo: What did you expect? I mean, no prosecutor in their right mind would let a prisoner keep stuff like that. Athena: Did he take your attorney's badge, too? Dhurke: No. I thought it strange, but... ...just when it looked like he was going to take it from me, he changed his mind. Apollo: I wonder why. Dhurke: Indeed. I find it hard to understand anything he does these days. Your attorney's badge (appears after \"Nahyuta\") Apollo: Your Khura'inese attorney's badge... You've worn it all these years -- even though all the lawyers are gone. Dhurke: Yes, because the Dragon's Eye is the embodiment of my creed. Apollo: (To show the world that \"a dragon never yields,\" huh.) Apollo: Hey, Dhurke? Why do you still wear your badge? You're not a lawyer anymore, right? Dhurke: This badge is my heart and soul, son. I'll never stop trying to realize my dream -- not until my very last breath. Nahyuta: \"A dragon never yields,\" right?! Dhurke: Exactly. ...Nahyuta, Apollo, I vow to restore Khura'in's legal system to its rightful state one day. I want to pass on to you a world where you can live free from the fear of tyranny. Apollo: (He was always saying stuff like that to the two of us. Nahyuta... Is the reason why you didn't take Dhurke's badge... ...because you still remember those talks, too? I really hope that's what it is.) Dhurke: ...Son, would you keep my badge for me? Apollo: Are you sure?! I can't take something so important to you. Dhurke: That's exactly why I want you to hold on to it, Apollo. I'm placing my fate in your hands. Apollo: .........All right. I'll make sure it stays safe. Dhurke's Badge added to the Court Record. Your attorney's badge (subsequent times) Apollo: Your Khura'inese attorney's badge... You've worn it all these years -- even though all the lawyers are gone. Dhurke: Yes, because the Dragon's Eye is the embodiment of my creed. Apollo: (To show the world that \"a dragon never yields,\" huh.) Apollo: Hey, Dhurke? Why do you still wear your badge? You're not a lawyer anymore, right? Dhurke: This badge is my heart and soul, son. I'll never stop trying to realize my dream -- not until my very last breath. Nahyuta: \"A dragon never yields,\" right?! Dhurke: Exactly. ...Nahyuta, Apollo, I vow to restore Khura'in's legal system to its rightful state one day. I want to pass on to you a world where you can live free from the fear of tyranny. Apollo: (He was always saying stuff like that to the two of us. Nahyuta... Is the reason why you didn't take Dhurke's badge... ...because you still remember those talks, too? I really hope that's what it is.) Present Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Dhurke: Inga Karkhuul Khura'in... He was an entirely insufferable, unlikable fellow, but I never thought he'd wind up dead. Apollo: Why didn't you like him? Dhurke: He was the most hawkish one in the Ga'ran regime. He established the secret police to arrest us rebels without due process. Those they managed to capture were immediately executed. My compatriots in the Defiant Dragons came to call him \"The Executioner.\" Apollo: \"The Executioner\"? Pretty ironic, considering how he ended up. Dhurke: He's probably in Hell now, being tormented by those he wrongfully put to death. Pink Butterfly Pendant Apollo: I found this in the tomb. Look familiar? Dhurke: ...Ah! Th-That's... Apollo: Dhurke? Dhurke: Where did you find it? Apollo: Down between the monk statues in the tomb. Is it yours, Dhurke? Dhurke: .........Oh, um, it's... it's something I bought. Apollo: ? (Why's he suddenly acting all awkward?) Dhurke: Hmm... I wonder when I lost it. Let's have it. It's very important to me. Apollo: O-Of course... (I'll just make a note about it for future reference.) Pink Butterfly Pendant returned to Dhurke, but a record of it remains in the Court Record. Dhurke's Law Book Dhurke: Careful with that. Don't go showing it around town. You'll be branded a rebel. Apollo: But I'm not a rebel. Dhurke: Don't be ridiculous. You're a member of the Defiant Dragons simply by being my son. Or did you think that dragon tattoo on your rear end was just for show? Athena: Whaaat?! You have a tattoo on your butt, Apollo?! Let me see! Apollo: Relax, Athena. He's just jerking our chains again. Amara's Assassination File Dhurke: I prepared that myself. Use it well. Apollo: I'm surprised you were able to gather this much information. Dhurke: It wasn't easy. After all, all of the evidence from the assassination was lost in the fire. And the newly-installed Ga'ran regime was in full control of the media. Every lead I tried to follow led to a dead end. Apollo: So then how am I supposed to solve this case? Dhurke: ...You'll figure something out once tomorrow's trial is underway. After all, no one's looked into this assassination since my last trial. Apolo: (I hope I can turn things around enough to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.) Dhurke's Badge Dhurke: Ah, my attorney's badge. You don't see those around here anymore. Apollo: It's not exactly something you can wear publicly, is it? Dhurke: Yeah... And if you did, people would jeer and throw things at you. I've had tomatoes, cabbages -- even eggs thrown at me. Apollo: That sounds awful. But at least they didn't throw rocks. Dhurke: ...True. Plus, if you were good at catching things, you'd have the start of a good meal. Apollo: What?! Dhurke: It's true. An hour's walk can yield all you need for a nice, big hot pot! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (Dhurke... I'm sorry I never knew how bad things were when you were raising us.) Anything else Dhurke: Is that for me, son? Apollo: No, I was just wondering if you knew anything about it. Dhurke: What? You came to visit me and you didn't even bring a present? Apollo: (I'll take that as a \"no.\") After clearing \"Your attorney's badge\" Talk option and presenting Pink Butterfly Pendant: Phoenix: Apollo, remember how Inga said he had \"someone dear to Dhurke\"? Why don't you ask about that? Apollo: Oh, right. I'll give it a try. Talk Someone dear to Dhurke Apollo: What did the minister mean when he said... ...he had someone dear to you in the palm of his hand? Who was he talking about? Dhurke: Hm? Apollo: Nahyuta seemed to know, but he wouldn't tell me anything. Dhurke: W-Well, I've no idea, so... Phoenix: Well, you obediently followed his every word after he said that... ...so it seems to me the minister was in close proximity to someone you really care about. Dhurke: Oh, um... Apollo: Someone you really care about that isn't Nahyuta...? Wait, don't tell me--! Is there a new lady in your life, Dhurke?! Dhurke: Wh-What?! No! Don't be ridiculous, son! Apollo: .................. Dhurke: .................. The love of my life was Amara. But she's gone now and there will never be another. BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: (Ah! My bracelet! Wait, does this mean...? Dhurke... Have you REALLY not met somebody new?) Present Bracelet Dhurke: The love of my life was Amara. But she's gone now and there will never be another. Perceive twitching left forearm on \"But she's gone now\" Apollo: Apollo: ...Dhurke. You can't fool me. You tensed up when you said, \"But she's gone now.\" And you unconsciously moved your arm... ...causing something to press up against your jacket. Dhurke: Ahhhhh! ...H-How did you do that?! Apollo: ...Oh, so that's it! You're hiding a woman's photo up your sleeve. You don't have to keep secrets like that from me, Dhurke. You're an eligible bachelor now. But you'll... introduce her to me at some point, right? Dhurke: I keep telling you, there's no other woman! Apollo: Fine, then let's see it. What are you hiding up your sleeve? Dhurke: ...It's just this. Satisfied? Apollo: Huh? But that's the pendant we found in Amara's Tomb... Dhurke: See? I wasn't trying to hide anything. Apollo: (...Then why did he tense up?) Dhurke, let me take a look at that. Dhurke: Ah! Apollo: .........Hey, what's this button for? *click* Apollo: Whoa! I-It's...! Athena: It's a picture of Dhurke and some lady! And she's really young-looking, too! Mon Dieu! Are you into younger women, Dhurke?! Apollo: Heh heh. Dhurke, you old dog, you. You got yourself a younger lover. Dhurke: Will you stop with this nonsense! This is Amara before she died. If you look closer, you'll see that I was younger, too. Apollo: Hey, you're right. Athena: Aww. That's no fun. Apollo: ...Wait a second. Haven't we seen this woman before? Athena: .........Now that you mention it...! Apollo: Isn't this woman the same as the one in the pendant's photo? Present Woman's Photo Apollo: Leads to: \"The woman in the pendant is also the one in this photo.\" Present anything else Apollo: Athena: Apollo... I don't see how that has anything to do with the woman in the pendant's photo. Dhurke: Have you had your eyes checked lately, son? Apollo: (I'm wrong, not blind! Maybe I should compare the pendant's photo against the evidence again.) Dhurke, I know I've seen the woman in the pendant's photo before. Leads back to: Isn't this woman the same as the one in the pendant's photo? Apollo: The woman in the pendant is also the one in this photo. Dhurke: ! A-Apollo, where did you get this? Apollo: From the safe in Inga's room. Phoenix: ...Apollo. If this is Queen Amara, it had to have been taken at least twenty-three years ago. But that's just not possible. Dhurke: ! Apollo: Yeah, I just noticed the same thing. Here's why this photo couldn't be twenty-three years old! Present law book Apollo: Leads to: \"Take a look at the law book. It has the mark of the Defiant Dragons branded on it.\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Dhurke: I don't see how that proves anything. Apollo: Look closer. Doesn't that part look, you know, kinda modern? Athena: Hmm... I don't know about that. Maybe you just don't know what's considered new and hip these days, Apollo. Apollo: Nngh... Dhurke: This photo is at least twenty-three years old. I don't know how you could say otherwise. Apollo: That's where you're wrong, Dhurke. (There's something in this photo that couldn't have existed back then.) Leads back to: \"Here's why this photo couldn't be twenty-three years old!\" Apollo: Take a look at the law book. It has the mark of the Defiant Dragons branded on it. But that mark didn't exist until after you started your revolutionary activities, Dhurke. So, this photo must've been taken AFTER Ga'ran came into power. ...And that didn't happen until AFTER Amara was assassinated. Dhurke: Gnrk! Apollo: ...So then, how could Amara even be in this photo? ...............Wait a second. That would mean that Amara is... ...still alive? Dhurke: Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh! ............Looks like you found me out, son. Apollo: Wait... So it's actually true?! Leads back to Talk options Perceive wrong area Apollo: Apollo: You seem uneasy, Dhurke. Wait... Don't tell me you're ashamed because she's much younger than you?! Dhurke: D-Don't be ridiculous! I'm just getting tense because of your intrusive questions! Anyone would react the same way! Apollo: (Hmm, I guess that's not it... Still, my bracelet reacted... ...so I know he must be hiding something!) Leads back to Talk options Someone dear to Dhurke (after perceiving) Apollo: Dhurke! What do you mean, Amara's still alive?! I thought she'd been assassinated. Dhurke: .........So did I. But it seems she made it out alive, only to be held captive by the Ga'ran regime. Apollo: Why would they do that? Dhurke: When I fled from the law and went underground twenty-three years ago... ...I heard some shocking news from a Defiant Dragons spy. There were rumors of Queen Amara being sighted in the palace. Apollo: And those rumors turned out to be true? Dhurke: Yes. I snuck into the palace to see for myself. She was confined within the grounds, but otherwise, she was as fit as a fiddle. Phoenix: S-So then, the sarcophagus in the tomb... It's empty? Dhurke: Yes. That entire tomb is one big charade. Ga'ran had it built to stage Amara's death. Athena: So we're not going to be cursed by her vengeful spirit? That's a relief. Dhurke: She was being held under virtual house arrest. So I freed her, and we made a run for it. This photo was taken back then. Apollo: (Look at how they're both grinning from ear to ear.) .........Hm? (There's a fingerprint on the metal part. I guess Dhurke must've left it by accident.) Athena: Ooh, Mr. Sahdmadhi! I wanna hear ALL about how you ran away with Queen Amara! Pink Butterfly Pendant updated in the Court Record. On the run with Amara (appears after \"Someone dear to Dhurke\") Apollo: I'm surprised Amara agreed to run away with you. I mean, Ga'ran must've told her that you tried to kill her. Dhurke: I tried to convince her that I wasn't the one who set the blaze. Apollo: And she believed you? Dhurke: She said, and I quote, \"I shall accompany you so I may ascertain the truth myself.\" Heh, she always was a tough one to read. Athena: I bet she was thrilled you came to her rescue, Mr. Sahdmadhi. To be set free by your beloved... It's like something out of a fairy tale. Dhurke: Yeah, well... There was no \"happily ever after\" once Ga'ran's people caught up with us. They took Amara away to who-knows-where. I snuck back into the palace and searched high and low for her, but to no avail. They probably moved her to some remote mountain prison or the like. Apollo: Dhurke, does Nahyuta know about this? Dhurke: He knows she's his true mother. I told him as much. Apollo: Wait... Is that why Nahyuta is following Ga'ran's orders? Dhurke: .........Most likely. Athena: So then, do you think that deep down, he doesn't really want to prosecute you? Dhurke: Well, he's not one to show his feelings. And lately, I've had no idea what he's thinking. Phoenix: Apollo. We need to grill the queen about Amara when we have the chance. Athena: ...Um. I was wondering about something. The little baby the lady's holding... Is that Prosecutor Sahdmadhi? Apollo: Not necessarily. It could just as well be me. After all, we're only one year apart. Athena: I don't know. I mean, the kid in the picture is too cute to be you. Apollo: (...Let's settle this by asking Dhurke himself.) Something important (appears after \"On the run with Amara\", then presenting Woman's Photo) Apollo: So what's this \"something important\" you have to tell me? Dhurke: ........................ Listen son. Even if you manage to prove me innocent tomorrow... ............... ...I... I don't have long to live. Apollo: Huh? ............... Wh-What are you talking about? Dhurke: What I mean is, I can already hear the Twilight Realm calling my name. There is no escaping death now that it has its sights set on me. Apollo: What?! ............I-Is this another one of your jokes? Dhurke: I wish it was. Apollo: Ha... Ha ha ha. You can't fool me, Dhurke. (Hm? That's strange. Why isn't my bracelet reacting?) Dhurke: ............ Phoenix: ...Are you sick? Dhurke: I-It's something like that. Apollo: So you're not joking? Dhurke: .........I'm afraid not, son. Sorry. Apollo: I-Isn't there a cure? Or at least some sort of treatment? Dhurke: Unfortunately not. Not for what I've got. Apollo: If you need some kind of surgery, I'll work hard until I can pay for it! So... Please...! Dhurke: .........It's too late. There's nothing more to be done now. Apollo: B-But you always say, \"A dragon never yields.\" So why are you giving up now? Dhurke: ...Apollo, I'm sorry. I really am. Apollo: ............I don't understand. Why is this happening, Dhurke? Why? Dhurke: ..................Listen, Apollo. I've got a favor to ask of you. Would you keep quiet about this? I don't want my fellow Dragons to find out. They'd lose all hope if they knew I was dying. Would you do that for me? Apollo: ............Of course. (Why is this happening now? Just when I was finally starting to feel like you really are my... I thought that this time, we'd finally... But now...) ...Damn it... Why...? Athena: Apollo... Dhurke: Listen, son. I don't have much longer to live... ...but I'll never let them execute me. Not before I finish what I need to do. Apollo: ...I know, Dhurke. There's no way I'm going to let them prove you guilty. (Before he goes, I'm going to turn back time by righting the wrongs that have been done. I'm going to restore Dhurke's freedom... ...and return a real smile to Nahyuta's face! I'm going to win this case. I just have to!) Dhurke: ...Son. I have one more... big secret. Apollo: What? There's something else you've been hiding from me? Dhurke: I'm afraid I can't tell you what it is. I'd be betraying a certain someone if I did. Apollo: Huh? What's that supposed to mean? Dhurke: .........Forgive me. You'll just have to find out for yourself. That's the only way. Apollo: I don't understand, Dhurke. Dhurke: ..................... Apollo. In court tomorrow... ...you may find yourself faced with a truth that is difficult to accept. But I know you. And I know you can handle the truth, no matter what it turns out to be. I know that because I believe in you. You're my son, after all! Apollo: ...Dhurke. (What is he talking about? Wait... He's not going to reveal that he actually IS the killer, is he?) Phoenix: Looks like we've run out of things to discuss. Apollo? ...Are you okay? Apollo: ...I'm fine. ???: FREE HIM NOW...!!! RELEASE DHURKE...!!! Apollo: What's going on out there? Dhurke: Sounds like the party's getting started without me. Apollo: Huh? Athena: It's coming from the temple. Let's go, Apollo, and take a look! Something important (subsequent times) Apollo: So what's this \"something important\" you have to tell me? Dhurke: ........................ Listen son. Even if you manage to prove me innocent tomorrow... ............... ...I... I don't have long to live. Apollo: Huh? ............... Wh-What are you talking about?

Present Pink Butterfly Pendant or Woman's Photo (after clearing \"Someone dear to Dhurke\" Talk option) Dhurke: Amara... I hope she's doing well. Apollo: I've been wondering, Dhurke... How could a commoner win the heart of a queen anyway? Dhurke: ...Hm? Wait, don't tell me... Have you fallen for Princess Rayfa, son? Apollo: Wait, what?! Athena: ...Apollo. I had no idea you liked your women so young. Apollo: No! I don't! Phoenix: She's barely in her teens. That's just not right, Apollo. Apollo: Listen to me! I never said anything about her! Dhurke: Aww, it's all right son. In a few more years, the age difference won't matter so much. Apollo: Would you guys just stop already?! Woman's Photo (after clearing \"On the run with Amara\" Talk option) Apollo: Dhurke, about the cute little kid in this photo... Is that me? Dhurke: ...Huh? What are you talking about? Apollo: .................. Athena: See? I told you it was Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. Dhurke: Hm? .........Oh, I see. Well, either way, it's not you, son. Apollo: So then... ...if it's Nahyuta, it was taken when he was about a year old, right? And that would mean... ...you ran away with Amara around twenty-two or twenty-three years ago? (Changed from [...you ran away with Amara around 22 or 23 years ago?] in the original release) Dhurke: Hm? .........You're pretty good with numbers, son! Impressive. Apollo: Huh? (What kind of answer is that?) Woman's Photo updated in the Court Record. Dhurke: .........Before you go, son, there is something else I need to tell you. Something important. Apollo: What is it, Dhurke? I've never seen you act so serious before. After clearing \"Something important\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: May 18Tehm'pul Temple Apollo: Wh-Whoa! What IS all this?! Anime cutscene Datz: Ow-ow-oww! Let go, will ya?! Policeman: W-What are they-- Datz: Huh? Well, look at that! The people are coming to take their courts back! Policeman: Don't hold back, men! Arrest them all! Rebel: Dhurke belongs to the people! Give him back! Rebel: Yeaaaaah! Where are you holding him?! Policeman: Quiet down, you! Child: Th-They have my big sister, too! But she didn't do anything wrong! Policeman: Ouch! YOUCH! Stop pulling my hair! Old Man: Release my son! Release him now...!!! Policeman: Aaaagh! Stop that! No biting! Apollo: This... is really something. Phoenix: And it looks like Datz and Mrs. Inmee are leading the charge. ???: ...You unenlightened fools. Do you honestly think this will change anything? Datz: Yuty! ...Why do you keep serving that witch Ga'ran?! Apollo: Ah! (It's...) Hey, Nahyuta! Nahyuta: ! You again? Apollo: What's going on here? Nahyuta: It would appear that the insurgents are fanning the flames of the rebellion. ...But I never thought it would grow so large. However, they will all be under arrest shortly. Reinforcements are almost here. Apollo: They'll be arrested? Just for protesting? Nahyuta: They are aiding and abetting a criminal by seeking his release. Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran, has ordered they be arrested and judged en masse. Apollo: B-But weren't you once a member of the Defiant Dragons, too? How can you go along with this? Nahyuta: ...I am simply following the orders that Her Eminence has handed down. Apollo: No, it can't be as simple as that. Listen, Nahyuta. There's something I want to talk to you about. Hey! You're not getting away this time! We need to talk. Nahyuta: .........*sigh* I see there is no reasoning with you. Very well, then. Speak. Examine Protesters Athena: Look at all these people! They've got the whole temple surrounded. Phoenix: And it looks like Datz is fanning the flames. The police are going to really have their hands full with this many protesters. Apollo: This whole thing is like a powder keg waiting to go off. We should keep our distance for now. Talk Dhurke Apollo: Nahyuta, do you really have to serve as prosecutor on Dhurke's case? I mean, prosecuting your own flesh and blood... It's just not right. Nahyuta: Again with this drivel? Your ethical standards are not the be-all, end-all of the world around you. Apollo: (I'm not getting into another debate with him.) .........Nahyuta, did you know that Dhurke is sick? Nahyuta: What? Apollo: He apparently doesn't have that much longer to live. If found guilty, he probably wouldn't even make it until his execution day. Nahyuta: What are you talking about? Apollo: Knowing this, are you still prepared to send an already dying man to his grave? Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: Well? Nahyuta: ...I... Apollo: Enough with the zen monk act, Nahyuta. Tell me how you really feel. Nahyuta: .........Mr. Justice. Each person is born with a role to fulfill. And I... must fulfill mine. Apollo; Well, I'm not convinced that taking Dhurke to trial is a part of your lot in life. Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: As for why you've been at Ga'ran's every beck and call... ...I think I might have the answer. Amara (appears after \"Dhurke\") Leads to: \"Nahyuta. You know the truth about your mother, don't you?\" Present Dhurke's Law Book Nahyuta: That's... Apollo: The rebels' \"Mark of the Dragon.\" It symbolizes a person's opposition to the Defense Culpability Act. Nahyuta: You seek to argue with me about the legal system? ...If so, you're wasting your breath. Lawyers and prosecutors do not lay down the law; they merely follow it. The laws decreed by our sovereign are absolute. There is no room for debate. Apollo: So \"let it go, and move on,\" right? Why is that your only answer to everything? Apollo: Nahyuta. You know the truth about your mother, don't you? About how the former queen is still alive and being held somewhere. Nahyuta: So Dhurke told you, did he... Yes, it's true. My mother was spirited away to some remote corner of this kingdom... ...to keep her safe from harm. Apollo: Safe from harm? But Dhurke said the Ga'ran regime is holding her captive. Nahyuta: No, they are keeping her safe. Apollo: So you don't know where Amara is being held? Nahyuta: I only know that it is some secluded hideaway where visitors are not allowed. I have heard she leads a simple life, akin to that of monastic disciples. Apollo: (Sure sounds like she's being held captive to me.) Listen, Nahyuta... Aren't you really doing the queen's bidding... ...because she's holding Amara captive? Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: And this whole thing with Dhurke... You know he didn't really kill Inga, don't you? Nahyuta: .................. Apollo: Dhurke doesn't have much longer to live, so I want to help him however I can. This time, it's our turn... Apollo: *sniffle* *hiccup* *hiccup* Nahyuta: You... You could've been killed... But you risked your life... to save us... Why...? Dhurke: What a silly question. What father wouldn't risk his life to save his own children? Nahyuta, Apollo... Don't you ever hesitate to call when you need me. Understand? Apollo: It's our turn to help Dhurke however we can. Nahyuta: .................. .................. .........What you speak of... is futile. Apollo: ! Nahyuta: .........Let it go, and move on. The guilty verdict... The hopelessness... You must resign yourself to it all. Clinging to false hope now will only serve to magnify your future despair. So let it go... and move on... Apollo: ...Nahyuta. (Are you really going to just roll over on this?) Nahyuta: ...I've no more time for idle chatter. I must prepare for tomorrow's trial. Now, if you'll excuse me... Apollo: ......... Athena: Apollo. I sensed a whirlpool of emotions coming from within Prosecutor Sahdmadhi just now. Anger, shock, bewilderment... ...and an icy sorrow, as deep and dark as an abyss. Apollo: Yeah, I picked up on that, too. Looks like Dhurke really won't be the only one who will need my help tomorrow. Phoenix: ...I think it's about time to pay Queen Ga'ran another visit... ...and ask her about her sister Amara. Talk Any ideas? Athena: I didn't know Dhurke was sick. What's wrong with him? I mean, he looked fine to me. Apollo: ...I really don't know. The Dhurke I remember would go out hunting in the middle of winter... ...while everyone around him was dropping like flies with the flu and whatnot. Athena: ............... Apollo: .................. Phoenix: ........................ Apollo: .........Come on everyone, cheer up! The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles, right? Phoenix: ...Apollo, you don't have to put on a brave face for-- Apollo: No! I'm fine! Besides, Dhurke will have his day in court. I won't let this get me down. What to do Athena: So you don't know Queen Amara at all, Apollo? I thought that since you used to live with Dhurke, that maybe you had met her. Apollo: Dhurke escaped with Amara twenty-three or so years ago, so I was still just an infant. Even if I had met her, I wouldn't have remembered it. Athena: I guess not. But that means you may have been cared for by a queen. And if you had been, then... Apollo: Th-Then what? Athena: You would've turned out... I don't know... better? Apollo: Wh-What's that supposed to mean? May 18Ga'ran Palace - Audience Chamber Phoenix: Hm? The royal guard isn't around. ???: That is utter... utter... hooey! You cannot continue to deceive the people like that! ???: ...Rayfa. Justice is much more than simply speaking the truth. Apollo: Is that Princess Rayfa and Queen Ga'ran over there? Rayfa: Y-You deceived me, too, Mother! How can I ever believe a word you say again?! You... You... nincompoop! .........Ah. Phoenix: Your Benevolence... ...I, uh, couldn't help but overhear... Rayfa: Nnnnnnnnnnnngh... You impudent--!! *ka-tonk!* Phoenix: Oww!!! Apollo: Are you okay, Mr. Wright? I can't believe she actually punched you... Phoenix: ...Yeah, I'm used to it by now. Athena: What's the matter with the princess? Apollo: It sounded like she was arguing with her mother. Phoenix: .........Maybe it has something to do with this picture. Rayfa said she had to ask her mother about some secret or another as soon as she saw it. Apollo: So then... ...does that mean that Princess Rayfa knows what really happened? That Amara wasn't assassinated, and is still very much alive? Phoenix: It would seem so. And she doesn't seem to be taking Ga'ran's lies very well. But that's no surprise, considering how much Rayfa reveres her mother. Athena: That would definitely cause her a great deal of anguish and sadness. ???: Eavesdropping, are we? How very rude. Ga'ran: Hm? You there. Are you not Dhurke's son? Apollo: Oh, um, nice to meet you, Your Eminence. We're actually here to speak with you, if you could spare a moment. Examine Throne Apollo: ............ Phoenix: Apollo? What are you doing? This is the queen's audience chamber. You can't snoop around in here. Apollo: Oh, right. Sorry! (I wonder what it'd be like to sit there with Athena and Mr. Wright groveling at my feet... No! Stop! I can't let myself think about that sort of thing!) Talk Amara's alive? Apollo: Your Eminence, Dhurke told me about Amara. About how she's still alive, that is. Ga'ran: ...We know not of what you speak. Apollo: After Dhurke learned Amara was still alive, he rescued her, and they ran off together. But she was captured and remains captive in a secret location to this day. As for Nahyuta doing your bidding, it's only because Amara's life's in your hands. Ga'ran: Ho ho ho. What an active imagination you have. Royal Guard: Ha ha ha ha ha ha! A lawyer AND a comedian! How droll! Apollo: (Wh-Whoa. Where'd THEY come from? Anyway! If she's going to play dumb, I'll just have to jog her memory with some evidence!) Amara's alive? (subsequent times) Apollo: Your Eminence, Dhurke told me about Amara. About how she's still alive, that is. Ga'ran: ...We know not of what you speak. Apollo: After Dhurke learned Amara was still alive, he rescued her, and they ran off together. But she was captured and remains captive in a secret location to this day. As for Nahyuta doing your bidding, it's only because Amara's life's in your hands. Ga'ran: Ho ho ho. What an active imagination you have. Royal Guard: Ha ha ha ha ha ha! A lawyer AND a comedian! How droll! Apollo: (Argh! If she's going to play dumb, I'll just have to jog her memory with some evidence!) Amara's alive! (appears after \"Amara's alive?\", then presenting Woman's Photo) Apollo: So then, you admit that Amara's still alive? Ga'ran: .........Yes. She is under our protection in a safe location. Apollo: (I think you mean \"being held prisoner.\") ...And where is she being kept? Ga'ran: Ho ho ho. Now why would we tell the son of a traitor that? Apollo: (Guess she has a point there.) Ga'ran: Now, heed our warning, Horned Devil. It would not be wise to inform the people that Amara yet lives. It would only serve to plunge public order into chaos. Apollo: I have no intention of doing that. (Besides, there are real terrorists out there who might try to kill her.) Ga'ran: ...Good. Now, there was something we have been meaning to ask you. Do you know what has become of the Founder's Orb? The Founder's Orb (appears after \"Amara's alive!\") Leads to: \"The Founder's Orb went missing after Dhurke took it into the tomb.\" Present Attorney's Badge Ga'ran: What have we here? Apollo: It's the attorney's badge used by lawyers like me back home. Ga'ran: Well, in this country, lawyers are a loathsome breed. And we would advise you not to needlessly advertise your place among their ranks. For even now, the bad karma Dhurke has engendered brings woe to your kind. It is a simple matter of cause and effect. Apollo: (Yeah, an effect you caused by enacting the Defense Culpability Act.) Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Ga'ran: His own ill will was visited upon him. So it is within the cycle of karma. Others might call it divine retribution -- the punishment of the gods. Apollo: You don't seem particularly sad, even though it was your own husband. Ga'ran: We were betrayed by the man we had called husband. Moreover, we are the Grand Priestess, summoner of spirits from the Twilight Realm. For us, death is not the end, for we can still speak with those who have passed. Apollo: (I guess being a spirit-channeling queen gives you a different take on life and death.) Woman's Photo (after clearing \"Amara's alive?\" Talk option) Apollo: Your Eminence, I ask that you take a look at this photo. Ga'ran: Why, that's--! Apollo: It's a photo of Amara. And here you can see a law book bearing the mark of the Defiant Dragons. I believe you know what that means. Ga'ran: .................. ..........Very well. Royal guard, stand down. Royal Guard: Yes, Your Eminence! Your wish is our command! Ga'ran: It seems there is no need to perpetuate this charade any longer. We shall speak... of all we know. Dhurke's Law Book Ga'ran: To burn such a mark upon a sacred text of the law... He will surely be visited by what he has wrought. And to think he once called himself a man of the law. Apollo: I think it's just his way of objecting to the DC Act. Ga'ran: Yet that act is but an objection to his falsified evidence. How appalling that even now he recognizes no responsibility and knows no shame. Anything else Apollo: So, I was wondering if... Ga'ran: We have no intention of bestowing any information upon you or any other lawyer. Apollo: (Guess someone doesn't like to play nice with others.) Ga'ran: The Founder's Orb went missing after Dhurke took it into the tomb. As his son, we thought you might know something of its current whereabouts. Apollo: I knew it. I suppose I should thank you for that free running tour of Khura'in. Ga'ran: ...That was the royal guards' own doing. Apollo: (Nice try, lady. But now you're definitely not getting the orb, ever.) Why do you want the orb so badly, anyway? Ga'ran: Because... it would be most dangerous in the wrong hands. It must be recovered. Phoenix: Is the legend true? Can the orb really impart spiritual power? Are you worried that someone could overthrow you with it? Ga'ran: The Holy Mother's power is without equal. Should Her Holiness once again return to our world... ...she could conceivably bestow great power upon the one who unlocked the orb's secret. Phoenix: I guess it makes sense, considering spirit channeling is a fact of life here. Ga'ran: ...So we ask you, Horned Devil. Did you receive the Founder's Orb from Dhurke? Apollo: ...Does it look like I did? Ga'ran: ...So you like to play games, do you? ...Royal guard! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Eminence! Ga'ran: Search this devil, and his belongings! Apollo: What? Royal Guard: At once, Your Eminence! Don't move!!! You're only making this haaaaaarder on yourseeelf!!! Apollo: Yikes! Hey, cut it out! Argh! What the--?! Athena: Eeeeeek! Apollo! Don't strip here! Royal Guard: Stop resisting!!! Just submit to our strip search alreeeeeady!!! Apollo: N-No, wait! Hey! Cut it out! Aaaaaaaaaaaaagh! .................. (Rest in pieces, my poor, tattered dignity.) Royal Guard: There's no sign of the Founder's Orb, Your Eminence! Ga'ran: .........So, you have hidden it somewhere. Heh. No matter. We shall recover it one way or another once you are found guilty of abetting the accused. Apollo: (Dhurke was right. She really is bent on getting the orb.) ???: Mother! Apollo: Looks like the princess is back. Rayfa: I took a stroll to try to calm myself, but... I still find this situation unacceptable. The people must be informed about Queen Amara! Apollo: ! (So she DOES know about that!) Ga'ran: Rayfa, you do not yet possess a clear grasp of how a government and its people interact. There will always be secrets that must be kept from the ignorant masses. Rayfa: You have little faith in our people, Mother. But it is the Royal Priestess's duty to always speak the truth. And as such I cannot remain silent! I will not! Ga'ran: Hah. The truth, you say? Your mind has been poisoned by the Barbed One. Phoenix: It was an honor and a pleasure, Your Eminence. Ga'ran: ...We must speak with our child. It is a mother's duty to discipline her child, after all. Now, if you would excuse us. Apollo: (Discipline? Coming from her, I don't like the sound of that at all...) Phoenix: Well, Apollo, let's head back to the safe house for now. Apollo: Good idea. We need to go over what we've found and collect our thoughts. May 18Former Sahdmadhi Law Offices Edgeworth: ...Ah, you're back. Athena: Thank you for holding down the fort, Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth. Sorry it took so long. Hope you weren't too bored. Edgeworth: ...I watched \"The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm\" while you were gone. And my verdict is... it's an outrage! Especially its theme song. Even worse, the people here believe it's an original, Khura'inese show. Can you believe it! I've already spoke about it at length with Mr. Are'bal here, and he... Apollo: (I'm not sure what he's babbling about, but at least it seems he wasn't bored.) Phoenix: Moving along to things that actually matter... We've gathered about all the information and evidence we can concerning this case. I think it's time we go over everything we've learned so far. Examine Any point of interest Phoenix: ...Apollo. We probably shouldn't search the place while Datz is gone. Besides, we need to go over the case for tomorrow. Athena: What's with you recently? It's like you want to spend every free minute we have snooping. Apollo: (But don't you get the urge to look at everything you can sometimes, too?) Talk About Inga's murder Phoenix: The orb trial... Maya's abduction... And the murder of the mastermind behind it all, Justice Minister Inga... It's a lot to consider. Think you have all the facts straight in your head? Apollo: Yep, I've got it covered, Mr. Wright. It's the truth about what really went down that's going to be the problem. Athena: Yeah, it's like the more we learn about this case, the less we understand. Phoenix: I agree. There's a deep darkness enveloping this case. I'm almost afraid of what we will find once we lift that black veil. Suffice to say, the real killer is certainly waiting underneath. Apollo: (The real killer, huh... Now that's the million dollar question.) Phoenix: Who killed Inga, and why? Think, Apollo. Who would you say had a motive to commit this crime? Apollo: Umm... Athena: I, for one, am drawing a complete blank. Phoenix: I want to know how the killer slipped into the tomb, killed Inga, and slipped back out... ...without ever being seen. That's a bona fide locked-room mystery right there. Apollo: Well, we've collected plenty of evidence and statements. I just hope the rest comes out in court. It'll be a thinner tightrope than usual, that's for sure. Amara's assassination Phoenix: This case has one big fly in the ointment. In order to prove Dhurke completely innocent... ...we'll also have to exonerate him of the crime committed twenty-three years ago. Apollo: Amara's supposed assassination... Athena: Right. We know Amara's still alive... ...but Dhurke could still be charged with plotting to kill her. Apollo: He couldn't discover the truth -- even after over two decades of investigating. So our biggest hurdle is going to be the complete lack of evidence. The fire made sure of that. Athena: Mr. Wright, have you ever won a case without any evidence? Phoenix: No, that's one thing I've never done before. Apollo: A trial unprecedented even in the decorated annals of the Wright Anything Agency... (Still, I can't help but wonder... Was there really no evidence left behind?) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: You flash that badge like a pro now. And with such confidence, too. I can really feel it. Apollo: R-Really? Phoenix: ...Sure. Take Trucy's case, or that civil trial yesterday. You really came into your own during both of them. Apollo: Eheh... Heh heh heh. (I can feel my cheeks betraying me...) Athena: You'd better not be thinking of starting your own firm, Apollo. Apollo: What? No, of course not. (I'm probably not ready for that, anyway.) Pink Butterfly Pendant, Woman's Photo, or Amara's Assassination File Phoenix: Amara... She's still alive. Apollo: But she's basically being held prisoner somewhere. Phoenix: This puts Dhurke at a distinct disadvantage. ...Not to mention us, too. Apollo: And Nahyuta is under Ga'ran's thumb because of all this as well. Phoenix: Yep. It's a problem all right, and it's not like we can just go and rescue Amara. There must be something we can do... Athena: We'll just have to pin our hopes on Dhurke's revolution! Apollo: So, basically, the fates of Amara and Nahyuta... ...depend entirely on our ability to beat the charges against Dhruke tomorrow. Dhurke's Law Book or Dhurke's Badge Phoenix: What would you do if the Defense Culpability Act was established back home? Apollo: What would I do? That's a good question. Athena: What are you worried about, Apollo? You'd always have a job as Trucy's assistant. Apollo: Uh-huh... And what about you, Athena? Couldn't you become a therapist? Athena: Hmm... I don't know if I could do it for a living... Phoenix: I'd probably go back to playing piano. Apollo: ..................... Athena: ............... Phoenix: Hey! What are those looks for?! Anything else Phoenix: Just because you don't know something, doesn't mean that I do, Apollo. That's an important lesson for you to learn. Apollo: (In other words, this didn't ring any bells.) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ...Oh, and we can't forget about the Defense Culpability Act. \"...those who would support criminals will be deemed just as guilty.\" In short, if Dhurke is found guilty, and is sentenced to death... ...we'll likely join him in a very public execution. Apollo: Y-Yeah... Athena: Beat the charges or die... What kind of crazy, upside-down legal system is this, anyway?! Phoenix: ...Don't worry. I can't ask someone as young as you to risk your life, Athena. So tomorrow, it'll just be me and Apollo on the courtroom floor. But you can support us by watching from the gallery. Athena: What?! No... I wanna help! I'm part of the agency, too, after all! Phoenix: ...Sorry, but this is a direct order from your boss. Plus, there's Prosecutor Blackquill to think of. He said he'd use me for sword practice if I put you in harm's way. Athena: Nrrgh... Simon... Well, at least promise me this, you two. Promise me you'll make it back alive! Apollo: Ha... Ha ha... Make it back alive... huh... Phoenix: What's with that face, Apollo? You'll never inspire confidence in your client like that. And it'll play right into the prosecution's hands. Remember, \"the worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles.\" Apollo: You're right! Even when it seems hopeless, or when there's not a shred of evidence to be found... ... we can never let it show on our faces... right? (But will I actually be able to do that tomorrow? When push comes to shove, will I be able to force my biggest smile?)

There is no escaping death now that it has its sights set on me....Dhurke knew everything. ...But he couldn't bring himself to tell me.Dhurke: I have one more... big secret. I'm afraid I can't tell you what it is. I'd be betraying a certain someone if I did....He couldn't accuse the love of his life. .........The sad truth is... ...the other victim channeled by Amara was...Nahyuta: Wha--?! You can't--!Phoenix: Th-That's not possible!Apollo: The defendant, Dhurke Sahdmadhi... ...is the one Queen Amara channeled. He's the other victim!Nahyuta: Th-This is insanity!Judge: P-Pohlkunkaaaaaa!Phoenix: A-Apollo! Wh-What are you--?! Do you realize what you're proposing?!Nahyuta:Nahyuta: I demand an explanation, Mr. Justice!Apollo: .........I don't know when or why Dhurke was murdered. But the facts and evidence speak for themselves. .........And this... This is where they've led me.Phoenix: ...I see. After Inga's murder, Dhurke and Maya were the only ones in the tomb. But if one of them was actually dead and being channeled by Amara... But it can't be... can it?Apollo: Dhurke's bloodstain at the scene of the crime was the clincher for me. He wasn't even injured, so how could he have possibly bled that much? The only logical explanation is... ...Dhurke had also been murdered!Nahyuta:Nahyuta: Th-That's enough. Your explanation cannot be the truth! A-And you would not dare to claim to have proof to support your assertion.Apollo: ...............Nahyuta. I wish it weren't true... I wish with all my heart that I'm wrong! But as much as I don't want to believe it... y-yes... I can prove it... (Dhurke's killer must've hidden his body. It would have to be somewhere nobody would ever look. And there is only one such place...)Nahyuta: Y-You truly... have proof?Apollo: The fastest way... would be to actually have someone go check the tomb.Judge: Go check the tomb...? But why?Apollo: Because I believe Dhurke's killer hid his body here.Present Sarcophagus Apollo: Leads to: \"Y-You would suggest...?!\"Present anywhere else Apollo: Nahyuta: How could anyone hide a body there? Apollo: W-Well, uh... Nahyuta: You see? I knew you were mistaken about Dhurke's death. Apollo: (Come on, Justice! Pull yourself together! There's only one sure hiding spot for a body in that tomb!) I was mistaken once, but I won't make the same mistake again. Leads back to: \"Because I believe Dhurke's killer hid his body here.\"Nahyuta: Y-You would suggest...?!Apollo: Queen Amara's sarcophagus... The only place in the tomb that no one would dare to look. Plus, a killer would soon become trapped by hiding in there. But a body... well, that's a horse of a different color. Wh-Which means... .........Urngh!Judge: ...I-I believe we must search the sarcophagus at once! Your Eminence. Being that Queen Amara yet lives, I trust we may now open it?Ga'ran: .........If we must.Nahyuta: Your Magistry, I believe Detective Skye is still there at the tomb. Let us contact her at once, and have her conduct a full investigation into the matter.Amara: ..................Judge: ...Now then, Detective Skye. Your report, if you please.Ema: .........I'll start with my findings.Apollo: ............... (Please, please...! Please let me be wrong about this! I just want things to be as they were.)Ema: .................. ............ A search of the sarcophagus... ...revealed a body that appears to be several days old.Apollo: ! A b-body...?! D-Detective Skye... Tell me it wasn't Dhurke. Tell me my whole theory was completely off-base.Ema: .................. I have a photo of the body. A-And I have positively identified it as... ...Dhurke Sahdmadhi.Apollo: .........Dhurke! N...NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! ..................... (Why...? Why'd this have to happen?! Damn it, Dhurke! Answer me...!) ........................Nahyuta: How.. can this be...?.........Heh heh heh.Ga'ran: The traitorous snake -- the very head of the insurgency -- murdered? Oh, what a joyous day! Those fools shouting for change and revolution... ...will finally return to whatever rocks they crawled out from under. Heh heh heh. Ha ha ha ha! Ahhh ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!Nahyuta: .........Gnkh.........Nnngh!Apollo: ......... (Wh-Who... What... ...was I even fighting for?)Phoenix: Apollo...Apollo: (What am I... supposed to do now?) ................................. ................................. ................................. (I... I...)...Son. A lawyer...Dhurke: ...should never look the way you do right now. .........A dragon never yields. Even when wounded, a dragon bites down hard, and never lets go till its dying breath. It glares, it roars, and it latches its jaws firmly onto its prey till the bitter end. That's what lawyers do to get to the truth!But... Dhurke... What if the truth is that you're...Dhurke: Apollo. In court tomorrow... ...you may find yourself faced with a truth that is difficult to accept. But I know you. And I know you can handle the truth, no matter what it turns out to be. I know that because I believe in you. You're my son, after all!You... You believed in me that much, Dhurke? .............................. ........................ Dhurke. I think I finally understand.Apollo: (I can't yield -- not now, not ever. Not after Dhurke believed in me, despite knowing what was about to happen. Besides... Dhurke left me with two things I must do!)Phoenix: Are you... all right, Apollo?Apollo: ...Sorry about that, Mr. Wright. But I'm... I'm fine now!Nahyuta: ...A...pol...lo......?Apollo: Detective Skye!Ema: Y-Yes?!Apollo: How sure are you that the body's been there for a few days?Ema: I'm positive. No autopsy's been performed yet, but I'd say it's been at least three days. Fortunately, the low temperature inside the sarcophagus kept it from decaying... Oh, and the chest area bore three gunshot wounds from a small caliber weapon. I believe they are the cause of death.Dhurke's Corpse Photo added to the Court Record.Phoenix: At least three days, huh...Apollo: That means Dhurke was already dead by the time he came to visit me back in the States.Nahyuta: Th-Then who was channeling him?Apollo: I think it would have to be... ...someone who could get into and stay in the U.S. without arousing suspicion... ...yet also had a solid cover story so they wouldn't be seen as \"missing.\" I believe this is who was channeling Dhurke when I saw him in the States.Present Maya Fey profile Apollo: Leads to: \"Maya...? ...Oh, I see.\"Present anyone else Apollo: Nahyuta: This is who was channeling him? Phoenix: I... don't think so, Apollo. Apollo: ...You sure? Hmm... I guess it IS a bit of a stretch. Judge: ...That's the understatement of the year! Apollo: (That's going to leave a mark. There are only a few spirit mediums. So the answer should be pretty obvious.) Judge: The defense will offer an answer within the realm of possibility this time. Apollo: Yes, Your Magistry. Leads back to: \"I believe this is who was channeling Dhurke when I saw him in the States.\"Phoenix: Maya...? ...Oh, I see. She was being held hostage at the time... ...so it seemed only natural that she wasn't around.Apollo: Right. And do you remember what she said earlier?Apollo: ...So please, just tell me. What exactly are you hiding?Maya: Sorry, but... I promised Dhurke I wouldn't say.Apollo: You made a promise... to Dhurke?Maya: Mm-hm. A pretty big one...Apollo: Dhurke didn't want his own death to be known. The other members of the Defiant Dragons would lose all hope if they found out. And that would snuff out the flames of revolution for good. Ms. Fey. Dhurke told you to keep quiet about this, didn't he?Maya: ! .........I guess it's no use hiding it anymore. Yes, I promised not to tell. Dhurke made me promise before he died...Apollo: So, I was right, then.Maya: Um, Apollo? ...There's... something I need to tell you. It's about... you know... Dhurke's final moments.Apollo: ..................... ...I'm listening, Ms. Fey. What happened in his final moments?Maya: It was soon after I was kidnapped. Dhurke paid me a visit in that tomb where I was being held captive. I'd say it was a few days before Minister Inga's murder.???: Hey, young lady. Time to get you up and out of here.Maya: O-Ooooooh... *gasp!* (It's that revolutionary guy...!)Dhurke: I'm here to rescue you.Maya: Y-You are? Why?Dhurke: I figured things were a little too quiet with that stamp-sucking scumbag... ...so I started digging around. That's when I found out you'd been abducted.Maya: (But why would a rebel help me?)Dhurke: Let's go before it's too late.???: It already is for you, pal.Inga: Heh heh heh... Long time no see, ya rebel blowhard.Dhurke: Inga... I know you're up to something, and I'm going to find out what. Aagh! ..................... .....................Rrrngh!Inga: Heh heh heh. That's gotta smart. You've become a real thorn in my side, see? So it's time for you to be pushing up daisies!Dhurke: Agh... Gah.........Maya: Dhurke!Dhurke: .................. Heh. Did you really think a peashooter like that... ...could kill a dragon?!Inga: What the--?! Ahhh............... W-W-Whaddaya, some kinda freak?! N-Nuts to this!Maya: Dhurke was shot several times, but he barely even flinched. He sacrificed himself for me.Dhurke: ............Hrgh.Maya: Arngh! These ropes! Urrrrrgh! I've... I've got to help you!Dhurke: Relax. It's going to be okay. ...Sorry things turned out this way... but it doesn't look like I have much longer.Maya: No! Don't say that!Dhurke: Y-You're a spirit medium, aren't you? Wh-When I'm gone, I want you to channel my spirit.Maya: S-Stop it! Don't give up like that!Dhurke: If you do, untying a rope like that'll be child's play.Maya: No... *sniffle* Please, hang in there. You can still make it...Dhurke: P...Promise... Promise me... o-one thing, young lady. I-It's about... my son.Maya: Dhurke... was talking about you, Apollo. He said he wanted to see you... one last time. So he asked me to return to the U.S. and channel his spirit.Apollo: ...He really said that?Maya: Mm-hm. He also said he'd been meaning to visit you for years, but kept putting it off. And that this was his last chance.Apollo: .........Apollo: You just show up here without warning after all this time... What gives?Dhurke: I came all this way to see you, son! Come, rejoice!Apollo: Riiight... Why don't you tell me the real reason you're here.Apollo: (Dhurke... You really did come to the U.S. because you wanted to see me.)Phoenix: .........I guess this means... ...it was Inga that hid Dhurke's body in the sarcophagus after Maya left the tomb.Maya: .........Apollo. You can't stop now. Dhurke would want you to keep pressing on.Apollo: .....................I know, Ms. Fey. And I won't disappoint him.Judge: ..................Defense, if you are ready to proceed... ...I would first have you answer this: Do you believe the accused's death will impact what we know about this case?Apollo: .........Yes, and I believe I can explain everything now.Judge: Very well. Your explanation, please.Apollo: Dhurke entered the tomb at 3 PM, the time the hostage exchange was to take place. Or rather, Dhurke -- as channeled by Ms. Fey -- did. Now, by the time he entered the tomb at 3 PM... ...Minister Inga was already dead. I say that because we know the minister was murdered at 2 PM. But, there was someone else in there. This person was already hiding in the tomb, waiting to channel Dhurke in place of Ms. Fey.Present Amara Sigatar Khura'in profile Apollo: Leads to: \"It was you, wasn't it.\"Present anyone else Apollo: Nahyuta: I'm afraid that makes no sense whatsoever, defense. Apollo: .........Oh, um... My mistake. Judge: Yes, and it was mine for letting you take part in this trial. Apollo: (Argh, if that wasn't who was hiding in the tomb, then...) Your Magistry, I'd like to try that again. When Dhurke arrived at 3 PM... Leads back to: \"This person was already hiding in the tomb, waiting to channel Dhurke in placer of Ms. Fey.\"Apollo: It was you, wasn't it.Amara: .........Apollo: The fact of the matter is, Queen Amara killed Minister Inga at 2 PM. She then went to his private quarters and channeled his spirit. The minister, thinking he was going to be late, hurried to the tomb for the hostage exchange. But once in the tomb... Queen Amara stopped channeling Minister Inga and hid herself. Then, when Dhurke entered at 3 PM... ...she snuck up from behind... ...and forcibly drove Dhurke's spirit out of Ms. Fey's body.Amara: Drove his spirit out of her body? Impossible...Phoenix:Phoenix: Actually... there is a way to do that. With a Magatama of Parting, that is. Using one, anyone could drive a spirit out of a person's body -- even if it refused to leave.Amara: Urgh!Nahyuta: Are you telling me that the extra, pale brown magatama in the tomb was...! That it was...Phoenix: That's right, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. And you've seen one in action before. You saw how the glowing red magatama sent the high priest back to the Twilight Realm... ...and how it turned a spent, pale brown afterwards.Apollo: In other words, the brown magatama found in the tomb looks that way because... ...its power had been used up in pushing Dhurke's spirit out of Ms. Fey's body, right?Maya: I probably passed out as soon as Dhurke's spirit left my body. I was exhausted after channeling him for so long, after all.Apollo: After that, Queen Amara must've dressed Ms. Fey in her usual outfit, and tied her up. I'm not sure where she got the outfit, but we can assume she had it all planned out. Then, Queen Amara must've changed into Dhurke's clothes, smeared blood onto them... ...picked up the knife, and channeled Dhurke's spirit. That's how she made it look like Dhurke had committed the crime! And that's how she escaped -- right under our noses!Amara: .........Gah!Phoenix: ......I don't know, Apollo. The whole thing still seems a bit... far-fetched.Apollo: (.........Dhurke. What was going through your mind while all this was unfolding?)........................Hmph. So ultimately, it was all for naught.Apollo: Nahyuta?Nahyuta: Those dreams of revolution Dhurke was always spouting... They placed nothing but false hope in the minds of the people. And in the end, they were simply fantasies.Apollo: Nahyuta... How can you--!Nahyuta:Nahyuta: Karma has spoken. The dream of revolution has withered on the vine. Its fate is sealed. The other insurgents will soon wake from their shattered dreams.Apollo: (No. Dhurke's dream can't die like this. I'm not going to sit back and let that happen. I can't, and I won't!) Nahyuta... Don't forget that Dhurke's been proven innocent. His name is no longer tainted by the charge of murder.Phoenix: Now the rebels and their sympathizers who have been calling for his release... ...can't be charged with abetting the accused. So the revolution is far from over -- it's only just begun!Nahyuta:Nahyuta: No, Dhurke has not yet been proven innocent. You have merely indicated the possibility of his innocence.Apollo: Wh-What do you mean?Nahyuta: Dhurke is indeed dead. However... What if it was Dhurke who killed Minister Inga while being channeled by Ms. Fey? And while the crime could have occurred at 2 PM, you have yet to substantively prove it. ...Or do you have conclusive proof that the time of Minister Inga's death was at 2 PM?Apollo: W-Well, no, I don't, but...Amara: .........It seems further testimony will be required of me. As it would appear that I have fallen under suspicion, I would like to state my case.Ga'ran: Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, the rebellion must be snuffed out once and for all. You MUST prove Dhurke Sahdmadhi to be the foul murderer that he was. And every last insurgent and their sympathizers... ...must be found guilty under the Defense Culpability Act!Nahyuta: As you wish, Your Eminence!Apollo: (Why is Nahyuta doing this? Ga'ran shouldn't have him under her thumb anymore. Amara's not a hostage, so what gives? Nahyuta... What's left to chain you to her like this?)Judge: Very well then, Queen Amara. Please proceed with your additional testimony.Witness Testimony-- You Have No Proof --Amara: Well done, lawyer. You have painted me as a killer with nothing but your silver tongue. However, you have no evidence proving your distasteful theory. Furthermore, Dhurke could have committed the crime while being channeled by Ms. Fey. Now, let us end this charade. For the eternal glory of Khura'in and its people!Nahyuta: Do you understand now, you putrid pepper? There is no point in defending Dhurke any longer. It has all been in vain.Apollo: (Let it go, and move on... right? Well, not today.)Amara: Your theories are but a pillar of salt that crumbles at the slightest breeze. But no more. This ends here and now.Judge: The defense may proceed with its cross-examination.Cross-ExaminationCross-Examination-- You Have No Proof --Amara: Well done, lawyer. You have painted me as a killer with nothing but your silver tongue.Press Apollo: Apollo: Convincing others is all part of a lawyer's trade, so I'll take that as a compliment. Amara: You would, wouldn't you? I suppose you have deceived countless souls with your lies. ...But I should not be surprised, considering you learned from... him. Apollo: Him? You mean Dhurke, right? Amara: Yes, the man who deceived and seduced me, a grand priestess, with his silver tongue. Apollo: Umm... We ARE still talking about the case, right? Amara: Surely you have heard of a lady falling for the wrong man before? .........Ah... But to think that I, of all people, would fall under that devil's spell... Apollo: (Wow. How did they ever get together in the first place, let alone procreate...?) Amara: I would advise all here today to beware this lawyer's silver tongue... ...lest you, too, be unjustly painted as a criminal as I have been.Amara: However, you have no evidence proving your distasteful theory.Press Apollo: Apollo: I admit I don't have any solid evidence... yet. But you're the only one who could've committed the crime. Amara: What on earth do you mean? Apollo: Including Ms. Fey, there are only three spirit mediums in Khura'in. Furthermore, when the crime scene was first discovered... ...Queen Ga'ran... ...was with me and Mr. Wright, while Ms. Fey... ...was tied up in the tomb. That means that the Dhurke we saw after the minister's murder... ...could only have been channeled by you, Queen Amara! Amara: INSOLENT LAWYER. Judge: EEK! Forgive us, Your Mercifulness! Apollo: (Really, Your Magistry?) Nahyuta: Nahyuta: Ah, but have you considered the following, defense? What if there was, unbeknownst to us, another spirit medium in Khura'in? Apollo: Apollo: Oh, come on. What are the chances? Nahyuta: Nahyuta: You lack the evidence to support your claim that Queen Amara is the killer. Which is why you have had to use the process of elimination to zero in on her. It therefore stands to reason that you would have to rule out all other possibilities as well. Well? Can you eliminate the possibility of another spirit medium, defense? Apollo: (Of course I can't!) Phoenix: Under the circumstances, Apollo, there are two ways to establish Amara's guilt. We either prove she killed Inga... ...or prove she was in the tomb. Apollo: ......... (Hmm, which one can I actually prove?) Prove she killed Inga Apollo: Queen Amara killed Minister Inga! And I can prove it! Amara: Well now, you seem quite confident. How very intriguing. Though I must say... Adds statement \"There is nothing that proves it was I who killed Justice Minister Inga.\" Prove she was in the tomb Apollo: I can prove that Queen Amara was in the tomb when the murder occurred. Amara: It seems you are ever bent on painting me as the killer. Apollo: Well, if the shoe fits... Amara: Very well. Let us see some evidence that proves I was at the scene of the crime. You do have some, do you not? Adds statement \"There is nothing to prove I was even at the scene of the crime.\"Press (subsequent times) Apollo: Apollo: Evidence, huh. Amara: Yes. Here in this Hall of Justice, evidence is everything. Is it not so in your country, too? Apollo: ......... (There are two ways to establish Amara's guilt: Prove she killed Inga... ...or prove she was in the tomb.) ......... (Hmm, which one can I actually prove?) Prove she killed Inga Apollo: Queen Amara killed Minister Inga! And I can prove it! Amara: Well now, you seem quite confident. How very intriguing. Though I must say... Changes statement from \"There is nothing to prove I was even at the scene of the crime.\" to \"There is nothing that proves it was I who killed Justice Minister Inga.\" Prove she was in the tomb Apollo: I can prove that Queen Amara was in the tomb when the murder occurred. Amara: It seems you are ever bent on painting me as the killer. Apollo: Well, if the shoe fits... Amara: Very well. Let us see some evidence that proves I was at the scene of the crime. You do have some, do you not? Changes statement from \"There is nothing that proves it was I who killed Justice Minister Inga.\" to \"There is nothing to prove I was even at the scene of the crime.\"Amara: There is nothing that proves it was I who killed Justice Minister Inga.Press Apollo: Apollo: So you didn't leave any evidence behind? Is that what you're saying? Amara: .........O ho ho ho. Did you truly believe you could trick me with such an ambiguously-phrased question? Were I to answer in the affirmative, you would twist my words into an admission of guilt. Apollo: (It was worth a shot.) Nahyuta: You should know that you cannot prove anything through the deceit of others. If there is something worthwhile to say, then let the evidence speak for itself. Apollo: (You think I wouldn't if I could?) Amara: Now do you see? All is idle speculation in the absence of evidence.Amara: There is nothing to prove I was even at the scene of the crime.Press Apollo: Apollo: By simply changing into Dhurke's clothes and channeling his spirit... ...it is a fact that the killer altered the crime scene. Amara: How very perceptive of you. Apollo: .........In trying to accomplish everything, the killer would have been pressed for time... ...and may have committed an error that could prove crucial to this case. Phoenix: And sometimes, the significance of certain pieces of evidence can change... ...in the face of new facts and circumstances. Why don't you take another look at all the evidence we have? Apollo: You think I'll see something in a new light? (Is there anything from the tomb that's taken on a different meaning now? Only way to find out is to reconsider each piece based on our current understanding.)Present Pink Butterfly Pendant Apollo: Leads to: \"Queen Amara.\"Amara: Furthermore, Dhurke could have committed the crime while being channeled by Ms. Fey.Press Apollo: Apollo: You're saying the Dhurke who entered the tomb is the one who killed Minister Inga? Amara: I am. I stand firm with the prosecution's original charge against the accused. The only issue is whether that Dhurke was alive or dead. Apollo: That's a pretty major issue. Amara: Oh, I beg to differ. For here in Khura'in, death is not the end. It is merely a change in one's address, for the Twilight Realm is only the next door over. Apollo: Is it really? Amara: It is. Those who have only recently passed away may call upon you in the night. Such occurrences are quite common in our kingdom. Apollo: (She's kidding... right?) Phoenix: In all the time I've spent here, I'm happy to say that's never happened to me. Apollo: ...Me, neither. Amara: You need not fear death. Embrace it, along with your guilt. Then may you begin your journey to the Twilight Realm.Amara: Now, let us end this charade. For the eternal glory of Khura'in and its people!Press Apollo: Apollo: Eternal glory? Amara: Once the king of traitors has been judged, and the rebellion quelled for good... ...peace and prosperity shall return to our fair kingdom. Then shall the blessings of the Holy Mother usher in an age of eternal glory. Judge: Hmm... With Queen Amara as the Grand Priestess of Khura'in once more... ...the people would be freed from subversive elements. Faith would blossom anew! Amara: Oh, you are too kind. But I have no intention of resuming my position as grand priestess. Judge: What...?! Amara: I relinquished my position as queen and grand priestess to my sister Ga'ran. And now that my would-be assassin is gone, I am truly free at last. O ho ho. Perhaps I shall take a trip, or expand my horizons with new training. Judge: .........Q-Queen Amara? Phoenix: Looks like she's totally over being grand priestess and queen. Judge: Ha ha ha ha! In that case, I shall introduce you to some wonderful classes that I am taking!Before adding either statement Phoenix: She's claiming that all we've got is circumstantial evidence. Apollo: Well, I can't say she's wrong... Phoenix: Guess it's do or die now, Apollo. Our whole case comes crashing down if her testimony is allowed to stand. Apollo: Don't worry. I've got this!After adding statement \"There is nothing that proves it was I who killed Justice Minister Inga.\" Phoenix: Proof that Amara killed Inga... Apollo: (Do we really have anything like that...?) Phoenix: If nothing comes to mind, Apollo... ...you might need to get some different testimony out of her. Apollo: (Maybe I should take another look at the evidence we already have, too.)After adding statement \"There is nothing to prove I was even at the scene of the crime.\" Phoenix: If Amara channeled Dhurke, she must have been at the scene of the crime. If so, she may have left something behind.  Apollo: Sure, but the question is, did she? Phoenix: Well, if nothing else, you can always try to get her to testify about something else. Apollo: (Right!

Rayfa actor: Aaah! Why me?! Dhurke actor: Mwahahahaha! It's time for a revolution! Rayfa actor: No! Let go of me! Plumed Punisher actor: That's far enough! Dhurke actor: Who's there?! Plumed Punisher actor: It is I-- The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm! Dhurke: Good people of Khura'in, we can't allow things to go on like this. The Defense Culpability Act has done nothing but produce countless victims of wrongful convictions. The time to act is now. For we, the Defiant Dragons, have obtained the ultimate weapon: the Founder's Orb! And to the Ga'ran regime: Make no mistake about it-- I will personally dethrone you! A dragon never yields. Nor will he rest until his revolution is complete. May 16, 11:00 AMWright Anything Agency TV: ...And this concludes our report on the recent television hijacking in Khura'in. But really, who could have anticipated a surprising turn of events? Trucy: Did you hear that, Polly? Someone hijacked the airwaves over there! It's like something out of a movie! Apollo: ......... Trucy: Apollo? Apollo: ......Um, yeah. Dhurke... What are you up to this time? Trucy: Wait a second... Do you know the TV hijacker or something, Apollo? Apollo: ......You could say that... but it was a long time ago. Trucy: ...And WHY do you know someone like that? I mean, they're calling him an \"insurgent.\" Apollo: Y-Yeah, about that... ???: Hey now. Is that any way to talk about the man who raised you? Apollo: Huh? Dhurke: Hey there, Apollo! Long time no see! How've you been, son? Apollo: I-I-It's-- Trucy: It's that guy that was on TV! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Guilty as charged! Surprised to see me, Apollo? I just beamed in from Khura'in, and boy are my arms tired! Apollo: Th-Th-This can't be happening! ...I must be dreaming... or hallucinating... or both... Trucy: No, you're not, Apollo! It's that TV hijacker-slash-insurgent in the flesh! Apollo: ........ (I'm so confused.) Trucy: Um! Mr. Hijacker! Sir! I have SO many questions, I don't even know where to begin! But let's start with that bit about \"the man who raised you.\" Dhurke: Wait, don't tell me you haven't told anyone about me, son? It's okay to brag about it. Tell everyone your old man's me, the rebel Dhurke! I mean, my face is all over TV these days! I'm practically a celebrity, hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: .........Trucy, what do you say we close up early today? Trucy: What?! Why?! Dhurke: ...Aw, come on, son. No need for the cold shoulder! Apollo: ......... (*sigh* I know I'm going to regret this, but...) What do you want, Dhurke? You just show up here without warning after all this time... What gives? Dhurke: I came all this way to see you, son! Come, rejoice! Apollo: Riiight... Why don't you tell me the real reason you're here. Dhurke: W-Well... Okay, so maybe there's a little something I need your help with, too, but... The fact is I came here to see you. That's the honest truth. Apollo: Yes, I think we've established that. (It figures... I haven't seen him in ten plus years and he's already asking for a favor. He really is a rebel in the purest sense -- he just does whatever he pleases.) Trucy: C'mon, Polly! I need details. Inquiring minds want to know! Apollo: Okay, okay. Hold your horses. First, I've got a few questions of my own. Examine Bookshelf Dhurke: Hm? Why, this is Apollo's journal. Apollo: Huh?! What's it doing at the office? Trucy: It's magic! Dhurke: Let's see what he wrote... Apollo: N-No, don't! Dhurke: Huh... There's nothing in here. Apollo: What? Trucy: This calls for a special spell! Presto diario! Dhurke: Why, there's writing appearing right before my very eyes! Trucy: Like I said, it's magic! Now go ahead, read to your heart's content! Apollo: Wow! ...Er, I mean, give me that! Charley the plant Apollo: That's Charley the houseplant. Dhurke: You know, my hideout used to have a houseplant, too. We called it \"Apollo.\" Trucy: I bet it was a cactus! Dhurke: How'd you guess? Trucy: Because Polly's hair's just as spiny! Apollo: Hey, leave my hair out of this. Trucy: And he has a prickly attitude, to boot! Apollo: (I better quit while I'm ahead.) Hula hoop Dhurke: More magic props... Oh! I've seen a ring like this before! I used to be quite good with these. Apollo: Really? Why don't you show us? Dhurke: Well, if you insist! I'll show you the act of daring-do I used to perform to supplement my income. First, I have to light the ring on fire, then I'll jump through it... Apollo: That's a fire hoop, this is a kid's toy, Dhurke... Magic props Dhurke: This is one seriously cluttered office. I mean, do you really need a piano here? Trucy: Well, it has sentimental value for Daddy, you see... Apollo: Yeah, but this office could use a little help with its bottom line. What if we sold it? Trucy: Apollo! ...You'd better give me a cut of the proceeds when you do. Dhurke: Money before memories, eh? This office's finances really must be in dire straits then. Magic split box Dhurke: This is one of those contraptions for cutting people into pieces! Trucy: How did you know that, Mr. Dhurke? Dhurke: Well, it just so happens I've been in one of these myself. Apollo: Really? Trucy: You have? Dhurke: Yes. Once, when I was being held prisoner by Minister Inga's secret police... ...they tried to torture me into revealing one of my compatriot's hideouts. Apollo: That's a torture device, this is a magic prop, Dhurke... Dhurke: Man, I barely escaped that thing alive! Trucy: Well, you have my respect as a magician for your death-defying spirit! Table Dhurke: What's with this bright red jacket? Who would wear such a garish thing? Trucy: Maybe one of our clients forgot it here. Dhurke: I'd love to get a look at the man who'd dare wear something like this! Trucy: Me, too! Apollo: (I know I don't wear it much, but... she has to know it's mine, right?) Talk Dhurke Dhurke: Pleased to meet you, little lady. My name is Dhurke Sahdmadhi. I'm a... well... a rebel by trade. Trucy: A rebel? But on TV, they were calling you an insurgent. So which is it? Personally, I vote for a rebel with a cause -- a real \"head\"-ache for anyone in your way! Apollo: Trucy...! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! You got me there. I'm the head of a resistance group. The Defiant Dragons. We're like the good, the bad, and the ugly... but without the good part. In Khura'in, I'm like the bogeyman -- a tall tale parents use to spook their kids straight! Trucy: That's too bad. You seem like you'd be a fun, cool guy to hang with! Dhurke: ...This little lady's a real catch, son. I'm talking bride material, if you get my drift. Apollo: Wait, what? Trucy: Oh! Stop it! You're embarrassing me... Dad. Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha. She's a plucky one, all right! Apollo: Someone pluck me out of my misery... Trucy: Now, about that \"man who raised you\" business... Foster father (appears after \"Dhurke\") Trucy: What did Mr. Dhurke mean when he said that he's \"the man who raised you,\" Apollo? Apollo: The truth is, I grew up in the Kingdom of Khura'in. Did I, uh... never mention that? Trucy: Oh, so you grew up in... Khura'in?! Wait, are you saying... ...you're not from around here, Polly? Apollo: No, it's just I was raised in Khura'in when I was really little. Trucy: Still, that's a shocker. It's like I hardly know anything about you! How come you never told me?! Dhurke: ...Apollo. You really haven't said a word about your past, have you? Apollo: What, that I was raised by a wanted criminal? It's like a bad joke. Trucy: It does sound rather melodramatic. I doubt anyone would even believe you. So you two haven't seen each other in a while, huh? Apollo: You could say that. I'd wager it's been at least ten years. Trucy: Wow... That's a really long time. Apollo: Yeah, well, I figured he'd forgotten about me. Dhurke: Not a chance! It's just, well... Starting a revolution takes time, and keeping it going even more so... And being a wanted man, I couldn't just hop a plane to come say hello. Apollo: ...I get it. It's fine. (Though, truth be told... ...it's weird having Dhurke suddenly show up acting all paternal. I'd even almost forgotten about Khura'in... No, that's not true. I probably tried to forget about it on purpose.) Trucy: Now then, Mr. Dhurke, what is it we can help you with? Request (appears after \"Foster father\") Dhurke: I need to get my hand on the Founder's Orb, the most sacred treasure of Khura'in. That's where you come in. Apollo: The Founder's Orb? Trucy: Wait, but didn't you say you already have it in that broadcast of yours? Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Don't go believing everything you see on TV, little lady. No one's seen hide nor hair of the Founder's Orb for some time. Trucy: No way! Apollo: S-So that was just a bluff...? What are you going to do if you DON'T find it? Dhurke: I don't know. Guess that just means we HAVE to find it, son. 'Cause I can't really back down now, can I? Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (*sigh* Different year, same old Dhurke. It's all coming back to me now.) Hold on. I think I read something about this in the newspaper a while back. Something about you stealing a sacred treasure from a temple's treasure room. Dhurke: That's a load of crock. We didn't lay a finger on the orb. Apollo: Really? Dhurke: Yes, Baseless allegations, all of it. Our enemy has really found a way to keep us all on our toes. Trucy: Ooh! So it's like a setup! Dhurke: That's the long and short of it. However, my compatriot has been hot on the orb's trail. And just the other day, his hard work finally paid off. We now know the Founder's Orb is in... Kurain Village. Apollo: Kurain Village? Dhurke: Yes. I hear there are spirit mediums there. They even have direct relations with Khura'in. Apollo: Spirit mediums... Right... Dhurke: Some doctor of archeology there supposedly has the orb. His name is Archie Buff. My Defiant Dragon compatriot has already made contact with him. Apparently, someone asked the doctor to study the orb. Apollo: So whoever asked him to do that is the real thief? Dhurke: Most likely. Apollo: And you think this guy will just hand the orb over to you? Dhurke: My compatriot, Datz, says Dr. Buff has already promised to do so. It seems he knew it was stolen, and wanted to do the right thing. Apollo: (Datz... I remember running around him when I was a kid.) (So he's here, too, huh.) Dhurke: Apollo, I want you to be present as my lawyer when I take possession of the orb. Would you do that for me? Fine Leads to: \".........Fine, but I'll charge my standard fee.\" Nope Apollo: I haven't seen you in years, and you waltz in here asking for a favor? You have a lot of nerve, you know-- Trucy: Of course we'll help! Right, Apollo?! Apollo: W-Wait, Trucy...! Trucy: Oh, come on. It's not like you have any work anyway. Besides, we're talking about rebels and legendary treasure here. It'll be fun! Apollo: (*sigh* Why is she always into the things I'm not?) Leads to: \".........Fine, but I'll charge my standard fee.\" Apollo: .........Fine, but I'll charge my standard fee. Now tell me about the Founder's Orb. The Founder's Orb (appears after \"Request\") Apollo: If I remember correctly, the founder is always depicted as a faceless spirit medium. Trucy: What do you mean \"faceless\"? Dhurke: Images of the founder, the Holy Mother of Khura'in, never show her face. To depict it is to commit the greatest taboo in Khura'inism. Apollo: The greatest taboo, huh? (I wonder why? I mean, what could she have looked like to make them hide her face like that? Dhurke: As for the Founder's Orb, it was discovered during an excavation eight years ago... ...and has an interesting legend that goes along with it. It's said that there's a riddle to the orb, and that any who can solve it... ...will receive immense spiritual power from the founder herself. Apollo: Sounds like one big fairy tale to me. Dhurke: In any case... ...it's just what us Defiant Dragons need to get our revolution started. With it, we can gain the spiritual power, and thus, the legal authority to rule Khura'in! Apollo: Wait, suppose I believe this legend. Then, anyone could become king or queen? And THAT'S why you think it'll help you overthrow the Gar'an regime? Dhurke: Only the rulers of Khura'in have ever laid eyes on the orb, Apollo. A legendary treasure that bestows immense spiritual power... Doesn't that sound like something you'd want to see with your own two eyes? Apollo: (...That does sound just a tiny bit intriguing.) Founder's Orb added to the Court Record. Dhurke: That should just about cover everything. Any other questions? Apollo: Not right now. Dhurke: Ah, I almost forgot. I brought you a present. Eat up, son! Apollo: ...Sushi? Dhurke: I figured you probably couldn't afford three square meals a day, so... Trucy: Yay! I was just thinking it was time for lunch! Dhurke: You dig in, too, little lady. After all, we're practically family, right?! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Trucy: Thanks, Dad! Ooh, that tuna looks good! *chomp* *nom nom nom* Dhurke: This salmon sushi's got my name on it! *chomp* *chew chew chew* Aren't you hungry, son? This is some of the best sushi you'll ever have! Apollo: .........I'm... I'm good. Dhurke: O-Oh, well... Okay then. ...Actually, I have one more present for you. Here. Apollo: What's this? Dhurke: A picture of your father. It's been twenty-three years since he passed away. Apollo: Huh?! This... This is my father? Dhurke: His name was Jove Justice. Apollo: Jove... Dhurke: I haven't talked to you about your real father in some time, but as you know... ...he was a musician -- a wandering minstrel, if you will -- and a talented one at that. Apollo: ............ Why... Why are you giving this to me now? Dhurke: I thought it was sad you didn't know what your old man looked like. I searched high and low to find that one picture. Apollo: ............ Trucy: What's wrong, Apollo? Don't you want it? Apollo: (I don't know. I mean, it's not like I ever met the guy.) Dhurke: Well, I went through all the trouble of finding it, so go on, take it! And don't ever let it go, you hear? Photo of My Father added to the Court Record. Dhurke: Well, now that our bellies are full, what do you say we hit the road? Apollo: One second. Hey, Trucy, any idea where Athena is? Trucy: She left early this morning to pick up Daddy from the airport. Apollo: Oh, I almost forgot. Mr. Wright is coming back today. Trucy: Yeah... but I wonder why he cut his trip short like that. Anyway, shouldn't they have been back by now? Apollo: Knowing Athena, she probably got lost. Well, there's no point sitting around here waiting. Let's get going. Trucy: I can't wait to see that super mysterious treasure! Dhurke: To Kurain Village, then! The Founder's Orb awaits! The Founder's Orb (subsequent times) Apollo: If I remember correctly, the founder is always depicted as a faceless spirit medium. Trucy: What do you mean \"faceless\"? Dhurke: Images of the founder, the Holy Mother of Khura'in, never show her face. To depict it is to commit the greatest taboo in Khura'inism. Apollo: The greatest taboo, huh? (I wonder why? I mean, what could she have looked like to make them hide her face like that? Dhurke: As for the Founder's Orb, it was discovered during an excavation eight years ago... ...and has an interesting legend that goes along with it. It's said that there's a riddle to the orb, and that any who can solve it... ...will receive immense spiritual power from the founder herself. Apollo: Sounds like one big fairy tale to me. Dhurke: In any case... ...it's just what us Defiant Dragons need to get our revolution started. With it, we can gain the spiritual power, and thus, the legal authority to rule Khura'in! Apollo: Wait, suppose I believe this legend. Then, anyone could become king or queen? And THAT'S why you think it'll help you overthrow the Gar'an regime? Dhurke: Only the rulers of Khura'in have ever laid eyes on the orb, Apollo. A legendary treasure that bestows immense spiritual power... Doesn't that sound like something you'd want to see with your own two eyes? Apollo: (...That does sound just a tiny bit intriguing.) Present Attorney's Badge Dhurke: What's that? Apollo: It's my attorney's badge. Dhurke: I can relate. I used to want to show mine off, too. But don't ever show it to anyone in Khura'in. They'll run you right out of town the moment they find out you're a lawyer. Apollo: I wonder how it went for Mr. Wright. Knowing him, he probably flashed his left and right... Founder's Orb Dhurke: The Founder's Orb... They say the Holy Mother will return when the riddle of the orb is solved. And she will bestow great spiritual power upon whoever accomplishes that feat. Apollo: (I wonder if I could channel spirits if I had such power.) Photo of My Father Dhurke: Brings back memories... He was a fine young man. So cheerful and fun to be around. His big, booming singing voice would captivate everyone in the tavern. But looks-wise, he was like a grownup version of you. Apollo: Um, that still doesn't give me a sense of what my real father was like. After clearing \"The Founder's Orb\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency: May 16Kurain Village Apollo: (So this is Kurain, the mystical village of spirit channeling... ... and where ancient traditions come alive. Looks like a really peaceful place.) Dhurke: Ahh, I love the air here! Nothing beats the mountains, huh, Apollo?! Apollo: (Come to think of it... We used to live way up in the mountains, too, just like this.) Dhurke: Sure brings back memories. Those were the days. The three of us living happily in peace. Trucy: ...I still can't wrap my mind around it all, you know. That Mr. Dhurke is not only Polly's daddy, but Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's as well. And the way you two talked about it like it was nothing the whole bus ride here! Apollo: (I guess it IS a lot to take in...) Trucy: So tell me, Mr. Dhurke, what was Apollo like as a kid? Dhurke: Oh, he was full of piss and vinegar, he was. A real rascal! He and Nahyuta used to run around in the open fields, naked as jaybirds. I've even got pictures of him posing in his birthday suit! Apollo: Whoa, whoa, Dhurke! Trucy: No way! Prosecutor Sahdmadhi used to be like that, too? Dhurke: The two of 'em would end up with leeches on their butts and cry like babies, hah-ha ha! Apollo: Dhurke! Don't you think you've said enough?! Dhurke: Aw, you're no fun. Trucy: Yeah! I wanted to hear more about the misadventures of Polly! ???: Hey, what are you people doing here? Apollo: Ema? Dhurke: You know this lady, son? Apollo: Yeah, this is Ema Skye. She's a detective. Ema: Technically speaking, I'm a forensics expert, but I'll let it slide. ...Anyway, I can't say I'm surprised to see you here. You always seem to pop up whenever there's trouble afoot. Still, what are the odds of running into you here in the boonies? Apollo: By \"trouble,\" you mean you're investigating a case? Ema: Does it look like I'm here to sightsee? .........Wait, don't tell me... You're not here to see Dr. Buff, are you? Apollo: Huh? How'd you know that? We're actually on our way to meet with him right now. Ema: Figures... Well, follow me. I'll show you the way. Apollo: ...Really? Dhurke: Don't look a gift horse in the mouth, son. Just follow the nice lady. Examine Phone booth Apollo: (A phone booth and a bus stop made of wood. They both look really old. You hardly ever see phone booths in the city anymore.) Dhurke: Apollo... what's this glass box for? Apollo: (I guess you hardly see them in Khura'in, too.) Kurain Boulder Apollo: There's a big boulder towering into the sky over there. According to the sign, it's called the \"Kurain Boulder.\" It also says that a spirit dwells within it. Hmm... A rock with a spirit in it? Dhurke: It's called animism -- the belief that spirits dwell within inanimate objects. They've probably enshrined this boulder as a sacred object. Their tradition of worshiping such objects is similar to our tradition in Khura'in. Apollo: I-Interesting... (Who knew Dhurke could make sense every once in a while?) Mountains Dhurke: Seeing those mountains really takes me back. I remember when we used to live high in the mountains to escape from the government. Apollo: So, you don't live there anymore? Dhurke: Nope. I needed a more convenient place to lead the revolution from. But that old mountain hut is still there. Apollo: (Man, I miss that hut...) Dhurke: What, are you getting homesick, Apollo? You can come on back to Khura'in anytime, you know? Apollo: N-No, no, I'm fine. Besides, I've got a lot on my plate here... Fey Manor Apollo: A thatched roof... First time I've ever seen one in real life. Dhurke: It looks just like the traditional thatched roofs they use in Japan. All we need now are some samurai with topknots, a few ninjas, and a cuddly mascot. Apollo: When was the last time you were in Japan? Talk Any ideas? Dhurke: Mass transit and electronic communications... This country's infrastructure is really advanced compared to Khura'in. Apollo: Why don't you see the sights once you have the orb? Dhurke: Well... I guess I could use a break. How about you show me around? Apollo: ...Oh, um, I'll probably be busy with work, so, uh... Dhurke: ...I-I see. Trucy: What are you talking about, Polly? Your only work right now is cleaning the office. What to do Dhurke: The Founder's Orb should be with the doctor right now. What do you say we go take a gander? Apollo: What if he doesn't have it? What if you came all the way from Khura'in for nothing? Dhurke: I'll cross that bridge if and when I come to it. Besides... even if I leave empty-handed, at least I got to see you, son. Apollo: ...Oh, ha ha. Thanks? Dhurke: N-No, no -- I really mean it. May 16Kurain Village - Doctor's Study Apollo: So this is Dr. Buff's study... Trucy: Wow, look at all those books! The shelves go from floor to ceiling! It's like a library in here! Dhurke: Yes, and lots of artifacts, too. A true archeologist's paradise. Look, son! There are so many relics, they're spilling onto the floor! What a delightfully amusing room! Apollo: All I see is a mess. (And what's with that white outline...?) ...Um, Ema, where's the doctor? Ema: Well the thing is... he died last night. Apollo: Wait, what? Ema: It seems an avalanche of books knocked him off his bookshelf ladder. We're labeling it an accidental death. Apollo: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Please tell me you're joking... Ema: As if I'd come all the way out here for a few laughs, Apollo. Apollo: ...Yeah, I guess not. Dhurke: A scholar killed by his own books... Apollo: Oh man. What do we do now? I mean, how can he transfer ownership of the orb to you if he's dead? Dhurke: Yes, that is a problem. Apollo: Ema, can you please tell us exactly what happened? Examine Ema: What do you think you're doing? You can't just poke around without my permission. Apollo: (Guess I should ask her what's going on first.) Talk The doctor's death Apollo: So the doctor died in an accident? Ema: I received a call this morning saying Dr. Buff had been found dead under a pile of books. Apollo: This morning? (Talk about bad timing...) You mentioned that he had fallen off a ladder. Ema: Right. We believe he fell from the top of that big ladder there. Apparently, he triggered an avalanche of books while fumbling to reach one. And that sent him headlong on a fatal fall onto the hard floor. Trucy: How sad... Killed by his own books. But at least he was doing something he loved. Dhurke: For a scholar, I suppose it's kind of like a soldier killed in the line of duty. You could say he died an honorable death. Apollo: Ema, who was the first one to discover the body? Ema: About that... Whoever it was, it seems they wanted to remain anonymous. Apollo: What? Ema: It happens now and then. Some people would rather not get involved with the police. Dhurke: I can relate to that. Apollo: (Yeah, being a wanted man and all.) What now, Dhurke? A dead man can't exactly hand over the orb. Dhurke: We'll just have to find it. It must be around here somewhere. Apollo: Just to fill you in, Ema, we're actually here to get something. The Founder's Orb (appears after \"The doctor's death\") Apollo: Pops here had an agreement with the doctor. The doctor was supposed to hand over a sacred relic known as the Founder's Orb. Dhurke: \"P-Pops\"...? Ema: Oh, I see. That could be a problem, considering he's dead. Do you have a plan B? Apollo: Umm... Dhurke: I have an agreement in writing. My compatriot Datz should have it. Ema: Well, there shouldn't be any problems, then. So, who IS this gentleman you're escorting? Dhurke (appears after \"The Founder's Orb\") Leads to: \"Oh, right, I haven't introduced you yet. This is Dhurke. He's from the Kingdom of Khura'in.\" Present Attorney's Badge Ema: Your attorney's badge? Huh... Apollo: What, that normally gets a better reaction from you. Ema: I'm tired of collecting your fingerprints. It's kind of lost its luster. Apollo: Yeah, but who knows? There could be other people's prints on it. Ema: Ooh, that's true! Hand it over, buddy! Apollo: Ah! Ema: ............Hmph. The only prints I found were yours. Apollo: (Argh, it's all dusty now.) Founder's Orb Ema: Scientifically speaking, ancient relics are highly fascinating. Apollo: Why's that? Ema: Because of all the tests I can run. CT scans, electron microscopy, chemical analysis... The list goes on and on! If you ever do find one, you'd better bring it to me straight away! Apollo: Can I count on getting it back intact? Ema: We'll see. Scientific advances don't come without sacrifices, you know. Apollo: (...I know someone who WON'T be seeing the orb anytime soon.) Anything else Ema: You sure like to shove things in people's faces, don't you? Apollo: What about you? You're always dusting around for prints. Ema: That's my job! Apollo: Well, it's not like I'm presenting evidence for the fun of it, either. Ema: Really? Because it sure seems like you enjoy it, Apollo. Apollo: Right back at you, Ema. Apollo: Oh, right, I haven't introduced you yet. This is Dhurke. He's from the Kingdom of Khura'in. Ema: All the way from Khura'in, huh? So, what do you do there? Dhurke: I used to practice law, but I'm taking a break from all that. I'm focused now on making Khura'in a better place through... volunteer work. Ema: Volunteer work, huh? How interesting... Apollo: (...Well, it's not technically a lie.) Ema: So, how do you two know each other? Apollo: Oh, um... He's sorta my foster father. Ema: Come again? Trucy: Yeah! And he's Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's real father, too! Ema: Whaaat?! You mean you... and Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... ............I'm so sorry. It seems you've had quite a life. Apollo: (...Guess she's put a few things together.) Ema: Actually, Dhurke, you look kind of... familiar. Have we met before? Dhurke: Um, not that I recall. Apollo: (Great... She must've seen that news report on TV. It will really complicate things if she figures out he's a wanted man.) There are lots of guys who look like him. Sure you're not mistaking him for someone else? Ema: Are there, really? I mean, a middle-aged man with long hair and an eye patch? You don't see that every day. Apollo: W-Well, I'm sure you're just imagining things. Ema: So what does that sacred relic you're searching for look like? I mean, there's lots of stuff in here that's old and relic-y. Dhurke: Indeed. Unfortunately, I've no idea what it actually looks like. Apollo: So then, how are we supposed to find it? Dhurke: That, I do not know, either. We'll just have to go through each candidate one by one. Apollo: Great plan of attack there, Dhurke. Well, Ema, do you mind if we give this room a once-over? Ema: ...I guess not. But in exchange, you're going to help me in my investigation. Apollo: Sure. It can't hurt. Trucy: Ooh, I can't wait to get started! It'll be like hunting for buried treasure! Examine Body outline or pile of books Apollo: So this is where Dr. Buff died. Ema: Poor man... He fell right on his head, and probably died almost instantly. Apollo: I see some blood on the book there, but what's that dark stain? Ema: It appears to be coffee. It's still damp, so it must have gotten on there recently, perhaps even last night. Dhurke: That's a mighty big window he's next to -- big enough for someone to see inside. Ema: Exactly. That's how the local resident who reported his death found him to begin with. The doctor's body was visible from outside the window. And a passerby called in earlier this morning to report what they'd found. Apollo: So you mean this case is still only a few hours old? Dhurke: That explains why your investigation is just getting underway. Study Photo added to the Court Record. Study Diagram added to the Court Record. Body outline or pile of books (subsequent times) Apollo: So this is where Dr. Buff died. Dhurke: Yeah, the police received a call this morning... ...so their investigation is still just getting started. Glasses Apollo: There's a pair of glasses on this little pyramid here. Ema: They belonged to the doctor. Scientifically speaking, they appear to be your ordinary run-of-the-mill glasses. Trucy: I guess they don't pique her interest, scientifically speaking. Computer Apollo: This PC is password protected. Trucy, you think your magic can do something about this? Trucy: Hmm... I don't think it can override a password. Now, a locked desk... That I can get into. Like yours back at the office, Polly! Apollo: (Yikes... I'd better watch what I put in there.) Trucy: What? Do you put weird stuff in your desk? Stuff you don't want anyone to see? Apollo: Jeez, are you a mind reader, too? Trucy: No, but unlocking your thoughts is a cinch! Ladder or bookshelves Apollo: The doctor fell from the top of that ladder. Dhurke: Hmm... From that height, a fall onto a hard surface would probably kill anyone. Apollo: I don't know why anyone would want to climb that high in the first place. Trucy: Guess you can say he climbed it all the way to heaven... Raincoat Apollo: It's a two-tone raincoat. Dhurke: It's still a bit damp. I think someone might've worn it recently. Shoe shelves Apollo: There are a few pairs of shoes here. I guess there must be an entrance on this floor, too. Ema: Yeah, there's a backdoor over that way. But it's usually locked from what I can tell. The visitor's entrance is up that spiral staircase. Apollo: (That's the way we came in.) Geoglyph Apollo: There are animal drawings on the floor. They look like those famous geoglyph things. Dhurke: They remind me of the chalk outlines detectives draw around bodies. And the doctor's has [sic] just joined them. Now that's what I call dedication to one's field. Apollo: I don't think it was on purpose. Window Apollo: What a huge window. I bet you could see the entire study from the outside. Dhurke: How could he concentrate in here? I'd feel so exposed. Apollo: Well... He does have a bookshelf positioned for some privacy around his desk. Mechanical statue Dhurke: There's some sort of machinery inside this clay figure. Apollo: Whoa, it's moving! EX-TER-MI-NATE. EX-TER-MI-NATE. DES-TROY ALL TAR-GETS. EX-T-T-TERRRrrr... *scrape* *grind* Apollo: D-Do I even want to know what that thing is for?! Notebook Apollo: Look, it's one of the doctor's notebooks. Dhurke: Maybe there's something about the orb in there. It's a photo of the treasure box! The one from Tehm'pul Temple's treasure room. These must be his research notes on the Founder's Orb. Apollo: What's that on the right page? It looks like a poem or something. Dhurke: Let's see... Oh, it's the song that's performed during the Dance of Devotion. It's been sung during Khura'inese rites of offering since ancient times. Apollo: Oh, I think I've heard of that. Dhurke: There's also a legend associated with the song. Some say the solution to the orb's riddle is contained therein. Apollo: It's a song everyone in Khura'in knows? Not much of a way to keep it secret. Trucy: It's called \"hiding secrets in plain sight,\" Polly. Us magicians know all about that. Dhurke: Huh. That's strange. Apollo: What is? Dhurke: Dr. Buff's notes contain the second half of the song. Only the first half is sung during the Dance of Devotion. Most people haven't even heard the second half. Apollo: The second half? As in the part that begins, \"Offer thy prayers\"? Dhurke: I'm impressed. That's some thorough research he was conducting. Research Notes added to the Court Record. Model plane Apollo: Is this a bird? Dhurke: It looks like an airplane to me. Apollo: No, there couldn't have been any planes back when this was made. Dhurke: Yes, but it has wings and both horizontal and vertical stabilizers. That makes it an airplane. Apollo: No, it's definitely a bird. Dhurke: Open your eyes, son... As a lawyer, your job is to see the true nature of things. Apollo: (I still say it's a bird.) Misty Fey scroll Apollo: There's a brown stain on this scroll. Hm? Why does it smell like... gravy? Dhurke: Why would there be a gravy stain on it? Apollo: Who knows? But it looks like it's meant to be there. Dhurke: Maybe the artist was trying to inspire a \"gravy\" new trend: food splatter art. Apollo: That pun wounded me \"gravy-ly,\" Dhurke. Coffee machine Apollo: A coffeemaker and a bunch of coffee cups... He must've taken his coffee breaks here. Oh, and there's a filter with old coffee grounds in here. *sigh* Guess I'd better clean this up. Dhurke: What are you doing there, son? Apollo: Ah! (What AM I doing, cleaning this office?!) Dhurke: Don't tell me they have you on coffee duty back at your office. Apollo: N-No, no... It's just, if I don't keep the place clean, no one will. Ami Fey statue Apollo: It's a golden statue. Looks pretty old, too. Dhurke: Hmm... I imagine it has great archeological value... Maybe too great for a private researcher of Dr. Buff's caliber. Apollo: I wonder how he got his hands on something like this. Sacred Urn Apollo: \"Ami\"... Hmm... Why's someone's name written on here? Trucy: Maybe it's so if it ever got lost, someone could return it to its owner. You know, like how school kids put their names on things. Apollo: Yeah, but this is just an urn. And the name is written so big. Trucy: Well, I wrote my name on my magic panties. It says W-R-I-G-H-T in super big letters! Apollo: (The less said about this, the better.) Spiral staircase Apollo: It's a spiral staircase... And it's connected to a hallway up there. Why'd they have to place the second floor so high up? Ema: Wait... You're not afraid of heights, are you? Apollo: Oh, um... Well... Trucy: Oh, Polly's hilarious around high places. He gets all wobbly, like a baby deer taking its first steps. And his face turns as green as a watermelon. Apollo: It's not nice to make fun of people's phobias, you know. Dhurke: Come to think of it, the visitor's entrance is on the second floor. What an odd layout for a house... Wall relief Apollo: What a huge wall relief. Hmm... It seems to depict a spirit channeling. Dhurke: Hey... this spirit medium looks like the Holy Mother of Khura'in. Apollo: Yeah, her face was left blank, but the rest is clearly detailed and well-crafted. Dhurke: Did you know some researchers claim that the Holy Mother had three eyes? And that her third eye was able to divine the truth, just like the gods above. It is said to be on her forehead. Apollo: Like you said, you shouldn't believe everything you hear. Suitcase Apollo: That's one big suitcase. Dhurke: It's locked. Is it the doctor's? Ema: No, someone left it here last night. Apollo: So the doctor might've had a visitor? But how can you tell? Ema: That sticker there. You only see those on airport luggage. Which means, its owner is likely from overseas. Dhurke: Is there any way to figure out who it belongs to? Apollo: Not unless we can open it to see what's inside. Dhurke: Guess not... ???: Heh heh heh. Ah-ha ha ha! Ema: That's because you're not me: Ema Skye, forensics expert extraordinaire! Try as you might, you won't find the word \"impossible\" in my forensics handbook! Dhurke: I-Is she okay, son? It's like she became an entirely different person. Apollo: Oh, that's just what happens when her forensics switch gets flipped. Ema: With this, identifying the suitcase's owner will be easy as pie! Apollo: Is that fingerprint powder? Ema: That's right. And there's no better time than the present to use it! Here we go! You remember how to do this, right? Apollo: I apply the powder to where I think some prints might be, and blow any excess off? Ema: Exactly. Well, have at it! Apollo: (Hmm... Now where would I expect to find prints on a suitcase?) Examine any fingerprint on stickers closest to keyhole Leads to: \"Hey Ema, I've got a pretty clear print here.\" Examine any fingerprint on handle Ema: This one isn't clear enough for a match. Apollo: Hmm... Where else could someone leave prints behind? Dhurke: Think, son. How might someone handle a suitcase? Start by considering what you do with them. Apollo: Well, besides being wheeled or carried, they can be opened and closed. So, I should look for prints that would be left at those times. Examine any incomplete fingerprint Ema: You'll need to use more powder than that to get a clear print. Examine excess powder Ema: There's still too much powder left. Try blowing some more off. Apollo: Hey Ema, I've got a pretty clear print here. Ema: Okay, now let me know who you think it could belong to. Apollo: (Hmm, who could it be? It would have to be someone who would've paid Dr. Buff a visit.) Compare Datz Are'bal profile Analyzing...Analysis CompleteMatch Found Leads to: \"We have a match!\" Compare anyone else Analyzing...No Match Found Ema: We didn't get a match. Trucy: Any other ideas, Apollo? Apollo: Hmm... Well, we can probably assume the print belongs to the suitcase's owner. (But who could that be? It would have to be someone who would've visited the doctor.) Leads back to profile selection Ema: We have a match! Apollo: Datz... Come to think of it, he did stop by to see the doctor, didn't he? To conclude the orb transfer agreement. Dhurke: So he's the one who forgot his suitcase here. Apollo: Where do you suppose he is now? Dhurke: Haven't heard from him in a while, and he's not answering his phone. Trucy: Wait, you don't think he left his phone inside his suitcase, do you? Dhurke: I wouldn't put it past that knucklehead. Ema: Actually, I think we may have run into him earlier. Apollo: Really? Ema: A suspicious man had been reported in the area, but when one of my officers approached to question him, he took off like a shot. Apollo: What?! Dhurke: Sorry about that. Khura'inese people aren't all like him... I swear. Ema: Well, he's probably still in the village somewhere. Apollo: Maybe he knows something about the orb. Suitcase (subsequent times) Apollo: So this suitcase belongs to Datz. Dhurke: How could he leave something so big behind? Apollo: Because, you know... it's Datz. Talk Dhurke Apollo: Oh, right, I haven't introduced you yet. This is Dhurke. He's from the Kingdom of Khura'in. Ema: All the way from Khura'in, huh? So, what do you do there? Dhurke: I used to practice law, but I'm taking a break from all that. I'm focused now on making Khura'in a better place through... volunteer work. Ema: Volunteer work, huh? How interesting... Apollo: (...Well, it's not technically a lie.) Ema: So, how do you two know each other? Apollo: Oh, um... He's sorta my foster father. Ema: Come again? Trucy: Yeah! And he's Prosecutor Sahdmadhi's real father, too! Ema: Whaaat?! You mean you... and Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... ............I'm so sorry. It seems you've had quite a life. Apollo: (...Guess she's put a few things together.) Ema: Actually, Dhurke, you look kind of... familiar. Have we met before? Dhurke: Um, not that I recall. Apollo: (Great... She must've seen that news report on TV. It will really complicate things if she figures out he's a wanted man.) There are lots of guys who look like him. Sure you're not mistaking him for someone else? Ema: Are there, really? I mean, a middle-aged man with long hair and an eye patch? You don't see that every day. Apollo: W-Well, I'm sure you're just imagining things. Present Study Photo Ema: Maybe it was Dr. Buff's wish to die under a pile of his beloved books. I know I could die happily under a big pile of forensic equipment. Apollo: Well, I'll pass on dying under a big pile of evidence from my past cases. It's all murder weapons and photos of dead bodies. Ema: So, what? Are you saying you don't love your job? Apollo: Being buried in the tools of one's trade is hardly a valid way to assess dedication, Ema. After examining body outline or pile of books, ladder or bookshelves, notebook, Sacred Urn, spiral staircase, and suitcase: Dhurke: It seems the orb isn't here. Apollo: That means Datz might be our only lead at this point. Dhurke: Detective Skye said he might still be here in the village. We should try to find him. May 16Kurain Village ???: Good day to you, citizens of Kurain Village! My name is Paul Atishon, and I want your vote! Apollo: Wow, that's REALLY loud. Trucy: Look, something's coming this way. ???: Paul Atishon, savior of Kurain, has come to-- Ahhh! It's you people! Dhurke: Apollo? What is that strange conveyance coming this way? Staff: Right, left, right, left, HALT! Apollo: (It's one of those... what-do-you-call-'ems? Palanquins...?) ???: So, you finally left Dr. Buff's house! What were you doing there?! ...What a bunch of shady-looking characters. Apollo: (And you aren't?) So I take it you knew the doctor? ???: Heh, what a foolish question. I've memorized the names and faces of the entire electorate here in Kurain. After all, I am the man who's destined to be king of this fine nation someday. Apollo: Um... who are you? (And what do you mean, \"king\"?) Atishon: Ignorant fools. I am THE Paul Atishon. I am a soon-to-be eminent politician -- a man whose name will go down in history. You should be ashamed that you've never heard of me before. Dhurke: Is he really that famous of a politician, Apollo? Apollo: Not that I know of. Atishon: I'm running for a seat on the local council right now. Apollo: (I guess even Jerk Q. Public has to start somewhere.) Atishon: But my election is a sure thing, I'm told. After all, my grandfather was a famous politician with untold influence. In short, I'm the chosen one, the golden boy, the powerhouse of politics! Trucy: ...And rider-of-his-grandfather's-coattails. Atishon: Heh heh heh. Are you blinded by my majesty? Go ahead! Bask in the resplendent glory that is me, the chosen one! Apollo: Um... Sure... Atishon: ...Ah! A pleasant day to you, good people of Kurain! I am Paul Atishon! It's time to reclaim the glory of Kurain, together! A convenience store on every corner, a karaoke bar in every home! A vote for Paul Atishon is a vote for a happier, hopey-er Kurain Village! Old Man: Turn off that infernal racket, you fool! You're a stain on your grandfather's good name! Atishon: Thank you, good sir! Your support is appreciated, as always! Trucy: I guess he's one of those people who only hears what they want to hear. Apollo: ...In other words, he's a model politician. Atishon: Now where was I? Oh right, you were in the doctor's house. Just what in the world were you doing in there? Hmm? Talk Paul Atishon Apollo: Is this what you ride around in when you're campaigning? Atishon: That's right. It's perfect for the narrow roads and steep hills here in this village. It has a top speed of five miles per hour, but it suffers from serious reliability issues. (Changed from [It has a top speed of 5 miles per hour, but it suffers from serious reliability issues.] in the original release) Namely, these imbeciles tire out too quickly. Staff: *cough* *huff, puff* We'll try harder next time, sir! Apollo: (Poor guys... They're exhausted and covered in sweat.) Atishon: The Atishon family has been in politics for generations, even back in the old country. Apollo: Really? Atishon: My grandfather, Abe Atishon, was a prominent member of Congress. And he was born right here in Kurain. There isn't a person here who hasn't heard of him. Apollo: (All I asked about was his palanquin.) Atishon: You must've heard of the Atishons. I'm even reviving our old country campaigning style. Apollo: ...Oh, um... politics aren't really my thing. Trucy? Trucy: I don't recall ever reading about them at school. Atishon: Feh... Young people today. You people really need to pay more attention to politics. The doctor's house Atishon: So, what business did you people have at Dr. Buff's house? Apollo: He was going to transfer ownership of the Founder's Orb to us. It's a sacred relic from the Kingdom of Khura'in. Atishon: The Founder's Orb? So you tried to get your hands on it, did you? Apollo: Wait, what do you know about the orb? Atishon: Heh. I know that it's mine, that's what. Apollo: How do you figure that? Atishon: Because I know it's not the Founder's Orb. Its real name is the Crystal of Ami Fey. Apollo: The Crystal of Ami Fey? Atishon: That's right. It's been passed down for generations in the Atishon family. Until it was stolen, that is. But just when I had zeroed in on the culprit... ...the doctor hid it away and then kicked the bucket. Apollo: So you're saying Dr. Buff stole your family heirloom? (That's not what Dhurke said. Strange...) But I've been told the doctor himself said that... ...he had the \"Founder's Orb.\" Atishon: It's all that weird foreigner's doing! He filled the doctor's head with nonsense! Nonsense like the Crystal of Ami Fey being the Founder's Orb. Apollo: \"Weird foreigner\"? (Could he mean...?) Is this the foreigner you're talking about? Present Datz Are'bal profile Apollo: Atishon: Yes, that's him! Apollo: I thought so. (Now we really have to find Datz.) Leads back to Talk options Present anyone else Apollo: Atishon: Who's that? Wait, I know everyone around here, so this must be a new eligible voter for me! Apollo: Yes, wouldn't that be nice. (Because I certainly wouldn't vote for you. It seems this isn't the person he's talking about. But I can't imagine the doctor had contact with that many foreigners way out here.) Leads back to Talk options Datz (appears after presenting Datz Are'bal profile upon selecting \"The doctor's house\" Talk option) Dhurke: Do you know where this man is now? Atishon: I imagine he's at the Detention Center by now. I called the authorities after I found him hiding in my dog's doghouse. Apollo: Whaaat?! Dhurke: That buffoon... Apollo: Well, at least we know where he is now. Dhurke: Let's head over to the Detention Center and see what he knows about the Founder's Orb. Atishon: So, you really are after my crystal. Apollo: No, we're looking for the Founder's Orb, and we have an agreement to prove it. Atishon: Well, just so you know, you're not going to lay a finger on it. It's mine. And I intend to give it to my benefactor. Apollo: Your... benefactor? Your benefactor (appears after \"Datz\") Athison: My benefactor is ready to support my rise to the pinnacle of the political world. They have immense influence here, you see, and I intend to harness that influence. Apollo: So you're just going to give your family heirloom away to this person? Atishon: That's right. It's a purely political decision. Apollo: And in exchange, your patron will get the people of Kurain to vote for you? Atishon: Heh heh heh. Eminent politicians are skilled at leveraging all of their connections. Apollo: ......... (Isn't it illegal to buy votes?) Well, good luck with that, I guess. Atishon: Heh, you just wait. Paul Atishon will reign supreme someday. Present Attorney's Badge Apollo: Actually, I'm a lawyer. Atishon: Heh heh heh. You're so shallow. Relying on your badge to impress people... What would you be without it? I petty men like you have no sense of self. Real men make their own mark in this world. Apollo: (Says the man who's riding on his grandfather's coattails.) Anything else Apollo: What do you think about this? Atishon: Paul Atishon is the \"squeaky-clean candidate.\" So if you're going to bribe me, try to be a little more subtle about it, would you? Apollo: Huh? I wasn't trying to bribe you. Atishon: \"Don't accept any bribes unless they come in unmarked bills.\" This is but a fraction of the political wisdom my grandfather shared with me. Better luck next time. Apollo: (After a spin cycle or two with those bills, I bet I'D be \"squeaky-clean,\" too.) Wright Anything Agency (after examining body outline or pile of books, ladder or bookshelves, notebook, Sacred Urn, spiral staircase, and suitcase in Kurain Village - Doctor's Study, then visiting Kurain Village) Talk Any ideas? Dhurke: About that Paul Atishon fellow... He's aiming to be a councilman and beyond, as his famous grandfather once was, right? No doubt some would vote for him on the merits of his grandfather's achievements. I see a grim future for Kurain Village if someone like that is able to climb the ranks. Apollo: I wouldn't worry about it. Who in their right mind would vote for him with the way he's campaigning? Dhurke: So the more aggressively he campaigns, the less people will want to vote for him? That makes me want to get out there and help him fail. What to do Apollo: We turned the doctor's study upside down, but never found the orb. Dhurke: Yeah, I didn't expect this to be so hard. Trucy: Well, I think it's fun. It's like a big old treasure hunt! Dhurke: That orb is the key to Khura'in's future, you know. Trucy: Yeah, and our office's future, too! Apollo: (She does realize it's not up for sale, right?) Present Anything else Dhurke: Ah, the old show-'em-and-see-what-they-say tactic. I used to try that whenever I had nothing else to say. Apollo: Who says I have nothing else to say? Dhurke: It's written all over your face. Apollo: Like you have anything to add right now. After clearing all Talk options with Paul Atishon in Kurain Village: May 16Detention Center - Visitor's Room Datz: ......... Dhurke: .........Hey. Datz: Yipes! Apollo: What's he doing under the desk...? Datz: Foul cogs of the corrupt regime! I've nothing to say to you! Dhurke: Datz, it's me, Dhurke. Datz: Oh! Dhurke! You're a sight for sore eyes! I knew you'd come save me! Dhurke: Well, this is another fine mess you've gotten yourself into. Datz: Har har har har har! My bad, my bad! 'Least the grub here's pretty good compared to that prison back home! Ya get three squares plus a place to sleep! Why don't ya join me, Dhurke?! Dhurke: No thanks. They'd just send me back to Khura'in where I'd face immediate execution. Datz: Yeah, I guess that wouldn't be such a good idea. Apollo: (Looks like he's still the same, too.) ...Long time no see, Datz. Datz: Huh? Hey, ya look... kinda familiar... A-A-A-Apollo?! Is it really you, m'boy?! A-to-the-J, all grown up and whatnot! How've ya been?! Apollo: Fine. And you, Datz? You look good, besides the incarceration and all. Datz: ...Pffffff! Haaaaar har har har har! Those horns, AJ! Apollo: Horns? Datz: They've grown up with ya, just like a stag's antlers! I can't take it! Apollo: *sigh* You really haven't changed a bit. Anyway, there's something we needed to talk to you about. Datz: Sure, pull up a chair. I've got all the time in the world. The slammer's like my second home. It's really not so bad once ya get used to it. Trucy: He's rather laid back for someone in police custody. Talk About the orb Apollo: Datz, was what the doctor had really the Founder's Orb? Datz: Absolutely positively! The doc was sure of it! Dhurke: Really? Because someone from the village is calling the Crystal of Ami Fey. He also claims you were filling the doctor's head with lies. Datz: That ain't true! The doc said he was sure it was the real deal. All his fancy research confirmed it was the Founder's Orb. Apollo: So then that Paul Atishon character was lying? Imagine that, a politician who lies... Datz: I bet he wants the orb all to himself! Trucy: Hmm... I wonder who's telling the truth? Datz: Well, take a look at this! It proves the doc believed he had the Founder's Orb! Dhurke: Let me see that. \"I agree to hand over the Founder's Orb to the Defiant Dragons... ...if I will come to no harm.\" Signed, Dr. Archie Buff. Datz: See, I got it all down in writing! Dhurke: But Datz... ...why does it say, \"if I will come to no harm\" at the end here? Trucy: Sounds like he was scared of you. Apollo: Datz, did you threaten the doctor in any way? Datz: No, ya got it all wrong! It was the doc's friend! HE told the old man us rebels were dangerous. It's his fault the doc thought I might hurt him! Apollo: Sounds like the work of that politician. He's really made a mess of things. Orb Transfer Agreement added to the Court Record. About the orb (subsequent times) Apollo: Datz, was what the doctor had really the Founder's Orb? Datz: Absolutely positively! The doc was sure of it! Dhurke: Really? Because someone from the village is calling the Crystal of Ami Fey. He also claims you were filling the doctor's head with lies. Datz: That ain't true! The doc said he was sure it was the real deal. All his fancy research confirmed it was the Founder's Orb. Apollo: So then that Paul Atishon character was lying? Imagine that, a politician who lies... Datz: I bet he wants the orb all to himself! Trucy: Hmm... I wonder who's telling the truth? Datz: Well, take a look at this! It proves the doc believed he had the Founder's Orb! Dhurke: Let me see that. \"I agree to hand over the Founder's Orb to the Defiant Dragons... ...if I will come to no harm.\" Signed, Dr. Archie Buff. Datz: See, I got it all down in writing! Dhurke: But Datz... ...why does it say, \"if I will come to no harm\" at the end here? Trucy: Sounds like he was scared of you. Apollo: Datz, did you threaten the doctor in any way? Datz: No, ya got it all wrong! It was the doc's friend! HE told the old man us rebels were dangerous. It's his fault the doc thought I might hurt him! Apollo: Sounds like the work of that politician. He's really made a mess of things. Reason for arrest Dhurke: What have you done now, Datz? Datz: Nothing! I'm innocent, I tell ya! It all started when this dog-faced cop tried to question me! He looked so funny, I started laughing at him. That's when they came after me. But it was hilarious, I tell ya! I mean, a human police dog? How funny is that! Apollo: Right... So what happened after that? Datz: They caught me hiding in a doghouse. Dang pooch ratted me out! I guess that's what I get for laughing at one of his doggy comrades. Apollo: Sounds like the dogs got the last laugh. Dhurke: Datz, weren't you cleared of those jailbreak charges? And your capture by Lady Kee'ra deemed unlawful? Datz: Yeah, but... The cops here don't seem to like me anyway. Apollo: What are the charges this time? Datz: Unauthorized entry, or something like that. They think I'm an illegal alien! And I can't prove otherwise 'cause I lost my passport! Trucy: Is there any way they'd let you go? Datz: Not without my passport... If only I had it! Dhurke, AJ! You gotta find my passport! Apollo: ...All right, we'll find it. (One more thing to add to our to-do list. Now, where might Datz's passport be?) Examine Security camera Apollo: I hate the feeling of being constantly watched. Dhurke: Indeed. Considering my current situation, the less I'm seen, the better. Apollo: Well, it's not like there's an international arrest warrant out for you. Dhurke: True, but I seem to have made quite an international splash with that hijacking stunt. I had to sign a ton of autographs and take a load of selfies before I got to your office. Apollo: Wait, what? Dhurke: Maybe they thought the hijacking was part of some movie's promotion. Guard Apollo: He's completely uninterested in us. Dhurke: That suits me fine. It will only complicate things if I'm recognized. Apollo: Right... You're known as some sort of scary terrorist who fled from Khura'in. Though, in reality, no one would believe you're the real Dhurke of legend anyway. Microphone Apollo: Dhurke, why are you holding that mic? Dhurke: I get this strange urge to speak whenever there's a microphone before me. We, the Defiant Dragons, shall--! Apollo: No, stop! Stop...!!! Present Attorney's Badge Datz: Why, AJ! You've become a fine lawyer in your own right! Apollo: Nah, I still have a lot to learn. Datz: Aw, c'mon, don't be so hard on yourself. If I ever went to trial, I'd definitely want you on my side! Apollo: Knowing you, you'd probably skip town before the trial even started. Founder's Orb or Orb Transfer Agreement Datz: The doc agreed in writing to hand the orb over to me, but he kept stalling, like he didn't trust me or something. Dhurke: That scary mug of yours no doubt frightened him. Datz: Look who's talking! Trucy: Honestly, I think you're both about equally scary looking. Apollo: (Ouch... Both Dhurke and Datz look like they've been stabbed right in the ego.) Anything else Datz: Oh, is that for me!? Apollo: No, I was just showing it to you. Datz: Anything I could use here in the slammer is more than welcome! Apollo: Um, Datz, the guard is giving you some serious side eye. After clearing all Talk options: Datz: Oh! About the orb's whereabouts... Maybe the doc's kid knows something! Apollo: The doctor has a kid? Datz: Yeah... A bit of a shut-in, though. The poor thing's own bedroom has become like a self-imposed prison. Apollo: A shut-in? Sounds like it will be a challenge just to get a conversation going. Guard: Time for your questioning. Follow me. Datz: It must be lunchtime. Today is fried chicken, if I'm not mistaken! Guard: You'll get your lunch IF you behave yourself. Datz: Dhurke, AJ. I'll see ya guys around! Dhurke: Our only lead now is Dr. Buff's kid. But luring a shut-in out is... Apollo: ...Not going to be easy. I know. May 16Kurain Village - Doctor's Study ???: Oh, it's you again. Ema Looking for Mr. Wright? He was just here a second ago. Apollo: He was?! Trucy: What was Daddy doing here? Apollo: Good question. Ema: He said he was looking for something. Apollo: Did he say anything else? Ema: Let me think... Something about how his ride never showed up at the airport. Yes, that was it. Apollo: (I guess Athena really did get lost...) Trucy: But what's Daddy doing all the way out here in the first place? He can't be looking for us since no one told him we'd be here. Apollo: Hmm... Ema: Well, if you're here to take another look around, be my guest. I have other work to do, so if you'll excuse me. Apollo: Of course. Thanks, Ema. Dhurke: First and foremost, we'd better find Datz's passport. We should also have a word with Dr. Buff's child. Trucy: Hey, is it just me... or is there something new in here? Dhurke: ...Oh, you mean that thing? Yeah, we should take a closer look at it, too. Apollo: Let's not forget about Datz's passport. It should be around here somewhere. Examine Suitcase Apollo: Datz's suitcase... Maybe his passport's in there. Trucy: Annggh! It's no good. It's locked tight. Apollo: We should've asked him for the key. Drone Apollo: What's this? A model helicopter? Trucy: Don't you know anything, Apollo? It's a drone! They're all the rage right now. I bet it belongs to the doctor's kid. Dhurke: We need to ask them about the orb's whereabouts. Apollo: Yeah, but luring out a shut-in isn't going to be easy. Any other point of interest Apollo: Nothing new here. Let's go look somewhere else. After examining suitcase and drone: Apollo: What are we going to do about Datz's passport? It's probably right there inside his suitcase, but we can't get it open. Trucy: Why don't I take it over to Datz so he can unlock it? That way, you guys can continue looking for the orb. Apollo: Good thinking, Trucy! Trucy: Okay, here I go! ...Huh? What the...? Hrrgh...! This thing weighs a ton! Apollo: Let me try. ............Jeez, how can a suitcase be so heavy? Is it filled with bricks or something? Dhurke: Knowing Datz, he probably packed his dumbbells in there. It's certainly much too heavy to lug all the way to the detention center. Here, let me take a crack at that lock. Apollo: What, are you going to pick it? *click* *click, click* *click* *click* Dhurke: There you go. Apollo: That was fast. Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha! A lock like that is child's play to me. Especially after all the wrongly imprisoned compatriots I've busted out over the years. Apollo: You've sure seen a lot of action for an ex-lawyer. Dhurke: Aaand here we go. Datz's passport. Trucy: I'll take it over to him. Apollo: Thanks, Trucy. Trucy: No problem! Now you guys enjoy some quality father-son treasure hunting time, okay? See you later! Apollo: (There she goes. I wish she wouldn't make such a big deal out of our little \"family\" situation.) Dhurke: Father-son time, eh? Hmm... Been ages since we've had a father-son talk, huh, son? Apollo: Yeah, well over a decade. Dhurke: So, Apollo, um... how've you been? Apollo: Oh, uh... Fine. I'm fine, I guess. Dhurke: Is that so? Fine, you say? Well, fine is fine by me! Good to hear! Apollo: ...Um, okay. .................. Dhurke: ........................... Apollo: ............ (Umm... So what do we talk about now...?) Dhurke: ...Hm? Get down! Hit the dirt, son! Apollo: Huh? What the--? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! .........Unngh......Oof... ......... Dhurke: Speak to me, son! Say something! Apollo: ......Ooh... Th-that smarts... ???: Youuuu maggots! Whattaya think yer doin', invading Buff airspace?! It'll be a scorching day in Siberia before you get past me, ya yellow-bellied yahoos! Apollo: Whoa! ...It can talk?! What kind of drone is this, anyw... ...AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYY! ???: Drone, nothin'! That's Sergeant Buff to you, soldier! You got that, you lowly grunts?! Apollo: Oww... What the who now...?! Dhurke: Buff? Sounds like the doctor's son is behind the controls. Apollo: He's controlling this thing? Dhurke: Apollo, let's play along for now. At least until we can get the information we need out of him. Apollo: G-Got it. Um... Sergeant Buff? Sarge: Sergeant Buff, sir! You forgot to say, \"sir\"! Ain't you never seen a war movie before?! Apollo: Oh, right. Let me try that again. Sergeant Buff, sir! Sarge: Better. Much better. Now, state your name, unit, and rank, soldier! Apollo: Oh, um, I'm Apollo Justice. I serve at the Wright Anything Agency. And my rank is, um... fledgling lawyer? ...Sir! Sarge: Affirmative, Private Justice. Apollo: P-Private? Sarge: Listen up, diaper baby! Your commanding officer's orders are absolute! Disobedience means a one-way trip to the firing squad! Do I make myself clear?! Apollo: Oh, um... sir! Yes, sir! Sarge: Good, good, we might make a man out of you yet, private! Now for you, Cyclops! Dhurke: Huh? ...Oh, you want my name, unit, and rank, too? Um, I'm Dhurke Sahdmadhi. I command the rebel group the Defiant Dragons, and my rank is... um... leader, sir! Sarge: Excellent! Welcome aboard, Komandir Dhurke! Wait a second! What's with that ridiculous mop you call a head? Soldiers should be clean cut! Dhurke: S-Sorry, but this is my signature look. I'm not going to-- WHOOOOOOOOOA! Fine, fine! I'll get a haircut before we ship out! Sarge: Listen up, you! It's kill-or-be-killed out on that battlefield. No place for leave-in conditioners. All you've got is your life, and you're lucky to have that! Apollo: (He's oddly obsessed with field survival for someone who never goes outdoors...) Dhurke: This is going to be harder than I thought, son. Examine Anything Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Sarge: Don't let me catch you stepping out of line again. Apollo: (...Guess I'd better play along and ask what he wants.) Talk Sergeant Buff Apollo: Um, are you controlling that drone from your room, sir? Sarge: Affirmative! But I can see everything you do from here, so... Teeen-HUT, soldier! Wipe that stupid look off your face! I'm going to whip you sheltered peaceniks into shape! Apollo: (With what? Your \"charming\" personality?) Dhurke: Look, it's got a camera and speakers, too. Sarge: And that's not all, Komandir! With these arms, I can cook and clean, too! Speaking of which... Private Justice! You're on latrine duty! Snap to it, on the double! Apollo: ...*sigh*... As if I don't see enough of the toilet back at the office. Sarge's Drone added to the Court Record. Dhurke: That thing's pretty handy. Us Defiant Dragons could use one of those. Sarge: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Yes, it is a fine piece of hardware, isn't it? I modified it especially for siege defense! Apollo: Siege defense...? You mean how you won't leave your room? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! Sarge: Holing up in a stronghold to defend against an enemy is an age-old military tactic! A timeless strategy still applicable in modern warfare! I hope you're not trying to mock the wisdom of my forefathers! Apollo: I-I... I meant no offense. It was just an observation. Sarge: So the greenhorn who ain't even discharged a firearm's got something to say, does he?! Apollo: S-Sorry, sorry! It won't happen again, sir! Sarge: Darn tootin'. Now, state your intentions, soldier. Sergeant Buff (subsequent times) Apollo: Um, are you controlling that drone from your room, sir? Sarge: Affirmative! But I can see everything you do from here, so... Teeen-HUT, soldier! Wipe that stupid look off your face! I'm going to whip you sheltered peaceniks into shape! Apollo: (With what? Your \"charming\" personality?) Dhurke: Look, it's got a camera and speakers, too. Sarge: And that's not all, Komandir! With these arms, I can cook and clean, too! Speaking of which... Private Justice! You're on latrine duty! Snap to it, on the double! Apollo: ...*sigh*... As if I don't see enough of the toilet back at the office. Dhurke: That thing's pretty handy. Us Defiant Dragons could use one of those. Sarge: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Yes, it is a fine piece of hardware, isn't it? I modified it especially for siege defense! Apollo: Siege defense...? You mean how you won't leave your room? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!!! Sarge: Holing up in a stronghold to defend against an enemy is an age-old military tactic! A timeless strategy still applicable in modern warfare! I hope you're not trying to mock the wisdom of my forefathers! Apollo: I-I... I meant no offense. It was just an observation. Sarge: So the greenhorn who ain't even discharged a firearm's got something to say, does he?! Apollo: S-Sorry, sorry! It won't happen again, sir! Sarge: Darn tootin'. Now, state your intentions, soldier. Location of the orb (appears after \"Sergeant Buff\") Apollo: We had an agreement with your father. He had promised to hand over the Founder's Orb to us. Sarge: What?! Papa promised you that?! Dhurke: He did. But he died before he could tell us where it's hidden. Now we have no idea where it is. Sarge: .................. ...Oh. *sniffle* Apollo: Hm? Sarge: P-Papa... Why...? Why'd you have to die? Dhurke: It was an unfortunate accident. And I'm sorry for your loss. Apollo: If it helps at all, I know how you feel, Sergeant Bu-- AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! What'd I do nowww?! Sarge: Y-You insignificant maggot! What would an unseasoned rookie like you know about how I feel?! First I lost Mama... and now I've lost Papa! Apollo: You lost your mother, too? Sarge: She's been gone for some time now. I'm... I'm all alone now. All alone... *sniffle* Dhurke: ...Sergeant Buff, would you tell us a little more about what happened to your mother? Your mother (appears after \"Location of the orb\") Sarge: Mama passed away about six months ago. We were still living in our apartment in the city. Back then, I had yet to engage in my siege defense strategy. Apollo: (In other words, something caused him to withdraw from the world.) Sarge: ...It was arson. It happened so suddenly... and before we knew it, our apartment was a sea of flames. Mama and I were trapped inside. But help never came. So Mama cradled me in her arms... ...kicked out a window... and jumped! Apollo: She did what?! Sarge: She was like a walkin', talkin' medal of valor, my mama was. She delivered me safely to terra firma with a perfectly executed PLF. It's a five-point landing technique used by paratroopers to land safely on the ground. Apollo: (She sounds like a superhero or something.) Sarge: But from that height, she suffered massive injuries in order to protect me. She... She died so that I could live! AHHHHHHHHHHHH! MAMAAAAAAAAAAAA!!! Apollo: I... I don't know what to say... Dhurke: And the person who started the fire? Sarge: He was immediately apprehended. They say he was standing outside laughing while the building burned. Dhurke: At least justice was served. I hope that brought you some solace. Sarge: I've lost both my parents now. You can't possibly know how I feel! *sniffle* *sob* Mama... Papa... Apollo: (Poor kid. It's hard losing both your parents at such a young age. He must really feel alone now.) Dhurke: Apollo... I imagine you know what he's going through. Apollo: I do? Dhurke: The road to recovery begins by talking to someone who's suffered the same hardship. I know you have something that shows you understand. Present Anything (before clearing \"Your mother\" Talk option) Sarge: What insubordination! Apollo: ARRRRRRAGH! Sarge: Petty trinkets have no place in Buff's army, soldier! Now drop and give me twenty! Apollo: (Sheesh... At least let me show the evidence before you shoot it down...) Photo of My Father (after clearing \"Your mother\" Talk option) Leads to: \"Um, sergeant, sir. Would you please take a look at this?\" Apollo: Um, sergeant, sir. Would you please take a look at this? Sarge: What do we have here? Apollo: It's a photo of my father. I wasn't even a year old when he died... in a fire. Sarge: What?! Dhurke: And like your mother, he died in an arsonist's blaze. But in his final moments, he managed to save his infant son. Sarge: P-Private Justice, you've suffered a loss just like mine. Apollo: I have... And that's why I know how you feel. Sarge: B-But... you still have your mother, don't you?! Apollo: No, I lost her, too. Sarge: What?! Apollo: She disappeared after the fire. I don't know if she's still alive or dead. Heck, I don't even know what she looks like. Sarge: Wow... Dhurke: Sergeant Buff, his experience is very much like your own. If anyone can understand the sadness in your heart, it's him. Sarge: Rrrr... Nnngh... .............................. ATTEEEEEENSHUN!!! I salute you, Comrade Justice! You are no longer a private in the Buff Army! Henceforth, you will be a corporal! Apollo: Corporal? Dhurke: Congratulations on your promotion, Corporal Justice! Apollo: ...I'm just glad that seemed to cheer him up a bit. Sarge: Now, comrade, let's toast to your new stripes! And call me Sarge! Don't be shy! We're a band of brothers now! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Dhurke: Now's our chance, corporal! Ask him about the Founder's Orb. Apollo: (Dhurke's getting waaaaay too much of a kick out of this.) Examine Ladder or bookshelves Apollo: Sarge, sir, do you ever read these books? Sarge: Why, of course! Soldiers must have extensive knowledge, as well as fighting prowess. I'm learning all I can each and every day in preparation for the big battle! Apollo: The big battle? Sarge: Um, you know... for when I go back to school. I'll need to be up to date on every subject. Stuff like... y'know, the latest comics and Hollywood gossip... Apollo: Oh, I see... (What about reading, writing and arithmetic?) Well, I'm rooting for you, Sarge! Sarge: Th-Thanks. I'll try my best. Computer Apollo: This computer could provide some useful information. Drat. It's password protected. Dhurke, you're good at getting into places you're not supposed to. Dhurke: Don't look at me. I don't know the first thing about computers. Sarge: Ha ha ha ha ha! Leave it to me! A modern day warrior must be well-versed in technology... and have a mean, mean pride! After all, he who controls information, controls the battlefield! *click clack click clack click clack* Sarge: Aaaaand I'm in! Apollo: Looks like modern day warriors have mean, mean keyboard skills, too. Dhurke: Okay, let's see what we can find. *click clack click clack click clack* Dhurke: Oh, what's this...? An e-mail message? Now this is interesting. It's a research report to whoever asked the doctor to study the orb. Sarge: Here, I put the data on this! Take it and use it well, soldier! E-Mail added to the Court Record. Computer (subsequent times) Apollo: The doctor's computer. It contains an e-mail detailing the progress of his research. Dhurke: I wonder who he prepared the report for. Glasses Apollo: Are these the doctor's? Sarge: Yes, those are Papa's reading glasses. He said he'd been having trouble reading lately. But those glasses seemed to help. Dhurke: Reading glasses, eh? I'll just hold on to these. Apollo: ...Dhurke. Don't tell me you're having trouble reading, too? Dhurke: Perish the thought! ...I-I just don't want to leave any stone unturned. Doctor's Reading Glasses added to the Court Record. Raincoat Apollo: It's a raincoat... Hm...? It's a bit wet, and there's fresh mud on it... That must mean someone wore it recently. Dhurke: Indeed. Maybe even as recently as last night. Apollo: Sarge, did it rain here last night? Sarge: Negative. There wasn't a cloud in the sky. Apollo: Hmm... Then how did this raincoat get all muddy and wet? Sarge: When I saw it last evening, it looked pretty clean and dry to me. Apollo: That means it got like this later at night. Dhurke: Good eye, son. This may very well turn out to be a vital clue. Raincoat added to the Court Record. Raincoat (subsquent times) Apollo: It's a raincoat... Hm...? It's a bit wet, and there's fresh mud on it... That must mean someone wore it recently. Dhurke: Indeed. Maybe even as recently as last night. Apollo: Sarge, did it rain here last night? Sarge: Negative. There wasn't a cloud in the sky. Apollo: Hmm... Then how did this raincoat get all muddy and wet? Sarge: When I saw it last evening, it looked pretty clean and dry to me. Apollo: That means it got like this later at night. Dhurke: Good eye, son. This may very well turn out to be a vital clue. Statue EX-TER-MI-NATE. EX-TER-MI-NATE. DES-TROY ALL HU-MANS. Apollo: What's this thing's problem...? Sarge: It's an OOPArt -- an our-of-place artifact. Papa won it in an online auction. Apollo: An online auction? Sarge: Yes, he said it's an alien weapon that destroyed an entire ancient civilization. Apollo: (...Where do I even start with an explanation like that?) Sacred Urn Apollo: This urn with \"Ami\" painted on it looks really old. But I don't think it's going to provide any info we need. Spiral staircase Apollo: Is your room upstairs, Sarge? Sarge: Yes, it's the one at the end of the hall. Dhurke: What do you say you come out, so we can enjoy a snack together? Sarge: B-But... Dhurke: I promise we won't bite! Sarge: ...............If you insist... ...then I'm not going to talk to you anymore! Dhurke: No, wait! Apollo: Dhurke, you'd better apologize quick. Dhurke: ...I'm sorry for pushing. Sarge: V-Very well. As long as you don't do it again, I'll let it slide this one time. Suitcase Apollo: It's Datz's suitcase. It's full of survival gear and questionable souvenirs. But we already got his passport, so we can leave it be for now. Shoe shelves Apollo: It's a shoe cubby. Hmm, these shoes look like they belong to Sarge and his dad. ...Ah, these boots here are a little damp! Dhurke: And it looks like there's something inside this one. Apollo: Maybe Doctor Buff wore them last night. Dhurke: They might lead us to where he hid the orb. Let's take a closer look. Examine outsole Apollo: There's a question mark on the bottom of this boot. Sarge: Papa had those custom-made for his archeological fieldwork. He had the soul of an adventurer. Dhurke: This boot had the \"sole\" of an adventurer, too. Examine residue on insole (before examining hook-and-loop fastener straps) Apollo: Something's giving off a soft glow inside this boot. But it's too dark in there to see what it is. Examine hook-and-loop fastener straps Apollo: We might get a better look inside if we undid these straps. Examine residue on insole (after examining hook-and-loop fastener straps) Leads to: \"It looks like some kind of glowing moss.\" Apollo: It looks like some kind of glowing moss. Dhurke: It could've come from wherever the doctor went last night. Must've gotten in with some of that mud. Apollo: It might be worth looking into... ...if it'll help us pinpoint where the doctor hid the orb. Glowing Moss added to the Court Record. Shoe shelves (subsequent times) Apollo: There's some glowing moss inside this boot. Dhurke: I'm willing to bet it got there from wherever the doctor went last night. Talk Location of the orb Apollo: Sarge, sir. Do you have any idea where the orb might be? Sarge: It was here in Papa's study until last night. But he said he was going to go hide it somewhere. He mentioned something about a shady character being after it. Apollo: Where do you think he could've hidden it? Sarge: Hmm... Somewhere in the village, I'd guess. He said he'd found a suitable hiding place for it. Apollo: So, it was here last night. That is, until he went out to hide it somewhere in the village. The only question is where? Dhurke: Maybe he left some clue here in his study. Let's search the place again. Apollo: (We should also find out more about Dr. Buff. It might steer us toward the hiding place.) Doctor Buff (appears after \"Location of the orb\") Apollo: So, Sarge, what was your father like? Sarge: Papa was as king as Mama was courageous. His whole reason for moving to the countryside was for me. Apollo: What do you mean? Sarge: I initiated my siege defense strategy after Mama died. Papa was so worried about me, he moved us here to the countryside. He thought the fresh air, blue skies, and natural surroundings might alter my tactics. Dhurke: What a fine father. Sarge: He even quit his position at the university to move here. Apollo: He did? Sarge: He did. He gave up his beloved research position just for me! \"A parent must be prepared to sacrifice everything for his child.\" That's what Papa said! Dhurke: ...Well, I'm feeling about two inches tall right now. Sarge: There's no one in the world I respected more than him. But that just makes his passing all the more devastating. *sniffle, sniffle* Papa, may you continue your beloved research up there with the angels! Present Attorney's Badge Sarge: What's that? Apollo: It's my attorney's badge, sir! Sarge: You mean like a medal?! What act of valor earned you such an honor? Apollo: I rescued my clients from those who would brand them as guilty, sir! Sarge: A heroic act, indeed! Apollo: Thank you for your kind words, sir! (This whole \"sir\" thing is getting real old, real quick.) Photo of My Father Sarge: Corporal Justice... you shoulder a bitter past. Apollo: You've been through quite a lot yourself, Sarge. Sarge: ...Corporal, if I may... um... Apollo: Yes? Sarge: ...Well... um... it doesn't have to be that often, but... W-W-Would you mind coming over from time to time? Apollo: You want me to visit you? Sarge: O-Only if you want to, of course! Apollo: ...Sure. I'll come by, and I'll even bring along my coworkers, Sarge. Sarge: R-Really?! Yaaaaaay! Our band of  brothers continues to grow in rank! Ha ha ha ha! Dhurke: ...Nice work, son. Glad to see you haven't changed one bit. Apollo: (What's that supposed to mean?) Study Photo or Research Notes Sarge: Why...? Why did Papa have to fall in battle? Apollo: (He's putting on a brave face, but he's still just a child.) Sarge: In honor of Papa's heroic sacrifice...  let us march on, comrade! To victory! Apollo: Huh?! I-I mean, sir! Yes, sir! Dhurke: Are you two seriously bent on waging war against that bookcase? Sarge's Drone Apollo: It looks like you can do everything by yourself. Sarge: Indeed! I can even cook and build things whenever I want! Apollo: So there's really no reason for you to leave your room, huh. Sarge: Yes, but there is still one gaping hole in my siege defense. ...Going to the bathroom. Apollo: When nature calls, it's best not to fight it. Sarge: Yes, all great tacticians will say never wage a battle you have no hope of winning. Anything else Apollo: Please take a look at this. Sarge: Let me ask you something, Corporal Justice! How does that aid you on the battlefield?! Apollo: Um, well, if you count the courtroom as a battlefield, it's a fairly useful weapon. Sarge: Good answer! A military man must know his weapons inside and out! Keep up the good work, corporal! Apollo: S-Sir, yes, sir! (I guess that's all he has to say about that.) After clearing \"Doctor Buff\" Talk option and examining computer, glasses, raincoat, and shoe shelves: Apollo: Okay, let's go over what we've learned so far. Wherever it was that Dr. Buff went, he needed a raincoat. And it was somewhere where this glowing moss grows. Any ideas where that might be, Sarge? Sarge: Negative, comrade. I hate to say my intel's a little thin on this one. I've been occupied with my siege defense strategy ever since we moved to the village. Dhurke: Well, son, it seems we have no other choice. We'll have to ask the locals if they know of a place like that. Wright Anything Agency Trucy: Ah! Apollo, Mr. Dhurke! Did you have some quality father-son time together? Talk Any ideas? Dhurke: That poor child... How is he going to survive all on his own? Apollo: Yeah, it's not like he can go out grocery shopping on his own. We should drop off some food later. Dhurke: No, that would only make it worse. We should be encouraging him to come out on his own. Once his food runs out, he'll have to leave the house if he wants to eat. Apollo: Talk about your old-school siege tactics. Sounds more like you want to starve him out... What to do Apollo: Um... Dhurke: Yes? What is it? Apollo: ............ Dhurke: ............ Apollo: (Talk about an awkward silence. I have no idea what to say.) ............ (Yeah... I've got nothing.) Dhurke: Aw, come on, son! Don't tell me you've got nothing! May 16Kurain Village Apollo: Ugh. It feels like somebody's watching me, and it's really creeping me out. Oh, it's just Paul Atishon's campaign posters. When did he put these up? (Whatever. I've got more important things to be paying attention to.) Dhurke: What great weather! It really lifts the spirits. I know! After our little treasure hunt, what do you say we go hunting, son? Apollo: Hunting? We used to do that a lot... didn't we? Dhurke: Just look at that mountain. I bet there are some feisty wild boars up there! Apollo: I... think I'll pass... but thanks. Dhurke: Oh, so hunting's a no-go. Um, well... I guess that wild boar stew will have to wait, then. .........Hm? Apollo, something seems different from the last time we were here. Apollo: Uh... You mean the posters? Dhurke: No, not those. Apollo: (What's he talking about...? Guess I should take a look around myself.) Examine Paul Atishon campaign posters Apollo: When did Paul Atishon have a chance to put up all these election posters? Old Man: That fool keeps stickin' 'em on our houses! He's a disgrace to his distinguished heritage! Apollo: He's doing this without permission? Fey Manor Apollo: A thatched roof... First time I've ever seen one in real life. Dhurke: It looks just like the traditional thatched roofs they use in Japan. All we need now are some samurai with topknots, a few ninjas, and a cuddly mascot. Apollo: When was the last time you were in Japan? Bus stop Apollo: (A phone booth and a bus stop made of wood. They both look really old. You hardly ever see phone booths in the city anymore.) Dhurke: Apollo... what's this glass box for? Apollo: (I guess you hardly see them in Khura'in, too.) Mountains Dhurke: Seeing those mountains really takes me back. I remember when we used to live high in the mountains to escape from the government. Apollo: So, you don't live there anymore? Dhurke: Nope. I needed a more convenient place to lead the revolution from. But that old mountain hut is still there. Apollo: (Man, I miss that hut...) Dhurke: What, are you getting homesick, Apollo? You can come on back to Khura'in anytime, you know? Apollo: N-No, no, I'm fine. Besides, I've got a lot on my plate here... Kurain Boulder Apollo: There's a big boulder towering into the sky over there. According to the sign, it's called the \"Kurain Boulder.\" It also says that a spirit dwells within it. Hmm... A rock with a spirit in it? Dhurke: It's called animism -- the belief that spirits dwell within inanimate objects. They've probably enshrined this boulder as a sacred object. Their tradition of worshipping such objects is similar to our tradition in Khura'in. Apollo: I-Interesting... (Who knew Dhurke could make sense every once in a while?) Canvas Leads to: \"What do we have here?\" Apollo: What do we have here? It looks like an unfinished picture... like something a little kid might paint. Dhurke: Hmm, you're right. But I can't quite tell what it's of. Apollo: I think it's supposed to be nighttime, but what's that thing on the left? Dhurke: Um... A monster, or some kind of alien, perhaps? In any case, it's a pretty poor excuse for a drawing. Apollo: Well, what did you expect from a little kid? ???: A... little kid...? Apollo: Huh? Oh, it's you, Pearl! Pearl: Why, Mr. Apollo, is that you? What a pleasant surprise! It's been quite some time. How have you been? Apollo: Fine, thanks. You're looking good, too, Pearl. Dhurke: Aren't you going to introduce me, son? Apollo: Of course. This is Pearl Fey. She's a spirit medium here in Kurain Village. Pearl, this is Dhurke, my umm... client. Pearl: Hello, sir. Pleased to meet you. If there is anything I can do to help, please let me know. Dhurke: Nice to meet you, too. And what a polite little girl you are! Pearl: ...Um, actually... I'm a high schooler. Dhurke: Whoops! Sorry about that! So, you're a spirit medium? Does that mean you can channel spirits, then? Pearl: Yes. I'm still in training, though. But I'm well-versed in the art of spirit channeling. Dhurke: Well now, isn't that something! I mean, back in my country, our little princess hasn't channeled a single spirit yet! Pretty impressive, young lady! Pearl: Oh, but compared to Mystic Maya, there is so much more I must learn! Apollo: Mystic Maya? Oh, right, Maya Fey... Mr. Wright's former courtroom assistant. He told me all about her. She's a spirit medium, too, if memory serves. Pearl: Yes, she's an amazing medium. And soon, she'll be the next lead of the Fey clan, too! Apollo: (Mediums and spirit channeling... I've heard all about it from Mr. Wright. He said that mediums will even physically become the person they're channeling. I wonder if even little Pearl would turn into a hulking giant if she hand to channel one...) Pearl: I hope you don't mind me asking, but what brings you all the way out here, Mr. Apollo? Apollo: Oh, just a small matter to take care of. Pearl: ...Wait, would it happen to be the matter Mr. Edgeworth is looking into? Apollo: Prosecutor Edgeworth? What's he doing here? Pearl: Oh, so it's a different matter, then? Because I just saw him a moment ago. He appeared to be searching for something. Apollo: Oh? Hmm... (Mr. Edgeworth is a friend of Mr. Wright's, and the district's chief prosecutor. Why would HE be here in Kurain? Well, no point obsessing over it.) Come to think of it, you live here in Kurain Village, don't you, Pearl? Pearl: Yes, I was born and raised here. Dhurke: This is perfect, Apollo. Let's ask the young lady if she knows where the doctor might have gone last night. Apollo: I was thinking the exact same thing. (Maybe I should show her what we found in the doctor's study.) Examine Paul Atishon campaign posters Pearl: Honestly! Why does he keep putting these up? And on people's houses, no less! Apollo: That's got to violate some campaigning law or something... Here, Pearl, I'll help you take them down. Apollo: Whew... Why did he have to put up so many... Pearl: Yeah... And it won't be long before he puts more up. It's really driving me crazy. Dhurke: Why don't you scribble something on them? You know, just some harmless graffiti? Pearl: ...Actually, that's just what I was thinking when I was sketching. Apollo: ...Why don't you join us for lunch at the office sometime? It'll get you away from all this. House Pearl: This is Fey Manor. Mystic Maya lives here. I hope she's doing well... Apollo: (Oh right. Ms. Fey's off studying and training in Khura'in.) Mountains Apollo: There's a lush, green mountain in the distance there. Pearl: It's home to a variety of animals. They sometimes come down to the village. I've seen foxes, badgers, and even bears. Apollo: B-Bears? Dhurke: Well, one would certainly never go hungry around here. Pearl: The poor animals! They are not for hunting or eating! Understand?! Dhurke: But badger and bear meat are so good... Canvas Dhurke: This picture looks like something you might've painted when you were little, son. Apollo: I think I would've done a little better than this. Pearl: ......... Canvas (after perceiving) Apollo: On closer inspection, there's more to this picture than meets the eye. Dhurke: Son, didn't you ever learn that honesty is the best policy? Apollo: Way to go, Dhurke! I was trying to get us out of the hole we dug ourselves into earlier! Talk Kurain Village Dhurke: What a peaceful place. Ahh... Nothing beats mountain air. Pearl: Many of the villagers have left for the city, but I just love it here. Blue skies, lush forests, star-filled skies at night, and fireflies in the summer. Plus, the big, beautiful, blue ocean is just beyond that mountain! Dhurke: The ocean?! What do you say we go for a swim, son? Apollo: ...Oh, um... I think I'll pass. (Besides, I can't swim.) ...Um, Pearl? Kurain Village is like, \"the home of spirit mediums,\" right? Pearl: Yes, and I'm a part of a long line of mediums. Apollo: I've never seen a channeling before, but... ...is it possible to channel the spirit of anyone who's passed away? Pearl: No, not just anyone. You must know their face and true name. Apollo: Really? You can channel a spirit just by knowing their face and name? That's an amazing ability. Pearl: It is, but it can only be learned by those with a gift occurring in certain bloodlines... ...and years of intense training. At present, Mystic Maya and I are the only ones in our village who can channel spirits. Dhurke: Looks like spirit mediums are highly valued here, much like they are back in Khura'in. Pearl: I heard there used to be many more of us a long time ago... ...but now, we are in very short supply. Most of the women nowadays don't want to stay; they want the thrill of the big city. Apollo: Yeah, well, you guys aren't exactly close to any shopping malls or nightclubs out here. But what about you? Are you NOT interested in things like that? Pearl: W-Who, me? Well, I... I wouldn't mind a new outfit or two, and, well... Oh, never mind. Apollo: It's okay, Pearl. You are at that age, after all. Paul Atishon (appears after \"Kurain Village\") Apollo: Oh! We met this weirdo earlier named Paul Atishon. Do you know anything about him? Pearl: Yes, he's been campaigning a lot around here lately. And the noise he's been making has become quite a problem. People are especially upset that he's campaigning at all hours of the night and day. Dhurke: Hmm, well... The local police should arrest him for disturbing the peace. Pearl: Unfortunately, there's little they can do because the Atishon family is so powerful. Apollo: (...Well, isn't HE the proverbial pampered provincial prince.) He seems pretty intent on winning here in Kurain. Is there some special reason why? Pearl: I'm not sure, but I have an idea. The spirit mediums of Kurain once held considerable sway in the political world. Judging by his slogan, maybe that's what he's after. Apollo: Great, so he's just another politician seeking powerful connections... Dhurke: The ability to commune with the dead gives comfort to those anxious about the future. Tiny Khura'in has preserved its independence by the queen's power of spirit channeling. It must play a similar role in this village. Pearl: Yes. Even today, many here revere those with spirit medium blood flowing in their veins. Apollo: So basically, as Paul Atishon's benefactor goes, so goes the whole village? (Who is this benefactor? Who could hold this much sway over Kurain Village?) Where the doctor went (appears after presenting Glowing Moss) Apollo: Pearl... Do you have any idea where Dr. Buff might've gone last night? Pearl: Umm... Well... Apollo: ......... Pearl: ...Uhh, about that... ...All I know is Dr. Buff was somewhere on Mt. Mitama. BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: ...! (My bracelet...! It's reacting! Which means Pearl is hiding something from me.) Present Bracelet Pearl: All I know is Dr. Buff was somewhere on Mt. Mitama. Percieve twitching left thumb on \"Mt. Mitama.\" Apollo: Apollo: Pearl, you seem anxious around the topic of Mt. Mitama. I could tell because you'd rub your thumb over a splotch of dried paint as you said it. Pearl: Oh! U-Um, well...! Apollo: That nighttime painting is yours, isn't it? Pearl: .........! ...This is so embarrassing. As you saw, I'm not a very good artist. But that picture has nothing to do with Dr. Buff! Apollo: I'm not so sure about that. In fact, I'm going to guess that while you were out here painting last night... ...you actually saw the good doctor heading out to Mt. Mitama from the bus stop. Pearl: N-No! I-I didn't see anything like that! I swear! Apollo: ...No, I'm positive you saw the doctor. After all, he's right here in your picture. Present human-like figure Apollo: Leads to: \"Y-You think that's the doctor?\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: See? Isn't the doctor right there? Pearl: Really? That doesn't look like him to me. Apollo: Well, I guess it IS pretty abstract. Pearl: Oh... Is it really that hard to make out? Er, what I mean is, it has nothing to do with Dr. Buff! After all, I never even saw him that night! Leads back to: \"...No, I'm positive you saw the doctor. After all, he's right here in your picture.\" Pearl: Y-You think that's the doctor? I may not be a very good artist, but at least I know how to draw a person! Apollo: Okay, if this isn't a person, then what is it? Pearl: Er... Th-That's a... a rain spirit! Apollo: ......... Pearl: .................. Apollo: ...Um, and what's a rain spirit doing at a bus stop? Pearl: Oh, umm, rain spirits have places to go, too! Apollo: ........ (This is getting ridiculous.) Sorry, Pearl, but you're not a very good liar. That is Dr. Buff, and this piece of evidence proves it! Present Raincoat Apollo: Leads to: \"This is the raincoat we found in the doctor's study.\" Present anything else Apollo: Pearl: The only thing I'm guilty of is being a terrible artist. But you're taking advantage of that to claim the picture is something it's not! Apollo: N-No no, it's... (...totally like that, but...) Pearl: That isn't a person! It's a rain spirit, I tell you! Apollo: No, Pearl, that isn't a rain spirit. Leads back to: \"That is Dr. Buff, and this piece of evidence proves it!\" Apollo: This is the raincoat we found in the doctor's study. It's still wet and muddy, so we know that someone wore it last night. Now, let's see how this pattern is the same as the \"rain spirit\" in your picture? Pearl: ...Ah! Apollo: You didn't see a rain spirit last night. You saw Dr. Buff wearing this raincoat! Pearl: Ah! ...I... I'm sorry. I know I'm not supposed to lie, but... Leads back to Talk options Percieve wrong area Apollo: Apollo: Pearl, you seem uneasy about something. Pearl: Anyone would feel uneasy being stared at like that! Apollo: Huh? But I...! Dhurke: I'd be unnerved, too. I mean, your eyes are practically popping out of your head. Apollo: I-I get it. I'll tone it down a little. (Guess I was wrong.) Leads back to Talk options Where the doctor went (after perceiving) Pearl: I'm sorry I didn't tell you before, Mr. Apollo, but I did see the doctor last night. Apollo: It's all right. Just, please, tell me everything you know. Pearl: ...Of course. I was painting out here last night... when the doctor came up to the bus stop. He was wearing a raincoat, even though it wasn't raining, and a helmet with a light on it. Apollo: Sounds like he was well-prepared for something. Pearl: I know. That's why I asked him if he was going off exploring again. He looked startled, like he hadn't noticed me there. And then, he suddenly said... \"Please don't tell anyone you saw me here.\" Apollo: Why would he want to silence you like that? Dhurke: Something must've happened to spook him. And he didn't want anyone to know where he was going to hide the orb. Apollo: But where could he have been going dressed like that? Pearl: My best guess is a cave somewhere on Mt. Mitama. I heard there's a cave there where mediums of the Kurain tradition went to train long ago. Legend has it, there are some sort of mystical ruins in there. Apollo: Mystical ruins? Sounds like the exact sort of place an archeologist might go. Present Attorney's Badge Pearl: Hee hee. Seeing you present your badge like that... ...reminds me of when I used to investigate cases alongside Mr. Nick. Apollo: You used to help Mr. Wright all the time, I hear. Pearl: That I did! Doing so helped me expand mu horizons beyond this tiny little village. So please, Mr. Apollo! If there's anything I can help you with, you just let me know! Apollo: I will. (What I'd really like is her help with cleaning the office again.) Glowing Moss Apollo: Pearl, do you have any idea where this moss might grow? Pearl: That looks like... Mitama Moss. It grows on Mt. Mitama, and gives off a soft glow in the dark. Apollo: Mt. Mitama? Pearl: See that mountain over there? That's Mt. Mitama. Dhurke: And how would one get there? Pearl: You can take a bus from that bus stop over there. ...Um, may I ask why you're so interested in that moss? Apollo: Well, Dr. Buff was supposed to give us something. But it seems he hid it somewhere last night. Pearl: H-He did? Maybe that's why he, um... Apollo: Pearl? Do you know something that might help us? Pearl: Um, well... Apollo: (Sounds like I'd better find out what she knows.) Anything else Pearl: Oh, um... Sorry, I wish I could help, but... Apollo: No, don't worry about it! I'm sorry I wasted your time like that. Pearl: Um... At least let me offer you some tea. I mean, you must be tired from all your investigating. Pearl: Oh, no, you don't have to do that. We'll be just fine, thank you. (She's so polite, it's hard NOT to feel rude around her.) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: Well, we should get going now, but thanks for all your help, Pearl. Pearl: You're welcome, Mr. Apollo. Please take care. Dhurke: What do you say we go find that cave, son? I sense that the orb might finally be within our grasp. Apollo: This treasure hunt is shaping up to be the real deal. Dhurke: Hah hah hah. Really gets the blood pumping, doesn't it?! Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go! May 16Mt. Mitama - Cave Entrance Apollo: Whew, I'm all out of breath. Dhurke: Aw, come on, that was nothing. And you're so much younger than me. Apollo: I, uh... *huff* *puff* ...don't normally get this much exercise... *cough* *sputter* Dhurke: Need a break? Apollo: N-No, I'm fine. *huff* *puff* Dhurke! Look! There's Mitama Moss growing in that cave over there. Dhurke: This must be where the doctor was last night. Let's take a look inside. May 16Mt. Mitama - Cave Apollo: ............ I can't see a thing. Dhurke: Relax. Your eyes will adjust eventually. Now, follow me. Apollo: I-I really think we need a flashlight, Dhurke. Dhurke: Should've brought one along then, son. ???: ...Here, use mine. Apollo: Thanks! Wait, were you holding out on me? Dhurke: Um... who are you talking to, Apollo? Apollo: ...You...? Whoa! (Someone just pushed me!) Dhurke: Apollo? What the--?! Apollo! Ah... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Apollo: Oww... Dhurke: Are you all right, son? Apollo: Y-Yeah... Looks like someone got the drop on us. Dhurke: Quite literally. Apollo: But who--? I mean, we could've died from that fall! Dhurke: I don't know... Hmm... But I don't think we'll be getting out the way we came in. Looks like we're in a pretty deep cave. Nothing to do but press on, son. Apollo: How can you even see in here? Dhurke: ...Come on, let's go. Apollo: H-Hey, wait! (One false step and we're dead... What in the world should we do...?) Wait here Apollo: How about we wait for help to come? Dhurke: And how are we to call for said help, hmm? Apollo: With my phone, obviously. I'll just-- Argh...! Of course we're in a dead zone... *sigh* Dhurke: Guess that's that. Apollo: (Just great...) Leads back to: \"What in the world should we do...?\" Go forward Leads to: \"I guess we keep going.\" Climb back up Apollo: Let's try climbing back up. Dhurke: Can you even see the wall in front of you? Apollo: ...No... Dhurke: Well, I can tell you it's far too steep. Apollo: You never know until you try! Here goes nothing! Hrrrgh... Annngh... Dhurke: Your loud voice may move mountains... ...but you've barely moved an inch, son. Apollo: (Argh!) Leads back to: \"What in the world should we do...?\" Apollo: I guess we keep going. There must've been some path for Dr. Buff to follow when he came to hide the orb. Dhurke: Right. By the way, it looks like our attacker left us with this useful parting gift. Apollo: From lawyer to spelunker... How do I always get myself into these situations...? We're never going to make it out alive, I hope you know. Dhurke: Don't tell me you're scared, son. We're just getting started. The greatest treasures are only ever found at the point of a blade, or the edge of a cliff. Apollo: Yeah, sure... If I'd known I'd wind up at the bottom of some dark, damp cave... ...I would've never taken your request, Dhurke. Dhurke: Save your breath, Apollo. Just keep putting one foot ahead of the other. Apollo: There'd really better be a way out of here. Dhurke: We'll find one before you know it. You'll see. .................................................................. May 16Mt. Mitama - Cave Apollo: *huff* *puff* We've been walking for over an hour. It's like a maze in here. I couldn't go back to where we started if I wanted to. Dhurke: Y-Yeah... This cave goes deeper than I thought. Apollo: Wait, don't tell me there really is no way out... Dhurke: ...Where there's a will, there's a way. Apollo: Ever the optimist, aren't you... (Maybe we should cut our losses while we still can...) Forge ahead Leads to: \"Even if we were to turn back, we wouldn't make it up that wall of solid rock.\" Turn back Apollo: I seriously think we're going to get completely turned around if we go any further, Dhurke. I mean, we don't even know if there's a way out up ahead. Dhurke: But we DO know we can't climb up that wall. Apollo: Yeah, but... Dhurke: I still know the way back from here. Don't worry, son. We can always go back there any time we want. Apollo: I-If you say so. (Famous last words if I've ever heard some...) Leads back to: \"Maybe we should cut our losses while we still can...\" Put my foot down Apollo: I'm not taking another step, Dhurke! Dhurke: Come on, now... Be reasonable... Apollo: No! I'm done, and that's final. Dhurke: I remember when you used to throw tantrums like this. Apollo: W-Well, I'm not a child anymore! Dhurke: There, there! It's okay. Daddy'll buy anything you want once we get home, son. Apollo: (...I'd better quit while I still have some manhood left to salvage... But it doesn't seem like Dhurke's about to quit any time soon. Even still...) Leads back to: \"Maybe we should cut our losses while we still can...\" Apollo: (Even if we were to turn back, we wouldn't make it up that wall of solid rock. So, I guess we keep going.) ............*sigh* How did I get stuck wandering around in a dark cave again? It's definitely not in my job description. Dhurke: Heh heh. Listen, son. Only the truly accomplished have the luxury of being so choosy. When I was just starting out, I did everything from street performing to yak milking. Apollo: And... that helped you become an accomplished attorney, how? Dhurke: It didn't. But when you need to make a living, you'll take on any job just to survive. ...Say, how IS your career going, by the way? Apollo: Well, it's been a harrowing adventure so far, to say the least. My first trial really put me through the wringer. And my next case had me investigating a pair of stolen panties. And just when I was hitting my stride, this one prosecutor branded me as \"Herr Forehead.\" Oh, and there's this other, ridiculous prosecutor who wields a samurai sword. Dhurke: ...Sounds like you've, um... seen quite a bit. Apollo: You're telling me. Dhurke: ...Listen, Apollo... I'm, uh, I'm sorry I didn't contact you for so long. Apollo: ............It's fine, Dhurke. What happened, happened. Dhurke: ...Hm? Careful, the ground doesn't feel as solid here. Apollo: What? Yikes! The cave floor's collapsing! Dhurke: Argh! Not agaaaain! Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHH! May 16??? ???: Hey, Apollo. Can you hear me? Apollo: ...Unngh. (.........Dhurke?) Huh? Where are we? Whoa! What is this place?! Dhurke: I was shocked, too. These ruins look really old. Apollo: It's not exactly something you'd expect to find in the middle of a cave system, that's for sure. Maybe the doctor hid the orb here? I mean, those look like footprints over there. Dhurke: Son, I think our little adventure is about to pay dividends! Time to find that orb! Examine Plastic bottle Apollo: What's a plastic bottle doing here? Dhurke: There's seaweed stuck to it, which means it probably came from the ocean. Hmm... It's possible this cavern is connected to the sea somehow. Driftwood Apollo: Driftwood? How'd that get in here? Dhurke: By drifting on in, I'd assume. The only question is, from where? Cavern wall near stone altar Apollo: So that's the hole we fell through. Doesn't look like we'll be going back that way. We're lucky we survived the fall from way up there. Dhurke: Indeed. If that hole hadn't been above the lake, we'd be history. You passed out the moment you hit the water. Apollo: Yeah, well, water's not really my thing. Dhurke: Hmm, this cavern is solid rock all around. Looks like we either go back through that hole... ...or find some other way out. Apollo: Ugh. Why am I always between a rock and a hard place? Stone altar Apollo: It's a big stone altar. One false move, and some god might come and smite us. Dhurke: Oh, come on. It's not all doom and gloom. Apollo: ...I dare you to look at our surroundings and say that again, Dhurke. Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! You've got me there, son. Apollo: (Dear gods, please smite me now.) Water Apollo: This lake looks really deep. I can't even see the bottom. (A bottomless lake in the depths of a mountain cave system. My blood runs cold at the thought of falling in there.) Dhurke: The water... It's salty. This lake may very well lead to the ocean. Apollo: Didn't Pearl mention something about the ocean? ...Like how it's on the other side of the mountain? Can't imagine she meant it literally. Footprints Apollo: These have gotta be the doctor's footprints. They match the bottoms of the boots we saw in his study. Dhurke: So he made it all the way down here. Hmm... The water's washed and most of them away, but his footprints are everywhere. Apollo: Really? 'Cause these are the only sets I see. Dhurke: He must've been looking for something. ...Ah. Those prints... They're coming out of that lake. Apollo: Hey, you're right. But that would mean Dr. Buff came walking out of the water. Box on altar Apollo: This box looks pretty new. I'm guessing... the doctor's the one who brought it down here. Dhurke: It's no good. It's locked tight. Apollo: There's no way to open it? Dhurke: Doesn't look like it. There isn't even a keyhole. Which means... there must be a trick to opening it. We'll have to figure it out if we want to see what's inside. Talk Any ideas? Apollo: I wonder what this place was for before it was... well, ruins. Dhurke: I'm guessing it was a place for spirit mediums to perform their rites. But earthquakes and the changing landscape eventually buried it. Apollo: If you're right, that would mean that it hasn't been used in ages. After examining cavern wall near stone altar, water, footprints, and box on altar: Dhurke: Let's sum up what we know so far. The orb is almost definitely inside this box contraption that we can't open. As for this cave, there doesn't seem to be any way out. Apollo: Nnrgh... We're THIS close to the orb... Dhurke: Aww, come now, son. Don't be like that. It's just a bit of bad luck. That's all. Apollo: A bit? Murphy called. He wants his law back. Dhurke: What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger, right? Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (How can he laugh at a time like this?) Dhurke: We're stuck here for now, so we might as well try to open this thing. Apollo: Okay, let's see what we're dealing with. Examine button Apollo: There's a big button here. ...Huh. Nothing happened. Examine pictures Apollo: This thing is covered with pictures. And, hey! Each section also rotates! Dhurke: Take a look at this, son. See the picture of a dragon battling a tiger? And this green and purple one... ...is of a Khura'inese butterfly and a mitamah. Apollo: ...I wonder if they're clues for figuring out how to open this box. After examining button and pictures: Dhurke: It appears this box uses a picture-based combination lock. We'll have to arrange the pictures on each side in the correct sequence. Apollo: Let's see... There's the dragon and tiger fight, a Khura'inese butterfly with a mitamah... Dhurke: ...And a number of pictures, too. Apollo: Dhurke, I was thinking... Maybe we should check the evidence we've collected so far. I think we have something that just might help us open it. Dhurke: You read my mind, son. Apollo: I think this will help us open the puzzle box. Present Research Notes Apollo: Leads to: \"Dr. Buff's research notes mention the Song of Ceremony.\" Present anything else Apollo: Dhurke: I don't see how that would help us. Apollo: Really? (Guess that wasn't it.) Dhurke: There's a dragon and tiger fighting, and a Khura'inese butterfly with a mitamah. We've gotta have something related to those things, don't we? Apollo: Hmm... Leads back to: \"I think this will help us open the puzzle box.\" Apollo: Dr. Buff's research notes mention the Song of Ceremony. Maybe its lyrics and the pictures on the box correspond somehow. Dhurke: I think you're on to something, son. Apollo: Okay, let's give it a shot. Each dial has six pictures... ...and there are four dials in all. The box should open once the pictures are arranged in the right order. Funky puzzle box... here comes Justice! Input tiger and dragon picture on top row, Khura'inese butterfly and mitamah picture on middle-top row, praying people and Holy Mother picture halves on middle-bottom row, and Holy Mother's spiritual blessing picture on bottom row Leads to: \"It opened!\" Input any other combination Apollo: It won't open. Dhurke: Maybe the pictures aren't in the right order. The case should open if the pictures are arranged properly, but... Apollo: I know. I should carefully consider which part of the song corresponds to which picture. Apollo: It opened! So this is the Founder's Orb... Dhurke: We did it, son! The orb is finally ours! Founder's Orb updated in the Court Record. Dhurke: At last, the Founder's Orb is ours! And it's all thanks to you, son! Well done! Then again, I'd expect nothing less from my boy! Apollo: Oh, uh, ha ha. It's no big deal. Dhurke: Don't sell yourself short! You may think it's nothing... ...but your insights and reasoning led us here. And I'd say that's truly impressive! Apollo: I don't know about that, ha ha ha. Dhurke: All those battles you fought in the courtroom have shaped you into the man you are today. And I couldn't be prouder! Apollo: ...W-Will you cut it out, already? (...Before I turn into a sun-ripened tomato.) Dhurke: With this orb, I can finally deliver a fatal blow to the Ga'ran regime. Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: So, how exactly do you plan on using it? You're not going to try to become a spirit medium, are you? Dhurke: Don't be ridiculous. I don't need supernatural powers like that. Apollo: So then, are you going to use it as a bargaining chip with Queen Ga'ran? Like demanding she abolishes the Defense Culpability Act? Dhurke: Well, the thought had crossed my mind, but... ...the main thing is returning this to the Kingdom of Khura'in. After all, as a sacred relic of Khura'inism, that is where it belongs. Apollo: Really? That's all you wanted to do? Dhurke: Mm-hm. Because my true objective has always been... ...to find out who asked Dr. Buff to study it and why. Apollo: I'm not sure I follow. Examine Box on altar Apollo: That was one fancy puzzle box. Dhurke: The fact that he chose to use such an elaborate box... ...makes me think that Dr. Buff must've had a rather playful side to him. Apollo: I can almost imagine him saying, \"Go ahead. Open it if you can.\" Talk The orb's significance Dhurke: The official story is that the orb was stolen from the Tehm'pul Temple treasure room. Apollo: Yeah, I heard about that on the news. They also said your group was behind the theft. Dhurke: That's not good... We're probably on an international most-wanted list now. ...Let me ask you something, Apollo: Who do YOU think really stole the orb? Apollo: Umm, I really haven't a clue. Dhurke: Well, I think it was one of the royals. Apollo: Really? Someone from the royal family? Dhurke: Yeah, and I've got a pretty good idea which one it was. Apollo: (He knows who it is?) Care to share your hunch? Dhurke: All I'll say at this point is this: Security is pretty tight, but the royals have unfettered access to the treasure room. Plus, they seem to be turning a blind eye to the orb's loss. Apollo: But why would a member of the royal family do that? Dhurke: ...That, I haven't figured out yet. But whatever the reason, it can't be good. I mean, a Khura'inese royal stealing a national treasure of such religious significance? And then pinning the crime on us, the Defiant Dragons? Apollo: Sounds like a conspiracy or something. Dhurke: I agree. And if the truth were to come to light, it would be a scandal of epic proportions. To allow a foreign national to study a treasure so sacred that it's off limits to the public... It would be seen as an utter sacrilege to those who truly revere the Holy Mother. Apollo: So if this were to go public, support for the Ga'ran regime would weaken. Dhurke: But that's not all. This is just a hunch, but I believe there's something even bigger here. Something that would explain why the orb was being studied in the first place. Something that would shake the Kingdom of Khura'in to its very core. And I'm going to find out what. Apollo: (.........He's probably right. His intuition is usually spot on.) Dhurke, why are you so bent on revolution, anyway? Is it to reform the legal system in Khura'in? Dhurke: There's that. But I'm  also doing this for my children... I want to save Nahyuta. Apollo: What do you mean? Dhurke: ...This is for your ears only. It's the other reason why this revolution needs to succeed. Nahyuta (appears after \"The orb's significance\") Apollo: Nahyuta... I never thought that our reunion would take place in a courtroom. Dhurke: Oh, so you've run into each other already. Apollo: Yeah, but it was like he was a different person. He used to be such a kind, cheerful kid -- always smiling and stuff. But now... He tried to convict Trucy for a crime she didn't even commit. Plus, he kept telling me I had a \"putrid mind\" and to \"let it go, and move on.\" Dhurke: Has it really gotten that bad? It must be Ga'ran's influence. He wasn't like that when he first stepped into the courtroom. Back then, he still had a keen sense of justice. \"I vow to bring the Ga'ran regime down and reform the legal system.\" Dhurke: That's what he swore to do... but that was also five years ago. He'd been the shining star of the Defiant Dragons, and our greatest hope. Apollo: Wait, Nahyuta was a Dragon? Dhurke: He was. But these days, he's more like Ga'ran's lapdog. Apollo: Talk about a complete about-face. Why would he do that? Dhurke: Something must have happened to him. Something that sparked a radical change. Still... I don't think he truly believes in the new path he's taken. It's not conviction that fills his heart; it's resignation and despair. Apollo: I-I see... Dhurke: ...The only thing I know for sure is... Nahyuta is suffering... and he is suffering in silence. Apollo: Nahyuta... is suffering...? Dhurke: Yes. He knows the rightful state of Khura'in's legal system... ...but something forces him to bend to Ga'ran's will, and it's tearing him apart. Apollo: But it's been five years. Do you really think he even still wants to reform the legal system? Dhurke: ...As long as he carries what I've taught him in his heart, I do. Dhurke's teachings (appears after \"Nahyuta\") Leads to: \"\"A dragon never yields.\" ...That's what you always told us.\" Present Founder's Orb Dhurke: The orb is ours at last! Apollo: I'm just glad we were able to make what you said in your broadcast a reality. Dhurke: Me, too. I didn't want to admit it before, but I was starting to have second thoughts about making such a big, bold move. I kept thinking, \"What would happen if we failed to get the orb?\" Apollo: Just another example of how a bluff can be the starting point in the quest for the truth. Dhurke: And what a hard-won truth it was. But I couldn't have done it without you, son. Apollo: \"A dragon never yields.\" ...That's what you always told us. Dhurke: That I did. It's a belief I've held since back when I was lawyer. [sic] The dragon stands at the pinnacle of the natural world. Nothing and no one can bend its will. Apollo: That's why we lawyers must pursue the truth like an unyielding dragon, right? We must fight for truth to the bitter end, no matter what it takes... (Dhurke and Mr. Wright... they have that much in common.) Dhurke: That's why I've held onto this badge, even though there are no more lawyers in Khura'in. I believe that one day, our legal system will return to its former glory. And this badge here is a testament to that belief. Apollo: ...Hmm... I wonder if Nahyuta still believes in what you taught us? Dhurke: He does. That much I'm sure of. A dragon never yields. Dhurke: I know that belief is etched deep in his heart. ...I'd bet my life on it. After all, he is my flesh and blood! Apollo: ............ (This unshakable faith and confidence... It's what draws people to him, whether they like it or not. ...Even people like me.) You know, I remember back when we were kids... ...Nahyuta used to say with great pride, \"I have the blood of the dragon within me.\" Dhurke: Yes, and that's why I want to free him. Free him from the poisonous clutches of the Ga'ran regime. Apollo: So that's your other reason for starting a revolution... Dhurke: Yes. I need to smack some sense into that boy of mine. I mean, what else are fathers for? Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: ...I... I wouldn't know.) Dhurke: Now that we have the orb, on to the next problem -- getting out of here. Apollo: Well, we're not going back the way we came. That's for sure. That hole we fell through is way too high to climb back up to. Dhurke: Actually, I have an idea. That lake water tastes salty, which means it must connect to the ocean. Apollo: W-Wait a second. You're not suggesting we SWIM our way out of here...? Dhurke: That's exactly what I'm suggesting. Apollo: But we have no idea how deep that lake goes. It's pitch black down there. Dhurke: Not a problem. Apollo: How is that not a problem? I mean, how do you even know if there's really a passage to the ocean? Dhurke: Well, one of us has to try, and I'm the better swimmer. Time's a wastin'! I'll be back before you know it, son. Apollo: Dhurke! ...He's gone. I sure hope he knows what he's doing. May 16Mt. Mitama - Kurainese Ruins Apollo: ......... (It's been twenty minutes. I hope he's okay.) What's going on? Uh-oh. Th-The water...! It's rising! And fast! Aaaaaaaaaaaaah! (N-Need... air...) *cough* *sputter* *cough* *cough* ...Ahhh! I don't know how to swim! If I don't grab onto something that floats...! .................. *cough* *sputter* *cough* *cough* ...This is bad! I-I better think of something -- quick! Examine Plastic bottle Apollo: Hey, maybe I can use this like an oxygen tank! ...Wait, what am I thinking?! I need to stay calm and be more rational about this! Driftwood Apollo: I've got it! As long as I hold onto this, I should be able to stay afloat! Stone altar Apollo: This is not good. The water's almost up to the top of the altar. It won't be long before it reaches the roof of the cave. Box on altar Apollo: The puzzle box is still at the base of the altar. It must've been designed to stay put, even at high tide. Wait, that's it! Dr. Buff must've gotten in here from some ocean-side entrance at low tide. That's why his footprints were leading OUT of the lake. So it really DOES connect to the ocean. Not that that helps. I'd drown before I made it out. Top of cavern Apollo: Nnrrgh... It's no use! The hole's still too high up! I'll have to find another way -- and quick -- before I drown! After examining plastic bottle, driftwood, box on altar, and top of cavern: Apollo: The water won't stop rising! Aaaah! I-I'm getting swept away! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh! Please...! STOPPPP! Examine Plastic bottle Apollo: If only that bottle were a little bigger, it'd store that much more air... No, it wouldn't make that much of a difference... I need to stop with these harebrained ideas, and come up with a real way to escape! Cavern ceiling Apollo: The water's almost to the top now. At this rate, I'll run out of breathing room! I'm a goner if I don't find a way out quick! Hole in cavern Leads to: \"The water's just high enough for me to reach the hole!\" Apollo: The water's just high enough for me to reach the hole! I'm saved! All I have to do is go back the way we came! The water might even lift me all the way back up, over that wall of rock! Here goes! ...Huh? The hole! It's full of rubble. The tunnel collapsing above must've filled it in after we fell through it. Nngh... This... This can't be happening! No, I can't give up now. I refuse to die here! Th-The water...! I can't--! *cough* *sputter* I can't... I can't... breathe... .................. (Is this... the end?) .................. (Dhurke... I wonder if he made it out.) .................. (So this is what it feels like to drown. I would've eaten that sushi if I'd known it would be my last meal. ...I feel like I've been through this before. ...Ah, now I remember. It was back when all three of us were living in that shack in the mountains. Nahyuta and I were playing by the riverside when we got swept up in the rapids.) Apollo: AAAAAAHHH! Nahyuta: AAAAAAAGH! Apollo: (I thought we were goners, but then...) Dhurke: Nahyuta! Apollo! Hold on! I'm coming! Apollo: ...*sniffle*... *sniffle*... *sniffle*... Wahhhhh!!! Nahyuta: Waaahhhh!!! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! That was a close one! Thought I'd lost you two! Apollo: I-I'm sorry, Dhuuuuuuurke! Dhurke: All right, that's enough now. Didn't I teach you that boys don't cry? Nahyuta: ...Thank you, Father. Apollo: *sniffle* *hiccup* *hiccup* Nahyuta: You... You could've been killed... But you risked your life... to save us... Why...? Dhurke: What a silly question. What father wouldn't risk his life to save his own children? Nahyuta, Apollo... Don't you ever hesitate to call when you need me. Understand? Apollo: ...Hey Dhurke? This isn't forever, right? You'll bring me back from America someday, right? Dhurke: Of course... I'll come pick you up as soon as things settle down here. Promise. Apollo: Okay! You promised! Apollo: ...Dhurke. I waited and waited. For the day you'd come and take me home. But you never came. That's why I tried to forget about you... ...and my life back in Khura'in. ...Dhurke... Why...? Why... didn't you...? .................. ..................... ???: A... ...lo... A... pol... lo...! Apollo! Can you hear me?! Apollo: *cough* *sputter* *cough* .........D-Dhurke? Dhurke: Still can't swim, eh? Apollo: You... You came back? But why? Dhurke: I said I'd come for you, didn't I? Apollo: Yeah... But you can't hold me and swim...! We're both going to...! Dhurke: Stop talking. You'll bite your tongue. Apollo: What? Whoa whoa whoa! (We're being pulled under! What's going on?! Why is this happeniiiiing?!) .................. May 16??? Apollo: *cough* ...Uuuuugh. Wh-Where...? ???: Ahh, you finally came to, son. Dhurke: Get your fill of seawater? Good thing your name's not Neptune, huh! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: D-Dhurke... Datz: Har har har har har har! You're telling me! Check it out, snot's coming out of his nose! Trucy: What a miraculous escape! Not even some of the escape-artist greats could pull that off! Apollo: ...Wh-What on earth happened? Dhurke: Sorry it took me so long, son. I made it to the ocean, but I figured you still couldn't swim. So I found a local fisherman and had him take us out near the undersea cavern. He tied a rope to me, and I came and grabbed you. Then he yanked me back. Apollo: Oh, so that's what pulled us under with such force. Trucy: Don't forget about me! I assisted in your escape act, too, Polly! Dhurke: I've helped compatriots escape from all sorts of places -- mountain jails, island prisons... But an undersea cavern? Now that was a first! Apollo: ......... (Dhurke... He risked his life for me.) .........Dhurke. I'm only alive because of you. ...Thank you. Dhurke: Oh, uh... Y-You're welcome. I, uh... just did what any father would do for his son. Apollo: (.........He saved my life yet again.) *growl* ...Um... Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! I guess seawater doesn't make for much of a meal! Trucy: It's 'cause Polly didn't have any sushi! Apollo: (Oh, yeah. I haven't eaten anything since this morning.) Datz: ...Oh, that's right! Hey, AJ! Dhurke had me buy this for ya. Apollo: ! Dhurke: Thought you might be hungry. Ready to have some this time around? Apollo: .........Yeah. Thanks! *chomp* *nom nom nom* Oh wow, this is delicious! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Glad you approve! I'd better get some before you eat them all! *chomp* *chew chew chew* Apollo: (Just like old times. Dhurke used to slice up the fish he caught, and we'd all eat fresh sashimi together. He used to talk about all the vitamins and minerals packed in the raw fish.) Datz: *chomp* *munch munch munch* Hey, by the way! Lemme see that orb, AJ! Apollo: Here you go. Datz: Hoa, so that's what it looks like! Trucy: You found the legendary treasure! Nice work, Polly! Apollo: Thanks. ...Guess you could say, mission accomplished! Dhurke: With the orb, our revolution can take a big step forward. Let's celebrate the eve of our revolution! We'll all get dressed up and feast till dawn! Datz: Yeah! Now you're talkin'! Time to party! Apollo: ......... (After all that? I just want to go to bed. Sure wish Nahyuta was here. Maybe one day, we'll enjoy times like these together again. ...The revolution. If it can bring back those happy days... ...you can sign me up for--) ???: Sorry to interrupt your little party, but I'm here for my crystal. Staff: Right, left, right, left, HALT! Apollo: Ah! It's him again! Atishon: Heh heh heh. Well done. Then again, I always knew you could do it. After all, we politicians must be excellent judges of character. Still, I'm impressed you both made it out of there alive. Apollo: ...W-Wait a second. YOU'RE the one who shoved us into that pit? Atishon: It sounds so bad when you say it like that. All I did was give you a little nudge in the right direction. Dhurke: ...So... it was you... ............................................................... You no good, son of a--! Atishon: ...EEP! D-Don't look at me like that! The Crystal of Ami Fey is mine! Now, hand it over! Dhurke: Over my dead body! Atishon: EEK! Detective! Help! Ema: Yeah yeah, I know. Apollo: Ema? What's going on here? Ema: He filed a police report. He claims you're trying to steal his family heirloom. Atishon: Th-That's him! The one with the long hair! Arrest him this instant! He's the thief that made off with the Atishon family's most precious heirloom! Ema: Well, I suppose I should ask you to come in for questioning. Dhurke: Down at the police station? I... think I'll pass. After all, Mr. Atishon seems bent on having me arrested on theft charges. Apollo: (This is not good! If Dhurke gets arrested, he'll be sent back to Khura'in to face execution!) Ema: Sorry, but now that I know you have the crystal, or orb as you call it, I must insist. Will you please come with me, sir? Apollo: Apollo: Ema! I'm afraid I can't let you take Dhurke in! He received the orb from Dr. Buff in a perfectly legal transaction. Ema: Is that so? Can you prove it? Apollo: Of course. This should sufficiently prove that the orb now belongs to Dhurke. Present Orb Transfer Agreement Apollo: Leads to: \"Take a look at this agreement.\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: Look at this! It's proof that the orb is Dhurke's. Ema: Umm... All this proves is you're completely our of your mind. Apollo: Oops... (I guess that wasn't it.) But the doctor definitely transferred it over to us. Leads back to: \"This should sufficiently prove that the orb now belongs to Dhurke.\" Apollo: Take a look at this agreement. Ema: What do we have here? Let's see... \"I agree to hand over the Founder's Orb to the Defiant Dragons if I will come to no harm.\" Hmm... It appears to be a perfectly legal agreement. Atishon: Not so fast! That's not the Founder's Orb! It's the Crystal of Ami Fey, which means their agreement is null and void! Ema: Hmm, this is going nowhere fast. Apollo: You can say that again. ???: Then it will just have to go to trial. Right, Apollo? Apollo: M-M-Mr. Wright? Trucy: Daddy! Phoenix: What's with you two? You look like you just saw a ghost. Apollo: (...Oh yeah. Ema mentioned she had seen him around.) ...Um, what're you doing in Kurain Village, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Mr. Atishon has retained me as his lawyer. Apollo: Wait, you're his... lawyer? Examine Mountains Apollo: You can see Mt. Mitama from here. We're lucky we found the Founder's Orb, and even luckier we got out of there alive. I hope I never have to go through anything like that again. Talk Legal advisor Apollo: Mr. Wright, why are you serving as Mr. Atishon's lawyer? Phoenix: Because he hired me. He needed my help in getting a family heirloom back from Dr. Buff. And it seems he correctly foresaw that something like this might happen. Atishon: It's because those shifty insurgents were harassing poor Dr. Buff. So I knew I might need a lawyer if things went south. I figured with a celebrated lawyer like Phoenix Wright, I couldn't go wrong. Apollo: Is this what you came back from Khura'in for, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: It was just good timing. My work over there just happened to wrap up, so here I am. Plus... Mr. Atishon is a very important client. Apollo: (They know each other? But I've never heard Mr. Wright mention his name before.) The Crystal of Ami Fey Apollo: Mr. Wright, are you sure this is Mr. Atishon's family heirloom? Phoenix: That's my client's assertion. He says it's the Crystal of Ami Fey. Apparently, it's the crystal she once used when channeling spirits. Apollo: Who's Ami Fey? Phoenix: She brought Khura'inese channeling to Japan, and her descendants brought it here. Her true origins are still rather murky... ...but what's clear is she is the founder of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Apollo: Oh, so she's like the one they call the founder in Khura'in -- the Holy Mother. Present Anything Phoenix: I'd think you would have more pressing things to ask me about. Apollo: Y-Yeah... (I'd better ask what I can while I can.) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ...Apollo, I don't plan to betray my client's confidence. I may not know all the facts yet, but I do know we won't be handing the crystal over to you. Apollo: What? Are you saying...? Phoenix: .................. I'm really sorry it's come to this, but... Apollo: Mr. Wright? I don't understand. Phoenix: Let me spell it out then. If you continue to claim that the crystal belongs to your client... ...then I will be seeing you in court. Apollo: Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! Trucy: ...Wh-What's gotten into you, Daddy? Phoenix: Nothing. This is strictly business. Atishon: Heh heh heh. Two lawyers from the same firm facing off? What are the odds! Lucky for me, I believe I have the \"right\" man for the job! What ever are you going to do? Remember, he IS your boss. Apollo: Ngrrrgh... (How did it come to this?!) M-Mr. Wright! Please! Don't do this! Phoenix: Apollo, there's no point in arguing about it here... ...when it's now clear we're headed to court. That's where we'll find out who the crystal really belongs to. Apollo: (I don't believe it. Am I really going to face Mr. Wright in court?) Trucy: Daddy! Apollo! No! We can't have our agency's talent competing against each other! Phoenix: It's too late, Trucy. The die has been cast. We each have to fight for our clients' best interests. Trucy: B-But... Phoenix: So, what's it going to be, Apollo. Are we going to have to take this to trial? Apollo: (I have to battle Mr. Wright in court? THE legendary Phoenix Wright? No matter how many trials of his I've watched... ...no matter how dire the situation, he's always pulled out a win in the end. Can I do it? Can I really take on the man whose footsteps I've been following in...? I owe it to Dhurke to at least try. I... What should I do?) Battle Mr. Wright Leads to: \"There's no turning back now.\" Throw in the towel Apollo: (I can't do this. I mean, how can I go up against a man like him? I couldn't possibly win! ...But do I really want to give up without a fight? If I do, I'll be forever walking in his shadow! Plus, I'd be letting Dhurke down! And I can't let that happen!) Leads to: \"There's no turning back now.\" Apollo: (There's no turning back now.) If it's a trial you want, Mr. Wright, I'm more than happy to oblige! I'm ready to fight for my client... ...even if it means facing off against you! Phoenix: .................................... .................. ...All right. I won't be pulling any punches, either, Apollo. The kid gloves are officially off. May the best attorney win. Apollo: You got it! Trucy: Whoa whoa whoa! First Daddy, now you! Polly! You're not seriously... Apollo: ...Sorry, Trucy. But I have to do this. Phoenix: .................. Apollo... All right, then, I'd better go prepare for tomorrow. See you in court. Trucy: Daddy, no! Wait! Dhurke: A fine mess I've gotten you into, son. I mean, of all the lawyers we could've faced, it had to be him? He's practically a celebrity in Khura'in now. They're calling him the Fighting Phoenix. Apollo: ...I-I'll be fine! (After all, I've come a long way, too! Who knows? I could even end up winning. There's always a chance...... right?) Dhurke: You know, this may be a blessing in disguise. If the trial proves what we found is indeed the Founder's Orb... ...then whoever asked Dr. Buff to study it may be revealed, too. This is our chance to finally pull them out of the shadows! Apollo: ...The first step of your revolution, huh? Dhurke: Yes. The revolution to restore Khura'in to its former glory, and save Nahyuta's soul! Apollo: Dhurke... I swear to fight as hard as I can in court to make that a reality. We're going to win this one. You'll see. Dhurke: I know you can do it... son. Apollo: (It doesn't matter that I'll be going up against Mr. Wright. I have to win this for Dhurke... ...and for Nahyuta. His salvation, along with all of Khura'in, depends on it!) To be continued Nothing to examine during investigation Apollo: Nothing particularly interesting here. Area already examined Apollo: We've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around. Nothing to examine during fingerprinting session Apollo: Doesn't look like there are any prints here. Examine insignificant area on evidence Apollo: (Nothing particularly interesting here.) Consult (while opening puzzle box) Apollo: Hmm, this is harder than I imagined. I thought all we had to do was arrange the pictures according to the song. Dhurke: It's times like these you have to think outside the puzzle-box. Sometimes the truth can only be found when you look at things from a different angle. Apollo: A different angle? (Come to think of it, one of the pictures from the song is missing. Does this mean the pictures don't line up exactly one-to-one?) Turnabout Revolution Image Gallery Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 May 17, 10:08 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Trucy: Just so you know... I'm not going to take sides! Apollo: Message received, loud and clear. Trucy: Good, because I don't like this one bit! You and Daddy should be on the same team! Apollo: S-Sorry, Trucy... (Wow, she's really mad.) Dhurke: I'm sorry, too, little lady. This is all my fault. Trucy: I'm just worried things will never be the same between Daddy and Apollo... ...if they go through with this. Dhurke: Is that all? Well, I wouldn't worry about that. That's the way it is with us men. We may fight, but we don't burn bridges. Trucy: Really? Dhurke: Sure. One minute we're trading blows, and the next, we're having drinks together. We're simple creatures at heart. Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Trucy: I sure hope you're right... Athena: Sorry I'm late, Apollo! Apollo: Athena! There you are! What happened with you and Mr. Wright yesterday? Athena: O-Oh, about that... I ended up going to the wrong airport. I was waiting there, thinking his flight was really late... and before I knew it, I dozed off. By the time I woke up, it was already dark. Apollo: I figured something like that had happened. Being late and dozing off are the two things you do best. Athena: Ugh. Guilty as charged. Apollo: So then, I take it you have no idea what today's case is about? Athena: Not a clue. Sorry... Um, what IS today's case about, if I might ask? Another locked-room mystery? A suspect with a flimsy alibi? Ooh, or a dying message? Apollo: Sorry, strike three, you're out. It's a civil case. Athena: ...A civil case? Apollo: You act like I'm speaking Swahili here. Athena: It's just, the Wright Anything Agency specializes in criminal law, or so I thought. In civil cases, there are no prosecutors, right? Instead, both parties retain an attorney. Apollo: Right. And the other attorney is someone you know very well. Athena: Really? Who? Bailiff: The trial will begin shortly. Please proceed to the courtroom at once. Apollo: (...Okay, let's do this!) Athena: Apollo, wait. Who's the other attorney? And where is Mr. Wright? Apollo: No time to explain. Let's go. Athena: O-Okay! Right behind you! May 17, 10:30 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 6 Judge: Court is now in session. Oh, um... Uh, is this some sort of practice session? A mock trial, perhaps? Apollo: Um... no. No, it's not, Your Honor. Phoenix: It's the real deal, Your Honor. Judge: Hmm... So then you two have had a falling out? I won't have you use my courtroom for that, you know! Apollo: I-It's nothing like that, Your Honor! Phoenix: Exactly. It just so happens that we have different clients in this case. Judge: I see... Well, here's to hoping this has no adverse effect on your working relationship. Athena: You can say that again! I had no idea we'd be going up against the boss today! Ugh... You sure this is a good idea, Apollo? Apollo: ...What? Do you want to switch sides? Athena: Honestly, I'd rather be anywhere but here right now. Apollo: (Well, at least she IS here. I'm really going to need her help.) Phoenix: ...Mr. Justice. Apollo: Yes?! Phoenix: Don't expect me to pull any punches just because you're the opposing lawyer. As I said, the kid gloves are off, and come what may, they'll stay off. Apollo: ...Same here, Mr. Wright! If it's a fight you want, it's a fight you'll get! Phoenix: .................. Apollo: .................. Athena: Yeesh, you guys are really chomping at the bit, aren't you? Judge: Hmm... I don't mind a good fight between co-workers. Just keep this civil case civil. Now then, if the plaintiff would take the stand, we may begin. Staff: Right, left, right, left, HALT! Atishon: Noble judge, members of the gallery! Good day to you! I am Paul Atishon! This is but the start of my epic campaign! And you all have the honor of witnessing it! I believe the youth of this country are our very future. Too long have they been looked down on and given the cold shoulder! So, to them I say! Ask not what you can do for your country! Ask what you can do for me! Judge: M-Mr. Atishon! What is that crazy contraption you're riding in?! Atishon: Heh heh heh. It's my custom-made, election-winning campaign mobile. Beautiful, isn't it? Judge: You're at a witness stand, not a campaign podium. So come out of there this instant! Atishon: Feh... Judge: All right. Now, would the plaintiff's attorney, Mr. Wright... ...please explain the complaint filed against the defendant. Phoenix: Mr. Atishon's complaint against the defendant is simple. The defendant, one Dhurke Sahdmadhi... ...stole my client's family heirloom -- the Crystal of Ami Fey. Mr. Atishon merely seeks its return. Atishon: This wouldn't have happened if that archeologist hadn't kicked the bucket. Judge: ...I see. Well, Mr. Justice, let's have your opening statement, if you would. Apollo: The defense asserts the item in question is the Founder's Orb, a sacred relic from Khura'in. Judge: Hmm... Go on. Apollo: It seems someone asked an archeologist -- Dr. Archie Buff -- to study the orb. Dr. Buff determined that it was a Khura'inese national treasure known as the Founder's Orb. The very orb that was stolen from a treasure room in Khura'in several weeks ago. Judge: Why yes, I saw a news report about that! The theft of a Khura'inese national treasure caused quite an uproar in the kingdom. Apollo: Well, we believe it was not, in fact, a theft in the traditional sense. But rather, that it was spirited out of Khura'in by someone for Dr. Buff to study. Judge: You don't say... And...? Apollo: Around that time, an acquaintance of the defendant learned of Dr. Buff. He made contact with the doctor, who agreed to hand over the orb. Apparently, the doctor wanted nothing to do with it once he'd learned it had been stolen. Judge: Hmm... It seems you even have a transfer agreement between both parties. Apollo: Mr. Sahdmadhi also agreed to return the Founder's Orb to the Kingdom of Khura'in... ...once the doctor verified it was the real thing. Judge: I see... So this dispute centers on... ...whether the item is the Founder's Orb or the Crystal of Ami Fey. That, in turn, will determine the object's rightful owner. Apollo: (I'd better bring my A game. Going up against Mr. Wright won't be a walk in the park.) Judge: Hmm... Come to think of it, the name Dhurke Sahdmadhi sounds awfully familiar. But I can't recall where I've heard it. Apollo: ...Oh. umm, it's probably your imagination, Your Honor. He's just a tourist, after all. Judge: Hmm... My imagination, you say? Athena: Are you sure about this, Apollo? He's a wanted criminal in Khura'in, isn't he? Apollo: ...In Khura'in, yes. Here, he's just a tourist. Judge: Very well, let's begin the proceedings. Bailiff, would you bring in the first witness? Apollo: ...Ema? Ema: Show some manners. We're in court. Apollo: I know, it's just... This is a civil trial, so I was surprised to see a detective take the stand. Phoenix: I had her do some digging on Dr. Buff. Apollo: (What for?) Ema: You disappoint me, Apollo. First, you know I'm not just a detective. I'm a forensic scientist. Do try to remember that. Second, you owe Mr. Wright an apology. After all he's done for you, you have some nerve! Apollo: First, I'm sorry. And second, I'm really just trying to do my job. Ema: You'll never get anywhere with that attitude. Take some advice from someone who's been there. Apollo: Why do I feel like I'm on trial here? Judge: Detective Skye, your testimony, if you please. Witness Testimony -- The Doctor's Dark Secret -- Ema: The police have had their eye on Dr. Buff for some time. And just today, a number of stolen artifacts were discovered in his study. Among them were a priceless urn and a statue that were stolen from the Fey clan. It seems the doctor would do anything to study artifacts, including steal them. As for the relic at the center of this dispute, he likely stole it from the Atishon residence. Apollo: The doctor... is a thief? Why am I just hearing about this now? Ema: Well, \"cat burglar\" isn't something he'd put on his résumé. He was more careful than that. But the fact is, he was a classic treasure hunter. Athena: A treasure hunter, huh... Like people who have thrilling adventures in exotic places, risking life and limb for glory? Apollo: I doubt Dr. Buff was the star of his own hit movie series, Athena. Phoenix: Out of respect for the dead, I will say that Dr. Buff wasn't doing it to get rich. Apparently, he only wanted to borrow artifacts to study them. He would then return them as soon as his research was finished. Ema: According to the doctor's child... ...he would even repair or restore some of the artifacts he stole before returning them. He believed he was honoring the dead by discovering their history through artifacts. But whatever lofty ideals he had, it makes no difference. Larceny is larceny. Judge: Yes, he certainly sounds no different than a regular thief to me. Apollo: So, let's say for a moment that the doctor really did moonlight in stealing artifacts... Might he not have stolen the Founder's Orb in Khura'in and brought it back here himself? Phoenix: Nope. There's no records of him traveling overseas over the past few years. Plus, he couldn't very well leave his reclusive child at home all alone. Judge: Hmm... Then this really must be the Crystal of Ami Fey. Phoenix: Yes. He stole it from the Atishon residence, probably so he could study it. Apollo: ......... (This is the left hook I did not need.) Athena: I bet you never saw that coming, Apollo. Apollo: Yeah, when Mr. Wright said the kid gloves were off, he wasn't kidding. Phoenix: ......... Judge: Mr. Justice, you may proceed with your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- The Doctor's Dark Secret -- Ema: The police have had their eye on Dr. Buff for some time. Press Apollo: Apollo: How exactly did Dr. Buff arouse the suspicion of the police anyway? Ema: Chalk it up to good, old-fashioned sleuthing. After investigating countless artifact thefts over the years... ...the police finally zeroed in on him, and the doctor became their prime suspect. Phoenix: A number of those artifact thefts occurred in Kurain Village, too, if I might add. And they started right around the time the doctor moved there. Apollo: But he was never arrested. I take it there was nothing concrete linking him to a crime? Ema: No. Which is why we were never able to get a search warrant in the first place. It's hard to arrest artifact thieves unless you catch them red-handed. Still, the police had him under constant surveillance. Ema: And just today, a number of stolen artifacts were discovered in his study. Press Apollo: Apollo: Are you sure these allegedly stolen artifacts are the real deal? Ema: They're not fakes, that's for sure. Take the urn, for example. Apparently, it's an extremely intricate work of art. Its design, cracks, and other features would be impossible to replicate perfectly. Phoenix: Actually, I've had a few run-ins with that urn myself. So I was shocked to see it there in the doctor's study. I can say without a doubt, that that urn was stolen from the Fey clan. Apollo: I-I see... Judge: Detective Skye, please continue your testimony, if you would. Ema: Among them were a priceless urn and a statue that were stolen from the Fey clan. Press Apollo: Apollo: Were any other stolen artifacts found besides those belonging to the Feys? Ema: Yes. For instance... Remember the large relief on the wall? It was chiseled out some ancient ruins in the Kingdom of Khura'in several years ago. Apollo: Ch-Chiseled out...? Didn't that damage it? Ema: Well, he did restore the parts that were so faded you could barely see them anymore. It seems he intended to return it someday, so one could say his intentions were good. But good intentions are no get-out-of-jail-free card. That's a fact. Phoenix: If I might add, with respect for the deceased... ...the quality of the restorations was apparently exceptional. It seems the doctor invested a lot of money in hiring an extremely talented specialist. Athena: He sounds like a good man... who took a wrong turn somewhere. Apollo: (I guess Sarge takes after him in that way.) Ema: Any further questions? If not... Ema: It seems the doctor would do anything to study artifacts, including steal them. Press Apollo: Apollo: Had these alleged thefts been going on for some time? Ema: At least five years, as far as we can tell. All the recent thefts had been local... ...but before moving to Kurain Village, he had been stealing from ruins around the world. Apollo: (Dr. Buff was an international criminal?) Ema: This data lends itself to but one conclusion: Dr. Buff was a thief. Ema: As for the relic at the center of this dispute, he likely stole it from the Atishon residence. Press Apollo: Apollo: You claim he stole a family heirloom from the Atishon residence. But claiming something doesn't make it true. Ema: Unfortunately, it IS true. Apollo: How can you be so sure? Ema: A police report was filed concerning the theft -- one year ago, in fact. Apollo: What?! A whole year ago? Ema: August 25 of last year, to be exact. The report state, and I quote... \"The Crystal of Ami Fey was discovered to be missing... ...from the Atishon storehouse at 10 AM. The storehouse lock had been picked. Signed, Paul Atishon-Wimperson.\" Judge: Well, a year-old report certainly lends the the plaintiff's claim credence. The doctor could really have stolen the Crystal of Ami Fey. Phoenix: Not only that, Your Honor... ...but the Founder's Orb was only found to be missing several weeks ago. That is nearly a year after the crystal's theft was reported. Therefore, I believe we must consider the orb and the crystal to be two separate items. Apollo: ......... Athena: Paul Atishon-Wimperson? Not the most awe-inspiring tail end, is it? I see why he cut it. Apollo: Not that he inspires confidence without it. Still, I'd probably do the same in his shoes. Robbery Report added to the Court Record. Press (subsequent times) Apollo: Apollo: This police report say say the \"Crystal of Ami Fey,\" but... ...how do you know it's this relic right here? Ema: Because Mr. Atishon has stated as much. Apollo: (...Well, I'm not buying it.) Athena: Apollo, I was thinking... The plaintiff's legal name is pretty distinctive. Paul Atishon-Wimperson... Do we have any evidence related to his initials or his name? Apollo: We just might. It might even point out a flaw in something Ema said. Athena: You think her logic's faulty? Apollo: Yeah. If the doctor stole the relic from Mr. Atishon... er, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson... ...then there's one thing the doctor did that doesn't make any sense. Athena: Especially if Paul Atishon-Wimperson was desperately searching for his stolen relic. Apollo: (Okay, time to go over the evidence again.) Present E-Mail (after pressing fifth statement) Apollo: Leads to: \"The doctor stole the relic from the plaintiff?\" Before pressing fifth statement Athena: The trial's barely started and we're already backed into a corner. Apollo: To make matters worse the judge seems to agree with the plaintiff's case. But we've still got to give it our all. After pressing fifth statement Athena: A police report was filed about the crystal's theft a year ago. Apollo: But the theft of the Founder's Orb was only reported a few weeks ago. So the crystal's report was filed way before the orb was found missing. Athena: That suggests the stolen relic is the Crystal of Ami Fey, as Mr. Atishon-Wimperson asserts. Hmm... I doubt the police report is a fake. After all, Ema is the one who submitted it as evidence. Apollo: (Still, I feel like something we learned in the police report is important somehow...) Apollo: The doctor stole the relic from the plaintiff? Are you sure? Because that statement doesn't agree with a certain piece of evidence. Ema: What do you mean? Apollo: Take a look at this. Ema: What about it? Apollo: This contains an e-mail from the doctor's computer. Judge: ...E-mail? In that little piece of plastic? ......... I'm afraid I don't understand. Apollo: Oh, umm... This stick here can store all sorts of computer data. Judge: I still don't get it. Apollo: H-Here, just look at this! Apparently, the doctor was reporting his research findings to a certain individual. Now, take a look at this. It's the police report that Detective Skye presented to this court. You can see the plaintiff's legal name on it. Paul Atishon-Wimperson. Judge: I can see why'd he drop \"Wimperson\" from his name, but that's hardly breaking news. Apollo: Look closer, Your Honor. Phoenix: .........Ah! H-His initials! Apollo: Right. The plaintiff's full legal name is Paul Atishon-Wimperson. Now consider this... The e-mail's recipient address starts with three letters. Ema: P-A-W...? Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Don't tell me--! Apollo: Oh, but I will anyway. The individual who hired the doctor to study the disputed item... ...is none other than Paul Atishon-Wimperson. Ema: Wait, th-then that means... Apollo: Exactly. He wouldn't have asked the man who stole his family heirloom to study it. Therefore, how could this possibly be the Crystal of Ami Fey?! Ema: AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! ...We never checked the doctor's e-mails. We couldn't even figure out the password to his computer. Apollo: The plaintiff willingly left the orb in the doctor's care so he could study it... ...at the behest of his \"benefactor\"! Ema: ...Wait. Then what about the police report? I have all the details of the theft right here! Apollo: It's probably for another relic -- the real Crystal of Ami Fey. He's just using the report as a way to claim that our orb is actually his stolen crystal. Phoenix: Phoenix: And how are you certain that \"PAW\" refers to my client's initials? Maybe the e-mail's recipient was a dog lover. Apollo: Perhaps. So let's get to know your client a little better, shall we? Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson! Atishon: Feh. I suppose shutting down detractors is all part of a politician's job. Apollo: Answer me this, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson: what is... Your shoe size? Apollo: What's your shoe size? Atishon: How should I know? Apollo: Wait, you don't know your own shoe size? Atishon: I have all my shoes handcrafted in Italy. And the shoemaker comes to my residence to take the necessary measurements. I have better things to do than memorize trivial information like that. Apollo: (Makes we wish I'd memorized the Italian for \"entitled jerk.\") Judge: Maybe this will help you memorize what happens to those who waste the court's time. Apollo: (I really put my foot in it this time.) Athena: Apollo, no matter what his shoe size is, there wouldn't be enough digits. We're looking for a three-digit number. Apollo: Oh, right. Let's see... Leads back to: \"Answer me this, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson: what is...\" Your favorite food? Apollo: What's your favorite food? Atishon: Curry rice. It's an old family favorite. Apollo: Really? As in, boil up some rice and dump some curry sauce on top? THAT curry rice? Atishon: Heh, I bet you assumed I would say French cuisine... ...just because I'm a member of the political elite. But nothing beats the delectable curry recipe my ancestors bright over from Japan. And I'm the kind of representative who upholds the value of such traditions! Apollo: (Is his entire strategy really just to pander to \"traditional values\" voters?) Judge: Your penalty is served, Mr. Justice. Let this be some food for thought! Athena: Apollo, why don't we take another look at the e-mail address? Apollo: No, it's fine! I just need another crack at this. Leads back to: \"Answer me this, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson: what is...\" Your birthday? Leads to: \"What is your birthday?\" Apollo: What is your birthday? Atishon: My birthday? It's July 11th, but what's it to you? (Changed from [My birthday? It's July 11, but what's it to you?] in the original release) ...Oh, I see. You can address birthday gifts to my office. But, full disclosure... I only accept gifts valued at one thousand dollars or more. (Changed from [But, full disclosure... I only accept gifts valued at $1,000 or more.] in the original release) Phoenix: ......... Judge: ......... Atishon: ...Hm? Why has everyone gone silent? Apollo: (How can anyone be that self-centered? Oh, right... politician.) Did everyone hear that? He said, \"July 11th.\" (Changed from [He said, 'July 11.'] in the original release) July 11 -- or rather, \"711\" -- matches the numbers in the e-mail address. Both the name and birthday are a match! I hardly think that's a coincidence! Atishon: .........Wait... Why you sneaky little--! Apollo: (Looks like someone finally decided to join the conversation.) Would the plaintiff care to explain? Atishon: I-I would like to say... that is q-quite... Apollo: Quite what? Atishon: Q-Quite... a thing... you've said. ......... Apollo Um... Any other thoughts? Atishon: No further comments. I stand by my previous statement. Apollo: Apollo: You can't just walk away. Even politicians have to explain themselves in a court of law! Atishon: ...I'm afraid I simply don't know how it happened. I can't possibly explain matters out of my purview. Perhaps it was a mistake on the part of my secretary? Apollo: (Oh no you don't, you slippery eel.) Mr. Wright, would you care to respond? Phoenix: ...I won't argue your assertion. My client lent the treasure in question to the doctor and asked him to study it. It seems that much is a fact. Apollo: (Now we're getting somewhere!) Phoenix: However, it has no bearing on the issue of ownership. Apollo: ...How so? Phoenix: Mr. Atishon, I fully understand your position here. You HAD to hide the fact that you sent the crystal out to be studied. Your family would've been very upset if they had found out. It's a family heirloom, after all. Apollo: You've got to be kidding me! Atishon: Mr. Wright is, well, right, of course. But then, he always is. That's why he's my lawyer. The crystal is a precious Atishon family heirloom, and has been for centuries. But Dr. Buff was so eager to study its proud heritage, I just couldn't say no. I didn't even tell my grandfather. Apollo: Apollo: But in order to win the backing of your so-called \"benefactor\"... ...you were going to give what you claim to be the Crystal of Ami Fey to that person? You were going to give a precious family heirloom away, just like that? Atishon: ...I-I was going to explain everything to grandfather later! Honest! Phoenix: My client's grandfather is very proud of his grandson for following in his footsteps. And if refusing him would've meant dashing the dreams of his darling grandson... ...I doubt the kindly old man could've said no. Judge: Well, grandchildren ARE meant to be spoiled. That's what grandfathers are for. Apollo: Your Honor... Please. (I mean, it's been in the family for centuries.) Atishon: My grandfather thinks highly of my talents as a politician. That's why he entrusted me with this very important name placard today. So I'm sure he would've been okay with me using the crystal as I saw fit. Apollo: (Grrr... Grandpa's spoiled little brat.) Athena: I think the judge is buying it, Apollo. Apollo: No surprise there. He's always going on and on about his own grandchild, after all. Ema: ...Excuse me. Can I leave now, Mr. Wright? I believe my work here is done. Phoenix: By all means, Detective Skye. Thank you for your assistance. Ema: You're welcome. It's nice to testify at a civil trial once in a while. See you around. Judge: Hmm... It seems the facts have changed somewhat. Mr. Atishon-Wimperson apparently lent his family heirloom to Dr. Buff. Mr. Justice. How would the defense like to proceed? Apollo: Oh, umm... (All right, now what?) Athena: Apollo, let's hear what what they know about this so-called \"Crystal of Ami Fey.\" Maybe we can find some inconsistencies in their statements. Apollo: Right... Okay then, Mr. Wright. If the item in question really is an Atishon family heirloom... ...then let's hear all your client knows about it. Phoenix: ...Of course. Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Please tell the defense everything you know about the crystal's origin. Atishon: All right. Now then, listen and learn. This is the tale of the Crystal of Ami Fey, and the illustrious history of the Atishon clan! Are you ready? Our story begins back in the old country, when the Atishon family reigned supreme... Witness Testimony -- The Illustrious History of the Atishon Clan -- Atishon: My ancestor was praised as a benevolent ruler. He protected the spirit mediums, a minority back then, from the rest of the locals. Some discriminated against them, you see, while others tried to abuse their power. As thanks, Ami Fey gave the crystal she had specially made as a gift to him. I am a descendent of that great lord. As such, my political power and influence is backed by centuries of history! Apollo: (Well, that devolved into a great load of self-aggrandizing propaganda fast.) Phoenix: As you can see... ...the Crystal of Ami Fey is an heirloom of the esteemed House of Atishon. Apollo: And you have proof that it has always been in the Atishon family? Phoenix: ...I have someone who gave a statement to that effect. My client's neighbor -- one Ives Shineto, age eighty-five -- gave the following statement: (Changed from [My client's neighbor -- one Ives Shineto, age 85 -- gave the following statement:] in the original release) \"The Atishons showed me the Crystal back when I was but a lad.\" Apollo: Apollo: Can we really trust the memory of an old man? Phoenix: ...Mr. Justice. Would you care you to explain that statement to the judge? Apollo: Oh... Er, I didn't mean-- What I'm trying to say is, um... Judge: Never underestimate the memory of your elders. I may forget my verdicts the next day, but the memories of my past are clear as day! Therefore, I find Mr. Ives Shineto's statement to be perfectly credible. Athena: Wow, did you see how Mr. Wright got the judge on his side? That's definitely a trick I want up my sleeve. Apollo: *sigh* You're not helping, Athena... Judge: You may cross-examine the witness, Mr. Justice. Cross Examination -- The Illustrious History of the Atishon Clan -- Atishon: My ancestor was praised as a benevolent ruler. Press Apollo: Apollo: Um, that object you set down there... Is it something of importance to you? Atishon: It's a name placard. This one here belonged to my grandfather, Abraham Atishon. He had it custom-made during his distinguished political career. It's special because it was crafted from the finest Italian plastic. Apollo: (I wasn't aware the Italians were famous for their fine plastic...) Atishon: Heh heh heh. You can touch it if you want. Apollo: No, I'm fine. Atishon: Very well. I'll just continue with my testimony. My ancestor was praised as a benevolent ruler. But he was also an eminent politician. Atishon: He protected the spirit mediums, a minority back then, from the rest of the locals. Press Apollo: Apollo: So I take it the relationship with the Fey clan was a close one. Atishon: A smooth and open line of communication with my entire electorate... That is the Paul Atishon way. Apollo: Huh...? Oh, sorry. I was asking about your ancestor. Atishon: Heh. Whether it's about me or my ancestor... ...feel free to ask me anything you'd like. Transparency in government! That's the Paul Atishon way. Apollo: (More like: Dodging questions! That's the Paul Atishon way.) Thanks. I'll be sure to ask when I have something you'll actually answer. Atishon: As I was saying, the Atishon family protected the Fey spirit mediums back then. Atishon: Some discriminated against them, you see, while others tried to abuse their power. Press Apollo: Apollo: Spirit mediums were targets of discrimination? Atishon: Yes. Some people even treated them like they were monsters. The transformation the mediums underwent when channeling spirits frightened the locals. And then there were those who tried to use them. Apollo: You mean they sought to control the channeling powers of the mediums? Atishon: Discriminating against a minority is absolutely despicable. A vote for me is a vote to end discrimination. I vow to root it out wherever it may be! That is my promise to you! Athena: He's totally ignoring your questions. It's like you're a moderator at a political debate. Apollo: Yeah, and only HE cares about his talking points. As thrilling as your campaign is, could we please get back to your testimony? Atishon: Feh. As you wish. Now then, as for the Crystal of Ami Fey... Atishon: As thanks, Ami Fey gave the crystal she had specially made as a gift to him. Press Apollo: Apollo: You said she had it made. So then it was made in Japan? Atishon: That's right. They say she hired a famous craftsman to make it. And they say it's quite valuable, too. Apollo: And you were going to take such a priceless family heirloom... ...and just give it to your patron? Atishon: Feh. That's so typical of you ignorant, common types. Making difficult decisions when the chips are down is what being a politician is all about. Apollo: (But only when it's in service of your own political career, you mean.) Atishon: The crystal is a testament to my ancestor's remarkable achievements. And furthermore... Present Research Notes Apollo: Leads to: \"You stated that Ami Fey had the crystal made for your ancestor.\" Atishon: I am a descendent of that great lord. Press Apollo: Apollo: So tell me, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, are you famous in Kurain Village? Atishon: You could say that. But I find my popularity to be rather bemusing. Apollo: Bemusing? Atishon: Yes, my campaign posters keep going missing as soon as I put them up. My avid supporters and female fans are likely taking them home to hang in their bedrooms. Apollo: (...I guess ignorance really is bliss.) Atishon: Heh heh heh. All this only proves my fine lineage. Atishon: As such, my political power and influence is backed by centuries of history! Press Apollo: Apollo: I'm sorry, but is any of that relevant to the issue of the relic's rightful owner? Atishon: ...Have you never heard of kingcraft? Apollo: Kingcraft? Atishon: It's the art of ruling as a king. My father drilled it into my head from a young age. And one of its precepts states: \"Ruin awaits a ruler who responds to every single issue posed by the masses.\" Apollo: (Well, that answered my question about what he meant by \"king of this nation.\" Progress.) Athena: Apollo, who is this Ami Fey, anyway? Apollo: I believe she was the founder of the Kurain Channeling Technique. Athena: The plaintiff claims she had the crystal made for his ancestor. That would mean it was made in Japan, right? Apollo: Yes, I suppose it would. Apollo: You stated that Ami Fey had the crystal made for your ancestor. So, am I to assume it was made in Japan? Atishon: That's right. The craftsmanship is unbeatable! Apollo: Well, that's strange. I don't see how your so-called crystal could've been made there. Atishon: What are you talking about? Apollo: It's quite obvious if you take a closer look at this. Present motif on Founder's Orb pedestal Apollo: Leads to: \"Take a look at the distinctive design here. According to Dr. Buff...\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: See this part right here? Doesn't it exude a mysterious, exotic charm? Judge: Hmm... I don't know about that. Phoenix: What I do know, Mr. Justice, is your assertion exudes a mysterious amount of nonsense. Apollo: ...Oops. Judge: And I assure you there's no mystery behind a penalty for aimless speculation, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Nope. No mystery there, Your Honor. Athena: Apollo, let's go over everything we have on the orb once more. Maybe there's something that can help us prove it wasn't made in Japan. Apollo: Your Honor, I can prove the orb wasn't made in Japan. Leads back to: \"It's quite obvious if you take a closer look at this.\" Apollo: Take a look at the distinctive design here. According to Dr. Buff... ...it's a mitamah motif dating back to the early days of the Kingdom of Khura'in. Judge: The Kingdom of Khura'in, hmm? And you base this on...? Apollo: Here, this piece of evidence, Your Honor. These are the doctor's research notes on the Founder's Orb. This is the box in which the orb was originally stored. It features the same pattern as the one found on the orb. Judge: Hmm... They do look like the same pattern. Apollo: Therefore, I assert that... ...the disputed item must have been made in the Kingdom of Khura'in! Atishon: AAAAAAAAAHHHH! Eeeeeeek! M-My placard...!!! Phoenix: Phoenix: The Kurain Channeling Technique originated in the Kingdom of Khura'in. And Ami Fey is known to have traveled there to train. With that in mind, what's to say she didn't bring that pattern back with her? Apollo: Apollo: But since this is CLEARLY a Khura'inese design... ...not even you can deny... ...the possibility that it was made there -- in the Kingdom of Khura'in! Phoenix: Phoenix: Anything is possible to some extent. That doesn't make it true. So you can't conclude that the orb is from Khura'in based solely on that pattern. If it were that simple... ...I could just as easily say it's Japanese. Judge: I have to agree with Mr. Wright. The pattern alone proves nothing. But that also means there's no basis to claim that the item in dispute was made in Japan, either. Hmm... At this rate, we're going nowhere fast. Apollo: (...Argh. He's right -- we're just spinning our wheels here.) Athena: I wonder if we have any evidence that could break this stalemate. Apollo: (Hmm... Evidence that could break this stalemate...) Exists Apollo: The defense would like to present a piece of evidence to the court. A piece that will finally break this stalemate! Phoenix: Oh? Well, you've sure piqued my interest. Let's see what you've got. Apollo: ...All right. I will now prove that this is, in fact, the Founder's Orb! Present anything Apollo: Phoenix: And just how does that piece of evidence prove that the relic is the Founder's Orb? Apollo: .........It doesn't, does it? Phoenix: Not by any means I can fathom. Athena: Sorry, Apollo, but I have to agree with the boss on this. Apollo: ...Me too, actually. Judge: Me three, defense! Apollo: Yikes! Judge: Time to think that one over again, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Y-Yes, Your Honor... Leads back to: \"Hmm... Evidence that could break this stalemate...\" Does not exist Leads to: \"There doesn't seem to be anything we can use. At least, not at this point.\" Apollo: There doesn't seem to be anything we can use. At least, not at this point. Athena: Well, unless we can find something, this trial won't be going anywhere. Atishon: ......... *whew* That's much better. Apollo: (What's his deal?) Phoenix: ...I have a suggestion. Why don't we consider this from a different angle? Apollo: I'm listening... Phoenix: What if... ...the Defiant Dragons really were authorized to take possession of the relic? Judge: Hmm... I'm afraid I don't know where you're going with this, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Consider the Orb Transfer Agreement, which states: \"I agree to hand over the Founder's Orb to the Defiant Dragons if I will come to no harm.\" What if, as the last part suggests, this was written under duress? That would render the agreement null and void. Apollo: ...What are you suggesting, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: While you were on your little cave expedition, I was investigating Dr. Buff's accident. And there was something you overlooked, Mr. Justice. Namely, that his \"accident\" might have actually been murder. Apollo: What?! (M-Murder?) Judge: M-Mr. Wright! You do realize such statements are not to be made lightly? Are you suggesting the doctor was murdered by the Defiant Dragons? Phoenix: Yes, but follow me on this for a sec. The books that came tumbling down were from the archeology shelf. However, among that mountain of books was a single volume on psychology. What's more, there was blood on it. Apollo: And you feel this is important because...? Phoenix: The took that came tumbling down were from the top shelf -- the archeology books. We know this because the doctor's books were meticulously organized by subject. Archeology took up the entire shelf, so that psychology book is completely out of place. Apollo: (Come to think of it, the shelves were arranged quite carefully.) Phoenix: It's also worth noting that psychology books only take up a tiny part of the bottom shelf. You might wonder why a book on psychology was found amid the pile of archeology books. But I believe I can explain what that single out-of-place book was doing there. The doctor was struck from behind while selecting a psychology book from the shelf. Apollo: And that's when the blood got on the book? Phoenix: Precisely. And to make it look like an accident... ...he was buried under a mountain of archeology books. Apollo: Apollo: W-Wait a second. This is all just speculation, right? Or do you have proof it was murder? Phoenix: Of course I do. Apollo: Y-You do? Phoenix: On a hunch, I had Detective Skye examine the doctor's head wound. She found that he'd been struck by the corner of some object or another. Apollo: Wait, what?! Phoenix: A would like that couldn't have resulted from a fall to a floor, you know. Do you understand what this means, Mr. Justice? The wound makes it crystal clear that Dr. Buff was murdered! Apollo: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Athena: Well, THAT was unexpected! Who'd have thought we'd break out of the stalemate like this! He pulled the ladder right out from under us. Apollo: (Still, if he thinks that's enough to make me back down, he's got another thing coming!) Even if the cause of death was murder, what makes you think it was the Defiant Dragons? You should know better than to hurl baseless accusations! Phoenix: Phoenix: Did you forget who you were up against, Mr. Justice? Apollo: Huh? Phoenix: You didn't actually think I'd come to court without witnesses and evidence, did you? Apollo: Wh-What are you talking about? Phoenix: I would like to request further testimony from the plaintiff. Specifically... ...I would like the court to hear how he saw one of the rebels leaving the crime scene! Apollo: He-- He-- He saw whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?! Athena: If he can prove it was murder, that's the end of our client's right to the orb! Did he have this up his sleeve the whole time?! Apollo: Grrr... How could Mr. Wright do this to us? (He was just waiting to spring this trap!) Phoenix: ...Heh. Judge: Hmm... This trial has taken another unexpected turn. But I must mention, Mr. Wright, that you have yet to identify the murder weapon. Phoenix: The object used to commit the murder was not located at the scene of the crime. The murderer likely disposed of it elsewhere. Dr. Buff's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Judge: Well, I never thought we'd be deliberating the issue of murder at a civil trial. All right, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, your testimony, if you please. Atishon: Heh. Prepare to be dazzled! Dazzled by charismatic oration forged in the crucible of campaign battles! Witness Testimony -- The Rebel's Crime -- Atishon: That evening, I was walking alone, lost in thought. I passed by the doctor's house... and that's when I saw Mr. Are'bal. He was running out the front door. It was around 10 at night. Surely that must've been him fleeing the scene of his crime. A vote for me is a vote to end such violence. That is my promise to you! Judge: So the plaintiff saw a possible suspect fleeing from the doctor's residence? And it was within the window of the estimated time of death? Apollo: ......... (Datz Are'bal! What in the world were you doing there then?!) Study Photo updated in the Court Record. Phoenix: It seems that Mr. Are'bal was loitering about Kurain Village that day. There's evidence that he was in the doctor's study as well. Isn't that right, Mr. Justice? Apollo: ......Ah! You mean the suitcase? Phoenix: Exactly. He must have been in quite a rush to leave that behind. Oh, and by the way, Your Honor... ...Mr. Are'bal just so happens to be sitting in the gallery today. Datz: Ack! Phoenix: See? That's him trying to escape as we speak. Judge: Bailiff! Don't let that man get away! Datz: Wright, you backstabber! Why are you doing this to meeee?! Judge: All right. The... counsel-slash-defense may question the plaintiff-slash-witness once more. ...Ahem. Please proceed, Mr. Justice. Cross Examination -- The Rebel's Crime -- Atishon: That evening, I was walking alone, lost in thought. Press Apollo: Apollo: Why were you taking a walk? Atishon: Society is inundated with serious problems that must be solved. And as a politician... ...I'm always on the job, thinking hard about possible solutions, even on my walks. Apollo: Umm... (Thanks for the non-answer.) Atishon: While we live out our comfy lives... ...there are starving children who suffer in the back alleys of our major cities. It's not in me to ignore such suffering! A vote for me, is a vote to end hunger. ...And for world peace! Phoenix: Yes, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, we are well aware of your outstanding character. Now, please continue with your testimony. Atishon: Heh heh heh. I can practically hear my poll numbers surging. Now, on with my speech. After all, the voting public must be informed of the magnificence that is me! Atishon: I passed by the doctor's house... and that's when I saw Mr. Are'bal. Press Apollo: Apollo: Where exactly were you when you saw Mr. Are'bal? Atishon: Right here, under this tree. I saw him dashing out of Dr. Buff's front door. Apollo: And he didn't notice you? Atishon: No. I was hidden by the tree. Judge: Is it really all that important to know from where the plaintiff saw Dr. Buff? No, it isn't Apollo: No, I don't believe it bears any relevance to this case. Judge: All right, then. Will the witness please continue with his testimony? Leads back to cross-examination Yes, it is Apollo: Yes, I believe it matters a lot. I ask that it please be added to the witness's testimony. Adds statement \"I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal.\" if not already added Atishon: I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal. Press Apollo: Apollo: What were you doing under that tree? Atishon: A lack of lateral thinking... That is a politician's downfall. Apollo: What? Atishon: That is why, if I'm elected... I promise to think outside the box! Apollo: Um... uh... The question was, what were you doing under the tree, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. Atishon: Feh... I suppose I can't expect a plebeian such as yourself to understand my grand design. Apollo: (Oh, yeah? Try me, O Lord of Plebs.) Phoenix: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. I believe the court is well aware of your grand political vision. Now, let's have the rest of your testimony, if you please. Atishon: Heh, I can hardly wait for the upcoming election. Atishon: He was running out the front door. Press Apollo: Apollo: Did you notice anything unusual? Atishon: Yes, his behavior was incredibly suspicious. His eyes were darting all around as he ran off in total panic. As soon as I saw that, I knew he had done something, and it probably wasn't good. Apollo: Despite that, you still didn't report it to the police? Atishon: Who would've thought he had killed Dr. Buff? Not me. That's why I didn't report him. Judge: So the witness didn't notify the police. Is that an important statement, Mr. Justice? No, it isn't Apollo: No, it's not important. Judge: Hmm... All right, then. Let's have the witness continue with his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Yes, it is Apollo: Yes, it's important. I request that the witness add it to his testimony. Atishon: ...Feh. Sure, why not. Adds statement \"I had no idea Dr. Buff was dead. That's why I didn't call the police.\" if not already added Atishon: I had no idea Dr. Buff was dead. That's why I didn't call the police. Press Apollo: Apollo: You had no idea he was dead. In other words, you knew nothing about what had happened? Atishon: I am truly ashamed of myself. Apollo: What? Atishon: There's been a gruesome murder in my beloved village. What a fool I've been! I was thinking only of the village's future and world peace! It seems my earnest attitude and industrious nature have come back to haunt me! Apollo: (Only a politician would try to pass off self-aggrandizement as self-deprecation.) Athena: Apollo, you think this is how all politicians will be from now on? Apollo: We're all doomed if they are... Atishon: If you don't mind, I'd like to continue with my testimony. Present Study Photo or Study Diagram (after adding statement \"I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal.\") Apollo: Leads to: \"Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, rather than Mr. Are'bal...\" Atishon: It was around 10 at night. Surely that must've been him fleeing the scene of his crime. Press Apollo: Apollo: But at the time, you didn't know the doctor was dead. Is that correct? Atishon: ...It's true that I've been known as a prodigy from a very young age. Apollo: Huh? Atishon: I graduated high school and college with exceptional grades. As class president... ...I reformed stale old school traditions. My exploits were even covered in local papers. But as exceptional as I am, I can't possibly be expected to know everything at all times. Apollo: (This isn't working. He keeps bending the questions to serve his own needs.) Athena: Hang in there, Apollo! Phoenix: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. I believe the court is well aware of your exceptional nature. Now, would you please continue with your testimony? Atishon: Heh heh heh. I have the upcoming election in the bag. Atishon: A vote for me is a vote to end such violence. That is my promise to you! Press Apollo: Apollo: So, how do you actually intend to end such violence? Atishon: Elite politicians such as myself never reveal their strategies. Did you really think I would divulge such sensitive information to the likes of you? Apollo: Yeah, but, surely you have some sort of campaign platform you're running on? Atishon: ................................... ...No comment. Apollo: (Clearly, his is a platform, told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing.) Before adding either statement Athena: They're accusing the Defiant Dragons of murder. If this sticks, we'll lose the orb! Apollo: Yeah, we need to sink Paul Atishon's testimony before it's too late. (Mr. Wright is pulling out all the stops. Then again, I'd expect nothing less from him.) After adding statement \"I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal.\", but before adding statement \"I had no idea Dr. Buff was dead. That's why I didn't call the police.\" Athena: He saw Mr. Are'bal from under that tree? Apollo, maybe there's some sort of an inconsistency there. Apollo: Hmm, I wonder... Athena: Why don't we review the evidence? Apollo: (Yeah. Maybe there's something we overlooked.) After adding statement \"I had no idea Dr. Buff was dead. That's why I didn't call the police.\", but before adding statement \"I was under this tree when I saw Mr. Are'bal.\" Athena: He didn't know the doctor was dead? Well, I guess that makes sense, considering the body was inside the study. Apollo: Right, how could he have known? (Guess I could find out where our weaselly witness was when he saw Datz.) After adding both statements Apollo: He said he saw Datz from under the tree. If that's true, then... Athena: Did you figure something out? Apollo: Yeah, I think he's hiding something. Let's take another look at the evidence, Athena. Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, rather than Mr. Are'bal... ...wasn't there's something else that should've had your undivided attention? Atishon: Like what? ...Oh, yes, of course! A politician must also keep his finger on the electorate's pulse, and focus on the nation's-- Apollo: Sorry, but you're way off. Atishon: I am? Hmm... Judge: Would you care to explain, Mr. Justice? Apollo: If the witness saw Mr. Are'bal from his position here... ...then he should've also been able to see the doctor's body. After all, it was right next to a huge window. Judge: Why, I believe you have a point there! Apollo: With the body THAT clearly visible to the witness... ...it's unthinkable that he wouldn't have reported it to the police! Phoenix: Ah! Judge: Hmm... Would the witness care to respond? Atishon: ........................... Apollo: ......... (Did he... fall asleep?) Judge: ...Um, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Atishon: ........................... Judge: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson!!! Atishon: Huh?! Oh, um. Hmm... There are many sides to any issue. Apollo: (What did I ever do to deserve this?) In any case, I'd like the court to acknowledge in the inconsistency in the witness's testimony. Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, did you really see Mr. Are'bal? Atishon: Yes! .................. Apollo: Apollo: Where do you think you're going?! Atishon: Oh, I thought I would return to my seat, seeing as I had already answered the question. Apollo: This isn't some small town hall debate, so you just stay right there until I say we're through. Atishon: I-I'll have to run that by my campaign manager before I... Apollo: Apollo: .........*glare* Atishon: *gulp* Phoenix: ...Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. I think it's time for you to come clean. Atishon: Huh?! Apollo: ...So then, does this mean he DIDN'T see Mr. Are'bal? Phoenix: As your lawyer, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson... ...I advise you divulge that matter we discussed. Silence is no longer an option. Atishon: ...Err, are you sure about this? I'm in the midst of running for office! I can't afford to let any strange rumors get out. Phoenix: Don't worry. You won't suffer any blowback for what you're about to reveal. Judge: \"Blowback\"? I'm not sure I like the sound of that, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Not to worry, Your Honor. Nothing untoward will come of this, I promise. Now then, Mr. Justice. Remember how it was an anonymous caller that reported the doctor's death? Apollo: Come to think of it... Apollo: Ema, who was the first one to discover the body? Ema: About that... Whoever it was, it seems they wanted to remain anonymous. Apollo: What? Ema: It happens now and then. Some people would rather not get involved with the police. Apollo: Wait... You're not saying that... Phoenix: Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying. The anonymous source who contacted the police after discovering the body was... ...my client, Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson. Apollo: Wh-What?! (Y-You don't say...) Phoenix: So you see, he played his part as a concerned citizen -- quite admirably, if I may say so. Isn't that right? Atishon: .........Y-Yes, indeed... In our society today, there are too many who choose indifference over righteous action. But I don't number among them. That's why I did my duty as a concerned citizen. One might call me THE model citizen -- one worthy of standing above all the rest! Apollo: (What a real standard-bearer he is, reporting it anonymously.) Phoenix: ...Oh, and by the way, Mr. Justice. Wasn't there someone else at the scene of the crime when my client discovered the body? Apollo: ...Oh, um, you mean Mr. Are'bal? He would have been leaving the doctor's house right around then... Wait, th-that means...! Phoenix: Yes, it does. In short... ...what my client witnessed was Mr. Are'bal fleeing the scene of a heinous murder! Apollo: ...Aaaaaaah! Phoenix: And that's not all! Based on what we've heard so far... ...Mr. Are'bal looked exceedingly suspicious, and that's putting it mildly. We already know the Defiant Dragons threatened the doctor with bodily harm. And now that they've killed him, the so-called Orb Transfer Agreement is null and void! Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Athena: A-Apollo! If we don't come up wit with some sort of counterargument...! Apollo: A-And what sort of evidence do you have? Can you actually prove that it was Mr. Are'bal who killed the doctor? Athena: That move had \"desperate\" written all over it. Apollo: It's all I've got, so I'm going with it! Phoenix: ...Evidence? I suppose it's true that I don't have any... Apollo: I-I knew it! Phoenix: But I do have another witness. Apollo: You do? Phoenix: You should know I always come fully prepared, Mr. Justice. And my new witness will provide testimony proving Mr. Are'bal's guilt. Apollo: ...Gnrggh! Athena: A new witness? I wonder who it could be. Judge: ...Very well. Bailiff, please summon our new witness. In the meantime, the court will take a brief recess. I would like both sides to use this time to prepare properly, understood? May 17District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Apollo: Wow. I knew Mr. Wright would put up a tough fight, but... Athena: Yeah! Just when I thought we had him, he'd turn the tables on us. He really is the Turnabout Terror. Apollo: (We can't let him blindside us again.) Datz: Looks like they've got me again! Three times in one year! \"Datz\" a new record! Har har har har har har! Apollo: Datz, please... No more new records -- or bad puns, while you're at it. It's hard enough trying to help you as it is. Datz: Roger that. I'll be more careful next time! Dhurke: Datz, is what Mr. Wright said true? Did you really pay a visit to Dr. Buff that night? Datz: Sure did. Can't remember the exact time, though. All I know is he wouldn't hand over the orb. Someone put it in his head that we rebels were dangerous. That's why he threw me out. Apollo: So the doctor was still alive when Datz last saw him. Athena: We'll still have to prove it, though. Dhurke: ...Better brace yourself, son. The next witness's testimony could make or break this case. Apollo: Yeah, I know. Hey, where's Trucy? Athena: She went to go see her dad. Apollo: Hmm... Maybe she's still mad. Athena: More like worried. Worried that this trial will create a rift between you two... ...and that you might then leave the agency. Apollo: Ha ha ha. She has an active imagination. Bailiff: Excuse me. The trial will be resuming shortly. Apollo: Well, let's go see what new testimony awaits us. May 17District Court - Courtroom No. 6 Judge: All right, court is back in session. Mr. Wright, you said you had a witness...? Phoenix: Your Honor, I would like to call the lone survivor of the doctor's murder to the stand. Apollo: (Wait.. He can't mean... that Sarge is here?) You mean Dr. Buff's reclusive son? How did you get him to cooperate? Phoenix: ...Nothing a little persuasion couldn't handle. The poor child only agreed to help if it meant catching the killer. Apollo: (Getting a kid like that to overcome his fear... Now that's impressive.) Athena: This must be really important testimony for the kid to come out in public like this. Judge: Very well, Mr. Wright. Please call your witness to the stand. Judge: .........Oh, my! Sarge: Sergeant Buff at your service, sir! Apollo: ...He's here as the drone? Really? Judge: ...Um, Mr. Wright? What exactly is the meaning of this? Phoenix: Past trauma has rendered it impossible for the witness to venture into public. Leaving home was hard enough. And it seems leaving the witness lobby was just too much. But I would still like to continue with testimony delivered via this drone. Judge: Hmm... I understand it must be terrible to lose one's father like that... ...but testimony via a remote control toy? .........Well, let's take things for a spin and see how it goes. Apollo: (Just who's piloting this trial, anyway?!) Athena: The judge sure warmed up to the idea fast. Apollo: I think the phrase you're looking for is \"gave up.\" Sarge: You disappoint me, Corporal Justice! To think I once called you comrade! Apollo: AAAAAAAAAGH! Sarge: Defending the man who killed Papa?! That's full-on treason, soldier! I hereby demote you back to \"private\"! Athena: \"Corporal\"? \"Private\"? What's he talking about, Apollo? Apollo: It's... a long story. Judge: Now then, are you ready to testify, youngster? Sarge: Locked and loaded, sir! Ready to rain lead down upon the perpetrator! Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Witness Testimony -- What Happened That Evening -- Sarge: Papa met with someone the night he died. I didn't have eyes on the ground, as I'd already mounted my siege defense, but... ...I did hear him arguing with someone in his study! From my window, I saw the one designated \"Datz\" getting ejected from the premises. After that, the man lingered around the perimeter for some time. He must have regrouped and killed my papa in the study later -- I just know it! Judge: Hmm... So he was thrown out, but later returned and committed the murder, did he? Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. So the man my client saw... ...really must have been the fleeing Mr. Are'bal. Datz: Datz: Objeeeeection! Wright, you backstabbing, no good--! I-I didn't kill no one! Sarge: It's the enemy! Ready all missiles! And... FIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRE!! Datz: WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA WHOA!!! Sarge: Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Capitalist pig! I'll turn you into pork stroganoff! And that's just a taste of my ultimate anti-swine weapon! Apollo: (Whoa! It fires missiles, too?!) Judge: ...Yes, well, the witness is all yours, Mr. Justice. Cross Examination -- What Happened That Evening -- Sarge: Papa met with someone the night he died. Press Apollo: Apollo: Your father met with \"someone\"? Could you be more specific? Sarge: No. I was in the midst of a crucial defensive siege operation. Apollo: Right... You're referring to how you don't leave your room, correct? Sarge: You never know where the enemy might be lurking outside the siege perimeter. Apollo: What about, you know, school? Sarge: Oh, uhhh... I don't go to boot camp! I'm a soldier! A sergeant doesn't associate with rookies still too green to fight! Apollo: (With a kid like this, I bet Dr. Buff won't be getting any rest in the afterlife, either.) Judge: Hmm... It was very brave of you to come to the courthouse today. But what was that you said about a siege defense? Sarge: Oh, that? Well... Sarge: I didn't have eyes on the ground, as I'd already mounted my siege defense, but... Press Apollo: Apollo: Um, Sarge? I've always wondered... ...who or what are you battling? Sarge: ! Th-That's... classified. Apollo: Even so, it may be relevant to this case. Phoenix: Phoenix: Umm... I don't know if YOU'RE the right person to be asking things like that... Athena: That's right. Such matter need to be handled with a certain delicacy. Apollo: Oh, ha ha ha. I guess curiosity got the better of me. Sarge: You're all talk and no action, soldier! Out on the battlefield, it ain't the number of pretty words in yer repertoire... ...but the number of bullets in yer gun belt that counts! Apollo: (Easy for you to say. You're the one with all of them. Judge: Would the witness please tell the court what he saw and heard that night? Present Sarge's Drone Apollo: Leads to: \"Sarge, are you hiding something from me?\" Sarge: ...I did hear him arguing with someone in his study! Press Apollo: Apollo: What was the argument about? Sarge: I heard things like, \"Where's the orb?!\" and \"Are you Defiant Dragons really criminals?!\" It sounded real volatile, like a war might break out any second! Apollo: (So the two of them had an argument when Datz came to get the orb.) Did you see or hear anything else? Sarge: Yeah. I heard them arguing, and then, silence. Sarge: From my window, I saw the one designated \"Datz\" getting ejected from the premises. Press Apollo: Apollo: How was Mr. Are'bal acting? Sarge: Like a conquered trooper retreating with his tail between his legs. Apollo: A \"trooper\"...? Well, I guess he does dress like he's in the military. Athena: I bet those two would have really hit it off had they met under different circumstances. Apollo: Yeah, I can see that. Sarge: And so, the defeated soldier was expelled. But that wasn't the end. Sarge: After that, the man lingered around the perimeter for some time. Press Apollo: Apollo: That... does seem suspicious. Sarge: He kept hiding behind trees and telephone poles, and stealing glances at our house. Apollo: Well, he couldn't exactly leave without the orb...) Sarge: I bet he was angry that he'd been kicked out. Sarge: He must have regrouped and killed my papa in the study later -- I just know it! Press Apollo: Apollo: But don't you keep your front door unlocked? If so, anyone could've gotten in.. Sarge: That's true. Papa didn't keep our house locked up. He said there was no need because there were only good people in Kurain Village. Apollo: (Yet he ended up dead, anyway.) Sarge: Only a monster could do what they did to my kind, trusting Papa! There will be no mercy! I vow swift and terrible vengeance! I'll carpet-bomb the killer with everything in my arsenal! FIIIIIIRE!!! Judge: While I sympathize with you, witness, you will refrain from firing Gatling guns in this court. Athena: So Sarge saw Datz, too. Apollo: And just when I thought things couldn't get any worse. I wonder why he hung around after getting thrown out? Athena: I hate to say this, but if Datz is proven to be the killer... ...we'll lose the orb to the plaintiff. So our only option is to prove the Defiant Dragons had nothing to do with the murder! Apollo: Sarge, are you hiding something from me? Sarge: H-How dare you question your superior officer like that! You wanna get in on this stroganoff action with pig-boy over there, soldier?! Apollo: Sorry, but I'm afraid lawyers are missile-proof. Sarge: Wh-What?! Judge: Would the defense care to explain? Apollo: It's simple, Your Honor. Just as he is able to see what is happening in court right now... ...Sarge was able to see what happening in the study then. With his cherished drone, of course. Judge: Ahhh! Now that you mention it... And to think, the answer was right before our eyes this whole time. Apollo: Sarge! You were perfectly capable of patrolling the study that night! So you must've seen something! Sarge: Aaaaaaaaaagh! I'm hit! What is this strange new weaponry you're using against me?! Apollo: Courtroom warriors don't use guns or missiles, because evidence is our weapon of choice! And the evidence has exposed your bald-faced lie! My truth bomb, Sarge... has stripped your defenses bare! Sarge: A t-t... truth bomb?! Noooooooooooo! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH! Mayday, mayday!!! I'm going doooooooown!!! Judge: Oh, my! Are you all right?! Sarge: *cough* *sputter* Evidence... Never have I seen such fearsome ordnance. Apollo: Tell it to us straight, Sarge. After all, you want to help your father, don't you? Sarge: Papa... Apollo: Yes. You want to find out who killed him, don't you? So please. Tell us what you saw that night. Sarge: ...It's... It's... It's not what you think. I-I... I... I didn't see anything. I swear...! Apollo: ...You sure? You seem awfully stressed for someone who didn't see anything. Sarge: ...Grrrrrrr! Apollo: UWAAAAAAHHH! ...S-Sarge. You need to answer my question. Sarge: Shut your piehole, maggot! It'll be a scorching day in Siberia before a lowly private like you orders me around! Apollo: (...What's with him and Siberia, of all places? But if a scorching day is what it'll take, then maybe it's time to turn up the heat.) Hey, Athena. You think a therapy session might help? Athena: Well, it could help alleviate some of his anxiety. NOISE LEVEL100% Athena: ...Plus, I'm picking up a lot of discord in Sarge's voice. That usually means the patient wants to say something, but can't for some reason. Apollo: And in Sarge's case, I imagine whatever's plaguing him is pretty severe. In that case, I leave it to you and your Mood Matrix magic! Athena: You got it! Your Honor, I believe I can be of help here. Judge: Time for a therapy session, is it, Ms. Cykes? Athena: Yes. It will help the witness with his anxiety -- maybe even enough to testify! Judge: Then by all means, please bring the poor child out into the light of day. ...Oh, but I assume this will be all right with you, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Why not? It's not like we all haven't been through this before. Sarge: Wh-What are you butting in for, lady?! There ain't a place on this battlefield for you! Athena: Athena: I beg to differ, Sarge. This G.I. Jane's always ready for a fight in the courtroom! And wait until you see what I've got in my arsenal -- analytical psychology! With it, I'm going to blow a big ol' hole in the armor you've built around your heart! Sarge: UWAAAAAAH! First evidence, now analytical psychology?! Where are these WMDs coming from?! ...W-Well, if it's a battle you want, bring it on! You may have started this war, but I'm going to end it, Corpswoman Cykes! Athena: You got it, Sarge. Time to seek out the agony buried deep in your heart. Widget: Brace yourself! Sarge: I stayed in my room with my drone that evening. Sarge: I heard Datz and Papa arguing with each other. Sarge: Datz got kicked out, but I saw him still hanging around outside. Pinpoint Surprised marker Apollo: Leads to: \"That's strange...\" Sarge: I was in my room, so I didn't know Papa was dead until the next day. Pinpoint Surprised marker Apollo: Leads to: \"That's strange... You reacted with shock when you discovered your father's body... \" Apollo: So I'm looking for unexpected emotions and unnatural reactions, right? Athena: Right -- emotions and reactions that don't fit the content of his testimony. When you find one, make sure you point it out to me. Also, remember not to view his emotional reactions in isolation. Sometimes, it's important to see how they change from one statement to the next. Apollo: Okay, I'll give it a try. Apollo: That's strange... You reacted with shock when you discovered your father's body... ...yet, you weren't nearly as shocked then as when you saw Mr. Are'bal. Normally, you'd expect the death of one's father to be much more impactful. Sarge: ...Enemy fire! Direct hit!!! Athena: That IS strange. I wonder what it could mean. Apollo: Well, we know he wasn't as affected by his father's death as he should've been. And I think I know why. Athena: Oh? Apollo: Sarge, you weren't as shocked at seeing your father's body as seeing Mr. Are'bal because... You're scared of Mr. Are'bal Apollo: Maybe you were scared of him? Sarge: Why you--! How could you even THINK I was scared of that capitalist pig! Apollo: So you weren't scared? Sarge: Listen up, trainee! You feckless amateurs don't even know what true fear is! Naïve little babies like you wouldn't last two seconds out there. So he's your first lesson, private! A heaping spoonful of true, battlefield terror! Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Athena: I think that means you were wrong. But there's no need to look so bitter about it, Apollo. Apollo: No, but that was some bitter medicine... (Ugh, the aftertaste of failure...) Leads back to: \"Sarge, you weren't as shocked at seeing your father's body as seeing Mr. Are'bal because...\" You'd already seen his body Leads to: \"Sarge...\" Something else shocked you Apollo: Did... something else shock you when you saw Mr. Are'bal? Something even more shocking than your father's death? Athena: Hmm, like what exactly, Apollo? Apollo: I don't know... Maybe a mouse or a cockroach? Athena: Eeeuuuwww, gross!!! Sarge: Foolish cannon fodder! Vermin are powerless in the fact of my deadly arsenal! I'll pump 'em full of lead! Apollo: Sounds kinda messy, don't you think? Sarge: ...Ah! Th-Then I'll develop new weaponry! Maybe a flamethrower'd do the trick... Apollo: S-Sure... As long as you keep it \"for vermin use only\"... Athena: Guess it wasn't something like mice or cockroaches after all, huh. Apollo: No, but it was worth a try -- especially to see your reaction. (*sigh* What else could it be...?) Leads back to: \"Sarge, you weren't as shocked at seeing your father's body as seeing Mr. Are'bal because...\" Apollo: Sarge... Maybe the truth is, you left your room that night. And that's when you saw it -- your father's body. Sarge: I-I saw no such thing! Apollo: Really? You didn't see his body? All right then, what DID you see? Sarge: Err... NOISE LEVEL70% Athena: Look, Apollo! We've lost some noise! Apollo: So, just as I suspected... he really did see something. Sarge! Please. Tell us what you saw. Sarge: Ooh... B-B-But... .................. ........................... I-I... The moment I saw it, ooh... ...I-I.. I couldn't bear it. I couldn't stand to lose yet another loved one. Apollo: Huh? (Am I missing something here?) Is that you weren't very shocked when you found out your father was dead? Because you had already sensed he was a goner somehow? Sarge: M-Maybe... Apollo: Please, Sarge. What was it you saw on the night of your father's murder? Sarge: Ooh... Gah gah gah gah. I-I... I saw... ...Agh. Gah. Hrgh. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! UHWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Apollo: Wh-What's happening?! (I don't like where this is going...) Sarge: YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH! NO MORE! NO MORE, PLEEEEEEAAASE!!! Athena: Eeeeeek! Widget: Help! Sarge: I've confiscated your little toy! The battlefield has no place for unauthorized equipment! Athena: W-Widget...! A-Apollo! I can't continue the rest of the session without him! Judge: C-Calm yourself this instant, witness! I hereby order you to submit to your therapy session! What in blazes...?! Sarge: Lookit me! I'm judge, jury, and executioner now! I hereby convene a military tribunal! Apollo: Whoa, whoa... This has gone way too far. Judge: B-Bailiff! Arrest that drone this instant! Sarge: RAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWRRRRRR! Bailiff: Stop resisting! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGHHHHH! If you don't come quietly, I'll--! Sarge: FIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRE! Bailiff: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Athena: Give Widget back right-- EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEKKK!!! .................................................................. Athena: *huff* *puff* *cough, cough* Whew, finally got him back. Apollo: Nice work. Judge: Hmm... This witness is truly a handful. Sarge: Ooh... hup, two, three, four... Uwoooooooooooooooooooooooooooh! Phoenix: Ms. Cykes, what is the witness's current psychological state? Athena: Let's see... He's emotionally all over the map. Apollo: So his out-of-control emotions are in control of him, huh. Does that mean we can calm him down if we can figure out the root cause? Athena: Yes. So let's see what we can find. Sarge! Can you hear me? Sarge: Ooh... I-Is that you, Corpswoman Cykes? Athena: I'm here. Now, I want you to take a few deep breaths. Just try to relax. Try it with me. Breathe in, breathe out. Breathe in, breathe out. Sarge: In... Out... In... Out... Athena: And now... Let your emotions take you where they will. Go on, just let it all out! Sarge: UHWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH!!! All forces, attaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack! Apollo: (...That's the LEAST relaxing breathing exercise I've ever seen.) Sarge: Datz was still hanging around after he got kicked out when... Sarge: ...I heard more fighting, and I got worried about Papa. Sarge: So I left my room, but suddenly... Sarge: ...I got dizzy and passed out. Sarge: I remember a flame lighting up the room... Probe Flames Apollo: Leads to: \"That's it!\" Sarge: ...and Papa grinning with delight. Probe Flames Apollo: Leads to: \"That's it!\" Sarge: That's when he must have been killed. If only I hadn't passed out! Apollo: So he has two out-of-control emotions, huh. And all we have to do is find out what's causing them to run wild like this? Athena: Yes. Whatever the cause, it should appear somewhere in the Mood Matrix. Let me know if you think you've found it. Apollo: Ugh... Easier said than done. Don't suppose you have any ideas on where to start? Athena: Well... I would think about Sarge's personality and his past. Those are the things that shape a person's emotions. You should be able to find something to work with from there! Apollo: That's it! Sarge... You were overcome with shock and fear when you saw those flames, weren't you? Sarge: Was I...? Apollo: Yes. Just six months ago... ...you and your mother were caught up in an arsonist's blaze. So it's no wonder you would be extremely scared of fire. Sarge: ...Y-Yes, that does make sense. Athena: And maybe, just maybe... ...your subconscious fear of fire was what caused you to withdraw from the world. Sarge: What do you mean, Corpswoman Cykes? Athena: In the outside world, you were bound to come across all sorts of fire. Candles, cigarettes... heck, even the grill at a diner. Even if it's not that often, just the idea that you might see them... ...grew bigger and bigger until you couldn't shut it out. Sarge: ...! I... I think you might be onto something. Candles, cigarettes... Just thinking about them sends a chill down my spine. Apollo: (Wow, the things I take for granted.) Sarge: Now I see. I was afraid... Afraid of the fire. Strange, I didn't even realize it myself. Apollo: About that fire, Sarge... Can you tell me what it was burning? Athena: Just stay calm and maybe something will come to you. Sarge: Oh, umm... ............. ..................Oh! I'm starting to remember! I-It was...! It was that relic! That relic Papa was studying... It was on fire! Apollo: The orb... was on fire? Sarge: Mm-hm. It's still kind of fuzzy...  ...but yes, the \"orb\" was burning right in front of Papa. And there... in the flames was... ...Mama? Yes! Now I remember... I saw Mama appear amid the dancing flames! Apollo: Wait... WHAAAAAAAAAT?! NOISE LEVEL30% Apollo: Wh-What's going on here? Athena: Maybe it's a memory from the fire that killed his mother. Hmm... He might be confusing it with what really happened when his father died. Apollo: So let me guess... More therapy? Athena: Yep. But this time, it seems there's an inconsistency in his statements. And I think we should be able to prove that with the evidence at hand. Apollo: (I hope this inconsistency is the key... ...to proving that the relic is really the Founder's Orb!) Sarge: Datz was still hanging around after he got kicked out when... Sarge: ...I heard more fighting, and I got worried about Papa. Sarge: So I left my room, but suddenly, I got dizzy and passed out. Sarge: I remember a flame lighting up the room, and Papa grinning with delight. Sarge: The relic was on fire, and I saw Mama's face inside. Sarge: That's when he must have been killed. If only I hadn't passed out! Present Founder's Orb Apollo: Leads to: \"Don't blame yourself, Sarge.\" Athena: I believe Sarge's fear of fire is triggering a past memory. As a result, the memory of what he really saw is being suppressed. When he tries to remember, the past memory is being overlaid onto the more recent one. Apollo: Wow, the mind sure is a tricky beast. So, I'll just have to find an inconsistency? Athena: Right. Once you find an inconsistent statement... ...present the evidence that proves it. Apollo: (The main issue here is when the doctor was murdered. Was he really killed while Datz was there?) Apollo: Don't blame yourself, Sarge. After all, even if you hadn't passed out... ...the outcome would've been the same. Sarge: What do you mean? Apollo: I'm talking about the time of death. Your father wasn't killed right after you left your room. Sarge: Wh-What?! Explain yourself at once, Private Justice! Apollo: You said you saw your father burning the orb, right? But that night, he went out to hide it in a cave. So, what you saw, Sarge... ...was something that happened before your father left to hide the orb. Sarge: Ah! Apollo: So you see, you didn't pass out right before he was killed. You passed out right before he left for the cave, to hide the orb in the ruins within. Sarge: S-So, even if I hadn't passed out... Apollo: That's right. The outcome would've been exactly the same. That's because your father, Dr. Buff, was killed after he returned from the ruins. And therefore, Sarge, there's no need to blame yourself. Sarge: Oh... I see... .............. ................................ Private Justice... Can... Can you really say I bear no blame in this? Apollo: ...Why do you ask? Sarge: .........Because... the truth is... ...if I hadn't engaged in my siege defense, Papa would still be alive. Apollo: Sarge... Sarge: Papa wished nothing more than for me to lead a happy, healthy life. That's why he quit his job and moved us out, away from the big city. But even then, I didn't have the courage to set foot into the outside world. And in the end... ...I failed to make Papa's wish come true. Sarge: ..................... ???: ...Um, Sarge? Athena: If you want to make your father's wish come true... If that's what you really want... ...then who's to say it's too late? Why don't you take the first step now? Sarge: ...My first step? Athena: That's right. You can cast off all your regret. You can stop standing still and start moving forward. You have the power within you. I know from experience. I know what's it like to feel like you do. But only you... only you can decide to take the first step! Sarge: ................................ Apollo: If you don't change your tactics now, Sarge... ...the victory you seek in the war you're waging will always lie beyond your grasp. Sarge: ................................................ Hmm... I think I understand now. I've... I've made up my mind! Apollo: ! Sarge: As of this moment... ...I will suspend my siege defense indefinitely! Apollo: ...............Huh? ???: S-Sergeant Buff, r-reporting for duty. Apollo: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! I-I-I thought you were a guy! Athena: You're DEFINTELY not the gruff drill sergeant I envisioned! ???: W-Well, my mama was in the Russian army. Phoenix: I was just as shocked, but it certainly explained a few things when I found out, too. May I introduce to you Miss Armie Buff, age twelve. (Changed from [May I introduce to you Miss Armie Buff, age 12.] in the original release) Apollo: N-No way... Armie: Careful, soldier! Don't forget I could blow you away at a moment's notice! Athena: S-She's just too cute... Apollo: So... Have you always been in a wheelchair, Sarge? Armie: Negative. Only since I was injured... in the fire. Judge: Umm... Your voice sounds awfully different from before. Armie: My drone features a voice modulation device. It's just one of my army's many technological marvels. Judge: Well, you fooled me. I thought some twenty-something military fanatic was at the controls. Armie: I-If it's all the same to you, troops, I'd like to continue my testimony! I've just remembered something! And it's as crisp and clear as a trumpet at roll call. Apollo: What did you remember? Armie: It wasn't my mother who appeared in the burning orb. It was some lady Papa had shown me a picture of a long time ago. He said it was the Holy Mother, the founder of Khura'inism. She appeared right there, right in the burning orb! Apollo: Huh...?! Phoenix: What did you just say?! NOISE LEVEL0%BYE BYE Athena: The Holy Mother of Khura'inism was in the burning orb? Wh-What does that even mean? Phoenix: ...I have a bad feeling about this. Apollo: Could it be...? Could this explain what Sarge means by the Holy Mother appearing in the burning orb? Present Research Notes Apollo: Leads to: \"Dr. Buff's research notes? What do they have to do with this?\" Present anything else Apollo: Armie: What's that? Apollo: A piece of related evidence. Wouldn't you agree? Although, to be honest, I'd have to plead the fifth if you asked me how certain I was. Sarge: Private! Did you really think such a cockamamie plan would rout out the enemy?! Apollo: Yiiiiiikes! {I'd better be more careful!) Athena: If the orb was burning, maybe the evidence you're looking for has to do with fire. Apollo: Yeah, I know. Leads back to: \"Could this explain what Sarge means by the Holy Mother appearing in the burning orb?\" Athena: Dr. Buff's research notes? What do they have to do with this? Apollo: Look at this! The burning orb, the appearance of the founder -- this part points to both! Present third stanza of Song of Ceremony Apollo: Leads to: \"There's a legend about the orb involving a mysterious riddle.\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: It's all... right here! Athena: Umm.. I'm not seeing it. Apollo: Well, it's... Maybe you can explain it, Athena. Athena: I'M not the one who's supposed to explain things when YOU'RE the one presenting! Apollo: (Yikes, she's really mad. I'd better come up with something before her anger burns me to a crisp.) Leads back to: \"Look at this! The burning orb, the appearance of the founder -- this part points to both!\" Apollo: There's a legend about the orb involving a mysterious riddle. And this song, in turn, is said to contain the key to solving it. If the legend is true, then I believe the answer lies in this part of the song: \"Offer thy prayers as fervent as fire Only then shall the Holy Mother return.\" ...Well? Anyone see where I'm going with this? Phoenix: Prayers as fervent as fire... ...Ah! You're supposed to... set the orb on fire? Apollo: The whole stanza seems to suggest that the founder will appear if the orb is set on fire. Athena: ...Wait! S-So the doctor! He...! Apollo: ...Yes, Athena. He had solved the ancient riddle of the Founder's Orb! Judge: Oh, my! Armie: Papa was a great archeologist. So I believe in him... and I want to believe... I want to believe he achieved his long-time dream of solving that riddle before he died. Apollo: Well, we won't know for sure... until we try it for ourselves. Armie: Yes, do it, Private Justice. Please! I want to see what Papa was searching for with my own eyes! Phoenix: Phoenix: The, uh... The plaintiff must object to this! Apollo: Apollo: The plaintiff will stand down and be quiet! Phoenix: Phoenix: Y-You don't have the right to set a precious relic like that on fire! Apollo: Apollo: Oh, but I do. All I needed was Sarge's permission. Since we still don't know if this treasure if the Founder's Orb or the Crystal of Ami Fey... ...any ownership rights the doctor had now belong to his daughter. Therefore, you have absolutely no right to stop us! Phoenix ...Gnrk! Judge: Very well, Mr. Justice. I never thought I'd be saying this, but you may burn the evidence. Apollo: All right, here we go! Apollo: Look! Athena: A-Apollo! The inside of the orb... It's melting! Apollo: There's something in there... Ahhhhhhhhhh! Dh-Dhurke! Isn't she...? Dhurke: Her garb leaves no room for doubt. It's the founder herself! Face and all... Dhurke: I-I don't understand. The greatest of taboos in Khura'inism... ...is the depiction of the founder's face. Yet here it is, hidden within this orb! Founder's Orb updated in the Court Record. Apollo: Sorry, Mr. Wright, but as you can see, the issue is \"crystal\" clear. This figure is the Holy Mother, founder of Khura'inism. And based on that, this must be none other than the Founder's Orb! Phoenix: Phoenix: B-Be that as it may, Mr. Are'bal still may have killed the doctor! If so, it would render the Orb Transfer Agreement null and void! Apollo: Don't play dumb, Mr. Wright. The truth of the matter has already been proven! Dr. Buff wasn't killed right after Sarge saw Mr. Are'bal. It happened after the doctor came back from hiding the orb. And you've no proof that Mr. Are'bal was still around at the time! Phoenix: ...Urrrrrrrgh. Apollo: Your claim that the Defiant Dragons were behind the crime doesn't hold water. And that means the Orb Transfer Agreement is still perfectly valid. Phoenix: ...Arrrrrrrgh. Apollo: Admit it, Mr. Wright. I just burned your whole case to the ground! Phoenix: Ooh... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! Apollo: (I won? I actually won?) Judge: M-Mr. Wright! Would you care to respond? Phoenix: .........R-Respond? ...Um... Apollo: (I didn't think so!) Athena: Wait, did we just win? Did we actually beat the Turnabout Terror?! You're amazing, Apollo! Atishon: Don't just stand there, Wright! Do something! Phoenix: ...Umm, well... I don't think there's any digging out of this hole. Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, I think it's time for your concession speech. I have proven beyond a shadow of a doubt that this is the Founder's Orb. The facts don't lie, but you obviously do. How's that for a campaign slogan? Atishon: Wh-Why you contemptuous peasant...! Judge: ...Hmmm. I think this is a good time to wrap up this trial. If both parties have no further objections, I will render my verdict. Apollo: No objections here, Your Honor. Phoenix: Err... Um... No ob-- Atishon: Atishon: You can't do this. The crystal is mine! I'll lose the election if I lose that crystal! Phoenix: I'm sorry, but there's really nothing more I can do. Atishon: ...You haven't forgotten about our little chat... have you? Phoenix: ! .......... Apollo: (What's going on here?) Phoenix: Phoenix: ...Y-Your Honor. I...I object to the defense's last claim! Apollo: What?! Phoenix: I don't believe they have truly proven that the relic is indeed the Founder's Orb. Apollo: Apollo: Mr. Wright. I don't think even you could bluff your way out of this one! What possible argument could you have to claim that this isn't the Founder's Orb? Phoenix .........Um, about that... ...................Oh, of course! Apollo: .......... (H-He can't possibly have hit on something...) Phoenix The defense's assertion is incomplete, and here's why. Their claim that this relic is the Founder's Orb is based on a legend. (Changed from [The defense is basing their claim that this relic is the Founder's Orb on a legend.] in the original release) And that legend claims that the founder will return when the riddle is solved at last. Apollo: Right. And that's what happened. The founder was revealed for all to see. Phoenix: But Mr. Justice, what about the rest of the legend? Apollo: Huh? Phoenix: According to the legend, once the founder returned... ...she would bestow spiritual power onto the person who solved the riddle. Apollo: ..........Y-You're kidding, right? Phoenix: Well, Mr. Justice? Do you feel great spiritual power coursing through your veins? Apollo: Um.......... no. B-But receiving spiritual powers and stuff... It's all just mystic mumbo-jumbo, right? Phoenix: Maybe so, but you're the one basing your claim on said legend. And what we saw here does not fully fulfill it, does it? Apollo: N-No, but... Phoenix: Consequently... You cannot rightfully claim that this is the Founder's Orb! Judge: .......... Atishon: .......... Apollo: .......... .......... Apollo: (What's gotten into him? Why is Mr. Wright doing this?) Judge: Hmm... It would appear that Mr. Wright has lost a few of his marbles. Phoenix: ...Th-That couldn't be further from the truth, Your Honor. Judge: In any case... I believe this a good time for a recess. Both sides will have twenty minutes to prepare. (Changed from [I believe this a good time for a recess. Both sides will have 20 minutes to prepare.] in the original release) I ask that all arguments be ready by then. Oh, and Mr. Wright? You'd do well to wash up and find your missing marbles by then, too. Phoenix: .................... May 17District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Athena: Mr. Wright is sure acting funny. I mean, he's famous for going out on a limb, but that last assertion was just plain crazy. Apollo: It's either a bluff or a Hail Mary. Either way, it doesn't make much sense. Trucy: ...Maybe there's something we're missing here. Although, he seemed perfectly normal when we spoke earlier. Athena: ...Apollo, I have a bad feeling about this. I'm going to go check up on him. Apollo: (What's going on with you, Mr. Wright...?) ???: Hey. Private Justice. Apollo: ...Oh, Sarge. Armie: I forgot to mention something. O-On the night of Papa's murder, a strange thing happened. Apollo: Oh? But why are you only telling me about it now? Armie: Well... I didn't say anything before because I thought Papa's death was an accident. But now that we know otherwise, I figured it might be important. Apollo: (There's still more to this case?) Armie: When I left my room and lost consciousness, I passed out right here. Apollo: That's right above the coffee bar. Armie: Mm-hm. But when I came to... ...someone was pushing my wheelchair. Apollo: What?! Armie: I was so scared, I beat a hasty retreat -- as fast as my wheels could take me! Apollo: Do you know who it was? Armie: No. It was pitch black. Plus, I fled to my room so fast, I didn't even have a chance to turn on the lights. Apollo: Maybe it was your father. Armie: No, he would have said something to me. Besides, I'd have known if it was him. Apollo: So then, it could've been... ...your father's real killer? Armie: My thoughts exactly. Apollo: But you didn't report this to the police? Armie: ...I-It didn't even occur to me. Apollo: It's okay. You were obviously still upset, so don't bear yourself up over it. Dhurke: Apollo, this could be really important information. I think the act of pushing Sarge's wheelchair could be part of some bigger scheme. It's hard to see why else the killer would do such a thing. Apollo: (Guess I should take her statement down as evidence.) Armie's Statement added to the Court Record. Apollo: Oh, welcome back, Athena. ...Hm? (What's with the long face?) Athena: .......... Apollo: How'd it go with Mr. Wright? Athena: .......... What should I...? Apollo: Athena? Athena: Oops, sorry! Zoned out there for a sec. The recess is almost over, so let's go! Ha, a-ha ha. Apollo: ........ (What was that all about?) May 17District Court - Courtroom No. 6 Judge: All right. Court is, once again, back in session. Now, umm... Mr. Wright. About that last objection you raised... Phoenix: We, the plaintiffs, still believe that the defense has yet to sufficiently prove its case. They claim that, according to legend, the Founder's Orb would bestow spiritual power... ...yet the relic in question has failed to do so. Therefore, it has failed its own test. Judge: I-I see... Apollo: (He's sticking with that ridiculous argument?) Phoenix: Furthermore... ...even if is the Founder's Orb, it can't be awarded to the Defiant Dragons. After all, they were the ones who killed Dr. Buff. Apollo: Apollo: What are you talking about? That was already proven to be false. There are no grounds for asserting that the Defiant Dragons murdered the doctor! Phoenix: Oh, but I'm afraid there are, Mr. Justice. ...Your Honor. I would like to present new testimony to this court. Testimony that will show that Datz Are'bal did, in fact, kill Dr. Buff! Apollo: What?! Judge: Very well. You may call your witness. Athena: I guess Mr. Wright found another new angle. Apollo: What new testimony could there be this late in the game? Atishon: Fellow citizens! It is I, Paul Atishon, the once and future representative of the people! Apollo: (Jeez, not him again.) Phoenix: My client divulged new information to me during the recess. He remembered something he saw, you see -- something crucial to this case. Apollo: (How very convenient...) Witness Testimony -- Datz's Crime -- Atishon: It was around 11 at night, and I was out on a mobile meet-and-greet around the village. That's when I saw Dr. Buff being murdered from outside his study window! Mr. Are'bal snuck up from behind and struck him on the head. His weapon of choice: a suitcase. A big, strong man like him could easily swing a heavy suitcase into someone's head. Apollo: You saw the murder as it happened?! And you're just telling us now because...? Atishon: Heh heh heh. I saved the best for last. It's a tactic known to all the political greats. Phoenix: The murder weapon was a complete mystery... ...but my client's eyewitness account has finally brought it to light. Judge: According to the autopsy report... ...Dr. Buff was struck in the head by the corner of some object. I suppose that could very well be the corner of a suitcase. Apollo: Apollo: But eyewitness testimony isn't the same as hard evidence! Phoenix: Oh, I wouldn't worry about that if I were you. Apollo: What's that supposed to mean? Phoenix: We have physical evidence, too. A luminol test revealed... ...the doctor's blood on Mr. Are'bal's suitcase. Apollo: R-Really?! But how does that prove that Mr. Are'bal used it as a weapon? Phoenix: Phoenix: You should know the answer to that, Mr. Justice. Since you know was well as I that the suitcase is covered in his fingerprints. Apollo: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! (I forgot we'd dusted it right in front of Ema!) Athena: The Turnabout Terror strikes again. Judge: Hmm... This is quite convincing testimony and evidence. Nevertheless, you may proceed with your cross-examination, Mr. Justice. Cross Examination -- Datz's Crime -- Atishon: It was around 11 at night, and I was out on a mobile meet-and-greet around the village. Press Apollo: Apollo: You were on a so-called \"mobile-meet-and-greet\" at 11 at night? Atishon: That's right. It's the perfect time because everyone is at home. You should have seen how the villagers' eyes teared up when they heard what I had to say. Apollo: (With tears of frustration, no doubt.) You weren't riding around in your palanquin? Atishon: That's right. Some village idiot reported me to the police. I've been banned from using it after dark. Athena: No wonder, what with all the noise he makes. Apollo: So, what exactly did you see, then? Atishon: That's when I saw Dr. Buff being murdered from outside his study window! Press Apollo: Apollo: Sounds like you witnessed something rather shocking. Atishon: Indeed. I didn't even believe it at first. I mean, a vicious murder, in Kurain? Apollo: There haven't been many murders there, I take it? Atishon: If I'm elected, I promise you that such a terrible tragedy will never happen again! A vote for me is a vote to banish murder forever from our beloved Kurain Village! Apollo: (Yeah, good luck with that.) Judge: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, please tell the court what you saw at the scene of the crime. Atishon: Mr. Are'bal snuck up from behind and struck him on the head. Press Apollo: Apollo: He snuck up from behind? So you're saying the doctor never even realized Mr. Are'bal was there? Atishon: That's right. He was utterly absorbed in a book. Apollo: ...I see. What did you see Mr. Are'bal do next? Atishon: He climbed up the bookshelf ladder and dumped a bunch of books down on the body. I believe he was trying to make it look like an accident. But that idiot didn't realize I could see everything from outside the window. Apollo: (One of those statements doesn't feel right.) Your Honor, I believe the witness made an important statement just now about how... The crime was clearly visible Apollo: If the crime was visible through the window, that's earth-shattering testimony! Judge: ...Is it? Because to my ears, it sounds like a rather obvious fact. Apollo: ...Oh, sorry. I'm good, then. Judge: Hmmm... Very well. Will the witness please continue with his testimony? Leads back to cross-examination The doctor was reading a book Apollo: The doctor was reading a book at the time of the murder...? That's vital testimony! Judge: Very well. The witness will please add that statement to his testimony. Adds statement \"The doctor was standing in front of the bookshelves, absorbed in a book.\" if not already added Datz is an idiot Apollo: The witness said Mr. Are'bal is an idiot. That's a key piece of information! Datz: Don't you jump on the bandwagon, AJ! I'm no idiot, you hear! Judge: Hmm... I fail to see how that is a key piece of information. Apollo: ...Yeah, I guess it's not, is it? Judge: Then it seems there is no need to add it into the witness's testimony. So let's get on with it, shall we? Leads back to cross-examination Atishon: The doctor was standing in front of the bookshelves, absorbed in a book. Press Apollo: Apollo: You watched a murderer commit his crime and did nothing to stop it? That doesn't sound like a good way to score points with the voting public. Atishon: I'm a politician, not a superhero! I'm under no obligation to risk life and limb. Athena: He's sure quick to deny his obligations when there's nothing in it for him. Apollo: I'm getting tired of listening to his endless campaigning and flimsy rationalizations. Phoenix: About your testimony, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson... You said Mr. Are'bal struck the doctor from behind when he was absorbed in a book. Atishon: Yes, that's exactly what happened. Present Doctor's Reading Glasses Apollo: Leads to: \"The doctor was standing in front of the bookshelves, absorbed in a book, you say?\" Atishon: His weapon of choice: a suitcase. Press Apollo: Apollo: Are you sure? Atishon: Positive. I saw it with my own two eyes. Apollo: Yet, despite your certainty, you kept quiet about it until now? Atishon: No, I was waiting. I knew there would be a perfect chance to talk about it later. Information must always be disclosed in a strategic manner. That is one of the lessons of kingcraft, as taught by the Atishon clan. Apollo: (Is there a lesson, by chance, in the Atishon Kingcraft Guidebook on being honest?) Atishon: Anyway, I saw Mr. Are'bal commit that heinous crime. Atishon: A big, strong man like him could easily swing a heavy suitcase into someone's head. Press Apollo: Apollo: I would have to agree, that suitcase is really heavy. ...Wait a second. How did you know it was so heavy? For all you knew, it could've been empty. Atishon: Gnrk! Phoenix: Phoenix: My client witnessed the crime in progress. So naturally, he saw Mr. Are'bal straining to lift what was obviously a heavy suitcase. I can't say I'm a fan of you trying to discredit my client by tripping him up, Mr. Justice. Apollo: (But I'm just doing what you always do, Mr. Wright!) Before adding statement Athena: Talk about new testimony. He's totally changed his story. Apollo: If he had really seen the murder taking place, you'd think he'd have said so from the start. Athena: Maybe he had some reason to hide what he really saw? Apollo: (If so, that might be our only opening.) After adding statement Athena: Dr. Buff was struck from behind while he was absorbed in a book? He must've been really into it. Apollo: Hmm... It doesn't add up. Athena: What doesn't? Apollo: (That Paul Atishon is lying. I'm sure of it.) Apollo: The doctor was standing in front of the bookshelves, absorbed in a book, you say? I'm sorry, but it seems your testimony is completely unreliable. Atishon: That's quite a bold statement. Well, let's hear you back it up. I challenge you to prove that I am anything but one hundred percent reliable. (Changed from [I challenge you to prove that I am anything but 100% reliable.] in the original release) Apollo: It would be my pleasure. Lately, it seems that the doctor's eyes had gotten so bad, he needed reading glasses. However, his reading glasses were over on his desk. So you see, there's no way he could've been reading a book in front of the bookshelves! Atishon: Hrrrrrrngh! Apollo: I'm sorry, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, but... ...I'm going to have to ask you to explain this discrepancy to the voting public! Atishon: Ngah, gah gah gah! I-I-I... Apollo: You what? Atishon: I-I'll explain it, you lowly cur! I simply made a mistake, you see. The doctor was actually sitting at his desk when Mr. Are'bal hit him over the head! Apollo: But then the doctor would have been facing him. Surely he would've seen him and tried to run? Atishon: D-Dr. Buff was nodding off! I could tell because he his eyes were closed, and he wasn't moving! Apollo: (Sounds more like what you would do.) Then how do you explain the back that he was struck in the back of the head? Isn't that something that should be impossible from the front of the desk? Atishon: ...Oh, um... About that... H-He... He bowed his head when he nodded off. That's when he was clobbered. Judge: Hmm... So that's what you saw. Well, Mr. Justice, that sounds like a perfectly reasonable explanation to me. Do you have a problem with the proposal that the doctor was struck while nodding off? No problem Apollo: No problem here, Your Honor. The doctor was probably dozing, just as the witness said. Athena: N-No, Apollo! Wait! If you accept that, then you might as well admit Datz killed the doctor. Apollo: ...Your Honor! I, uh, actually do have a problem with that statement... Judge: Very well. But let's avoid careless answers like that, or I will have a problem with you! Apollo: (Guess I blew that one.) Judge: Now, as you were saying, Mr. Justice? Leads to: \"There is a problem. A very big problem.\" A big problem Leads to: \"There is a problem. A very big problem.\" Apollo: There is a problem. A very big problem. The witness's statement doesn't hold up under the slightest bit of scrutiny! Judge: Is that so? Then will you please show this court what evidence you have to justify this? Apollo: Gladly, Your Honor. This shows the problem with the witness's claim that he saw the doctor nodding off! Present Study Diagram Apollo: Leads to: \"...A diagram of the study?\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: This shows the glaring problem with the witness's statement! Atishon: ...............Zzz... Apollo: See? The witness has passed out from the overwhelming power of my evidence! Phoenix: No, Mr. Justice. Your lackadaisical attempt to refute him put my client to sleep. That's all. Judge: I feel a yawn coming on myself. Perhaps giving you this penalty will wake me up. Apollo: Surely there are better ways to stay awake, Your Honor? Athena: Apollo, think about the relative positions of the witness and doctor again. Apollo: Right. That's where we'll find the contradiction. Judge: Now then, Mr. Justice. See that you avoid these snooze-incusing answers in the future. Leads back to: \"This shows the problem with the witness's claim that he saw the doctor nodding off!\" Judge: ...A diagram of the study? Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson allegedly viewed the murder from... ...here. And the doctor was allegedly nodding off... ...here. But from his vantage point, the bookcase would've blocked the witness's line of sight. Judge: Why, yes, I believe you're right! Atishon: B-B-But...! Arrrgh! Phoenix: Phoenix: The fact remains, my client knew that the suitcase was the murder weapon. So he definitely had first-hand knowledge of the crime scene! Apollo: I'm afraid I have to agree with you there, Mr. Wright. But then we have to ask ourselves, from what vantage point did he see the murder? Phoenix: What are you insinuating, Mr. Justice? Apollo: From what vantage point could Mr. Atishon-Wimperson have seen the dozing doctor? Once we determine that, I believe we'll finally see the truth behind this incident. The witness saw the murder from... right here! Present area between Bookshelf and Coffee Bar Apollo: Leads to: \"You've got to be kidding!\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Phoenix: How could he have seen it from there? Apollo: Oh, umm... He just did somehow? I mean, I just feel like it must've been from there. Athena: Um, Apollo? for some reason, I feel like you're wrong. Judge: Hmm... And for some reason, I feel like giving you a penalty. Apollo: (So much for that spot.) Athena: Hmm... Looking at it in another way... ...where must Mr. Atishon-Wimperson have been standing to see the doctor nodding off? Apollo: Someplace where the bookcase wasn't blocking his view, I guess. Judge: Now then. Will the defense please indicate where the witness saw the murder from? Leads back to: \"The witness saw the murder from... right here!\" Phoenix: You've got to be kidding! Judge: B-But that's--! Apollo: It is indeed. But everything only makes sense if the witness was there in the study. Athena: I-Inside the study? But that's the scene of the crime! Apollo: I know. Mr. Atishon-Wimperson -- the man who claims to be a witness to the murder... ...was most certainly in that very room. Athena: A-Apollo, are you suggesting...? Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson! Weren't YOU the one who actually swung that suitcase? Atishon: Gaaaaaaaaaaah! Phoenix: Phoenix: What you're proposing is ludicrous! My client is a small, thin man, whereas Mr. Are'bal had the musculature to pull it off. Apollo: ......... (He has a point... I gave up trying to lift that thing after one go.) Atishon: That's right. He's the only one who could've lifted such a heavy object. Now do you understand? The rebel Datz Are'bal is the doctor's killer! Athena: As long as the suitcase is the murder weapon, the suspicion falls entirely on Datz. You'll have to poke a hole in Mr. Wright's argument somehow, Apollo. Apollo: Oh, I will. And with his own technique, no less. If Mr. Atishon-Wimperson couldn't swing the suitcase around... ...we'll just have to consider another way he could've used it as a murder weapon instead. I'm going to turn this case on its head, Mr. Wright, just like you taught me. Phoenix: ...You talk big, Mr. Justice, but do you have what it takes? Judge: Well, this should be interesting... Apollo:: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson's testimony has been filled with one inaccuracy after another. First he stated Dr. Buff was in front of the bookshelves. Now he claims that the doctor was sitting at his desk. So where was the victim REALLY when he was killed? Also, where was his killer, and how was the murder weapon REALLY used? Judge: So the important thing here is the position of the victim and killer related to each other? Apollo: Yes, Your Honor. If they were positioned a certain way... ...it would be possible to use the suitcase as a weapon without lifting a finger. Phoenix: You can't mean...! Apollo: I would ask the court to recall the study's layout. It's quite distinctive, as you can see. Now, if Dr. Buff were sitting in a certain spot, and his killer was at a certain other spot... ...the suitcase would become a weapon ANYONE could use! Judge: Hmm... Very well, Mr. Justice. Where was Dr. Buff's killer at the time of the crime? Present balcony west of Coffee Bar Apollo: Leads to: \"Th-There...?!\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Judge: How could the murder have been committed from there? Phoenix: Yes, I would love to see a demonstration. Apollo: ...Um, well... I can't from here. Judge: Well, I have a demonstration for you from here... on how to give a penalty. Apollo: (So much for that spot.) Athena: If the killer didn't swing the suit case, there aren't many other ways to use it as a weapon. Apollo: I know. And there aren't that many places to use it from, either. Judge: Now then. I hope the defense is ready to try again. Leads back to: \"Where was Dr. Buff's killer at the time of the crime?\" Judge: Th-There...?! Phoenix: Oh... That's... Apollo: This should wrap things up nice and pretty for you, Mr. Wright. I would ask the court to recall the study's layout. But this time, instead of thinking in two dimensions... ...let's think in three. Only then can we clearly see the killer's method at work. The killer didn't have to swing the suitcase. ...If he used gravity to his advantage, that is. That's right. It was the plaintiff -- one Paul Atishon-Wimperson -- who used the suitcase. He pushed it from the second floor... ...and sent it hurtling down onto Dr. Buff, who was sitting at the coffee bar! Atishon: Yaaaaaaargh! Apollo: That psychology book had been at the coffee bar, no doubt. The doctor must have set it down there after he'd finished reading it, or the like. But his blood got on it, which is why the killer thought to hide it in that mountain of books! Phoenix: Phoenix: That's quite an entertaining theory you have there, Mr. Justice. But there's no evidence that the murder took place at the coffee bar. Apollo: ......... (I'm not so sure about that, Mr. Wright. I'd say that evidence of the murder occurring at the coffee bar...) Exists Leads to: \"The evidence does exist, and I'm going to show you.\" Does not exist Apollo: Obviously, there is none! Phoenix: Just as I thought. So, if the coffee bar isn't where the doctor was killed... ...the defense's little theory fails to bear fruit Judge: Hmm... Mr. Wright is correct, of course. Apollo: Urk! ...Umm... Athena: Don't just stand there, Apollo! If you don't do something quick, we're going to lose both the orb AND the creep, together! Apollo: I'm thinking... I'm thinking... Oh! (Wait a second... There IS a piece of evidence that proves the doctor was killed at the coffee bar!) Phoenix: So, such evidence never existed in the first place, did it? Leads to: \"The evidence does exist, and I'm going to show you.\" Apollo: The evidence does exist, and I'm going to show you. Phoenix: Y-You are? Apollo: This, right here, is proof that the murder took place at the coffee bar. Present stained book Apollo: Leads to: \"This brown stain was determined to be coffee.\" Present anything else Apollo: Judge: Hmm... I don't understand how that could be proof of anything. Apollo: You don't, Your Honor? Well, I believe Mr. Wright understands perfectly. Phoenix: All I know is, it's perfectly clear you don't understand what you're talking about. Judge: Now that is something I can understand. Apollo: (Me too... Oww.) Athena: Apollo, let's take another look at that crime scene photo. Maybe there's something in it related to the coffee bar. Apollo: I've got it this time! Leads back to: \"This, right here, is proof that the murder took place at the coffee bar.\" Apollo: This brown stain was determined to be coffee. What's more, it was still a bit damp when we saw it yesterday morning. Phoenix: Ah! Apollo: One look at this book speaks volumes, I'm afraid, Mr. Wright. It tells us the doctor was having a cup of coffee at the coffee bar. That's when the suitcase came hurtling down, striking him on the head... ...causing both his blood and his coffee to spatter onto it! Phoenix: Ack! Atishon: Aaaaaaagh! Apollo: Well, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson?! Atishon: .........Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh... What motive could I have possibly had to kill Dr. Buff?! Apollo: (And there it is. That final excuse cornered killers are so fond of.) Well, the doctor never returned your \"crystal\" to you, did he? Instead, he hid it in the cave ruins. Atishon: Nngh... Apollo: Telling him that the Defiant Dragons were a dangerous bunch was a huge blunder. All it did was make him hide the orb. Your lie came back to bite you in the end. Atishon: Uhhh... Apollo: Even worse, the doctor saw the news reports, so he knew the relic was the Founder's Orb. Being the conscientious researcher he was, he knew he had to return it to its rightful place... ...and that meant keeping it out of your hands. Atishon: Aaaaaaaaaaaaah... Apollo: You were so angry that he refused to return the relic to you... ...that you killed him with your own hands. Isn't that right, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Atishon: Arrrrrraaaaaagh! .........I-I-I... Th-That is... Phoenix: Phoenix: ...A-Apollo! Don't! Please don't accuse my client of murder! Apollo: .........Huh? What do you mean, \"don't accuse him\"? Why would you even say that, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: ...Er, what I meant was, um... He's a promising politician with a bright future ahead of him. It's in our nation's best interests to avoid burdening him with the taint of scandal. Apollo: Say what? Atishon: Wright! You'd better do something to change the current courtroom climate... ...or I'll be charged with murder! And you know what will happen to her if that happens. Phoenix: ...Arngh! Apollo: (What's he talking about? Well, I can ponder that later. For now...) Mr. Wright, you can't possibly believe that Mr. Are'bal is the killer. Are you really going to send an innocent man to prison? I thought you were better than that. Phoenix: Uhhh... Ummm... Apollo: Well, Mr. Wright? Answer me! Phoenix: Errr... Ummm... UUHWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH! Apollo: M-M-Mr. Wright? ...What in the world's going on here? Athena: ......... Apollo: ...If you won't say anything, then...! Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, the defense hereby accuses you of-- Athena: Athena: A-Apollo! Wait! Apollo: Not you, too, Athena! Athena: Umm... It's just, uhhh... I wasn't sure whether I should say anything, but... ...during that last recess, when I went to check on Mr. Wright... ...I overheard something I shouldn't have. Phoenix: I trust Maya is unharmed. Atishon: I can't really say. But just remember... If I'm arrested or fail to obtain the treasure... ...there will be consequences. Consequences of the worst kind, if you catch my drift. Phoenix: Augh! Atishon: Relax. All you have to do is ensure I get my hands on that relic. I must deliver it to my benefactor at all costs. Phoenix: What do they want that relic for anyway? Atishon: Heh heh heh. It's something to do with an old legend. My patron seeks the great power said to be granted to whoever solves its secret. Apollo: ....Maya? As in Maya Fey? Athena: Yes, the boss's legendary former assistant. Apollo: Ms. Fey's being held hostage? Athena: So it seems. Apollo: Why didn't you tell me as soon as you heard this? Athena: Sorry. It's just, Mr. Wright spotted me before I could slip away... ...and made me promise not to tell you. He said it would make things more difficult if you found out. Apollo: Arngh! As if things weren't already hard enough! (So that's why Mr. Wright was acting so strange. I had no idea. This must've been excruciating for him. Think, Justice... There's got to be something you can do!) Judge: Mr. Justice, about that last statement of yours... I believe you were in the middle of accusing the plaintiff of murdering Dr. Buff... Would you care to continue? Apollo: Ack! I-I... Phoenix: Nngh... I'm sorry, Apollo... I'm really, really sorry. Judge: What's gotten into you two? Apollo: ......... (If I accuse that slimebag, I put Ms. Fey's life in jeopardy.) Atishon: Heh heh heh. It seems you've finally caught on. I'm far too important to be accused of murder. After all, our nation's future rests squarely on my shoulders. Apollo: (Nnrgh... Either I give up, or...) Atishon: Once I present the crystal to my patron, my victory is assured! Then one day, I'll become president -- and then, king! I'll have every politician at my command! Now, retract your accusation! Apollo: Arrrrrrnnngh! (I can't kowtow to him, but... but...) The defense would... It would like to retract... the previous accusati-- ???: Dhurke: ...Apollo. Apollo: Dh-Dhurke? Dhurke: I don't know what's going on here... ...but a lawyer should never look the way you do right now... ... with \"defeat\" and \"resignation\" written all over your face. Apollo: ! .........A dragon never yields. Dhurke: Even when wounded, a dragon bites down hard, and never lets go till its dying breath. It glares, it roars, and it latches its jaws firmly onto its prey till the bitter end. That's what lawyers do to get to the truth! Apollo: ...Dhurke. (A dragon never yields... ...He's right. It's all over if I give up now! If Mr. Wright's hands are tied, it's up to me to do what must be done! He's saved my neck so many times. Now... it's my turn to save his!) ...Dhurke, thanks for that wake up call. Dhurke: Heh, now that's the face of a lawyer you've got there, son. Apollo: (Where there's a will, there's a way. And I'm going to find the way to save Ms. Fey AND see that justice is served!) Apollo: That scumbag is holding Ms. Fey hostage to ensure he gets the orb for his patron. And it seems said patron believes in the orb's legend. Thing is, the founder DID appear when the orb was exposed to fire, as the legend said. If the legend is true, then we've already solved the riddle, right? Yes, we have Apollo: Yes, we've definitely solved the riddle! ...And yet... ...we still don't understand what the part about \"bestowing power\" is talking about. I need to rethink this! Leads back to: \"If the legend is true, then we've already solved the riddle, right?\" No, not yet Leads to: \"We have not solved the riddle yet\" We have not solved the riddle yet Apollo: The legend says that the founder will bestow great spiritual power when she returns. But if that's true, it means we haven't solved the whole riddle yet. But how can that be? Are we missing something? ...Wait, maybe... Maybe the part about the founder returning should be taken literally. But how would it be possible for a dead person to return to the world of the living? Cloning Apollo: Oh, I know! Cloning technology! I bet some of the founder's DNA is hidden somewhere in the orb. ...Argh, what am I talking about? They didn't know about DNA and cloning back then. I'd better think of something else. Leads back to: \"But how would it be possible for a dead person to return to the world of the living?\" Channeling Leads to: \"The founder can return though channeling\" Time travel Apollo: Oh, I know! Time travel! We could go back to the past and bring the founder here to the present. ...Wait, what am I saying? Maybe I should cut back on the sci-fi movies. I'd better think of something else. Leads back to: \"But how would it be possible for a dead person to return to the world of the living?\" The founder can return though channeling Apollo: Oh, I know! here IS a way for the dead to return -- spirit channeling! Of course, you'd have to know what he founder looks like first... ...but the orb has revealed her face to us, so what if it's a sign that we should channel her? Given the facts, in order to solve the riddle and receive the founder's power, I'd need... A spirit medium Leads to: \"A MEDIUM IS NEEDED TO OBTAIN THE POWER\" To practice channeling Apollo: All I have to do is train as a spirit medium, so I can channel spirits myself! ...Wait, it can't be that easy. And if I ever did become a medium, I wouldn't need the founder's power anymore anyway. Leads back to: \"Given the facts, in order to solve the riddle and receive the founder's power, I'd need...\" A MEDIUM IS NEEDED TO OBTAIN THE POWER Apollo: The ability of a medium to channel spirits is the final key to unlocking the orb's secret. That means Mr. Atishon-Wimperson's patron will need one, too. And once that slimy politician realizes that, he won't be able to lay a finger on Ms. Fey! Apollo: Everything is going to be okay, Mr. Wright. Because Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson can't afford to harm a hair on Ms. Fey's head. Phoenix: ............Huh? Apollo: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson! It seems you've chosen the wrong person to take hostage. Atishon: Wh-What do you mean? Apollo: Your patron seeks to solve the orb's riddle... ...and thereby receive great spiritual power. However, only Maya Fey can truly give them what they really want. Phoenix: She can? Atishon: What do you mean, \"only Maya Fey\"? Apollo: Think about what the return of the founder really means. We should have considered it more literally. After all, the orb was made in the Kingdom of Khura'in -- the birthplace of spirit mediums. Phoenix: ...Ahh, I think I see now. You need to know what the deceased looks like in order to channel them. But in Khura'inism, depicting the face of the founder is taboo. However, her true face was hidden in the orb. So maybe the orb is telling us... to try channeling the founder. Apollo: Exactly. Through a spirit medium, the founder can quite literally return. And if the legend is true... ...the founder just might bestow spiritual power on someone when she does. Phoenix: It's like when Pearls imbued my magatama with spiritual power. If a human could be imbued with such power in a similar manner... Dhurke: It is said the founder possesses immense spiritual power. Such a great feat would not necessarily be beyond her-- W-Wait a second! Th-Then the legend is true?! Apollo: Do you understand now, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? You are holding hostage the final key to unlocking the orb's secret. And if anything were to happen to her, the riddle would remain unsolved, forever! Atishon: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Atishon: Atishon: Th-Th-There's always Pearl Fey! I could simply ask her to help! If she wants money, I have plenty to offer! Apollo: She's not the kind of person to be tempted by material gain. And she certainly wouldn't help you if anything were to happen to her cousin. Atishon: Urhgk. Apollo: Or maybe you'd like to go ask the queen of Khura'in to channel the founder for you. Phoenix: He could, but he'd probably get executed for requesting such a thing. Apollo: ...It's over. Now, confess! You killed Dr. Buff, didn't you? Atishon: Ack! Hrrrrrrrrrrrrrngh! It wasn't supposed to end this way! Judge: Mr. Atishon-Wimperson. Are you admitting to committing the crime? Atishon: Errr... Um, I-I-I... You're my lawyer, Wright! Do something! Phoenix: It's true that I'm your lawyer. And as such, it's my job to defend you. ...However, defending my client isn't the only job a lawyer has. There's something else that's equally as important. And that is finding the truth. Atishon: Wh-What? Phoenix Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, you have sought to twist the truth in the dirtiest of ways. I was complicit in your hostage-taking, but in a way, I was being held hostage, too. Even so, there's still time for me to make things right. And I owe it all to you, Apollo. Apollo: ! (Mr. Wright...) Phoenix: I can't allow a murderer to walk away scot-free! Therefore, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, I must resign as your attorney. Atishon: No no no no noooo! D-Does this mean... I'm under arrest? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! ........................ ............... .................................... ........................ Apollo: ...Well? Atishon: ...I've nothing to confess. Apollo: What?! Atishon: I said, I've nothing to confess! I don't and I won't, especially not to a plebeian like you! Apollo: (This guy doesn't know when to give up.) Atishon: Besides, there's no truth to these allegations! I mean, look at the suitcase. You won't find a single print of mine on it! Apollo: All that means is that you wiped them off, taking care to only leave Mr. Are'bal's. Atishon: Heh heh heh. As many a great politician has said before me: no comment. Phoenix: In that case, try switching things up, Apollo. Look at the situation from a different angle. Is there really nothing that points to the suitcase being dropped from up above? Apollo: Hmmm... Evidence that points to the suitcase being dropped from the second floor... Athena: Hmm... If the killer pushed the suitcase from the second floor hallway over the coffee bar... ...that would place him right around here. Apollo: Ah! Maybe... Just maybe...! Phoenix: Thought of something, Apollo? Apollo: I believe this piece of evidence to be connected to the dropping of the suitcase. Present Armie's Statement Apollo: Leads to: \"That... appears to be a statement. But how is that related to this case?\" Present anything else Apollo: Atishon: Wh-What is that?! Phoenix: Apollo, I don't see how that could possibly be related. Atishon: ...Oh, it's not? Tsk, I just wasted a perfectly good reaction! Your Honor! Penalize this pernicious peon! Judge: Hmm.. Yes, well, we all must be held accountable for our words and actions. Apollo: (What do you think I'm trying to do with Mr. Atishon-Wimperson, Your Honor?!) Athena: So the killer dropped the suitcase from above the coffee bar. Apollo: Right. Let's look again to see if we have any evidence related to that event. Phoenix: Come on, Apollo. I'm counting on you. Leads back to: \"I believe this piece of evidence to be connected to the dropping of the suitcase.\" Judge: That... appears to be a statement. But how is that related to this case? Apollo: On the night of the murder, Your Honor, Miss Armie Buff physically left her room. That's when she saw the doctor burning the orb, and subsequently passed out. ...Right above the coffee bar. But with her there in her wheelchair... ...the killer wouldn't have been able to drop the suitcase down onto the doctor. Phoenix: Good point! Apollo: However, according to Sarge... ...she woke up just as someone was trying to move her in her wheelchair. Phoenix: Ah! Armie: ...someone was pushing my wheelchair. Apollo: What?! Armie: I was so scared, I beat a hasty retreat -- as fast as my wheels could take me! Apollo: She must've been in the killer's way and had to be moved. Isn't that right, Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Atishon: ...Agrk! Phoenix: And if the killer had pushed the wheelchair with his bare hands... ...we may yet find the conclusive evidence we need. Apollo: Exactly. Fortunately for us, that evidence slipped right through the killer's fingers. If only he'd been able to hold on to it just a little tighter. But now, he is neither able to discard nor alter it. Phoenix: Honestly, that piece of evidence wasn't even supposed to be here in this courtroom today. And yet... it looks like sometimes, things DO get better. Atishon: Unngh! B-B-B-B-But...! Th-This... This wasn't supposed to happen! Apollo: No? Well, too bad. Because the evidence that sped away from you that night... ...has come back to haunt you! Right here at this very trial! Atishon: ARGH! UHWAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!! Apollo: Your Honor! The defense's final piece of evidence is on this person! Present Armie Buff profile Apollo: Leads to: \"Th-That's...!\" Present anyone else Apollo: Phoenix: ...Apollo? Apollo: Yes, Mr. Wright? Athena: Umm, I think he's saying that that doesn't jive with anything you've said so far. Judge: It seems Ms. Cykes is the more sensible of you two. Apollo: (Ugh... No need to compare the two of us...) Phoenix: What did the killer have to move in order to drop the suitcase? Consider that, and the rest should follow. Apollo: Okay, I'll get it for sure this time! Leads back to: \"Your Honor! The defense's final piece of evidence is on this person!\" Atishon: Th-That's...! Apollo: On the night of the murder, Sarge passed out... ...only to come to and find that someone was pushing her wheelchair. That's when she fled back into her room. Phoenix: She didn't physically see a single soul after that... Not until Athena drew her out through that therapy session, that is. Apollo: While the killer was able to wipe the prints on the suitcase off... (Changed from [While the killer was able to wipe the prints on the suitcase...] in the original release) ...the same can't be said for the prints that got away. Atishon: Ah. Ah. M-My fellow Kurainians... Apollo: Well, Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson? Try to explain your way out of this one! The podium is all yours! Atishon: Ah. Ah. P-Paul Atishon, savior of Kurain... I-I... I am not a crook... I... My political career...! It can't end like this! I-I'm destined for great things! Something's wrong... This isn't real! It's a dream! No, a nightmare! Ooooooooooooh. Huh? What? ...Wait? ...Really? Ah! Election ResultsWINNER Atishon: Ahhhhhh! Whoa, no waaaaaaaaay!!! BANZAI! BANZAI! BANZAI! BANZAI!!! Breaking NewsPaul Atishon arrested on murder charges and stripped of his electoral win. Atishon: ...Wait, what? ...............No, please. Wait. Don't go! No... No... Please...Whoa! Grandpaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! ........................ Judge: M-Mr. Atishon-Wimperson? Are you all right? ...B-Bailiff! Get him to the first-aid station, on the double! Judge: Well, this was yet another unexpected turn of events. In light of everything that's been revealed, it seems that this relic is indeed the Founder's Orb. And it seems Mr. Paul Atishon-Wimperson can be considered a suspect in Dr. Buff's murder. Phoenix: Apollo, I want to thank you for everything. Apollo: ! Phoenix: Thanks to you, I didn't have to keep bending the truth. I don't know what I would've done without you. Apollo: Er, don't mention it, ha ha ha... Athena: You were amazing today, Apollo! Apollo: (Well, I couldn't have done it without Dhurke.) .........A dragon never yields. Dhurke: Even when wounded, a dragon bites down hard, and never lets go till its dying breath. It glares, it roars, and it latches its jaws firmly onto its prey till the bitter end. That's what lawyers do to get the truth! Apollo: (A dragon never yields... Every lawyer should take that to heart.) Judge: As it seems both sides have no further objections... ...would Dhurke Sahdmadhi please take the stand? Dhurke: .......... Judge: This court awards the orb to the Defiant Dragons per the stated transfer agreement. Should the Kingdom of Khura'in claim ownership... ...the matter may have to be deliberated in court all over again. I just hope, or shall I say pray, that I'm not the judge presiding over that one! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Indeed! A trial like that might spark an international incident. Still, there are bigger and more momentous things astir in the air! Apollo: (The revolution... Dhurke's really serious about this.) Judge: This court is adjourned! May 17District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Dhurke: Nice work, son! We've finally broken through the last obstacle on the road to revolution! Apollo: Revolution... It just doesn't seem real. Dhurke: Yes, well, to think you actually defeated the Fighting Phoenix... All I can say is, that's my boy! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (Well, Mr. Wright did have his hands tied. Who knows if I'd have won if he'd been able to fight me head-on.) Athena: I see it more like you saved Mr. Wright. Apollo: ...Saved him? Athena: Yeah, remember what he said? He didn't have to bend the truth anymore, and it was all thanks to you! Apollo: I don't know about that. (Still, I guess it IS kinda nice to be appreciated.) Trucy: ...Um, Mr. Dhurke? Now that the Holy Mother's face has been revealed... ...are you going to have a spirit medium try channeling her? I, for one, would love to see the return of the legendary founder! Apollo: Yeah, just think about it. Being able to speak to someone right out of the history books... Dhurke: Unfortunately, it's not that easy. Apollo: What? Why? Dhurke: A face isn't enough. You also need the true name of the one you're attempting to channel. Apollo: Oh, right. Pearl mentioned something like that. Dhurke: And the founder's name is only known to the priestess who's been crowned queen. In short, the only living person who knows it is the current queen of Khura'in, Ga'ran. Apollo: Oh, so without her help, we won't be seeing the founder anytime soon? Trucy: Tsk, that's no fun. Founder's Orb updated in the Court Record. Apollo: So, Dhurke, what will you do now? Dhurke: First, I'll start by tracing the route by which the orb came into Dr. Buff's hands. Apollo: Since we now know it was Paul Atishon that asked the doctor to study it... ...isn't he the one who stole it? Dhurke: No, a political nobody like him couldn't get anywhere near the orb, let alone steal it. He must've had inside help. My money is on someone connected to the royal family. Apollo: Oh, right. You said something to that effect back in the cave. Dhurke: Whoever it may be, we need to expose their dirty scheme to the light of day. Apollo: Well, I'm sure Mr. Wright has plenty of information, courtesy of his dirty client. He might be able to shed some light on this. ???: Private Justice! Sarge: That was fine work you did at the trial today! You did your sergeant proud! Apollo: Back at you, Sarge! It took real courage to leave your room like that. Armie: It's all thanks to you and Corpswoman Cykes. With my siege defense over, I can finally sally forth. Sarge: But the battle's only just begun! One for me, and me alone, to fight! Athena: To lose your mother, and then your father... What a terrible thing to endure. Apollo: Yeah... (And being wheelchair-bound doesn't help.) Armie: ...Private Justice! I've been thinking... It's about time I stood on my own two feet. After all, I no longer have Papa to coddle me! Apollo: Huh? I'm afraid I don't follow. Armie: ...Take a good look, soldier. This is one small step for man... ...and one giant leap for me! ......... Hold my drone for me, would you, Private Justice? Apollo: Y-Yes, sir. (What she is up to?) Armie: .........Hrgh! Wh-Whoa... Apollo: Sh-Sh-She's... standing?! Dhurke: Wh-What's this?! Sarge! You mean your legs... They're...?! Armie: The doctor told me that I was ready to walk again months ago. But if I admitted I could walk, I knew I would have to leave the house. So I... I faked it. Apollo: (Makes sense, but...) Armie: I kept pretending I couldn't walk. But I know Papa is watching over me now, and I'd hate to disappoint him. So, from this day forth, I'm going to march forward on my own two feet! Apollo: (What a brave kid, trying to move forward like this. But it must be so hard this soon after her father's death.) Dhurke: Don't you ever stop. You just keep on walking... comrade. Stay brave, because there will be days when you want to stop... ...but I have faith you'll find a way to muster the strength to push through them. Apollo: Yeah, you can do it. Trucy: Hey, Daddy's back! Phoenix: .................. Apollo: Mr. Wright! (What's that look on his face for?) Phoenix: Oh, Apollo! Apollo: Um, is everything all right with Ms. Fey? Phoenix: She's safe... for now. Athena: Well then, we'd better go save her, quick! Where is she, anyway? Phoenix: ...I'm afraid I have some bad news. Apollo: Huh? Phoenix: Maya's... not here in the States. She's still in Khura'in. And she's still being held hostage by the mastermind behind this whole thing. Apollo: The mastermind? Phoenix: ...That's right. Paul Atishon-Wimperson was nothing more than a pawn. Maya's true abductor is in the Kingdom of Khura'in. Apollo: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaat?! I-I don't understand, Mr. Wright! What in the world's going on over there?! Apollo: But as shocking as that news was... ...it was only the beginning. The beginning of something big -- big enough to shake Khura'in to its very core. ...Revolution. I was being swept up in a mighty wave that nothing could stop. Of course, at the time... I had no idea what the days ahead had in store for us... To be continued Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: Please take a look at this piece of evidence. Judge: I'm looking... But what am I supposed to see? Apollo: Oh, um... Uhhh... Phoenix: As your boss and mentor, here's a bit of advice: Never present evidence before you have a good grasp of the situation at hand. Apollo: R-Right... Sorry... Judge: And as the presiding judge, here's a penalty. Apollo: (Ouch. Double-teamed for doing what Mr. Wright always does anyway.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: That statement contradicts with this piece of evidence! Judge: Hmmm... And just how does it contradict with the evidence, Mr. Justice? Apollo: Um... Could I have about five minutes to figure out the answer to that? Judge: The defense will figure it out before he presents his evidence next time! Apollo: (Sounds like a plan...) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: There's... something off about that statement... Judge: Hmm... It seemed perfectly reasonable to me. Apollo: No, something's definitely not right if you listen really carefully! Phoenix: A gambler once sang, you've got to know when to hold 'em, when to fold 'em... Judge: Oh, I love this one! ...Know when to walk away, know when to run! Apollo: (I don't know which penalty hurts more: the judge's or their singing.) Consult (when evidence must be presented) Athena: Is it just me, or does that statement sound a bit dubious? Apollo: You know what... you're right. Thanks, Athena! Athena: Anytime! Apollo: (Now to take another look at the evidence...) Consult (when statements must be pressed) Athena: You look like you've hit a brick wall, Apollo. Apollo: Yeah. It feels like I have, too. Athena: Maybe you just haven't brought all the facts to light. Why don't you try pressing a little more? Apollo: Good idea. (Okay, time to turn up the pressure!) Pinpoint wrong emotion (during Mood Matrix segment in the chapter \"Cross-Examining Sarge\") Apollo: Athena: Hmm... This emotion isn't that out of place, given this statement... Apollo, are you just looking at his emotions as they relate to only a single statement? It's really important to look for emotional fluctuation between different statements, too. Apollo: Oh, right. Thanks for the reminder, Athena. (All right, let's try that again.) Probe wrong area (during Mood Matrix segment in the chapter \"Cross-Examining Sarge\") Apollo: Athena: That doesn't seem to be the cause of his current emotional state. Apollo: I could sure use a clue or two right about now. Athena: A person's personality and past shapes their emotional responses. Consider everything you know about Sarge. That's where you'll find the clues you need. Apollo: (Everything I know about Sarge...) Presenting wrong evidence during the Mood Matrix Apollo: Apollo: There's an inconsistency in Sarge's testimony! Judge: Is that so? Would you be so kind as to point it out to the court? Apollo: ...Well if you're going to put me on the spot like that, I admit my confidence is waning. Judge: ...I could say the same about my confidence in you, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Ugh. (I wish you wouldn't, Your Honor.) Athena: Say, Apollo... Sarge is saying that his father was burning the orb when he was killed... ...but doesn't that seem funny to you? Considering what the doctor was up that night, it doesn't add up. Apollo: Well, now that you mention it... (All right, I'd better look through the evidence one more time.) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The Defiant Dragons have failed to sufficiently show their right to the item in question. Therefore, ownership is hereby awarded to... ...the plaintiff, Mr. Paul Atishon. Apollo: That creep Paul Atishon stole the Founder's Orb right out of our hands. The dream of revolution in the Kingdom of Khura'in died that day. And we returned to our daily lives. As for my relationship with Mr. Wright... The word awkward comes to mind. Let's just say it was never really the same. Turnabout Revolution Image Gallery Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 May 17District Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Apollo: What do you mean Ms. Fey is still being held hostage? And who's this \"mastermind\"? Phoenix: ...Paul Atishon-Wimperson was nothing more than a puppet. His benefactor was the one pulling the strings. But I have no idea who they are. Apollo: So all we know is it's the person he was trying to give the orb to? Phoenix: Right. He was just following orders. Whoever it is, it seems they really want to get their hands on the orb. Apollo: So then, Ms. Fey's abduction is the work of this so-called \"benefactor,\" too? Phoenix: Right again. Whoever they are, they're in Khura'in... ...along with Maya. Apollo: I wonder who they could be. Dhurke: Wright, this Maya -- the spirit medium you've been talking about... She wouldn't happen to be that bun-haired young lady you defended back in Khura'in? Phoenix: That's her. Why do you ask? Dhurke: I see... I think I know what's going on here.  I've got good news for you, Wright. Maya is somewhere safe. That much I'm sure of. Phoenix: ...I'm afraid you've lost me. Dhurke: Heh heh heh. So that's who the little snot's patron is. It's all starting to make sense. That fool has no idea I'm here in the States with you all. Apollo: Dhurke, you mind filling us in? Phone: .......................................... Phoenix: ...! ...No caller ID. I wonder who's calling? Phone: *beep* Phoenix: Hello? Phone: Mr. Phoenix Wright, yes? Let me start by thanking you... ...for taking such good care of my subordinate. Phoenix: Wh-Who is this? Phone: I believe you know me as Mr. Atishon's... \"benefactor.\" Phoenix: Ah! Apollo: (Sounds like they're using a voice changer or something to disguise themself.) Phoenix: Where's Maya?! Is she safe?! Phone: ...I had my ears on today's proceedings. What a shock it was to hear that the key to solving the orb's riddle is a spirit medium. I admit, I did not see that coming. Apollo: (Wait, did they plant a listening device in here somehow?) Phone: Nevertheless, don't think for a minute that it will guarantee Maya Fey's safety. She is not the only medium within my reach, you see. Phoenix: You harm a hair on Maya's head and you'll have to answer to me! Dhurke: ...Wright, give it here a sec. Phoenix: Wait! Dhurke: Hey, there. How's it going, stranger? Phone: ...Who is this? Dhurke: Why, it's your friendly neighborhood dragon. I just happen to be in the U.S. on a little trip. ...Minister of Justice Inga Karkhuul Khura'in. Phoenix: I-Inga?! Apollo: What?! Phoenix: Maya's kidnapper... Apollo: ...Is Khura'in's... Minister of Justice? Inga: Dh-Dhurke?! Is that you, ya dirty turncoat?! How in the--! What in blazes is going on here?! Dhurke: Oh, you know, just popped over to the States for a little R&R. But enough about me, Inga. That was a poor excuse for a bluff you pulled just now. We both know your threats are as empty as your head. You can't lay a hand on Maya Fey, and I do mean that literally. Inga: Ugh! Apollo: (What is he talking about?) Dhurke: You can kiss your chances of getting the orb goodbye. Inga: ...Heh heh heh. Maya Fey ain't my only... how shall I say... insurance, you know, Dhurke. Dhurke: What? Inga: I've got someone dear to you right in the palm of my hand, see? Now that one, well... You can imagine what kinds of things I could do, right? Dhurke: ! ............ Inga: Heh heh. Glad you're seeing things my way. Meet me at Amara's Tomb tomorrow, 3 PM sharp. And you better come alone, got it? If all goes well, the orb is all you'll need to get Maya Fey back. Dhurke: ......... Apollo: Dh-Dhurke, what's going on? Dhurke: You heard him. I have to get back to Khura'in at once. Apollo: What?! Why?! Dhurke: No time to explain. Apollo: But are you even going to make it? What if there are no seats left on the next flight? Plus, you're a wanted man. They're not just going to let you get on a plane. ???: Let me worry about that, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Ch-Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth? What are you doing here? Edgeworth: Taking care of the hostage situation. Apollo: Oh, now that you mention it... ...Pearl did say that she saw you around in Kurain Village. Phoenix: I had him look into a few things while I was on my way back from Khura'in. ...Including Maya's situation, of course. Edgeworth: I was astonished to hear she was still in Khura'in earlier... ...but it explained why I found no connection between her and Mr. Atishon. Apollo: Sorry to interrupt, but going back to the plane situation... Edgeworth: I've taken the liberty of chartering one for us. It's ready to take off at any time. And I will do what's necessary to hide the fact that Dhurke Sahdmadhi is onboard. Apollo: ...Wow. (Must be nice to be chief prosecutor...) Edgeworth: Wright, we have no time to lose. We must head for Khura'in at once. Phoenix: ...Right. Athena: I'm going, too! After all, you're bound to need my help! Trucy: No fair! I wanna go, too! Phoenix: This isn't a vacation, Trucy. Besides, I'll need you to hold down the fort. Trucy: But Daddy! Apollo: (Guess I should also only bring what's necessary.) ...Sorry Trucy, but would you mind holding on to this stuff for me? Unnecessary evidence foisted onto Trucy. Trucy: Fine. But you'd better bring me back something besides just more evidence. Dhurke: Excellent. Now, let us make haste... to Khura'in! Apollo: And that's how our sudden trip to the Kingdom of Khura'in began. I never imagined I'd return to the country of my youth under such circumstances, though... May 18, 2:30 PMTehm'pul Temple Apollo: That was a long flight. It's already 2:30 in the afternoon. Talk about cutting it close. ........... (The Kingdom of Khura'in... This is no time to reminisce, but... ...I gotta say, this place sure brings back memories.) Phoenix: Hurry up, Apollo! Apollo: Right behind you! Dhurke: Amara's Tomb is located in the courtyard of Ga'ran Palace. We should have just enough time to get there. Athena: Then let's sprint there! Think you can keep up, Apollo? Apollo: S-Sure, no sweat! Edgeworth: I'll contact the royal family and the local police, and inform them of our arrival. Phoenix: Thanks, Edgeworth. Examine Athena: Apollo. I'm sure this place brings back memories, but could you reminisce later? Time's running out! Apollo: You're right. We have to find Ms. Fey before it's too late. Talk Any ideas? Athena: I know you probably want to reminisce and all, but there's no time for that right now! Apollo: You're right. We've got to get to Amara's Tomb with Ms. Fey is being held captive! Present Anything Athena: Apollo! Don't go showing me stuff for no reason! We have to find Ms. Fey before it's too late! May 18, 2:45 PMGa'ran Palace - Royal Residence Apollo: *huff, puff* *huff, puff* I wasn't made for all the running and climbing and near-drowning I've done this week. Phoenix: It's 2:45... Only fifteen minutes left. (Changed from [It's 2:45... Only 15 minutes left.] in the original release) Dhurke: See that cylindrical building rising in the distance? That's Amara's Tomb. Phoenix: Amara... Wasn't that the previous queen? The one who was assassinated? Dhurke: Yes. And I'm the one they pinned it on. Apollo: It will take a few minutes to get to the tomb from here. ???: So, you have returned... Barbed Head. Phoenix: Ah...! Apollo: (I've seen her before on the news. If I remember correctly, this is the crown princess Rayfa Padma Khura'in.) Rayfa: What are you people doing here? This is the Royal Residence! Commoners are not allowed entry without permission. Phoenix: A prosecutor from the States... ...should've already called and requested permission for us to enter. As to why we're here, Your Benevolence... Have you seen Minister Inga? Rayfa: If you seek my father, I just saw him heading toward Amara's Tomb. Phoenix: Was he with anyone? You know, like some shady-looking underlings or something? Rayfa: No, he was alone. Why do you ask? Apollo: (Looks like she has no idea about Ms. Fey's abduction.) Athena: You hear that? I think we have company. *stomp, stomp, stomp* Royal Guard: Bow down before her glooooooory!!! Her Eminence Queen Ga'ran, grand priestess of Khura'in approooooooooaches!!! Apollo: Huh? ...Ga'ran? Ahhh! I-It's--! Phoenix: ...Q-Queen Ga'ran! Ga'ran: ............... Guards... Surround Amara's Tomb at once! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence! Ur di'hara Ga'ran! Apollo: (What's she doing? Is she going to help us?) Phoenix: Excuse me, Your Eminence... Ga'ran: So, our \"Barbed Head\" lawyer returns. May we presume you are here for Maya Fey, the spirit medium who has been abducted? Phoenix: Y-Yes, you may! Ga'ran: Allow us to apologize for the criminal actions of our husband. Phoenix: Oh, um... no need to apologize for him! Ga'ran: Honestly, Inga... Abducting a guest in our country? How could you? Rayfa: Father... abducted someone? Phoenix: Your Eminence, what about those soldiers over there? Ga'ran: They are the Ga'ran Royal Guard, soldiers who serve the crown and no other. Apollo: Royal guard? Ga'ran: They are an elite force selected from only the most loyal and outstanding of our subjects. Apollo: And why have you ordered them to surround the tomb? Ga'ran: The police will not come if it is my husband who is committing the crime. We shall have to storm the tomb and take Minister Inga into custody ourselves! Apollo: Whaaat?! Y-You mean...? Dhurke: Ga'ran! No! His hostage is in there! Ga'ran: Dhurke! How dare you set foot in the palace! Have you come to turn yourself in?! Dhurke: Listen, we need to call a truce for now! Ga'ran: Ga'ran Royal Guard! Seize this traitor of the crown! Royal Guard: As you wiiiiiiish, Your Eminence! Resist and you diiiiiie! Apollo: W-Wait a second! Dhurke: Dhurke: Slow down there, Ga'ran. I'm here to conduct a hostage exchange. But if you take me in now, Maya Fey is as good as dead. Ga'ran: ...A hostage exchange? And why would he choose to do such a thing with you? Dhurke: We can talk about that later. Right now, I need to get in there before it's too late. If I can't resolve this in twenty minutes, you can storm the palace. Now then... if you'll excuse me... Ga'ran: Dhurke, wait! ... *sigh* Guards, allow the insurgent Dhurke Sahdmadhi to pass. Rayfa: Barbed Head, you have some explaining to do! Phoenix: Right... Well, while we're waiting here... ...Apollo, why don't you explain the situation? Apollo: Whaaat?! M-Me? Rayfa: Leave nothing out, Horn Head, or I'll dehorn you where you stand! Apollo: (Horn Head? She doesn't waste any time coming up with nicknames. And what's with the attitude? Her father is the one who abducted Ms. Fey!) Examine Amara's Tomb Apollo: (Dhurke's in there right now.) Guards Athena: The Ga'ran Royal Guard has the tomb surrounded. Apollo: Yeah, and it looks like they might storm the place at any moment. Phoenix: If Her Eminence gives the order, they'll have no choice but to follow through. And I have the feeling she's about ready to do so. Apollo: All we can do is wait and hope for the best, huh... (I hope Dhurke and Ms. Fey both come out of this in one piece.) Any other point of interest Apollo: (This is no time to be looking around. Not until Dhurke gets back.) Move Rayfa: Where do you think you are going?! Apollo: (Oh, right. We're supposed to wait for Dhurke to return.) Talk Hostage taking by Inga Rayfa: Do my ears deceive me, or did I hear talk about my father abducting someone? Apollo: Oh, um, you heard right. He abducted Maya Fey, and... Rayfa: I-Insolent fool! Apollo: P-Pardon my rudeness! Rayfa: A gentle soul such as my father could not possibly have committed such a crime! Phoenix: \"Gentle\"? You think he's gentle? Apollo: I'm afraid it's true, Your Benevolence. He's holed up in that tomb as we speak. Rayfa: Really? I find this difficult to believe. Why would he do such a thing? Inga Karkhuul Khura'in Apollo: Umm, Your Benevolence? You saw your father heading toward the tomb? Rayfa: I did. I was over on that veranda, deep in thought... ...when I saw him hurrying toward the tomb. I'd say it was about ten minutes ago. (Changed from [...when I saw him hurrying toward the tomb. I'd say it was about 10 minutes ago.] in the original release) Apollo: (Why was he rushing? Maybe he was worried he'd be late?) Did you see anyone else heading for the tomb? Rayfa: I saw no one else after he entered. Apollo: So Minister Inga and Ms. Fey are the only ones in there besides Dhurke? Phoenix: Who knows? But I wouldn't be surprised if he had a minion or two with him. Apollo: Dhurke... I sure hope he's all right. Present Anything Rayfa: Horn Head! Stop wasting time and explain what's going on here! And make it quick, or I'll yank those horns right off your head. Apollo: Nngh... How about we keep our hands to ourselves and I'll explain everything...? (Guess I'd better start talking...) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: ...It's only been five minutes? (Argh, it feels like an eternity.) Phoenix: Patience, Apollo, patience. Ga'ran: ................. May 18, 3:20 PMGa'ran Palace - Royal Residence Apollo: It's been almost twenty minutes. What's taking Dhurke so long? Ga'ran: ...The appointed time has come. Our royal guard shall now storm in. Apollo: Umm, can't you wait just a little longer? Ga'ran: No, we cannot. Every second we wait puts the hostage's life in even more danger. Therefore, we see no alternative but to order our guards to storm in. Apollo: (But that'll put Ms. Fey's life in danger, too!) Ga'ran: Guards! Storm the tomb and seize Minister Inga, along with the insurgent Dhurke Sahdmadhi! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence! Apollo: What?! Dhurke's under arrest, too? Ga'ran: Naturally. That traitorous snake assassinated my predecessor, Queen Amara. Now go! Seize them both! Royal Guard: Raaaaaaaaah! We're going in! Follow me, men! For Her Eminence! Ur dihara Ga'raaaaaaaan! Apollo: ............ (I hope no one gets hurt.) Royal Guard: Ah! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Your Eminineeeeeeeence! Apollo: What the--? Why are they running back out?! Ga'ran: What is the meaning of this? Royal Guard: S-Something terrible has happened! Dhurke...! Th-Th-The minister...! H-H-He's dead! Ga'ran: What's this?! Apollo: WH-WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Phoenix: Apollo, quick! Apollo: I'm right behind you! Ga'ran: No one enters without our--! ...Hmph! Come, let us see what has transpired! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence! May 18Ga'ran Palace - Amara's Tomb Apollo: Wh-Where's Dhurke?! Phoenix: Apollo, over there! Apollo: .........Dhurke? Dhurke: ................ Apollo: Dhurke! Wh-Wh-What... What have you done? Dhurke: ..........Apollo? Phoenix: L-Look! Ga'ran: So it is... Minister Inga who has fallen? ...! Guards! Seize this murderous man at once! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Emineeeeeeeence! Surrender or peeeeeeerish, rebel scum! Dhurke: N-No, wait! Aaaaaaaaargh! .............................. ............................................................ Apollo: Dhurke! (They're taking him away...) *thud* Apollo: Oww! (Dhurke just threw something at me.) Wait, this is the... (Is he telling me to keep it safe?) ???: ......Nick? ...Is that you? Phoenix: M-Maya! Are you all right?! Maya: Dh-Dhurke, he... he saved me. ...I feel... exhausted. I can't keep my eyes... open... Phoenix: Maya! Apollo: (Minister Inga -- the man behind Ms. Fey's abduction -- had been killed. And Dhurke was arrested for his murder. So it was that the abduction of Maya Fey came to a sudden and unexpected resolution. With this, the curtain fell on the minister, but things were far from over.) May 18Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence Athena: Apollo! What happened?! Apollo: ......I can't say for sure. But from what I can tell, it seems Dhurke has killed Minister Inga. Athena: Whaaaaaaaaaaat?! You think he did it to save Ms. Fey? Apollo: Most likely... But who knows? I'm really confused right now... Rayfa: M-My father... He's...? This cannot be! I must see for myself! Royal Guard: Your Benevolence! We cannot allow you to pass! Rayfa: Fools! Stand aside! Royal Guard: Forgive us! But we have direct orders from Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran! Rayfa: Uuuuuuuuuuuh! Father... Oh, Father...! Dhuuuuuurke! You will pay for this! Phoenix: ...Apollo, let's go regroup somewhere. Apollo: Y-Yeah... (Dhurke... It wasn't really you that did it... right?) May 18Tehm'pul Temple Apollo: ......... Athena: Are you okay, Apollo? Apollo: ...Y-Yeah. Phoenix: Edgeworth's speaking with the local police... ...so let's sit tight until he returns. Apollo: ...O-Okay. ............... Phoenix: ...I know you must be in a state of shock right now, but I need you to stay with us, Apollo. Apollo: (He's right. I can't go to pieces now!) Thanks, Mr. Wright. I'll be fine! May 18Tehm'pul Temple Edgeworth: Wright, Mr. Justice... I'm afraid I have some bad news. It looks like things will only get more complicated from here. Apollo: Prosecutor Edgeworth... What's happening with Dhurke? Edgeworth: As I understand it, he has been officially charged with the murder of Minister Inga. Apollo: H-He has? Edgeworth: However, I did manage to get us permission to investigate the crime scene. And I expect we'll be allowed to visit Mr. Sahdmadhi shortly. Apollo: ...Thank you. (I'm sure glad Prosecutor Edgeworth is here with us.) Edgeworth: Also, it just so happens that Detective Skye is here in Khura'in... ...so I have asked her to assist us with our investigation. Apollo: What?! What's she doing here? Edgeworth: It seems Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has grown quite fond of her. He's been ferrying her around all over the place. A few days here, a few days there... They've almost become a team of sorts. Apollo: (Despite what Nahyuta says... ...it seems he thinks highly of Ema's skills.) Athena: So what now, Apollo? Apollo: I think I'll go pay Dhurke a visit at the Detention Center. Phoenix: I... want to go check in on Maya at the hospital. What about you, Athena? Athena: Well... If there's footwork to be done, I'd better stick with Apollo and give him a hand. Edgeworth: Very well. Then I will accompany Wright. Apollo: Okay, we'll go our separate ways for now. Phoenix: All right. If anything comes up, you have my cell number. Athena: Do you know your way around here, Apollo? Apollo: It's been over ten years since I left... but I'll try not to get us hopelessly lost. Examine Temple Athena: Mr. Wright stayed there the entire time he was here, apparently. Apollo: Why would he stay at a temple instead of a hotel? Athena: He says it helped to cut costs. Long stays at a hotel really add up, you know. But he had to sleep on the floor with a load of strangers. There weren't any showers, either. Apollo: Wow, that's worse than staying at a youth hostel for backpackers. Spring Apollo: (This is said to be a sacred spring, and a pathway for souls to follow. The people of Khura'in believe the spring draws souls to the temple... ...and by the truth gained in the Hall of Justice beyond, they are memorialized. It seems that legal trials and funeral rites are inseparable in this country.) Background temples Apollo: (There sure are a lot of temples around here. In fact, it looks like most of the buildings around here are related to Khura'inism.) Talk Any ideas? Athena: Queen Ga'ran sure has a lot of personal attendants. Apollo: Yeah. The Ga'ran Royal Guard... They're like her own private army. Athena: More like an elite fan club made up of carefully selected soldiers who adore her. That's how I see it anyway. Apollo: That's... a pretty blunt way of putting it. What to do Athena: Dhurke Sahdmadhi -- the charismatic leader of the Defiant Dragons -- arrested. This is going to deal a major blow to the rebels. Apollo: Yeah. I can already see Datz having a heart attack when he finds out. Athena: Speaking of Datz, he was on the plane with us... ...but I haven't seen him since we landed. Apollo: Dhurke said he wanted Datz to go to him before he caused any more trouble. Athena: ...Yeah, he strikes me as a troublemaker. Apollo: ...I just hope he doesn't do anything crazy, like trying to break Dhurke out of jail. Present Attorney's Badge Athena: I thought that attorney badges were the same around the world. But I just realized this type is only used back home. Apollo: You've had your badge for a while now, and you're JUST noticing that? Athena: Hey, I'm still getting used to things after all the time I spent in Europe. But as they say, when in Rome! Apollo: Wait, what are we even talking about anymore? Founder's Orb Athena: The orb... It was a real surprise to find out that it's hollow on the inside, wasn't it? Apollo: Yeah, and an even bigger surprise to find that the founder's face was hidden within. Athena: But now that the orb's secret has been revealed... ...how are you supposed to restore it to its original state? Apollo: ...Well, it was probably wax or something that melted to reveal the figure inside, so... ...if we turned it upside down and heated it up again, it should go back to the way it was. Athena: Ohhh, I get it! That's one clever little contraption. Photo of My Father Athena: I've been thinking about that photo. Your father was quite the manly man, Apollo. Apollo: Ha ha ha. I sense a compliment in there somewhere. Athena: Huh? Where'd you get that idea? Apollo: Oh, um... N-Never mind. Athena: Never mind what? Apollo: ......... Er, nice weather we're having today. Athena: ......... Aww... Is there something you wanted to hear me say, Apollo? Apollo: L-Look! Just forget I said anything, okay?! Royal Residence Examine Inga's residence Apollo: (Somebody got a little carried away decorating this place. There's a golden lion keeping watch at the entrance.) ...That frog looks like it's cowering under the lion's glare. Athena: Really? 'Cause to me, it looks like the frog is glaring at the lion. Apollo: Come on, Athena. How does that make any sense? Athena: Huh? I just call 'em as I see 'em. Apollo: (I guess we'll have to agree to disagree.) Ga'ran's palace Apollo: The palace of Queen Ga'ran is built to impress. Its white walls and gold ornamentation lend it an imposing air. Athena: It makes Minister Inga's residence look downright humble by comparison. Apollo: Yeah. It shows the difference in their tastes... and which one wears the pants, so to speak Amara's tomb Apollo: The previous queen, Amara, was laid to rest in her own private tomb. Pretty impressive. Athena: They say it cost $800 million to build, and took 400 workers five years to complete. Special memorial rites were also conducted at various points of its construction. Apollo: That's quite an undertaking. Athena: It was built with donations from her devoted subjects and royalty of neighboring countries. It ended up giving a huge boost to the national economy. Apollo: Wow, Queen Amara must've been one charismatic lady... Rayfa's residence Athena: Ooh, look at those flowers! They give the whole house such a cute vibe! I wonder if this is where Princess Rayfa lives. Apollo: ...I doubt it. She doesn't look like the type to decorate with cute flowers. I mean, I may not know her well, but she seems awfully serious and snobby. I bet she uses nothing but roses and peonies - stuffy old people flowers, you know? Athena: ......Apollo. I guess it's too much to ask that you not judge a book by its cover, huh. Apollo: What's that supposed to mean? Footprints Apollo: Are these... Inga's footprints? They appear to be heading toward the tomb. Athena: Didn't Princess Rayfa mention something about that? You know, something about him rushing over to the tomb before we arrived? Apollo: I wonder if he had accidentally dozed off before the exchange or something. Pond or bridge Apollo: Vibrant lotus flowers floating on still waters... Butterflies dancing about... It's almost supernatural in its beauty. Athena: And at the center of it all rises the tomb where Amara's soul slumbers.  It makes you wonder if that bridge there is a getaway to the hereafter. Apollo: Yeah... Especially after both Dhurke and Inga crossed that bridge earlier. Urns Apollo: This overturned urn has spilled water everywhere. Everything around it is soaking wet. Athena: D-Don't look at me! Apollo: (Rightly or wrongly, I'm guessing Athena's the type who gets blamed for a lot of things. And the more people accuse her, the more defensive she becomes. Even to the point of preemptively denying any wrongdoing.) Athena: I said, it wasn't me! Apollo: I never said it was. Amara's Tomb Examine Athena: Apollo, I know you can't help but want to start investigating, but... Apollo: I know. We should pay Dhurke a visit over at the Detention Center. May 18Detention Center - Visitor's Room Dhurke: Apollo! Here to see your old man, are you? Apollo: Dhurke. Are they done interrogating you? Dhurke: Nope, the fun hasn't even started. I imagine they'll really take me over the coals though. Athena: I don't even want to think about how harsh their interrogation method will be. Apollo: ...Yeah, but that's nothing compared to what they'll do if they find him guilty. Dhurke: They've branded me a terrorist who killed the previous queen, and now the justice minister. If found guilty of these crimes, I'll be facing a very public execution. Apollo: P-Public execution...?! (This is worse than I thought!) Dhurke: Come on, son. Turn that frown upside down! You'll jinx us. As soon as I get out of here, I'll take you to this tasty hash house I know. Apollo: .........I'd like that. (I really need to find out what happened. Time to switch to work mode.) Dhurke, can you tell me what happened? ...Oh, and there's also something I want you to take a look at. Examine Bell Athena: .................. Apollo: ...Don't do it, Athena. Don't ring that bell. Athena: Ack! Wh-Who, me...?! Perish the thought. I mean, would I ever do something so childish? Apollo: .................. Athena: All right, all right! Put your bracelet away already. Talk about unfair! Guard Apollo: That guard's standing so still, and with such great posture... I wonder if he spends his days just watching the dust dance in the sunlight. Wait a second. Don't you do that in court sometimes, Athena? Athena: Eep! You mean you noticed? Apollo: Don't think you can take it easy just because I'm the lead lawyer on this one. Talk The incident Apollo: Dhurke, what happened in there? You didn't really kill Minister Inga, did you? Dhurke: Well, the thing is... ...I really don't know. Apollo: Huh? Dhurke: I remember seeing the mural of the founder right as I entered the tomb... ...but I got all dizzy immediately after that. The next thing I knew, I was standing there with a bloody knife in my hand... ...and covered in Inga's blood. Apollo: So you don't remember meeting with him? Dhurke: No. The last thing I remember after entering the tomb is feeling really dizzy. Athena: There's no way he can explain what happened if he can't remember anything. Apollo: Y-Yeah... Dhurke: .........Hmm. I suppose there's no getting out of this one. Apollo: But we can't give up yet! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! I was just messing with you, son. Apollo: Well, stop. It's not funny. Dhurke: S-Sorry. Apollo: (Sheesh. Nothing seems to faze him. Not even being arrested for murder.) Dhurke: This is going to be one tough case, Apollo. Not only have I been charged with Inga's murder... ...but I've also been charged with Amara's assassination from twenty-three years ago. Apollo: You're on trial for two charges? Dhurke: Ga'ran is practically licking her chops just thinking about my public execution. Guess it means we can't afford to lose our heads, huh. Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: I... I don't know how you can laugh at a time like this. Dhurke: ...So, son, I take it you'll be defending me at my trial? Apollo: ...Of course. You can count on me. Dhurke: That's my boy! Looks like your nerves are as steely as those vocal chords of yours! After all, you've got the Defense Culpability Ace to contend with, too. Apollo: ...Oh, right... So if you're found guilty... ...then I'll be charged with the same double homicide, huh. Dhurke: Don't tell me you forgot about that...! Apollo: I'll-- I'll be fine. I-I just have to make sure we win this one. Dhurke: You sure? Because you don't sound very fine. Athena: ...Um, Apollo? What was that about an assassination twenty-three years ago? 23 years ago (appears after \"The incident\") Apollo: About that incident twenty-three years ago... That was when the previous queen, Amara, was assassinated, wasn't it? Dhurke: Yes. Someone set her private residence on fire. She lost her life in the ensuing blaze. Apollo: And you were arrested for the crime? Athena: Why would they arrest you, Mr. Sahdmadhi? Weren't you just a lawyer back then? What relation could you have had with the queen? Dhurke: Um, about that... Amara was... well... she was my wife. I may not look the part, but I was once husband to a queen. In short, I was royalty. Athena: What? No waaaaaay! Are you saying you won the heart of the reigning queen? Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! C'mon, you're talking to a guy who hones his prowess against witnesses on the stand. Even a queen is no match for this dragon's glare! Athena: W-Wow, you're really something else. Apollo: So was a verdict ever reached, Dhurke? Dhurke: I acted as my own attorney and won. ...Until I was accused of fabricating evidence, that is. Then it all went south. Apollo: (...Now where have I heard a story like that before?) Athena: What happened after that? Dhurke: I, uh... I made a run for it. Athena: You ran?! But why? Dhurke: I didn't kill Amara, and I didn't fabricate any evidence. But if I had stuck around for a retrial, I'd have been found guilty for sure. I couldn't allow that to happen; Amara's true killer would never face justice if I did. So I left my law practice behind and went underground. Apollo: But that was twenty-three years ago. ...Are you telling me that after all these years... ...you still haven't discovered the truth? Dhurke: Yeah... The fact that it was arson means that the crime scene was reduced to ashes. There is little in the way of evidence left. It's just been brick wall after brick wall. Apollo: (I guess that means it's all up to me to figure it out, huh. Along with Minister Inga's murder, of course. ...I think I'm going to be sick.) Dhurke: Come on, son. Don't look so down. With you on the case, it'll work out somehow. Apollo: (I hope he's right.) Dhurke: Say, son, do you remember my office? Apollo: ...Sure. (I remember that messy, dimly lit room.) Dhurke: The file I've amassed on Amara's assassination is kept there. I think it might help you on this case. Do you remember how to get there? Apollo: (Let me think... I recall going in through a manhole...) How can I not, Dhurke. I hated how I always got so dirty getting there. And that stench... (That old case is important, too, but I should probably focus on the minister's murder first.) Present Attorney's Badge Dhurke: I'm proud of you, son. You've really become a fine lawyer. Apollo: Well, at least it means I'm qualified to defend you. Dhurke: ...To think the day would come where you'd come to my defense. I'm one lucky man. Now I can die in peace. Apollo: Whoa, slow down! I'm going to prove you innocent, so...! Dhurke: Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Just pulling your leg, son! Apollo: (...Even when he's in the slammer, Dhurke is Dhurke.) Founder's Orb Dhurke: I see you got it safely out of the tomb! Apollo: Why did you throw it at me like that? Dhurke: I want you to listen carefully, son. The orb must not fall into Ga'ran's hands... Not ever. Apollo: I thought Minister Inga was the one who was after it. He was the one who lent it to Professor Buff to study, after all. So haven't you exposed his crime now? Dhurke: I have, but... ...there's more connected to this relic than meets the eye... Much more. And whatever it is, I can't help feeling that it could turn this entire kingdom upside down. Apollo: You said something like that before. (Looks like Dhurke's intuition is at it again.) Dhurke: Ga'ran will do anything to retrieve this... ...so guard it well, son -- at least until tomorrow's trial. Photo of My Father Dhurke: That's the only remaining photo of your father. Take good care of it. Apollo: I will. ...I'm just surprised to see it after all these years. Dhurke: I had a tough time tracking it down and retrieving it. It was taken by some European tourists who just happened to be watching your father. I had one of my men go to Europe to look them up and ask whether we could have it. Apollo: Y-You went through all that trouble? Dhurke: ...I did. So don't go losing it or anything. Apollo: I said I'd take good care of it, didn't I? After clearing \"23 years ago\" Talk option and presenting Founder's Orb: ???: I'm afraid your time is up. Apollo: ! N-Nahyuta. Nahyuta: It's time for the prisoner's interrogation. So begone, you putrid-headed, criminal-abetting lawyer. Apollo: Wait! Don't tell me... you're the prosecuting attorney? Athena: What?! But that would mean... Nahyuta: ...Is there a problem here? Apollo: You bet there is. He's your father! Nahyuta: ...And your point is...? My relation to the accused is irrelevant. The fact remains, I am a prosecutor. Apollo: N-No, that's not what I... (I don't think I'm getting through to him.) Dhurke: .........Nahyuta. Long time no see, son. How've you been? Nahyuta: ......... Dhurke: Look... I hear you've been serving Ga'ran -- rather faithfully, in fact. Whatever happened to our dream of taking her down and changing this country, son? Nahyuta: .........The past is the past. Dhurke: What do you mean? Why are you doing this? Nahyuta: .........It's simple. People change. The Nahyuta you knew exists no more. Dhurke: Listen, son, I don't know what made you change like this... ...but you're still my boy, even if you prosecute my case. The rest of the Defiant Dragons and I eagerly await your return. Whenever you're ready, we'll welcome you back with open arms. Nahyuta: ........Ngh! .........As I said, I've moved on. Now, let us waste no more time; for flowers do not blossom simply from talk of the past. Apollo: ......... (Nahyuta... Why do I get the feeling there's something he wants to say, but can't?) Nahyuta: ...Guard, move the accused to the interrogation room. Guard: Yes, sir! This way, you rebel scum! Dhurke: Ow! Watch it! Not so rough, will you! Apollo: (...Nahyuta. Is he seriously going to prosecute his own father?) May 18Ga'ran Palace - Amara's Tomb Apollo: So, this is the tomb of Amara, the previous queen of Khura'in. It's really lavish. I guess you could say it's fit for a queen. Athena: Is the faceless woman in that mural over there Amara? Apollo: No, that's the Holy Mother. She's the one who brought spirit channeling to Khura'in. Athena: Oh, right. The woman in the orb. ???: Oh, it's you two. Getting right down to business, I see. Apollo: Hi, Ema. We heard you'd give us a hand if we needed it. Ema: Yep. Mr. Edgeworth asked me to help where I could. So, it's been quite a while since you've been back in Khura'in, I hear. Apollo: Yeah, more than ten years, in fact. Ema: Well, you sure didn't waste any time. I mean, you're already mixed up in a murder. You're as big a trouble magnet as Mr. Wright. Apollo: P-Please don't say that. My luck's already bad enough as it is. Athena: Ema, I hear Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has requested your services again. He seems to have really taken a liking to you. Ema: You mean His Ephemeral Holiness? MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. I don't mind that he approves of me and my abilities. It's just, his people skills need some serious work. But when he manages a smile and compliments my work, it's hard to say no. Plus, working on investigations overseas is a priceless experience. But flying back and forth between here and home every few days with no days off... That's been tough, and the lack of sleep has been brutal on my skin. To make matters worse, the defendant in this case is someone I know. I mean, how could this get any worse?! MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. Apollo: (Sounds like they've got one complicated prosecutor-detective relationship going on.) Examine Apollo: (We better get Ema's okay before we start snooping around.) Talk The incident Apollo: Ema, have you determined the cause of death? Ema: Blood loss from a stab wound. A single stab in the back was enough to cause the victim to bleed to death. The estimated time of death is 3 PM, which is when Dhurke came onto the scene. Inga's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Apollo: Any suspects besides Dhurke? Ema: No. He, Maya, and the minister were the only ones here. And Maya had been tied up until she was freed by the queen's royal guard. Apollo: Could someone have been hiding somewhere in here? Ema: Not likely. I was told this tomb was searched from top to bottom right after the murder. And during that time, the royal guard set up a perimeter to prevent anyone from escaping. Athena: In other words, the crime scene was completely sealed off? Ema: It would appear so. Apollo: Hmm... No way for a third party to escape without being spotted, so... (Great. It's another one of those convoluted locked-room mysteries.) The incident (subsequent times) Apollo: Ema, have you determined the cause of death? Ema: Blood loss from a stab wound. A single stab in the back was enough to cause the victim to bleed to death. The estimated time of death is 3 PM, which is when Dhurke came onto the scene. Apollo: Any suspects besides Dhurke? Ema: No. He, Maya, and the minister were the only ones here. And Maya had been tied up until she was freed by the queen's royal guard. Apollo: Could someone have been hiding somewhere in here? Ema: Not likely. I was told this tomb was searched from top to bottom right after the murder. And during that time, the royal guard set up a perimeter to prevent anyone from escaping. Athena: In other words, the crime scene was completely sealed off? Ema: It would appear so. Apollo: Hmm... No way for a third party to escape without being spotted, so... (Great. It's another one of those convoluted locked-room mysteries.) The victim Apollo: About the victim, Minister Inga... He was the kingdom's Minister of Justice, correct? Ema: Yes. Inga Karkhuul Khura'in was the second most powerful figure in Khura'in. Plus, he was married to the queen. Apollo: Seems strange that someone of his status would abduct someone. Ema: Apparently, he only told a few of his most loyal subordinates about his plan. That way, there was little chance of the police or even the queen finding out. Apollo: What was Inga hoping to gain by getting his hands on the orb? Ema: That I don't know. But I'm working on it. Apollo: (...I wonder if it really was for what Paul Atishon-Wimperson said...?) Atishon: I must deliver it to my benefactor at all costs. Phoenix: What do they want that relic for anyway? Atishon: Heh heh heh. It's something to do with an old legend. My patron seeks the great power said to be granted to whoever solves its secret. Apollo: (A great power that is said to be bestowed on whoever solves the orb's secret. In Khura'in, only those who can channel spirits are said to be fit to rule. Was that why Inga wanted such power? Did he want to be king?) Amara's tomb Apollo: So this is the tomb of the previous queen? Ema: Yes, Queen Amara was laid to rest here. She lost her life in an arsonist's blaze. What a tragic end. I heard this tomb sits on the actual site of her residence before it was burned down. They built it on the same spot so her soul could rest in peace. Apollo: (So this is where the fire happened, huh.) Athena: Why do you think Minister Inga was holding Ms. Fey captive here? Ema: It's the perfect spot, if you think about it. It's close to his private quarters, which made it easy to keep an eye on his prisoner. And the courtyard is only open to the royal family, so he had little fear of prying eyes. Plus, the tomb is normally locked, and only the royal family is allowed access. Athena: So that's why he picked this place. Apollo: How long had Ms. Fey been held captive? Ema: About six days. Apollo: Really?! That long?! Ema: It appears that she was severely weakened by her prolonged confinement. She passed out as soon as she was freed, and is now on an IV drip at the hospital. She's been asleep ever since. Athena: Poor Ms. Fey. I hope she gets better soon. Present Attorney's Badge Ema: Your attorney's badge? Huh... Apollo: What, that normally gets a better reaction from you. Ema: I'm tired of collecting your fingerprints. It's kind of lost its luster. Apollo: Yeah, but who knows? There could be other people's prints on it. Ema: Ooh, that's true! Hand it over, buddy! Apollo: Ah! Ema: ............Hmph. The only prints I found were yours. Apollo: (Argh, it's all dusty now.) Anything else Ema: Oh, you must need my forensic expertise! Just leave it to me! Apollo: Oh, um... Actually, I was wondering if you see anything strange about this. Ema: ...Oh. .................................... Apollo: (Why isn't she saying anything?) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: Ema, do you mind if we start looking around? Ema: Sure, I've already got the okay. Knock yourselves out. Oh, and here. It's a diagram the police drew of the tomb. I thought I'd give you a copy to help your investigation along. Apollo: Thank you. Tomb Diagram added to the Court Record. Ema: Oh, and let me know if you need my forensic expertise. Don't you dare keep all the fun to yourselves, you hear?! Apollo: You don't need to worry about that. (Besides, I'd hardly classify this as \"fun\".) Examine Front of Amara's sarcophagus Apollo: So this is Amara's sarcophagus. Let's take a closer look. Sarcophagus curtains Athena: Hey, these curtains open, Apollo. Sarcophagus keyhole Apollo: ...That's one big sarcophagus. Ema: They say the mummy of Amara, the former queen, rests inside. Apollo: A mummy, huh? ...Rats, it's locked. Ema: Hey, don't touch that! Apollo: You mean we can't search inside it? Ema: Not a chance. Besides, it's not something anyone'd try opening, anyway. Apollo: What if the real killer's hiding inside? Athena: Hey! Anyone in there? Ema: D-Don't do that! You're going to get us cursed! Athena: C-C-Cursed? Ema: The queen likely bears a grudge toward the living after such a violent, painful death. So no one dares touch the sarcophagus for fear of incurring her wrath. Athena: .........Oh no, Apollo. What am I going to do? Apollo: Don't look at me. Ema: ...In any case, the sarcophagus is temperature controlled. It's kept really cold to preserve the mummy. So even if someone did decide to hide inside it, they would eventually freeze to death. Apollo: I see... (Still, if they bundled up, I bet a person could hide in there for a little while.) Sides of Amara's sarcophagus Apollo: The sarcophagus is surrounded by a curtain. I bet someone could've hidden behind it. Ema: True, but that's one of the many places the royal guard checked after storming in. Athena: Wow, they were really thorough. Ema: Yes, well, apparently, one of their members loves mystery novels. He peered into every nook and cranny with an almost frightening amount of gusto. And when he was done, he said: \"Very interesting. It's like one of those locked-room mysteries.\" Apollo: Sounds like he's in the wrong line of work. Bloodstain on Amara's sarcophagus Athena: Wow, it's covered in blood. Apollo: With a blood spatter this large, it must've gotten all over the killer, too. Come to think of it... There was blood on Dhurke's clothes. Athena: The circumstantial evidence points to Dhurke being the killer. Apollo: That's what I'd conclude if I were a cop, too. (Why are things always so bleak for me...?) Holy Mother mural Apollo: It looks like the Holy Mother was painted here to watch over Amara's sarcophagus. Athena: So it's like, this tomb is protected by the founder? That must be so reassuring to those she left behind. Apollo: Only one problem: they didn't paint the eyes she needs to do said watching. Athena: Come to think of it, she doesn't have a mouth to smile down on the tomb with, either. It's actually kind of creepy. I wonder if being watched over by something like that gives the queen nightmares. Apollo: ...Hey, hey. Keep that up, and the founder just might come and \"watch over\" you, too. Broken statue (while facing Holy Mother painting) Apollo: Look, one of the statues is broken. Athena: Yeah, but it's kind of hard to see from here. Apollo: Let's check it out when we get a little closer. Front of broken statue Apollo: One of the statues is broken. Let's take a closer look. Broken statue Apollo: This thing's more splinter than statue now. Ema: The bullet from the victim's gun did a real number on it. Athena: It seems like something you'd get cursed for, you know? Apollo: In Minister Inga's case, I'd say getting your ticket punched is curse enough. Athena: Yeah, but don't curses extend to the afterlife? Apollo: You need to stop taking what Nahyuta says so seriously. Athena: I-I'm perfectly capable of thinking for myself! Brown magatamas Apollo: It's a magatama... I think. Did it come from the broken statue? Athena: Look, Apollo, there's another one. But the other statues only have one each. Apollo: Hey, you're right. Maybe this statue was special or something. Bullet Apollo: Look, there's a bullet here. Ema: It's from the pistol the victim was carrying. My guess is he tried to shoot his attacker, but missed, and the bullet ended up here. We've already determined the rifling marks to be a match to his gun. Athena: Rifling marks? Aren't those...? Ema: Oh ho! Shall I explain? The science behind it is absolutely fascinating. Apollo: No, no, we're good. Ema: Hmph, lawyers... Think they're so smart. Apollo: You do realize we can hear you. Sparkling object Apollo: Hm? There's something shiny down there. It's a pendant... Athena: There's blood on it. I wonder who it belongs to. Ema: All we know is it's not the victims. No one in the royal family recognized it. Apollo: ...Ema, did you lift any fingerprints from it? Ema: I did, but... ...I wasn't able to get a clean one. Apollo: That's too bad. Ema: But the blood turned out to be the victim's. Apollo: That means it must have fallen here in the course of the murder. (It might be Dhurke's. I should ask him about it later.) Pink Butterfly Pendant added to the Court Record. Body outline Apollo: Guess this is where Inga collapsed when he died. Better take a closer look. Body outline Apollo: They've already taken the body away. It's kind of sad how familiar I've become with body outlines. Ema: I have a photo of the body if you're interested. He was stabbed right in the back; the poor guy was practically skewered. Athena: What's he wearing on his arms? Ema: Those are the Cuffs of Justice. Seems to be a tradition here for the Minister of Justice to wear those forearm cuffs. Apollo: They look like they're made of a thick fabric, so I guess they aren't for protection. Athena: Maybe they're for keeping his sleeves out of the way when handling documents. Apollo: Yeah, that's probably their original purpose. But over the years, the reason for wearing them was probably forgotten. So now, they're just one of many traditional things that people do without knowing why. Athena: ...Oh, I get it. Kind of like the way you roll up your sleeves, huh? Apollo: ...Or your psychology, if we're going there. Athena: I happen to know why I started, thank you very much! Tomb Crime Photo added to the Court Record. Body outline (subsequent times) Apollo: These white lines indicate where the minister's body fell. Athena: Hey, didn't Ema give us a photo of the crime scene before they took the body away? Apollo: Looks like he was stabbed in the back. Athena: Those things on his arms... They're called the \"Cuffs of Justice,\" right? Apollo: Yeah, they're supposedly a traditional part of the minister's outfit. Knife Apollo: So, this is the murder weapon. Ema, did you find any prints on it? Ema: Yep, and they were super clear. They belong to one Dhurke Sahdmadhi. Apollo: That's not good. Were there any others? Ema: There was one more print from another individual... ...but it was too smudged to identify. It's probably an old print from someone else who had handled the knife. Apollo: Oh... (Yet another piece of unhelpful info to add to our ever-growing pile... *sigh*) Knife (subsequent times) Apollo: The murder weapon... Athena: Apparently, Dhurke's prints were found on it. Apollo: That's not very helpful, is it. Cell phone Apollo: I wonder if this is Inga's cell phone. Ema: It should be. His fingerprints are all over it. Apollo: Do you know if he talked with anyone recently? Ema: There were a few calls logged between him and his underlings. They're all members of the secret police, who were directly under the minister's control. Athena: You mean like spies? Apollo: I don't think that's quite it. Pistol Apollo: So the minister was armed, huh. Ema: Mm-hm. That's a four-shot pistol. He had it for self-defense, apparently. But it won't be firing anything any time soon. Apollo: Huh? Athena: He was carrying a broken gun around for show? Ema: No, we recovered a bullet here. Which means the gun probably broke as the minister fired its last round. Thing is... the gun's chambers are all empty. Yet, that one bullet is the only bullet we could find. Apollo: That is strange. Where did the other three go? Athena: ...Maybe Dhurke ate them. Apollo: We can ask the next time we see him. Just be ready for his predictably \"shocking\" answer. Pistol (subsequent times) Apollo: Inga's pistol... He used to carry it for self-defense. Athena: Apparently, he fired all four rounds. Apollo: Yeah, but only one slug was recovered in this tomb. Rows of statues Apollo: It's like a small army of monks, all neatly lined up. It looks like they're facing the sarcophagus in prayer. Athena: If you look carefully, each one has a slightly different expression. Apollo: I wonder if they used real people as models. Athena: Some are frowning, some are smiling... Hm? There's one that looks like he's trying his hardest not to burst out laughing. Apollo: ...Really? Hmm, I wonder why. Athena: Maybe it's like those times when things are so intense, you can't help but laugh. You know, like at funerals and stuff. Apollo: They went through all the trouble of depicting that? Talk about going overboard... Right incense burner Apollo: It's full of ash. My guess would be this is an incense burner. Athena: Hey, look, Apollo. There's something in the ashes. Apollo: ...Let's see what it is. Ash Apollo: It's full of ash. They must burn incense in here. Athena: So, I was wondering, Apollo... Did the ash come from the incense sticks that were burned in this? Or do people put their incense in after there was already she in here to hold them up? Apollo: Don't be silly, Athena. The answer's simple. The ash is the product of prayers from countless visitors who came here. It's not a chicken-or-the-egg kind of thing. Apollo: Oh, that's an interesting take on it. It's so much more poetic than mine! Gemstone Apollo: Is that... a gemstone? Wonder what it's doing here. Athena: Heh heh heh, I've got this one covered, Apollo. Would you like to hear my brilliant theory? Apollo: Well, I guess it wouldn't do any harm. Athena: You know how people make wishes by throwing coins into a fountain, right? Well-- Apollo: You know, on second thought, I'm good. Athena: Whaaat?! Y-You sure you don't need to hear my theory? I was just about to get to the good part! Apollo: Let's just ask Ema. That'll be much quicker. Excuse me, Ema? What's this gemstone doing here? Ema: Oh, that... It's not a gem, it's a button -- albeit a very expensive one -- from the victim's jacket. Must've fallen off and gotten in there somehow. Apollo: See? Every puzzle has an answer, Athena. Athena: Well, I thought my idea was pretty good... Wait... What's with this soot? See here, on the gemstone. Apollo: ...Hey, you're right. Gemstone added to the Court Record. Right incense burner (after examining gemstone) Apollo: It's full of ash. My guess would be this is an incense burner. Grape juice Apollo: This is the grape juice Inga was drinking. He was probably nervous before his meeting with Dhurke. Athena: So he drank grape juice? I'm not seeing the logic here. Apollo: Mr. Wright told me all about it when he was hospitalized a few years ago. He said grape juice has something in it that helps you relax. Athena: Really? ...Um, are you sure he was talking about regular, plain old grape juice? Because it sounds like he was talking about the fermented variety. Apollo: No, he couldn't have meant that. I mean, we're talking about a medical facility. They wouldn't have allowed something like that in. Athena: R-Right... Let's just leave it at that. Side paintings (while facing Holy Mother mural) Apollo: There's a painting up there, but I can't see it very well from here. Paintings right of Holy Mother mural Apollo: A baby on a lotus blossom? That's one strange painting. Ema: Apparently, that's part of a mural depicting the life and times of Queen Amara. You know, like a storyboard or something. Apollo: So that baby's supposed to be Amara? Athena: This one depicts Amara preaching to the faithful. Apollo: It's hard to put into words, but I've never seen anything like it. Let's see, the next one is... I-Is that... Dhurke? Why does he have horns? Athena: My best guess is... ...it depicts the first time Amara and Dhurke met. Apollo: So he's supposed to be some kind of demon who's seducing her? Athena: Well, he WAS successful since they got married after that. Apollo: ...The mural continues on the opposite wall. Paintings left of Holy Mother mural Athena Is this supposed to be Amara channeling a spirit? Apollo: It looks like the spirit of some country's sultan or something. And she seems to be conveying something to his retainers. Athena: ...Sh-She's on fire. Apollo: This must be Amara's assassination as allegedly carried out by Dhurke. They really made him look evil. Athena: ...This is the weirdest one of all. Apollo: Is that supposed to be Dhurke facing his punishment in the afterlife? Anyway... Hm? I guess that's the last one. Athena: I guess we're supposed to see this as a happy ending. Apollo: Yeah, except nobody came out of this story happy. Chair Apollo: Ms. Fey was apparently tied to this chair. Let's take a closer look. We should try to cover every angle possible here. Let's use [left analog stick / WASD] to change our perspective and take a careful look around. (Changed from [Slide the Touch Screen...] in the original release) * (Line [...or use the Circle Pad ([Circle Pad]) to look around carefully in this area.] removed in the Trilogy release) Seat, rails, or legs of chair Apollo: (...Poor Ms. Fey. She must've been tied up to this chair.) Athena: I can just imagine how much her backside must've hurt after sitting here for so long. Apollo: It would've been torture for you, I bet. I mean, you don't know how to sit still. Athena: If by that you mean I like to stay active, then I have to agree with you. Rope Athena: I bet you didn't know, but I happen to be a bit of an escape artist myself. Trucy showed me how to do her rope escape trick. Apollo: Uh-huh. And why would you bother learning something like that? Athena: Because we're always getting into trouble when working cases with Mr. Wright. So I thought it might come in handy someday. Apollo: Well, I guess you're right about that. Ms. Fey could've definitely used that knowledge. Athena: That's right! So now, you just sit right here and we'll get started. Apollo: What in the world gave you the idea I wanted to learn?! Bloodstain on chair leg Apollo: Look, there's a bloodstain on one of the chair legs. Ema: Really?! Hey, you're right. I completely missed that. Apollo: Let's move the chair so we can check under it. ...There's more blood under the chair leg. Ema: Hmm... I wonder what it's doing there. I have some luminol here. Why don't you do some testing around it? Spray floor near rope Leads to: \"Look!\" Apollo: Look! The bloodstain leads all the way to the sarcophagus! Athena: Ema, is this Minister Inga's blood? Ema: Hold on one second... .........Huh? That's strange. I didn't get a match. Apollo: So then... whose blood is it? Dhurke and Ms. Fey weren't wounded as far as we know. Athena: And the blood's been wiped up by someone for some reason. Apollo: Yeah, that's strange, too. Mysterious Bloodstain added to the Court Record. Bloodstain on floor (after examining bloodstain on chair leg) Apollo: There's a bloodstain on the floor. Athena: It's already been mostly wiped up, but the stain leads all the way to the sarcophagus. Apollo: I wonder whose blood it is. Wall curtains Apollo: Someone could have hid behind these curtains. Athena: Here, I'll go give it a try! Well, can you tell I'm hiding here? Apollo: No, I can't tell at all. That's it! That's the perfect hiding place! Athena: We did it, Apollo! We solved the case! Ema: Sorry to burst your bubble, but... ...the royal guard searched the tomb high and low right after they stormed in. And they said no one else was in here besides Minister Inga, Dhurke, and Ms. Fey. Apollo: ...Well. Back to the drawing board, I guess. Athena: My brilliant deduction -- destroyed in three sentences. After examining sarcophagus keyhole, sides of Amara's sarcophagus, bloodstain on Amara's sarcophagus, Holy Mother mural, broken statue (zoomed in), brown magatamas, sparkling object, body outline (zoomed in), knife, cell phone, pistol, gemstone, bloodstain on chair leg, and wall curtains: Apollo: I think we've covered just about everything. Maybe we should go over what we've learned so far. Athena: Umm... For starters, we're dealing with a locked-room murder. But instead of the tomb being locked, it was being cordoned off by the royal guard. And after the murder, no one was found to be hiding inside. Apollo: Right. In addition... ...we also know that Dhurke's fingerprints are all over the murder weapon. Athena: The curtain around the sarcophagus was drenched in the victim's blood on one side. The blood must've also gotten on the killer when they stabbed the minister from behind. Apollo: Dhurke had blood on him when the crime was first discovered. Unfortunately, he doesn't remember what happened. .................. Athena: ............ Apollo: (This is not good.) Athena: So, what we know so far is... ...things couldn't be worse for our case. And that's still and understatement somehow. Apollo: Yeah, it's looking pretty grim. Ema: Oh, uh! If you two are done here, I'll have to ask you to leave. Go on, scoot! Apollo: Something wrong, Ema? Why are you trying to give us the boot? Ema: ...It's just easier if you're not here when His Ephemeral Holiness arrives. ...Ah! Apollo: (Speak of the devil.) Ema: P-Prosecutor Sahdmadhi... Nahyuta: Detective Skye... It seems you've spoken at length with these two lawyers. I do hope you've also kept an eye on them. Ema: Y-Yes, of course! Like a hawk! They didn't touch a single thing! Ha, a-ha ha ha! Nahyuta: ...Give a lawyer an inch, and they'll take a mile. Never forget that. Apollo: (There's that look of distrust again.) ...Hey, Nahyuta. Do you really believe that Dhurke's guilty? Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: And are you seriously going to prosecute this case? I mean, he's your father. You were once part of the Defiant Dragons, weren't you? Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: Hey! Nahyuta! Wait! I said wait! Come on, Athena, after him! Athena: Huh? ...Oh, uh, right behind you! May 18Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence Apollo: Nahyuta, would you stop already?! Nahyuta: .........What do you want? Apollo: It's about Dhurke. Would you please hear me out? Nahyuta: ...I fail to see why I should. Now, if you'll excuse me... Apollo: Apollo: Nahyuta! ...Are you afraid of what I might have to say? If not, there's no harm in listening, right? Nahyuta: .........Very well. Speak. But make it quick. There is much I must do. Apollo: (Why does everything have to be so difficult with you?) Talk Prosecuting Dhurke Apollo: So, I know you'll be prosecuting Dhurke's case, but... ...aren't there any other prosecutors in this country? Why does it have to be you? Nahyuta: ...Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran, personally requested that I serve as prosecutor. Apollo: Sh-She did? That WOULD make it hard to say no. Nahyuta: Her Eminence thinks highly of my prosecutorial skills. Apollo: Still, she didn't have to ask you to handle a case against your own father. Be honest. You really don't want to do this, do you? Nahyuta: ...Ahh. You speak of love and sentiment. Apollo: Er, I guess so. Nahyuta: I do not deny such human emotions. But... the law is the law. And placing personal feelings above it is beyond reprieve. ...Do you disagree? Apollo: W-Well... No, I don't disagree, but... Nahyuta: Civilizations only exist due to the confines of the law. Without them, love and sentiment would lack the fertile they need to flourish. Do you disagree? Apollo: No, but... Nahyuta: The law must be obeyed. This truth sits above all else, including personal feelings. Therefore, whether or not I am the son of the accused is of no consequence. It is that simple, or would you say otherwise? Apollo: Nnnngh... B-But... Athena: Come on, Apollo! Tell him how wrong he is! Apollo: B...But don't you... you know... wish it wasn't that way...? Nahyuta: ............... Athena: ......... Nahyuta: It appears I've wasted my breath on you. Athena: And the winner is... Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! Nahyuta: ...Hmph. Still spewing empty words devoid of meaning or consequence, I see... ...you putrid red pepper. Apollo: Argh! ........ (I know I'm right... But did he have to be so eloquent about his point? It's like he's trying to cover something up with his pretty words.) Athena: Apollo, I'd cut back on the debates with him if I were you. Just stick to questions, like the one you wanted to ask. Who Dhurke cares about (appears after \"Prosecuting Dhurke\") Leads to: \"Nahyuta, I wanted to ask you about that hostage situation.\" Present Attorney's Badge Nahyuta: Why is that badge before me? Apollo: Remember how we used to talk about what we wanted to be back when we were kids? I wanted to be a lawyer, and you, a prosecutor. You said you wanted to prosecute bad guys to make sure they got punished. Nahyuta: Yes, passing judgment upon evil... That is my calling. And it is why I have taken this case. Apollo: Are you saying Dhurke is evil? Nahyuta: He who goes against what is righteous and holy... ...I shall reap his soul with all my power, whoever he may be, for that is my role. Apollo: (Then I'll just have to defend his soul with all MY power, Nahyuta.) Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Nahyuta: Alas... Another soul has departed this world, and must now be guided to the Twilight Realm. Apollo: You would even hold last rites for a kidnapper like Minister Inga? Nahyuta: Criminals, too, must be given funerary rites. Deny that, and their soul will turn malevolent, bringing woe upon the living. That is why all who pass on must receive a proper requiem. Apollo: Makes sense. I mean, if I were murdered, I'd probably be pretty keen on revenge, too. Anything else Nahyuta: The putrid-minded lawyer seeks information from me? Apollo: Come on, throw me a bone here. Nahyuta: I think not. Apollo: Well, aren't we stingy? Apollo: Nahyuta, I wanted to ask you about that hostage situation. Inga said he had someone dear to Dhurke in the palm of his hand. And he was using that person, along with his hostage, as leverage in obtaining the orb. Nahyuta: ...! That's news to me. Apollo: Well, that's what Inga said. Dhurke: You can kiss your chances of getting the orb goodbye. Inga: ...Heh heh heh. Maya Fey ain't my only... how shall I say... insurance, you know, Dhurke. Dhurke: What? Inga: I've got someone dear to you right in the palm of my hand, see? Now that one, well... You can imagine what kinds of things I could do, right? Dhurke: What? Inga: I've got someone dear to you right in the palm of my hand, see? Now that one, well... You can imagine what kinds of things I could do, right? Dhurke: ! ............ Inga: Heh heh. Glad you're seeing things my way. Apollo: I got the impression Dhurke had no choice but to follow Inga's demands after he heard that. So who do you suppose this special person is? Nahyuta: .........I wouldn't know. BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: ! (My bracelet's reacting!) Hey, Nahyuta, about what you just said-- Nahyuta: Apollo: Ack! Ow-ow-ouch! M-My bracelet is crushing my wrist! Youch! That really hurts! Wh-What the heck's going on?! Nahyuta: ...I'm wise to your tricks, you putrid pepper. That bracelet reacts to the anxieties around you by squeezing your wrist. But now that I know how it works, I can make it tighten around your wrist any time I wish. Consider this a warning. Apollo: Argh... (I don't know how he did it, but this renders my bracelet useless.) Nahyuta: Such devilry is powerless in the face of the Holy Mother's blessings. Athena: Looks like your special power won't work against Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, Apollo. We'll have to try something else. Apollo: Argh, you're right. We'll just have to ask Dhurke about this. Nahyuta: .........It appears... Apollo: ? Nahyuta: ...You intend to go through with a trial you have no hope of winning. Grow up, Mr. Justice. We are no longer children, you and I. Apollo: I'm not the one who needs to grow up, Nahyuta. In case you didn't hear, I won my last case against none other than Mr. Wright. Nahyuta: ! Athena: You tell him, Apollo! Nahyuta: ............... Apollo: (Is he mad? I can never tell with him.) Nahyuta: ...This trial is different. Your foolishness will only earn you a death sentence for aiding and abetting a criminal. And those who die as criminals... ...are doomed to be reborn in the next life as something lower than a bug or vegetable. You would be lucky to return to this realm as a patch of mold. Apollo: M-Mold? That's pretty harsh. Nahyuta: If you wish to avert such a fate, abandon this folly before it is too late. Apollo: ...I don't care if I end up as a dollop of blue cheese dressing in my next life! I'm going to defend Dhurke in court! Nahyuta: .........You fool. Know this... I intend to prosecute the accused with all my might -- no matter what you say or do. Consider yourself forewarned. ...Now, if you will excuse me. Athena: Prosecutor Sahdmadhi knows his father will be publicly executed if he's found guilty. Yet he won't show even an ounce of mercy. Apollo: ............... (...Nahyuta. Is this the real you? Have you really changed? Do you really plan on sending Dhurke to his death? Do you even hear me? Don't Dhurke and I matter to you anymore?) To be continued May 18Tem'phul Temple Phoenix: (Maya passed out right after we found her in the tomb.) Maya: ...I feel... exhausted. I can't keep my eyes... open... Phoenix: (She's been out cold ever since. We haven't been able to get a word out of her. The doctor says it's just exhaustion, but I can't help but worry...) Edgeworth: What is it, Wright? Are you all right? Phoenix: ...Yeah. Just thinking is all. I'm glad you're here, Edgeworth. We wouldn't have gotten the permissions we have without you. Edgeworth: ...Well, I didn't come all the way to Khura'in to be useless. Speaking of the investigation, I received a few things from Detective Skye. These should prove to be useful to us as well. Inga's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Tomb Diagram added to the Court Record. Tomb Crime Photo added to the Court Record. Phoenix: I can't thank you enough, Edgeworth. (Honestly, I'd have been so lost without him these past few days.) ???: You there! The \"Barbed Head\" lawyer, Phoenix Wriiiiiight! Phoenix: Huh? .........You're... from the Ga'ran Royal Guard, right...? Royal Guard: I am Lah'kee, royal guard member and Her Eminence's shoooooulder rubber!!! Phoenix: That's... very specific... And what does the royal shoulder rubber want with me? Wait, come to think of it, my shoulders ARE a bit stiff-- Royal Guard: Don't be absuuurd!!! I am here for one purpose ooonly!!! I am to bring you before Her Eminence... ...Queen Ga'ran, grand priestess of Khura'in!! Will you complyyy?!!! Phoenix: The queen? What could she want with me? (And why does he have to shout like that?) Edgeworth: Hmm... I can't fathom why Queen Ga'ran would summon you... ...but I advise you to accept Her Eminence's gracious invitation. .........Royal shoulder rubber Lahkee, was it? May I join Mr. Wright in his audience with the queen? Royal Guard: The name's Lah'kee! L-A-H apostrophe K-E-E!!! And...! All praise the omnipotent Queen Ga'raaan!!! For she has already foreseen and approved your request, Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth!!! You are both to come with meeeee!!! Edgeworth: You mean to say that Queen Ga'ran sees our every move? Royal Guard: Yes indeeeed! Her Eminence's spiritual power is immeeeeeeense!!! She can even see what's going on thoooousands of miiiiiiiiles away!!! Edgeworth: .........Wright. I fear I'll lose my hearing next if we don't hurry. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Me, too... Why would the queen herself summon me personally? What could she possibly be up to? Examine Temple Phoenix: There weren't any hotels available, so this is our home for tonight. It's a bed to sleep in and a roof over our heads. Phoenix: Sorry to disappoint, but... there aren't any beds here. We'll have to sleep on the floor next to a bunch of strangers. Edgeworth: Wh-What? ...Tell me there's a shower at the very least. Phoenix: The kitchen sink works just fine, I hear. Edgeworth: Of all the-- Wright, you will work to bring this case to a swift resolution. The sooner the better. Edgeworth: .........I suppose it will do. Spring Phoenix: The water's so clear, it's like a window into the soul. Edgeworth: I wouldn't stare too hard into it, Wright. Or you may find all your bluffs staring right back at you. Phoenix: No pool-gazing in front of a client. Got it. Temples in background Edgeworth: There appears to be many temples in this area. Phoenix: Yeah, there are always a lot of monks and worshippers praying around here. And then there's tourists like us. Edgeworth: It's unfortunate that we have more pressing matters to attend to. Then again, sightseeing with you of all people isn't exactly at the top of my list. Phoenix: (As if you have the luxury to be so picky, Edgeworth.) Talk Any Ideas? Edgeworth: So you'd been here all this time. I wondered where you had gone. Phoenix: ...Don't tell me you missed me, Edgeworth? Edgeworth: As if. The courts have been so peaceful without you around. Phoenix: You make it sound like I leave legal devastation in my wake. Edgeworth: Heh... Well, don't you? What to do Edgeworth: Well, Wright, what do you intend to do now? Phoenix: I was thinking... I want to help Apollo win this case. So why don't we try to gather whatever information we can? Edgeworth: You're quite the considerate boss. Phoenix: Well, I kinda forced him to take care of the office in my absence, so... ...it's the least I can do. Present Attorney's Badge or Tomb Diagram Edgeworth: Still at it, I see. I guess borders mean little in the face of your incurable habit. Phoenix: Well, I heard you used to present evidence left and right during your investigations, too. Edgeworth: That was a long time ago. ...Besides, who did you hear that from? Phoenix: Oh, I have my sources. Edgeworth: Oh? Well, tell your \"source\" that I look forward to his next salary review. Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Edgeworth: It's ironic that the man tasked with upholding the law should end up breaking it. Phoenix: Well, it's not like we don't have our fair share of that back home. Edgeworth: Hmph, that is a thing of the past. The worst offenders have already been removed. Phoenix: Now that you mention it, wasn't Gaspen Payne expelled from the prosecutor's office? Edgeworth: Yes, he was a particularly troublesome individual. I was shocked to see him resurface here in Khura'in, and with considerable sway, no less. I just hope he doesn't end up making a mess of things here as well. Royal Residence Examine Ga'ran Palace Phoenix: Ga'ran Palace, the heart of the kingdom's government and religion. Edgeworth: Yes, the two are inseparably intertwined here in Khura'in. The religious beliefs of its people touch every aspect of their lives, including legal affairs. Phoenix: Right. Like how they commune with spirits in court. I suppose Khura'inism is the glue that binds their faith, law, and politics together. It may seem strange to foreigners like us, but for them, it's perfectly natural. Landscape Phoenix: What a beautiful place this is. But I'd be enjoying this a whole lot more if we weren't investigating a murder. Edgeworth: Commoners aren't normally allowed access to the royal residence, you know. Under ordinary circumstances, it would be impossible to take in such a spectacular view. Though murder is certainly a unique reason to be offered such a rare opportunity. Rayfa's residence Phoenix: This place is decorated with all sorts of colorful flowers. And that view from the veranda looks like it would be amazing. If I had to guess, I'd say Rayfa must live here. Amara's Tomb Phoenix: Amara's Tomb -- the scene of Inga's murder. Poor Maya was held captive in there. Edgeworth: To think she was actually being held here in Khura'in. If only we had found out sooner. Phoenix: ...No point dwelling on that now. All we can do is to keep moving forward. Edgeworth: Yes, of course. Footprints Edgeworth: There are footprints coming from this residence. Phoenix: Too bad they just kinda end. I wonder who made them and where they went. Urns Phoenix: This overturned urn spilled its water all over the place. It was already knocked over when we got here earlier this afternoon, so... ...we can rule out Athena at least. Edgeworth: .........Wright. What does it say about you if your first suspect is your own subordinate? Inga's residence Phoenix: ...What a gaudy building. Looks like something you'd appreciate, Edgworth. Edgeworth: ...For the record, Wright, I have absolutely no interest in such ostentatious things. Phoenix: (Says the man who rides around in a red sports car, wearing that frilly cravat thing.) Amara's Tomb Examine Anywhere Phoenix: Apollo and Athena are already working this area. Edgeworth and I should try someplace else. Detention Center Examine Bell Edgeworth: This bell must be for summoning the guard. Phoenix: I bet one of your detectives would come running if you rang it. Edgeworth: Let's find out, shall we? Phoenix: Th-They're not seriously going to show up, are they? Guard Phoenix: Oh, the guard's asleep. And here I thought he was stoically doing his duty. Impressive. May 18Ga'ran Palace - Audience Chamber Ga'ran: Ah, the \"Barbed Head\" lawyer has arrived. We bid you welcome. And you, as well, Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth. Phoenix: Th-Thank you. (This place is still as magnificent as last time.) Ga'ran: We have heard much about you, Barbed One. It seems your bluffs and tomfoolery tend to leave our court devastated in their wake. Phoenix: Uh... Is that what people have been saying about me? Edgworth: ...Wright! Where are your manners?! Your Eminence. I am both humbled and delighted to be in your presence. Phoenix: Oh, umm... Your Eminence... Um, glad to be here. Looks like you're doing well. Ga'ran: ...Heh. It is all right. There is no need to keep your head bowed all day. Edgeworth: Yes, Your Eminence. Rayfa: ............ Phoenix: (Rayfa's not looking too good. I guess even she can't just bounce back from her father's murder...) ...So what can I do for you, Your Eminence? Ga'ran: We wish to question you about something related to the case at hand. Phoenix: (Perfect. Because I have a few questions of my own.) Examine Throne Phoenix: That's one swanky throne. I wouldn't mind taking a seat there myself. Edgeworth: The jester and the crown. I imagine it'd make quite the interesting picture. Phoenix: You know Edgeworth... I hate to say this, but you're absolutely right. Guards Phoenix: It's the Ga'ran Royal Guard. The one who came for us earlier said that he's the royal shoulder rubber. ...Um, excuse me. But are each of you charged with your own specific task? Royal Guard: I'm the royal teeeeeaaaa server! Royal Guard: I'm the royal taaaaaaster! Royal Guard: I'm the royal bed maaaaaaaker! Royal Guard: I'm the royal fitness traaaaiiiiine-- Phoenix: All right, all right... I'm sorry I asked. Edgeworth: At this rate, one has to wonder if there is no task left unassigned by Her Eminence. Talk Inga's crime Ga'ran: We fear we do not fully comprehend what has transpired. So it is that we summoned you here to further elucidate the situation. Is it true that our husband Inga had been seeking the Founder's Orb? Phoenix: That's right. He wanted to trade a hostage for it. That's why he abducted Maya Fey. Rayfa: Insolent fool! *ka-tonk!* Phoenix: Oww! Rayfa: That is a lie! A lie, I say! Father would have never done such a thing! Phoenix: B-But he did abduct Maya. That much is-- Rayfa: I will not stand here and listen to this nonsense! You will pay for this, you... you...! *ka-tonk!* *ka-tonk!* *ka-tonk!* Phoenix: Ow-Ow-Oww! P-Please, Your Benevolence! Ga'ran: That is quite enough, Rayfa. We understand your feelings, but we fear he speaks the truth. For we believe we know why your father would do such a thing. Rayfa: Huh? Ga'ran: We believe he was seeking the orb as a means of obtaining spiritual power. And with it, he intended to usurp the throne. Rayfa: .........M-Mother... Phoenix: What do you mean, Your Eminence? Ga'ran: Inga was planning a coup, for he was dissatisfied with the current administration... ...and his secret police was the primary instrument of his treason. Phoenix: The secret police... They came up during the high priest's murder trial, too. An elite force under the direct command of the Minister of Justice -- in this case, Inga. The man who was hunting down rebels as Lady Kee'ra was a member of that group. Ga'ran: Indeed. Inga turned that once proud force into his own private army. And he intended on using them to launch a coup and assassinate us. Edgeworth: So Your Eminence had no control over them? Ga'ran: As much as it shames us to admit it, Khura'in is not the unified realm it would appear to be. We are truly sorry you have had to witness the dirty underbelly of our kingdom. Rayfa: H...How could Father...? Ga'ran: But know that Inga could not have become king simply through our assassination. For in Khura'in, only those who possess spiritual power may sit on the throne. Edgeworth: I see... That explains why Minister Inga was seeking the Founder's Orb. Ga'ran: Barbed One, do you recall the man known as Pees'lubn Andistan'dhin? Phoenix: ...What about him? Ga'ran: He, too, was involved in Inga's machinations. Inga had bought his loyalty, ordered the man to steal the orb, and covered up the theft. Phoenix: And then, he sent the orb to the U.S. for Dr. Buff to study... It's all coming together... Dhurke the criminal Ga'ran: The capture of the infamous villain Dhurke Sahdmadhi... It may prove to be the crowning achievement of our reign. Now, perhaps, the kingdom may return to the peace it once knew. Oh, what a joyous day. Royal Guard: Hail to Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran, Grand Priestess of Khura'in! Her Eminence's spiritual power invoked a blessing straight from the Holy Mother! Phoenix: (I could see how her cronies would be elated at the prospect. But the queen herself seems almost giddy for someone whose husband was just murdered.) Rayfa: Father... Phoenix: (Rayfa, on the other hand, doesn't appear to be taking it so well.) About that incident that occurred twenty-three years ago... The one in which Dhurke was accused of assassinating Queen Amara. Ga'ran: Yes, he set fire to her private residence, burning my dear sister alive. Phoenix: Murder by arson... Ga'ran: ONly a demon would be capable of such a heinous crime. Phoenix: (But that event also set the stage for you to become queen...) What did you do before you were crowned queen, Your Eminence? Ga'ran: As part of our training to be queen, we served in many different governmental positions. The longest of which was as the previous Minister of Justice. It was in that position that we were best able to support our elder sister, Queen Amara. Phoenix: (Interesting... That's her husband's position, or at least it was.) And when you ascended to the throne, you passed the Defense Culpability Act. Defense Culpability Act (appears after \"Dhurke the criminal\") Phoenix: \"...those who would support criminals will be deemed just as guilty.\" What prompted you to pass something like the Defense Culpability Act, Your Eminence? Ga'ran: ...The assassination of our dear sister Amara. When the infamous villain Dhurke Sahdmadhi was apprehended... ...he announced that he would act as his own lawyer. Phoenix: (That's right... Dhurke used to be a lawyer.) Ga'ran: Dhurke had been an extraordinarily talented lawyer, and highly esteemed by the people. But he falsified evidence in an attempt to win his own case. Phoenix: I see... Ga'ran: But when the truth of his fabrications and the assassination of the queen came to light... ...the people were devastated. And trust in the legal system plummeted. Edgeworth: .........Now why does that sound so familiar? Phoenix: Yeah, I wonder, aha-hah-hah... Ga'ran: In Khura'in, the Hall of Justice is a sacred space where victims receive their last rites. Should the people lose their faith in it, the kingdom would be shaken to its very core. That is why the Defense Culpability Act had to be passed. It was the only way to keep our legal system from tumbling into the abyss. Phoenix: So that's how you sought to eliminate the use of perjury and phony evidence, huh. But that law is what made lawyers go extinct in your kingdom. Now there's no one left to defend those who have been accused. Ga'ran: .........We see how you could take issue with such a reality. However, we have not banned the act of lawyering itself. Those who are confident that they can prove their client's innocence... ...are always welcome to mount a vigorous defense, as you yourself have shown. Phoenix: W-Well, I guess so, but... Without lawyers, there's the possibility of false charges being filed and prosecuted. Ga'ran: So long as our prosecutors continue to run nothing but perfect trials... ...there needn't be fear of such nefarious dealings. Do you disagree? Phoenix: (Perfect prosecutors and their perfect trials, huh...) Edgeworth: Let's not get started down THIS path... Ga'ran: Furthermore, here in Khura'in, we have the Divination Séance. And so it is we no longer need lawyers, for the dead do not lie. Phoenix: Well, in the short time I've been here, I've beaten back false charges twice. And I've found that cases built on the memories of the dead are less than perfect. So yes, I do take issue with the Defense Culpability Act, to say the least. Ga'ran: ...Ho ho ho. Such relentless rhetoric. Your reputation precedes you, Barbed One. It feels as if we ourselves were being cross-examined. Phoenix: O-Oh, no, that wasn't my intention. Ga'ran: ...It is true that some feel that the Defense Culpability Act is a necessary evil at best. But it is a small sacrifice upon which the peace of our kingdom has been forged. Phoenix: (If you consider executing innocent lawyers a small sacrifice, then sure.) Ga'ran: The fact is that following its passage... ...the crime rate here in Khura'in dropped markedly. Therefore, we have no regrets concerning the enactment of the Defense Culpability Act. Phoenix: (Really? None at all?) Edgeworth: Wright, why don't we leave it at that? This isn't a court of law, after all. Phoenix: Y-Yeah... Present Anything Phoenix: Um, please take a look at this... Ga'ran: ...That reminds us of when Dhurke was still practicing law. So, we see that lawyers in your country also present evidence... ...simply to gauge the other party's reaction when all else has failed. Do not presume to use such simplistic methods upon us. Phoenix: S-Sorry. After clearing all Talk options: Ga'ran: About the Founder's Orb that was to be exchanged for the hostage... It went missing after the murder. Would you happen to know anything about that? Phoenix: It's missing? I'm sure Dhurke had it when he went into the tomb. If it wasn't there, I have no idea where it could be, Your Eminence. Ga'ran: ...In that case, then perhaps Dhurke has hidden it somewhere. ...Incidentally... there is the matter of that horned youth you were with. Phoenix: Oh, you must mean Apollo. Ga'ran: From his odd hairstyle, may we assume him to be a relative? Perhaps, your younger brother? Phoenix: N-No, no! You've got it all wrong. He's Dhurke's son. Well, more like foster son -- they're not actually related by blood. Ga'ran: Dhurke's...? .........Royal guard! Royal Guard: Your Eminence! Phoenix: Hm? (What's she whispering in that one guy's ear?) Ga'ran: .........Thank you for your time. The two of you may go now. Edgeworth: Yes, Your Eminence. We'll be on our way. Phoenix: (Okay, now what? Apollo and Athena have the murder scene investigation covered, so... ...maybe we should go speak with the locals over at the bazaar.) May 18Khura'in - Bazaar RAWWWRRR! Edgeworth: Wh-What... Was that a lion? Phoenix: Oh, that? Caught me by surprise, too, when I first heard it. It's the cry of a local bird known as a warbaa'd. Edgeworth: A bird? That sounds like that? Warbaa'd: RAWWWRRR! Edgeworth: Sounds more like a beast than a bird, if you ask me. Phoenix: It's a form of mimicry. You know, to help protect them against predators and stuff. Edgeworth: Yes, well... Can't say I've heard one quite like that before. Phoenix: Oh, it's more than unusual -- it's endangered. It's extremely rare to encounter one in the wild these days. Edgeworth: ...If it's so rare, then what's one doing out here in the middle of the bazaar? Phoenix: You got me. Maybe it's got something to do with it being their national bird. *BANG* Phoenix: Aaahh! (Was that a gunshot?!) ???: Har har har har har! Startle ya, PW? Phoenix: Wh-What was that, Datz?! Datz: The Defiant Dragons' newest weapon. I call these puppies... Dragon Snot Snaps! Phoenix: Uh, huh... And you need those... why? Datz: Because our hard work is starting to pay off! Thanks to our TV signal hijacking and stuff, more and more people are joining our cause. But on account o' that, the regime's been cracking down on us real tough-like. Phoenix: Yeah, there's been a lot going on lately. Datz: You can say that again. I mean, what with the high priest's fake-murder-slash-suicide. People are calling it the \"DCA Tragedy,\" and it's causing a real public uproar. Phoenix: (Hopefully this means Tahrust's death won't be in vain after all.) ...So how exactly is a handful of firecrackers going to be of help to you guys anyway? Datz: Simple. First, I supply 'em to our fellow rebels. Then we use 'em as a diversion when we need to shake Ga'ran's goons. Phoenix: Huh? Datz: Like this! *BANG!* Phoenix: Whoa! W-Will you cut that out?! I'm not with the regime, and I'm not chasing you! Datz: Har har har har har har! Haaaar har har har har! Your reaction! That was priceless, PW! Warbaa'd: RAWWWRRR! Datz: Har har har har har har! Guess I startled that warbaa'd, too! Phoenix: (It's a miracle no one's trying to arrest him while he's too busy laughing.) ???: You there. Datz: ! Rayfa: You are one of those insurgents, are you not? Datz: Yikes! ...Take that! *BANG!* Rayfa: Eek! Phoenix: Aaand he's gone. Those firecrackers are more useful than I thought. Rayfa: Barbed Head! Phoenix: Your Benevolence. What can I do for you? Rayfa: I... I wanted to speak with you. .........About what my mother said... I do not believe a word of it. My father could not have been planning a coup. Phoenix: Well, I can understand why you'd feel like that, but... Rayfa: It was a setup! Someone must have been plotting against him. Phoenix: Um, and how do you know that? Rayfa: I just do. Because the Holy Mother guides me. And as the royal priestess, I must uncover the truth for all to see. Phoenix: (Hmm... Maybe this is just how Rayfa expresses her sense of duty.) Rayfa: You're investigating this matter, are you not? Then rejoice, for I shall accompany you, and bestow upon you the royal priestess's wisdom. Phoenix: Ha, a-ha ha. That's the best news I've heard all day, Your Benevolence. (No one would dare get in our way with Rayfa by our side.) We humbly accept your offer, don't we, Edgeworth. Edgeworth: As you wish, Wright. Rayfa: Excellent. Then let us begin with my father's private quarters. We should be able to find some clues there. I shall expose this false charge for what it is, if it is the last thing I do! Phoenix: (Could it be? Is the reason she's so defensive about Inga because she's a daddy's girl?) Rayfa: Barbed Head! Let us not waste any time! My father's private quarters are located within the royal residence. Now, follow me! Phoenix: Wait! She's sure in a hurry. Edgeworth: Wright, the minister's private quarters may hold evidence related to his murder as well. Phoenix: Yeah, maybe we can kill two birds with one stone. (Rayfa's awfully fired up. I just hope she'll be ready for the truth we find. After all, it's hard to believe that Inga was not in full control of the whole affair.) Examine Any point of interest Edgeworth: I never thought the day would come when we'd be investigating a case side by side. Phoenix: Oh? 'Cause I never thought the day would come when you'd get sentimental on me. Edgeworth: Nghrk! Come on, Wright! Time's a wasting! Phoenix: Wait, exactly which one of us was wasting time here? May 18Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence Phoenix: Now, if we could figure out which of these buildings houses Inga's private quarters... That's where we'll find Rayfa. Examine Inga's residence Phoenix: Now that's what I call an extravagant exterior. Is this where Inga's private quarters are? Edgeworth: Watch your step, Wright. That urn's been knocked over, spilling water everywhere. Phoenix: Yeah, the ground's soaked. I wonder who did this? ???: .........*sob* Phoenix: Hm? ...I think someone's in there. ???: *sob* Father... *sniffle* Phoenix: Is that... Princess Rayfa? Rayfa: There were still so many things I wished to tell you... Phoenix: (...She always puts on such a brave face. But hearing her crying all alone... I... I can't help but think of Trucy.) Rayfa: *sob* Father... ............... Phoenix: ...Um, Princess Rayfa? Are you in there? Rayfa: Ah! J-Just a moment! I'll be right out! .........I see you are finally here. Well, let us commence our investigation, shall we? Phoenix: ...Um, Your Benevolence? Maybe you should rest for a minute first. Rayfa: ...! You were eavesdropping on me! Weren't you?! Phoenix: Um, no! I mean, yes... Sorry. I couldn't help overhearing... Rayfa: .........Grrrr. Phoenix: I-It wasn't like I was spying on you or anything! Rayfa: ...You stupid... stupid... Barbed Head! *ka-tonk!* Phoenix: Yeowch! Edgeworth: ...You could've feigned ignorance. It's as if your brain-to-mouth filter shuts off the moment you step out of the courtroom. Phoenix: Ugh... I'm not THAT bad, Edgeworth. Rayfa: ...Anyway, what took you so long? I thought you would never get here. You have a lot of nerve, keeping the crown princess waiting. Phoenix: Oh, um... sorry? Rayfa: This was my father's residence. I have already unlocked it, so you can go right in. Oh, and... Be careful. Some dingbat dog in the courtyard and spilled water over there. Phoenix: A dingbat dog? Rayfa: That's right. The yappy mutt spilled a whole urn's worth. Phoenix: I wonder how it got into this area. Do you know what it looked like? Rayfa: Hmph. I have better things to do than to memorize what some stray dog looks like. Anyway, it is not worth talking about. Let's search my father's room, shall we? Phoenix: (...I really hope she's all right.) Inga's residence (subsequent times) Edgeworth: The Minister of Justice used to live here. Phoenix: Yeah, the decor looks like something he'd choose. After examining Inga's residence in Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence: May 18Ga'ran Palace - Inga's Private Quarters Phoenix: (What a mess. You can definitely tell a guy used to live in this room. I guess Inga and I had at least that much in common.) Rayfa: ...Bah, this staff keeps getting in the way. Nayna! .................. ...Oh. Phoenix: (Huh? Where's Nayna? Normally... ...she comes running whenever Rayfa calls.) Rayfa: ...That's right. Nayna is... Phoenix: (Nayna is... what?) Rayfa: Oh, well. You, Barbed Head! Come, hold this staff for me. Phoenix: Wh-Why me? Rayfa: Just take it! It's too heavy, and I am tired of holding it! Phoenix: (*sigh* How does Nayna put up with this day in and day out?) Um... I'll just set it over here for now. Examine Shoeprints Phoenix: There are some muddy shoeprints here. (Come to think of it... There was some spilled water by the entrance. Somebody must've stepped in it before coming in here.) Edgeworth: They're already dry. That means they're at least several hours old. Rayfa: Then someone must have been in here today in the early afternoon... ...for our servants clean this room each day. Here in Khura'in we have a saying: \"Leave not today's untidiness to the morrow.\" Phoenix: (Mine is: \"Why clean up today what you can leave for tomorrow?\") Hair dye bottle Phoenix: What's this? ...\"Je suis L'Belle!\"? Never thought I'd see THIS brand again... Edgeworth: It appears to be a sample of some sort of spray-on hair color. Phoenix: \"Color: Jet Black\"... I wonder if Inga was going grey. Here, Edgeworth. Maybe you can use it. Edgeworth: I like my natural hair color just fine, thank you very much! Desk Phoenix: His desk is crammed full of documents! Edgeworth: Hmm... They appear to be paperwork for executions. Phoenix: B-But for this many cases?! Edgeworth: Indeed. Something is rotten in the Kingdom of Khura'in. Hm? This one dates back to five years ago. Phoenix: Something tells me he simply kept putting them off because he hated doing paperwork. Bed Phoenix: That's one luxurious and comfy-looking bed. I've slept on nothing but hard floors since coming to Khura'in. Can't wait to sleep in a nice, soft bed again. Rayfa: Then take it. It's yours, if you wish. ......We'll have to clean this room out, anyway, now that my father's gone. Phoenix: But don't you want to keep these things as a memento of your father? Besides... I don't need his spirit haunting me late at night. Rayfa: .........Do you suppose if I slept on it, I could see my father once more? Phoenix: P-Princess Rayfa... (I honestly don't know how to answer that...) Bust Phoenix: Wow... That's one gaudy sculpture. Rayfa: My father sculpted it himself from a block of solid gold. Phoenix: (Why does it not surprise me that he was also a narcissist?) Ha ha ha. It's pretty detailed. He even included that personal stamp of his. Hey, the stamp's a little loose. Ah! Edgeworth: Look. There's a secret safe inside! Rayfa: Oh, my! To think such a thing was here all this time! Phoenix: Rats. Looks like we'll need the combination to get in. Bust (subsequent times) Edgeworth: To have a secret safe in his own bedroom... It seems the minister was a rather cagey man. Phoenix: Let's take a look inside. Who knows what we might find. Safe (after examining bust) Phoenix: We can't open this without the combination, but I doubt Princess Rayfa would know it... Edgeworth: Well, if we can't open it, we can't open it. For now, let's continue our investigation, and come back to this dilemma later. Syringe Phoenix: It's a syringe and a vial... Rayfa: Those were for my father's back pain. He said it really helped when the pain was particularly unbearable. Phoenix: It was that bad, huh. Edgeworth: He must've been injecting some sort of painkiller directly into his back, then. Rayfa: Yes, my father said his back pain could knock him off his feet. Phoenix: I know the feeling. I've experienced some pretty severe back pain of my own... Rayfa: Well, we can't have you throwing your back out in court, so why don't you take a vial? Phoenix: Oh, uh, no thanks. I hear your body builds up a tolerance to that sort of thing. Painkiller Shots ninja'd into pocket. Rayfa: I thought you didn't want them. Phoenix: (I'm going straight to a chiropractor as soon as I get home.) Syringe (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's a syringe and a vial... Rayfa: Those were for my father's back pain. He said it really helped when the pain was particularly unbearable. Phoenix: It was that bad, huh. Edgeworth: He must've been injecting some sort of painkiller directly into his back, then. Rayfa: Yes, my father said his back pain could knock him off his feet. Phoenix: I know the feeling. I've experienced some pretty severe back pain of my own... Backrest of chair Phoenix: This chair looks like it was modeled after Inga's suit jacket. Edgeworth: Hmm... The backrest even has those fancy buttons of his. I imagine they make the chair awfully uncomfortable to sit on. Rayfa: Actually, they served to massage the pressure points on his back. My father suffered from terrible back pain, you see. Phoenix: ...I wonder if it really works. Notepad Phoenix: This notepad must've belonged to Inga. Let's see... That's strange. Edgeworth: These appear to be notes detailing people's most prominent characteristics. Phoenix: Hey, there's even some stuff about me in here. Why would he bother doing this? Rayfa: Hmm... I am afraid even I can't answer that. Phoenix: (Whatever the reason, it's giving me a case of the heebie-jeebies.) Edgeworth: Hmm... It's as though he was taking down descriptions of people over the phone... That's what it reminds me of, anyway. Rayfa: What a brilliant deduction! One fitting of a chief prosecutor such as yourself. I commend you. Edgeworth: ...Heh, that's high praise coming from you, Your Benevolence. Phoenix: (Edgeworth's right. They do look like dictation notes, but... I don't know... I mean, why bother describing Nayna, who he must've seen every day?) Inga's Notepad added to the Court Record. Notepad (subsequent times) Phoenix: It's the notepad with those descriptions of various people in it. I wonder what Inga was using it for. Move Rayfa: Barbed Head. First you make me wait, and now you're simply going to leave?! Phoenix: (Guess I should stay put for a while.) Talk The kidnapping Rayfa: Barbed Head... I, the Royal Priestess of Khura'in, shall share my thoughts on the abduction. Phoenix: You will? Rayfa: ......Listen carefully, for such opportunities do not come often. Phoenix: Y-Yes, of course. We'd be grateful to hear anything you'd like to share. Rayfa: ...My father was very likely seeking to obtain the Founder's Orb. But it was not for the purposes of a coup d'état. It was all... for my sake! Phoenix: For your sake? Rayfa: The Founder's Orb is capable of bestowing great spiritual power. My father truly believed that. And he wanted that power to be mine. I haven't finished my training, and I still can't channel spirits! He was doing it for me! Phoenix: ......Right, I see. Rayfa: Well? Do you understand why he did it now? Phoenix: ............I do, but... ...it doesn't change the fact that Minister Inga was a kidnapper. Rayfa: Ah! Phoenix: But I guess you don't believe he is, do you? Rayfa: Ooooooh! New information is sure to surface upon further investigation. S-Suffice to say, he did this all for me. End of story! Phoenix: (Was he really trying to obtain the orb for Rayfa? Somehow, I doubt it. Speaking of powers... ...I wonder if Rayfa will be performing the Divination Séance tomorrow. I should probably ask her about that. Nayna Phoenix: Your Benevolence, I noticed Nayna isn't with you today. Rayfa: .........I know not where she has gone. I have not spoken with her since this morning. I assume she must be quite busy today. I did catch a glimpse of her a little after two o'clock. I tried calling out to her... ...but she went off somewhere again. Phoenix: A little after two? That's about an hour before the murder. Rayfa: ...Indeed. Of all the times for this to happen... She normally comes to me the moment I call her name. Phoenix: (I know it's hard to believe, but even nannies have lives, you know...) Edgeworth: Your inability to find her after the murder is slightly alarming. I wonder if her absence is related to today's incidents somehow. Rayfa: Do you think she was unwittingly caught up in them? Phoenix: Who knows... At the very least I don't think she was at the scene of the crime. Rayfa: Nayna... I hope she is all right. Phoenix: (Rayfa seems really worried for Nayna.) Tomorrow's Séance (appears after \"The kidnapping\") Phoenix: I take it you'll be conducting tomorrow's Divination Séance? Rayfa: Who else, if not I? Phoenix: Good point. (The thing is... ...Divination Séances are all about what victims experienced in their final moments. So, tomorrow... ...Rayfa will experience her own father's death, exactly as it happened. That's more than anyone should ever have to deal with.) ...Do you really have to go through with the Séance tomorrow? There's really no one else? What about just calling the whole thing off? Rayfa: ............It's not as if... ...It's not as if I'm doing this because I want to. Phoenix: No? Rayfa: Ah! N-Never mind. I misspoke! The Divination Séance is a very important duty of the royal priestess. And it is one I intend to fulfill. Phoenix: (There's that word: duty.) Maya: ...Your Benevolence. As crown princess, you are destined to rule this kingdom one day. That means there will be many things that you alone must determine. Things like how to keep your people happy, and what is true and what is false... And most importantly, what role you must play therein. Rayfa: .................. I wonder if I am even up to the task. Phoenix: (Performing the Divination Séance IS very important for a priestess... ...but duty or not, it's a heavy burden for someone so young. Even worse, she'll be forced to watch her father's murder. Will it be a weight too heavy for her to bear?) Nayna and Rayfa (appears after \"Nayna\") Phoenix: Your Benevolence, has Nayna served you long? Rayfa: Yes, she has been at my beck and call for as long as I can remember. I have heard she even cared for me as an infant, right down to changing my diapers. Phoenix: Your diapers? It almost sounds like she could be your mother. Rayfa: Indeed. But that is a simple fact of life when your mother is busy being queen. Nayna takes care of my every need. She is my teacher in all things, as well. Phoenix: (Rayfa's pool of knowledge seems rather lopsided in some respects. Could that be the result of Nayna's teachings?) Rayfa: Nayna... Could it be that my trusted attendant has come to dislike me? Now that I think about it, perhaps I've been acting rather spoiled as of late. Phoenix: Oh, I'm sure she'll be back. Rayfa: ...Yes, I suppose Nayna would never truly abandon me. Upon her return, I will do something nice for her. Perhaps she'd like a shoulder massage. Phoenix: (And yet, I can't shake the feeling that Nayna's connected to this case in some way.) Present Attorney's Badge Rayfa: Remove that vile badge from my sight! If you insist on tormenting me, I will take matters into my own hands! Phoenix: Hey, don't bite it! Rayfa: ............ Hmm, it's much harder than I thought. Phoenix: ...What did you think it's made of? Tomb Crime Photo Rayfa: ...! ............ Phoenix: Um, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: .........Father. Phoenix: Whoops, s-sorry! Didn't mean to hurt you like that. Rayfa: Hmph! Do not underestimate me! I am the royal priestess, and as such I will experience my father's death tomorrow. So hand it over! A photo of a corpse... will not... phase... Phoenix: Your Benevolence! Edgeworth: Wright, you fool! Put that picture away! Rayfa: ...Nngh. There is no need to worry. I simply lost my footing, that's all. Phoenix: (Now I'm REALLY worried about tomorrow.) Painkiller Shots Rayfa: My father's back used to cause him considerable pain. I would give him massages from time to time. He seemed to truly enjoy them. Phoenix: Hmm, I didn't peg you as the dutiful daughter type. Rayfa: But never again... will I... Phoenix: Your Benevolence... Um... I could stand in for your father if you'd like-- Rayfa: ............Rrgh! *WHAM* Phoenix: Youch! M-My back! I think you broke something! Rayfa: Hmph. That's what I call the royal treatment. Inga's Notepad Rayfa: These are notes my father took on the characteristics of those around him. I wonder what he wrote about me. Phoenix: Let's see... Pink raiment... Tattoos on face... Ch-Childishly cute?! Rayfa: Huh?! Phoenix: That last one's rather subjective, isn't it... Anything else Phoenix: Your Benevolence, I wanted to ask you about this. Rayfa: Nayna! Nayna! Where are you?! Phoenix: Um, I thought you said she wasn't around... Rayfa: ...Oh, yes, of course......... Well, you're sadly mistaken if you think questioning Nayna will clear things up. Phoenix: (But I'm trying to question you, not Nayna.) After clearing all Talk options and examining shoeprints, hair dye bottle, bust, syringe, and notepad: Phoenix: I'm really beginning to wonder what's inside that safe. Any idea what the combination might be, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: None whatsoever. Phoenix: (It looks like a four-digit combo lock, so maybe it's a date. But it's probably not anything that would be easy to guess.) Well, let's try some dates and see what happens. I wonder what date Inga would use as a combination? Date the DC Act was enacted Phoenix: How about the date the Defense Culpability Act was enacted? Do you know when that was, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: Nayna! Nayna! Edgeworth: Your Benevolence... *whisper, whisper*... Rayfa: Yes, of course... I believe the date would be: June 14! Phoenix: (Really, Edgeworth? Is whispering in the ears of elites the secret to your success?) All right, let's give 0-6-1-4 a try. Nope, that's not it. Time to try something else. Leads back to: \"I wonder what date Inga would use as a combination?\" Parents' anniversary Phoenix: How about your parents' anniversary? Rayfa: Hmm... I have not the faintest idea of when it is. Phoenix: Yeah, I guess you wouldn't, huh. Edgeworth: ...It's December 11. Phoenix: H-How in the world do you know THAT fact, Edgeworth?! Edgeworth: Hmph, I don't. I simply deduced it using elementary school-level logic. Though I doubt you'd grasp how I arrived at my conclusion, so I'll save my breath. Phoenix: (There's no way you didn't use some kind of superpower to come up with that...) Anyway, here goes... 1-2-1-1. ...No good. It won't open. Let's try another number, shall we? Leads back to: \"I wonder what date Inga would use as a combination?\" Rayfa's birthday Leads to: \"When's your birthday, Your Benevolence?\" Phoenix: When's your birthday, Your Benevolence? Rayfa: Hmph, you are wasting your time. It could not possibly be my birthday. Phoenix: Aw, come on. It's worth a shot. Rayfa: ...Fine. It's December 24. Phoenix: Christmas Eve? Well, let's give it a try. 1-2-2-4... Ahhh! ...I-It... It opened! Rayfa: It did?! Phoenix: Yep. And it looks like the bottom safe was a fake. Edgeworth: Something meant to mislead would-be thieves, no doubt. Still, it was rendered quite ineffective by his use of such an easily-guessed combination. Rayfa: Wh-Why, Father...? Why my birthdate...? Examine Open safe Phoenix: Okay, let's see what's in here. Hm? This looks like a letter or something. Let's see... \"Dear Father... I wanted to wish you a happy birthday. You're always so kind, and I love you very much. I hope you live to be a hundred years old! Love, Rayfa.\" ............... Rayfa: I-I wrote this to my father when I was eight years old. F-Father... Why would you hold on to... something so childish and stupid...? Phoenix: .........There are some other papers in here. Hmm... Ah! This... This is the plan for his coup d'état! Rayfa: Wh-What?! Give me that! .........I... I don't understand. Edgeworth: It seems Justice Minister Inga was plotting the assassination of the queen. Rayfa: This... This can't be true. Father would never harm Mother. Phoenix: (Poor Rayfa. This has to come as a terrible shock.) ...What's this? There's a photo in here, too. Hmm... It's of a woman and a baby. I wonder who they are. ...On the far left, there's a law book with the mark of the Defiant Dragons branded on it. Rayfa: .........Wait! Th-Th-That's...! Phoenix: Your Benevolence? Rayfa: ...How... How can this be? *thud* Phoenix: P-Princess Rayfa! Rayfa: ............... Phoenix: (She's looking incredibly pale.) Your Benevolence. Are you all right? Rayfa: .........All right? How can I be all right? Phoenix: Huh? Rayfa: .........All that I have believed... It was all lies. Phoenix: I'm afraid I don't follow. (What the heck's she talking about?) Um... Can I ask who the woman is in this picture? Rayfa: ...H-How should I know?! .........It seems I didn't know ANYTHING that was going on! Phoenix: (...Doesn't look like I'm going to get much more out of her while she's like this.) Woman's Photo added to the Court Record. Rayfa: .........Mother. Phoenix: Huh? Rayfa: I must ask my mother... about the secret she is hiding. Phoenix: Um, what secret...? Rayfa: ...I must go. Goodbye. Phoenix: Wait! ...What was that all about? It's like her mind was off somewhere else. Edgeworth: It appears this photo really upset her. Phoenix: (I wonder who the lady in this picture is.) ???: Stop! Shah'do! Come back here! ???: Ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff ruff! Phoenix: Wait, that sounds like... Ahlbi and Shah'do. Edgeworth: That's odd. Commoners aren't normally allowed in this area. I wonder what's afoot. Any point of interest (after examining open safe) Phoenix: I better not touch anything without Rayfa's permission. Who knows what she might say... or do if she finds out. After examining open safe in Ga'ran Palace - Inga's Private Quarters: May 18Ga'ran Palace - Royal Residence Shah'do: Ruff ruff ruff! Edgeworth: Nghoooooooooh! Phoenix: Ahhh! Edgewooooorth! Edgeworth: .........I hope one of you has a good explanation for this. Ahlbi: Ahhhhhh! I'm SO sorry! Phoenix: Hi, Ahlbi... Ahlbi: No, Shah'do! Bad dog! Leave the man's frilly thingamajig alone! Shah'do: Grrrrrrrrr... Edgeworth: If you would kindly detach your dog from my cravat. Ahlbi: R-Right away, sir! Just hold still, and... Edgeworth: And...? Shah'do: Grrrrrr... Ahlbi: Hrrrrrgh! Hrrrrrrrrrrrgh! Edgeworth: Nghoooh! Stop pulling like that! You'll only stretch the fabric! Ahlbi: Come on, Shah'do...! Let go of his... carava-chamacallit! Shah'do: Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! Ahlbi: Hmm... This isn't working. I'll just have to pull harder, then... One, two... Edgeworth: Wait! What are you--?! Ahlbi: THREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE! RRRRRRRNNNNNNNNGH! .........Come OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON! Edgeworth: NNNNGHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH! AAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! I NEED AAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIIIRRRRRRRRRRR! *huff... huff... huff...* Were you trying to kill me?! Ahlbi: I'm really sorry, mister. My dog has a habit of attacking frilly things like that. Phoenix: (Maybe for his sake, he should stick to more traditional targets, like cars, or his tail...) Ahlbi: What's worse, he snuck in here again today and stole some weird-looking hat. I don't know what to do anymore. Bad dog! You're a very bad dog! Shah'da: *whine* Phoenix: (Wait a second... I've seen that hat before.) Examine Urns (after clearing \"Ahlbi in the courtyard\" Talk option) Leads to: \"Ahlbi, you wouldn't happen to know how this urn got knocked over, would you?\" Talk The frilly hat Phoenix: Ahlbi, could I see that hat again? Ahlbi: Sure! Phoenix: (Wait... Isn't this... Isn't this Nayna's hat? But I thought she'd disappeared.) Ahlbi: Shah'do swiped it from someone. Phoenix: Um, Ahlbi? How exactly did Shah'do get this? Ahlbi: Allow me to explain! It all started while we were on a walk through the bazaar today. When, suddenly, Datz popped out of a manhole! Datz: Hah! Ahlbi: Whoa! Datz: The fangs of the Defiant Dragons... ...Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaah... ...Datz Are'bal is here! .........Say, you wanna join our cause, kid? Ahlbi: (Misattributed to Datz Are'bal in the original release) Huh? Ahlbi: Naturally, I was super startled by that weirdo's sudden appearance. Warbaa'd: RAWWWWWWRRRRRR! Shah'do: Ruff ruff! Datz: Back! Dog of the Ga'ran regime! Ahlbi: (Misattributed to Datz Are'bal in the original release) Huh? But this is my dog, Shah'do... Datz: Defiant Dragon secret weapon: Dragon Snot Snaps! ACHOOOO! *BANG* Ahlbi: WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOA! Oof! Datz: Har har har har har! Aw man, the look on your face! That was classic! Ahlbi: The sudden bang of the firecracker spooked Shah'do, and he ran off into the crowds. Shah'do: Ruff ruff ruff ruff! Ahlbi: Ahhhhhh! Shah'do, come back here! Datz: Har har har har har! That'll teach ya, Ga'ran's lapdog! Policeman: You there! What do you think you're doing?! Datz: ...Ack! Not good! Ahlbi: That's when a policeman came running over and hauled Datz away. That happened right around 2 PM, if I remember correctly. Phoenix: (...I'm not even going to pretend I know what Datz was trying to do.) Ahlbi: I chased right after Shah'do, and... ...when I finally caught up to him here in the palace courtyard, he had this in his mouth. Edgeworth: 2 PM, hmm? That's about an hour before the minister's death. Phoenix: Nayna supposedly went missing after the murder... ...but this would place her here at the palace at around two. (Changed from [...but this would place her here at the palace at around 2.] in the original release) Ahlbi's Statement added to the Court Record. Ahlbi: Actually! I just remembered I saw something pretty amazing around that time, too! Phoenix: Something amazing? The frilly hat (subsequent times) Phoenix: Ahlbi, could I see that hat again? Ahlbi: Sure! Phoenix: (Wait... Isn't this... Isn't this Nayna's hat? But I thought she'd disappeared.) Ahlbi: Shah'do swiped it from someone. Phoenix: Um, Ahlbi? How exactly did Shah'do get this? Ahlbi: Allow me to explain! It all started while we were on a walk through the bazaar today. When, suddenly, Datz popped out of a manhole! Datz: Hah! Ahlbi: Whoa!

Datz: Back! Dog of the Ga'ran regime! Ahlbi: (Misattributed to Datz Are'bal in the original release) Huh? But this is my dog, Shah'do... Datz: Defiant Dragon secret weapon: Dragon Snot Snaps! ACHOOOO! *BANG* Ahlbi: WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOA! Oof! Datz: Har har har har har! Aw man, the look on your face! That was classic! Ahlbi: The sudden bang of the firecracker spooked Shah'do, and he ran off into the crowds. Shah'do: Ruff ruff ruff ruff! Ahlbi: Ahhhhhh! Shah'do, come back here! Datz: Har har har har har!

(Changed from [...but this would place her here at the palace at around 2.] in the original release) Ahlbi: Actually! I just remembered I saw something pretty amazing around that time, too! Phoenix: Something amazing? Something amazing (appears after \"The frilly hat\") Phoenix: So, Ahlbi, what was it you saw that was so amazing? Ahlbi: I saw Her Eminence Queen Ga'ran channeling a spirit! Phoenix: Is it really that big of a deal to see her channeling someone? Ahlbi: You bet it is! Commoners are never allowed to behold the sacred rite. Phoenix: Oh? Can you tell me more? Ahlbi: Of course! I'm always happy to explain! Um... I believe it was around 2:10 PM today. I got lost on the palace grounds while looking for Shah'do. Ahlbi: Ooh... What is this place? It gives me the creeps. Where could Shah'do have gone? Ahlbi: In my search, I took a peek into a small room and... ...that's when I saw Queen Ga'ran! She was channeling a spirit for a neighboring kingdom's king! I saw her transform right before my eyes! I was so excited, I had to take a picture of it! Phoenix: You... You took a picture? Ahlbi: I know I shouldn't have... ...but I just couldn't help myself! Phoenix: (Between this and the treasure room, Ahlbi's not exactly the picture of self-restraint...) Ahlbi: Her channeling rite ended right after that, so I ran off before anyone could spot me. Phoenix: You could've been arrested again, you know. Ahlbi: ...Yeah, I know... ........................ Anyway, here's a copy of the picture. Just don't tell anyone I was the one who took it. Phoenix: (...I worry about his future sometimes.) Channeling Photo added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Come to think of it... ...how did you and Shah'do get into the royal residence anyway? It's not open to commoners, after all. Ahlbi: Allow me to explain! Something amazing (subsequent times) Phoenix: So, Ahlbi, what was it you saw that was so amazing? Ahlbi: I saw Her Eminence Queen Ga'ran channeling a spirit! Phoenix: Is it really that big of a deal to see her channeling someone? Ahlbi: You bet it is!

Phoenix: (...I worry about his future sometimes.) Come to think of it... ...how did you and Shah'do get into the royal residence anyway? It's not open to commoners, after all. Ahlbi: Allow me to explain! Ahlbi in the courtyard (appears after \"Something amazing\") Ahlbi: There's a way to get into the palace from the bazaar. It's a bit of a tight squeeze, though. Shah'do can easily fit, but anyone bigger than me is out of luck. Phoenix: You don't say... Ahlbi: Yeah, part of the palace wall is damaged, and there's a hole I can just make it through. Phoenix: Go on. Ahlbi: Heh heh heh. Betcha didn't know they have some really tasty food here! Phoenix: Oh? Then this isn't your first time in here, huh. ...Trespassing is illegal, you know. Ahlbi: N-No, it's not like that! I didn't mean any harm. It's just... I want to help change this kingdom. Phoenix: What do you mean? Ahlbi: Well, after Ms. Fey's trial, I started thinking. Like maybe... Maybe there was something I could do to help the revolution, too. Phoenix: (...Maya's trial, huh. That tragedy only happened because of how twisted Khura'in's legal system has become.) Nahyuta: How utterly foolish to cast away one's life for such a reason! There must have been other ways to cover up the crime! Tahrust: Yet, had I done so, my wife would rush to my defense. And when the case went to trial... ...she would suffer the same fate as I under the Defense Culpability Act. I could not have lived with myself had she been convicted because of that fiendish man! Rayfa: Th-This... This cannot be... All I have done under the laws of our kingdom... It has all been... Phoenix: (The DC Act led to the false charges against Maya and the high priest's suicide. But that trial also caused the public to start questioning the current state of things. And it seems even Ahlbi has some pretty strong feelings on the matter.) Ahlbi: I knew there had to be something I could do to help! That's when I remembered the hole in the palace wall, and started thinking... ...maybe I could sneak in and take a picture of one of the royals up to no good. I just want to do my part! Edgeworth: The spirit of revolution seems to be catching on, even with one so young. Wright, the momentum is steadily building, and the tipping point is fast approaching. It's just a matter of when. Phoenix: I agree. And the public's perception of the Defiant Dragons seems to be changing, too. But Ahlbi... You can't go trespassing like that. Even if it's for a good cause, it's not right. Ahlbi: Okay. I won't do it again. Phoenix: Ahlbi, is that really all you have to confess? You haven't been up to any other mischief? And when I say \"you,\" I mean Shah'do. Ahlbi: Huh?! Oh, um... I-I... I don't know what you're talking about. Aheh... heh heh heh... Phoenix: (Nice try, Ahlbi, but the proof is literally right in front of us.) Present Attorney's Badge Ahlbi: Oh, that's an attorney's badge from your homeland, right?! I've studied all about it. Allow me to explain! There's a reason why the badge is shaped like a sunflower. You know how sunflowers always turn to face the sun -- the source of their well-being? Well, lawyers are like that -- they will chase after anything that will make them money! Phoenix: Whaaat?! Ahlbi: ...I guess people hate lawyers in your country, too, huh. Phoenix: Umm... Where did you get your information from again? Ahlbi: A proud sermon Chief Prosecutor Payne gave in the middle of the bazaar the other day. Phoenix: Nngh... Lawyers already have a bad enough time here without his lies. Channeling Photo Ahlbi: I know I shouldn't have taken that picture... But it was the first time I'd ever seen a spirit medium at work! I couldn't help myself. Phoenix: (At least he knows what he did was wrong.) Ahlbi: .........100-- no, 400 dahmas per copy sounds about right. Phoenix: Ahlbi... You're not planning to sell this photo to tourists, are you? Ahlbi: ...! Ah-ha ha ha! Come on, Mr. Wright, You don't really think I'd do that, do you? Phoenix: (Now I REALLY fear for his future.) Anything else Phoenix: What do you know about this, Ahlbi? Ahlbi: .........S-Sorry. I don't know anything about that. I'm the worst tour guide ever. Phoenix: N-No, no, it's my fault for randomly whipping it out and asking you about it. Ahlbi: Don't worry. I'll study hard, so I'll be ready to answer all your questions next time! Phoenix: (Argh, now I feel like a jerk.) Phoenix: Ahlbi, you wouldn't happen to know how this urn got knocked over, would you? Ahlbi: Ah! Phoenix: Because Her Benevolence told me something rather interesting. Rayfa: Be careful. Some dingbat dog got in the courtyard and spilled water over there. Phoenix: A dingbat dog? Rayfa: That's right. The yappy mutt spilled a whole urn's worth. Phoenix: The \"dingbat dog\" she mentioned wouldn't happen to be Shah'do, would it? Ahlbi: ...Ooh...! ......... I guess the dog's out of the bag. Sorry I lied. But I was worried I'd get in trouble. I know I shouldn't lie to a lawyer like that. Phoenix: No, it's not good to lie to anyone like that. So let's try to only tell the truth. Okay, Ahlbi? Ahlbi: Oh, Mr. Wright! I almost forgot. I saw a couple of Americans a moment ago. They had really weird haircuts, so I thought they might be friends of yours. Phoenix: ...R-Really, now... Um... Edgeworth: It seems your little friend thinks all us Americans have strange hairstyles. I suppose we have you to thank for that, Wright? Phoenix: ......... So, what exactly did their hair look like? Ahlbi: There was a guy with two crops of hair sticking out of his forehead like antennae. Then there was this lady with a long bunch of hair that looked like a big, orange spider leg. Phoenix: Oh, that sounds like Apollo and Athena. What were they doing? Ahlbi: They were racing through the bazaar... ... with the Ga'ran Royal Guard in hot pursuit! Phoenix: Wait, whaaaaaat?! Edgeworth: Why were they being pursued...? Phoenix: I'm not sure, but I have my suspicions. I just hope they're all right. Ahlbi: S-Sorry for not mentioning it before. It just kind of slipped my mind, heh heh... To be continued May 18Khura'in - Bazaar Apollo: *huff, puff, huff, puff* Those... Those guys... sure are... persistent! Athena: *huff, puff, huff, puff* Yeah. They even wore ME out, and that doesn't happen often. Apollo: Why are they after us, anyway?! Athena: Ah, Apollo! It's the royal guards again! Apollo: Argh! Q-Quick, hide! Royal Guard: Hey! Where'd Horn Head and Spidey Hair gooooooo?!! Athena: ...Spidey Hair? They're not talking about me, are they? Apollo: I-Is that a trick question...? Royal Guard: We know you're hiding somewhere around heeeeeeeeeeere!!! RAWWWRRR! Athena: A-Apollo, that weird-looking bird over there... Did it just...?! Apollo: ...Yeah, it did. It's called a warbaa'd and... You know what? I'll tell you all about it later when we're not being chased by masked men! Royal Guard: Come out, come out, wherever you aaaaare!!! ...Hand over the Founder's Orb, if you know what's good for yooooouuuuuu!!! Apollo: (It figures they're after the orb.) Athena: I don't want to know what they'll do to us if we were captured. If they grill us in those obnoxious, loud voices... ...I'd cave after the first hour and confess to whatever they wanted, truth or no! Royal Guard: Come out now, you foreign deeeeevils!!! This has gone faaaaaar enough!!! You must not keep Her Eminence waiting any looooooonger!!! RAWWWRRR! Apollo: W-We've gotta get out of here! There must be a safe place to hide somewhere! Examine Manhole cover Leads to: \"Look, a manhole.\" Any other point of interest Apollo: Maybe we could hide here. Athena: No way! They'd find us in no time! Royal Guard: Stay where you aaaare!!! Athena: Th-They're closing in on us! Apollo: We've gotta find a place to hide! Talk Any ideas? Athena: Apollo! We shouldn't be standing around talking like this! Who knows what they'll do to us if they catch us! Apollo: You're right. Let's find somewhere safe to hide! Present Anything Athena: Apollo! Do you really HAVE to show that to me right this second?! Apollo: S-Sorry. It's just... something I do now when I'm stuck... Anyway, your shouting isn't helping, either. Royal Guard: That voice! It's Spidey Hair!!! Athena: Eeeeek! ...Hiii-yaaaaaa!!! Royal Guard: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!!! Apollo: (Sh-She sent him flying!) Athena: L-Let's find somewhere else to hide before the other guards get here! Apollo: Look, a manhole. ...Ahhh! That's right! Dhurke: Say, son, do you remember my office? Apollo: ...Sure. (I remember that messy, dimly lit room.) Dhurke: The file I've amassed on Amara's assassination is kept there. I think it might help you on this case. Do you remember how to get there? Apollo: Athena! I know where we can hide! Follow me! Athena: Oh?! Where are we going?! Apollo: Hrrrrrrrnngh! Athena: W-Wait. You're not seriously thinking about going down there? It smells like rotten eggs. And are those rats I hear?! Apollo: We've got no choice! I can get us somewhere safe, but this is the only way in. Quick, before it's too late! Athena: Ugh. It's going to take forever to get this stench out of my hair. May 18Former Sahdmadhi Law Offices Apollo: .........Looks like we lost them. That was close. .................. (Dhurke's office... How long has it been since I last set foot in here?) At least we're safe now, but... (Why is Athena all huddled over in the corner like that?) Datz: Ah! Apollo: Datz? Datz: AJ! What the heck are ya doing here? Apollo: Ga'ran's royal guards are after us. Datz: Har har har! Once a rebel, always a rebel. Don't worry. The regime doesn't know about this place, so ya can relax now. Apollo: Good. But since when am I part of the rebellion? I don't recall signing up. ???: Apollo! Apollo: Mr. Wright? What are you doing here? Phoenix: We saw you two go into that manhole. Edgeworth: You narrowly escaped the guards' notice. Phoenix: It was like watching a pair of ostriches burying their heads in the sand. Apollo: (I guess that was a closer shave than I had thought...) Phoenix: Anyway, you're safe and sound now, and that's what really counts. Oh, I also have some evidence for you. Apollo: Thanks, Mr. Wright. Case evidence received from the boss. Edgeworth: So, what is this dubious hovel we've found ourselves in, anyway? Apollo: It's the Defiant Dragons' safe house... also known as the former Sahdmadhi Law Offices. Edgeworth: I see... Well. Though it might just be happenstance... ...here I am -- a chief prosecutor -- hiding out in a rebel base. Apollo: Um, please don't report this place to the local police, Prosecutor Edgeworth... (Might as well take a look around while we're waiting for the heat to die down out there.) Come on, Athena. Stop moping over there and help me check this place out. Athena: *shudder* Please tell me there's a shower here. Apollo: There's a sink in the kitchen. And if you're lucky, maybe even some soap. Athena: .........I'm sorry I even asked. Examine Picture of Ga'ran Apollo: There's a scary-looking knife sticking out of the queen's picture. If anyone saw this, they'd think the Defiant Dragons were a violent group. Datz: Oh, that? That was actually me trying to kill a fly. I threw that knife at it and whiffed, and the thing ended up stuck right between her eyes. Apollo: You mean this wasn't on purpose?! White flowers Apollo: Datz, what's with the altar? Datz: It's where we pay our respects to the victims of the Defense Culpability Act. The DC Act is a heinous law that puts innocent people to death! Apollo: (A law that's supposed to protect the people sends them to their graves instead... Talk about insane.) Ladder Athena: Wait... Don't tell me we have to go back through the manhole to get out of here... Apollo: The only reason this safe house is still safe is because the front door's been boarded up. Athena: Fine, then I'll just have to live here till the revolution begins! Apollo: ...What if I told you rats come out at night? Athena; Then we'll just have to start the revolution before sundown! Apollo: (I bet the revolution never thought it'd get a new ally this way.) Photos Athena: Hm? Who's the kid... Wait a second! That's YOU, Apollo! I'd recognize those horns anywhere! Apollo: Is that really the only way ANYBODY recognizes me?! Athena: Hee hee hee. You were so cute! ...And who's THAT fine-looking young man? Apollo: That's Nahyuta, back when he used to smile. Athena: ...Wow. His smile is absolutely angelic. Datz: Sure brings back memories! That was taken the day we all went out fishing. Athena: What was Prosecutor Sahdmadhi like when he was younger? Datz: He was kinda quiet, but passionate when it came to his convictions. When he finally made prosecutor, he was all fired up to change Khura'in for the better. But now he's nothing more than Ga'ran's lackey! Apollo: (Seems like Datz has a lot to say about Nahyuta. I'll ask him about his thoughts later. Photos (subsequent times) Apollo: These pictures sure bring back memories. Nahyuta is cheerfully smiling in this one. That quiet smile he gives in court now seems almost fake by comparison. Lizards Athena: Eeewww... Is that a newt? Apollo: Come on, Athena. Can't you tell a gecko when you see one? Athena: What's the difference? Apollo: Geckos like to live in houses, while newts prefer to be outside near water. They're totally different creatures. Athena: Well, how do you know this one wasn't caught outside near some water? It could very well be a gecko. Apollo: No, I'm pretty sure it's a newt. Athena: Oh, so then you agree it's a newt, Apollo? Apollo: Ack! (I fell right into her trap!) Phoenix: You're both wrong. It's just a plain old lizard. TV Apollo: I'm surprised to see so many appliances here. There's even a TV. Datz: Speaking of which, we gave the people of Khura'in quite a shock... ...when \"The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm\" was last on TV. Apollo: You mean that show where actors play the parts of Dhurke and Rayfa? You hijacked that in the middle of its broadcast, right? Datz: Yep. All their writers do each week is try to ruin the Defiant Dragons' good name. So we decided to hit 'em where it hurts! Har har har har har har! Apollo: That must've been real shocking, especially for the kids who'd waited all week to see it. I mean, the show's main villain was actually hijacking the very show he's in! Coat Athena: Dhurke's jacket... You should try it on, Apollo. It might actually suit you. Apollo: R-Really? Datz: There's also a spare eye patch here. Why not try that on, too? Athena: ...Pffft. ...*snicker* Hee hee hee! S-Sorry, sorry. Just picturing you in all that... Ha ha ha ha! It's just too funny! Apollo: (Oww... My pride...) Sign Apollo: Sahdmadhi Law Offices... That's the sign Dhurke used to display out front. Hey, Datz. I heard the office used [sic]do quite a bit of business. Datz: That it did. Dhurke was a famous lawyer with countless courtroom victories, after all. He was the Dauntless Dragon who turned trials upside down... ...snatching victory from the jaws of defeat! His fame as a lawyer spread far and wide across Khura'in back in the day. Apollo: ...I hope the day comes when he can proudly display this sign again. Spider Apollo: What's with all the spider webs, Datz? Don't you ever clean the place? Datz: Not the webs! We have what ya call a symbiotic relationship. They catch the bugs that get in here, and I don't clean 'em up! Apollo: You know... that actually makes a lot of sense. Law book Apollo: This is Dhurke's old law book. Athena: Look, there's a mark on the cover. It looks like it was branded with a hot iron. Apollo: Yeah, I think it was done in protest against the Defense Culpability Act. There's an entry on the DC Act right here. See? Athena: Oh, so this is the infamous anti-lawyer law you guys are always talking about... Dhurke's Law Book added to the Court Record. Law book (subsequent times) Apollo: This is Dhurke's old law book. Athena: Look, there's a mark on the cover. It looks like it was branded with a hot iron. Apollo: Yeah, I think it was done in protest against the Defense Culpability Act. There's an entry on the DC Act right here. See? Athena: Oh, so this is the infamous anti-lawyer law you guys are always talking about... File Athena: I wonder what's in this file. Oh, it's full of newspaper clippings. Apollo: It seems to be a collection of documents and information on Amara's assassination. (So this is what Dhurke was talking about.) Athena: We already know most of the stuff here on top. Let's see what else there is. Wow, where did he get all this? Umm... Anything important here...? Hmm, what about this... \"Apollo's roving musician father got caught up in this incident and lost his life.\" ...Whaaat?! Th-This is about your father, Apollo! Apollo: Looks like it. But I was never told much more than what's written here. Athena: Really? How come? Apollo: Dhurke always skated around the subject. Maybe he thought I was still too young. Plus, I always thought of Dhurke as my dad, so I never really brought it up. Athena: ...Oh, I see. Still... I feel kind of sorry for your real dad. Apollo: (My real dad... I was never really interested in learning about him. But after seeing his picture, I can't help but feel a little curious. I wonder if Datz could tell me anything about him.) Amara's Assassination File added to the Court Record. Athena: ...Apollo, this file looks like it might be useful. But there are so many pages, I can't tell what's important. Apollo: We need someone to help organize all of this. (And I think I know just the person to ask.) File (subsequent times) Apollo: This file has a ton of information on Amara's assassination. We should go over the important parts later. Talk Sahdmadhi Law Offices Apollo: So, Datz, you guys are still using this office, I see. Datz: Yep. 'Cept now it's the official HQ of the Defiant Dragons. But as Dhurke said, and I quote... \"We must keep it for the day when Khura'in needs lawyers once more.\" Phoenix: Restoring the legal system to its rightful form through popular uprising... You can tell how much Dhurke believes in his cause. Datz: Oh, and AJ. Dhurke said something else that might interest ya. He said he hopes you'll come back and take over this office someday. Apollo: T-Take over?! Me? Datz: Those were his words. He may've been half joking though. Datz: Dhurke! Guess what I heard from PW! AJ's become a lawyer! Dhurke: ...Yeah, I've been meaning to tell you. Datz: Must've been because of you, Dhurke! Dhurke: I'm not so sure about that. I imagine he's already forgotten about me. Datz: Whaddaya talking about? I bet he can't wait to follow in your footsteps. Dhurke: Hah, ha ha ha. Nothing would make me happier. Maybe one day he'll return to Khura'in and take over this office. ...Heh. It's just a pipe dream, though. Apollo: .........Dhurke really said that? Datz: Dhurke was never a hands-on kinda dad... ...but not a day went by that he wasn't thinking of ya. That much I'm sure of. Athena: Doesn't get more paternal than that. Apollo: (Dhurke... And to think, I really did spend my days trying to forget you. I'm looking forward to a nice, long talk once you're free.) Nahyuta (appears after examining photos) Apollo: Datz, wasn't Nahyuta once part of the Defiant Dragons? Datz: Yep. Yuty was a rising star in the resistance! He vowed to fight for the cause through the legal system. Said he'd become a prosecutor, and give Inga and Ga'ran the smackdown they deserved! Apollo: But now he's... Datz: Yeah... a puppet of the Ga'ran regime. Not only that, but now he's gonna prosecute his own dad. It doesn't add up! Athena: I wonder what happened to him. Datz: Me, too. But if I had to guess... ...I'd say Ga'ran has some serious leverage over him. Apollo: Leverage? Like what? Datz: Wish I knew. But it seems like Dhurke knows. I tried to press him about it, but he wouldn't say. Apollo: (Come to think of it, Dhurke did say...) Apollo: Nahyuta... is suffering...? Dhurke: Yes. He knows the rightful state of Khura'in's legal system... ...but something forces him to bend to Ga'ran's will, and it's tearing him apart. Apollo: (If that's the case... ...I bet Nahyuta doesn't really want to go through with Dhurke's prosecution.) My father (appears after presenting Photo of My Father) Apollo: Do you know what my biological father was like? Datz: Dhurke once told me about him. He was a modern minstrel, walking the world and making music in his travels. Athena: This file also has some information on your real dad. It says he died in the blaze at Queen Amara's residence twenty-three years ago. Datz: That's right. Dhurke had invited him over. Dhurke's the kinda guy who can become fast friends with just about anyone. And it seems your pops was like that, too, AJ. They hit it off at a bar... ...and the next thing ya know, Dhurke's asked him over to play some tunes. Apollo: And then the place went up in flames... Datz: Yeah. Dhurke had just stepped out for a sec when the fire broke out. .........Apollo. You were there, too, but you were still just a baby. Apollo: ...I remember hearing about that when I was little. Datz: Yeah, it was a crying shame. Your pops just happened to take you along that day. So you were there with him when the fire broke out. But Dhurke risked his life to save you! Apollo: (It's like Dhurke's done nothing but save me all my life...) Datz: All your pops's stuff got burned up. Including anything that could've helped us identify him. All we knew about him at first was his stage name, \"Jangly Justice\" or something like that. Dhurke did everything he could just to dig up what little we know now. Apollo: ...Um, what about my mother? Do you know anything about her? Datz: All we know is she was traveling with your pops. But that day, she was off doing something on her own. Apollo: So then, she probably didn't even know my father had been with Dhurke, huh. Athena: But she must've been desperate to find you and your father once you'd gone missing. Datz: No doubt. But the queen's assassination threw the kingdom into chaos. The police were so overwhelmed, they were probably hardly of any help to her. We searched and searched till our legs gave out, too, but we never found her. And with your father's stuff all burned up, we had zero leads -- not even a photo. Apollo: So that's how I became an orphan... Datz: Yeah... Who knows? Maybe your mom read about the details of the fire in the newspaper. And maybe she figured you'd died along with your pops. Athena: Wow, I had no idea you'd been through all that, Apollo. Present Photo of My Father Apollo: Datz, I wanted to ask you about this picture. Datz: That's the picture of your pops that Dhurke found. And he had a heck of a time tracking it down. He said he searched all over for it! Apollo: Why...? Why would he go through all that trouble? Athena: Datz, please tell us everything you know about Apollo's dad! Dhurke's Law Book Datz: The Mark of the Dragon... That's the symbol of our group, the Defiant Dragons. Apollo: Dhurke has the same mark tattooed on the palm of his hand, right? Datz: Yep. And I've got one, too. Apollo: Really? Where? Datz: On my heart! Apollo: ...Oh, you mean metaphorically. Like you're ready to die at any time for the cause or something like that? Datz: You got that right. Dead or alive, I'll always be a Defiant Dragon! Amara's Assassination File Apollo: Datz, about this file... Can you help me figure out whihc pages are the most relevant? Datz: Yup, sure can. I got the whole thing memorized. See this page? It's definitely worth a look. Athena: Oh, that's right! Prosecutor Sahdmadhi was part of the royal family, wasn't he! Datz: Yep. But he was expelled after that whole thing with Dhurke happened. He must've gone through hell once he entered the legal world though. Apollo: Because of the whole \"the sins of the father are visited upon his children\" thing? Datz: Yep. In the eyes of the people, Dhurke is not only a traitor to his kingdom... ...he's also the terrorist who assassinated the previous queen. So, as his son, Yuty no doubt got the cold shoulder at every turn. Apollo: That must've been really hard on him. Datz: Yeah, the ties between father and son aren't something you could break, even if you tried. No matter where he went, he was probably labeled the son of a criminal. But despite it all, he made a name for himself through blood, sweat, and tears. I mean, just look at him now. He's a star prosecutor working cases around the globe. He's become a hero! The pride and joy of Khura'in! Apollo: (Now that's the Nahyuta I know -- super smart and never willing to give in. He must've studied and fought like his life depended on it to get to where he is today.) Amaras Assassination File updated in the Court Record. Anything else Datz: Ahhhhhh! Apollo: What? Do you know something about this? Datz: Nope. Just felt like shouting is all. Apollo: (He had me going there for a sec...) After clearing all Talk options, examining law book, and presenting Amara's Assassination File: Old Man: So then you believe me? You believe in my son's innocence?! Beh'leeb: Your poor son -- imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit... Let's petition the government for his release and a declaration of innocence! Old Man: Oh, thank you, thank you! I'm forever in your debt! Apollo: Hm? Who's that? Datz: Hey there, Mrs. Inmee. Hard at work, I see. Beh'leeb: Yes, I have my own battle that I must wage. After all, there are many who suffer under the Defense Culpability Act. Rebel: Mrs. Inmee! Please don't forget about our case, too! Beh'leeb: I won't! I will look into it as soon as I am able. Phoenix: Um, Datz? What's Mrs. Inmee doing here? Datz: She's lending an ear to all those suffering under the regime's wrongful accusations. A lady whose husband's been imprisoned, parents whose son's been falsely charged... She's helping all those types of people. Phoenix: So she's trying to help the revolution along... ...in her own special way. Datz: Yep. And thanks to her, more and more folks are coming over to our side! All the people who've been unhappy with the regime have been waiting for just this chance! And they're starting to speak out in support of us! Apollo: (The people are responding... and a grassroots movement is growing... Dhurke's dream of revolution may finally come true.) Athena: What should we do about the Founder's Orb? We'll probably run into the royal guards again the moment we leave this place. Phoenix: Well, we can't stay here forever, so we'll have to think of something. Apollo: ...I've got it. Why don't you hold on to it, Datz? It should be safe here, right? Datz: You can count on me! I'll get it back to you in time for tomorrow's trial at the Hall of Justice. Founder's Orb left with Datz. Athena: What now, Apollo? Apollo: Well, we've got a handle on what happened twenty-three years ago. Maybe we should pay Dhurke a visit. There's something I want to show him. Phoenix: I'll join you. I want to talk to him before tomorrow's trial. Edgeworth: Maybe I should wait here, then. We'll attract undue attention if we go in too large of a group. Bazaar Examine Yak Apollo: It's a yak. They used to serve as a beast of burden here. Athena: They're actually kind of cute up-close. Hello there, big fella! Or are you a girl...? Apollo: Umm, if you stick your face that close to it, it's liable to-- *sluuuuurp* Athena: Eeewwww, gross! .................. Apollo: ...Need some tissues? Athena: I-I could use a handful of wet naps, if you've got 'em... Bird Athena: What's this bird doing here? Apollo: I wouldn't get too close to it if I were you. ???: RAWWWWWWRRRRRR! Athena: Eeeeeeeeek! Apollo: ...Athena, meet the warbaa'd. Its cry resembles a lion's roar to scare off predators. Athena: Wow... that's one gutsy little bird. But I bet it's not really all that tough. Apollo: How about we just leave the bird alone? Cart Apollo: (So many street stalls... And they all have stuff you can't find back home.) Athena: We should spend some time shopping here when this case is over. I'd like to buy Trucy a souvenir or something. Poster Apollo: There's a poster here... \"The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm\"...? Phoenix: It's a special-effects-driven action-here show that's become a huge hit here in Khura'in. Apollo: (Maybe it's a cultural thing, but she totally looks like a villain to me.) Steaming buns Phoenix: Khura'in's national delicacy, magatah'man -- or \"soul buns,\" if that makes it easier. Apparently, they're so delicious, they'll send your soul straight to the Twilight Realm. Apollo: \"Delicious\"? More like \"deadly.\" Phoenix: Actually, in one of the commercials, an old man literally drops dead after taking a bite. And at the very end, there's a warning that goes, \"Enjoy at your own risk.\" Apollo: Like I said: deadly. Manhole cover Apollo: (This is the manhole that leads to Dhurke's office-turned-safe house. It's the only way in or out. And for obvious reasons, there's no doorbell or welcome mat.) Souvenir stands Apollo: (The souvenir stands sure are popular with the tourists. I should check them out later.) Tehm'pul Temple Apollo: Tehm'pul Temple is just up ahead. When I was a kid, I used to race Nahyuta and my friends to the top. Present Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Athena: The victim was the Minister of Justice, the second most powerful person here in Khura'in. In Wright Anything Agency terms... ...I guess that would be you, Apollo. Apollo: Ha ha ha. Thanks, but... ...everyone knows it's Trucy. Athena: ...Yeah, you're probably right. On second thought, she might actually be number one. I mean, even Mr. Wright is no match for her. Apollo: .........Remind me not to forget to buy her a souvenir. Dhurke's Law Book Athena: I can't believe Dhurke's been fighting the good fight for over twenty years. Fighting for the truth and the repeal of the Defense Culpability Act... Apollo: Yeah. And being branded a traitor for it. That's got to be extremely hard on him. Athena: Whatever happens, we can't let them find him guilty! We have to help him achieve his life's dream! Anything else Athena: .........What? Are you just going to show that to me without a word? Apollo: (I guess she doesn't have anything to say about it.) Athena: W-Well?! Are you going to at least say SOMETHING?! Inga's Private Quarters Examine Phoenix: Edgeworth and I already searched this room. Apollo: Oh, okay. (I wonder if anything interesting turned up?) Hair dye bottle Athena: \"Je suis L'Belle! SAMPLE\"... Now THERE'S a brand I know well... Apollo: .........Yeah... Me, too. Athena: Let's see what it says on the back. \"The hair care sensation celebrities have been RAVING about! Guaranteed to make you WANT to proclaim, 'Je suis L'Belle!' to the world! This product is NOT FOR SALE. EVER. Even if you come to really like it, PEASANT.\" Apollo: I REALLY still don't get his sales strategy... Any other point of interest Phoenix: We already investigated that, Apollo. May 18Detention Center - Visitor's Room Dhurke: Hey there, son. Came to see your old man again? Apollo: Hi, Dhurke. Guess they're done questioning you? Dhurke: Yeah... You'd think Nahyuta might've cut his old man a little slack, but no. He really laid into me. Seems they're really keen on recovering the Founder's Orb. When I wouldn't tell them where it was, he confiscated what few possessions I had left. Apollo: (...Wait, Dhurke's not wearing his attorney's badge. They even took THAT from him? *sigh*) Talk Nahyuta Dhurke: He confiscated all my prized jailbreaking tools. Apollo: What did you expect? I mean, no prosecutor in their right mind would let a prisoner keep stuff like that. Athena: Did he take your attorney's badge, too? Dhurke: No. I thought it strange, but... ...just when it looked like he was going to take it from me, he changed his mind. Apollo: I wonder why. Dhurke: Indeed. I find it hard to understand anything he does these days. Your attorney's badge (appears after \"Nahyuta\") Apollo: Your Khura'inese attorney's badge... You've worn it all these years -- even though all the lawyers are gone. Dhurke: Yes, because the Dragon's Eye is the embodiment of my creed. Apollo: (To show the world that \"a dragon never yields,\" huh.) Apollo: Hey, Dhurke? Why do you still wear your badge? You're not a lawyer anymore, right? Dhurke: This badge is my heart and soul, son. I'll never stop trying to realize my dream -- not until my very last breath. Nahyuta: \"A dragon never yields,\" right?! Dhurke: Exactly. ...Nahyuta, Apollo, I vow to restore Khura'in's legal system to its rightful state one day. I want to pass on to you a world where you can live free from the fear of tyranny. Apollo: (He was always saying stuff like that to the two of us. Nahyuta... Is the reason why you didn't take Dhurke's badge... ...because you still remember those talks, too? I really hope that's what it is.) Dhurke: ...Son, would you keep my badge for me? Apollo: Are you sure?! I can't take something so important to you. Dhurke: That's exactly why I want you to hold on to it, Apollo. I'm placing my fate in your hands. Apollo: .........All right. I'll make sure it stays safe. Dhurke's Badge added to the Court Record. Your attorney's badge (subsequent times) Apollo: Your Khura'inese attorney's badge... You've worn it all these years -- even though all the lawyers are gone. Dhurke: Yes, because the Dragon's Eye is the embodiment of my creed. Apollo: (To show the world that \"a dragon never yields,\" huh.) Apollo: Hey, Dhurke? Why do you still wear your badge? You're not a lawyer anymore, right? Dhurke: This badge is my heart and soul, son. I'll never stop trying to realize my dream -- not until my very last breath. Nahyuta: \"A dragon never yields,\" right?! Dhurke: Exactly. ...Nahyuta, Apollo, I vow to restore Khura'in's legal system to its rightful state one day. I want to pass on to you a world where you can live free from the fear of tyranny. Apollo: (He was always saying stuff like that to the two of us. Nahyuta... Is the reason why you didn't take Dhurke's badge... ...because you still remember those talks, too? I really hope that's what it is.) Present Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Dhurke: Inga Karkhuul Khura'in... He was an entirely insufferable, unlikable fellow, but I never thought he'd wind up dead. Apollo: Why didn't you like him? Dhurke: He was the most hawkish one in the Ga'ran regime. He established the secret police to arrest us rebels without due process. Those they managed to capture were immediately executed. My compatriots in the Defiant Dragons came to call him \"The Executioner.\" Apollo: \"The Executioner\"? Pretty ironic, considering how he ended up. Dhurke: He's probably in Hell now, being tormented by those he wrongfully put to death. Pink Butterfly Pendant Apollo: I found this in the tomb. Look familiar? Dhurke: ...Ah! Th-That's... Apollo: Dhurke? Dhurke: Where did you find it? Apollo: Down between the monk statues in the tomb. Is it yours, Dhurke? Dhurke: .........Oh, um, it's... it's something I bought. Apollo: ? (Why's he suddenly acting all awkward?) Dhurke: Hmm... I wonder when I lost it. Let's have it. It's very important to me. Apollo: O-Of course... (I'll just make a note about it for future reference.) Pink Butterfly Pendant returned to Dhurke, but a record of it remains in the Court Record. Dhurke's Law Book Dhurke: Careful with that. Don't go showing it around town. You'll be branded a rebel. Apollo: But I'm not a rebel. Dhurke: Don't be ridiculous. You're a member of the Defiant Dragons simply by being my son. Or did you think that dragon tattoo on your rear end was just for show? Athena: Whaaat?! You have a tattoo on your butt, Apollo?! Let me see! Apollo: Relax, Athena. He's just jerking our chains again. Amara's Assassination File Dhurke: I prepared that myself. Use it well. Apollo: I'm surprised you were able to gather this much information. Dhurke: It wasn't easy. After all, all of the evidence from the assassination was lost in the fire. And the newly-installed Ga'ran regime was in full control of the media. Every lead I tried to follow led to a dead end. Apollo: So then how am I supposed to solve this case? Dhurke: ...You'll figure something out once tomorrow's trial is underway. After all, no one's looked into this assassination since my last trial. Apolo: (I hope I can turn things around enough to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat.) Dhurke's Badge Dhurke: Ah, my attorney's badge. You don't see those around here anymore. Apollo: It's not exactly something you can wear publicly, is it? Dhurke: Yeah... And if you did, people would jeer and throw things at you. I've had tomatoes, cabbages -- even eggs thrown at me. Apollo: That sounds awful. But at least they didn't throw rocks. Dhurke: ...True. Plus, if you were good at catching things, you'd have the start of a good meal. Apollo: What?! Dhurke: It's true. An hour's walk can yield all you need for a nice, big hot pot! Hah-ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (Dhurke... I'm sorry I never knew how bad things were when you were raising us.) Anything else Dhurke: Is that for me, son? Apollo: No, I was just wondering if you knew anything about it. Dhurke: What? You came to visit me and you didn't even bring a present? Apollo: (I'll take that as a \"no.\") After clearing \"Your attorney's badge\" Talk option and presenting Pink Butterfly Pendant: Phoenix: Apollo, remember how Inga said he had \"someone dear to Dhurke\"? Why don't you ask about that? Apollo: Oh, right. I'll give it a try. Talk Someone dear to Dhurke Apollo: What did the minister mean when he said... ...he had someone dear to you in the palm of his hand? Who was he talking about? Dhurke: Hm? Apollo: Nahyuta seemed to know, but he wouldn't tell me anything. Dhurke: W-Well, I've no idea, so... Phoenix: Well, you obediently followed his every word after he said that... ...so it seems to me the minister was in close proximity to someone you really care about. Dhurke: Oh, um... Apollo: Someone you really care about that isn't Nahyuta...? Wait, don't tell me--! Is there a new lady in your life, Dhurke?! Dhurke: Wh-What?! No! Don't be ridiculous, son! Apollo: .................. Dhurke: .................. The love of my life was Amara. But she's gone now and there will never be another. BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: (Ah! My bracelet! Wait, does this mean...? Dhurke... Have you REALLY not met somebody new?) Present Bracelet Dhurke: The love of my life was Amara. But she's gone now and there will never be another. Perceive twitching left forearm on \"But she's gone now\" Apollo: Apollo: ...Dhurke. You can't fool me. You tensed up when you said, \"But she's gone now.\" And you unconsciously moved your arm... ...causing something to press up against your jacket. Dhurke: Ahhhhh! ...H-How did you do that?! Apollo: ...Oh, so that's it! You're hiding a woman's photo up your sleeve. You don't have to keep secrets like that from me, Dhurke. You're an eligible bachelor now. But you'll... introduce her to me at some point, right? Dhurke: I keep telling you, there's no other woman! Apollo: Fine, then let's see it. What are you hiding up your sleeve? Dhurke: ...It's just this. Satisfied? Apollo: Huh? But that's the pendant we found in Amara's Tomb... Dhurke: See? I wasn't trying to hide anything. Apollo: (...Then why did he tense up?) Dhurke, let me take a look at that. Dhurke: Ah! Apollo: .........Hey, what's this button for? *click* Apollo: Whoa! I-It's...! Athena: It's a picture of Dhurke and some lady! And she's really young-looking, too! Mon Dieu! Are you into younger women, Dhurke?! Apollo: Heh heh. Dhurke, you old dog, you. You got yourself a younger lover. Dhurke: Will you stop with this nonsense! This is Amara before she died. If you look closer, you'll see that I was younger, too. Apollo: Hey, you're right. Athena: Aww. That's no fun. Apollo: ...Wait a second. Haven't we seen this woman before? Athena: .........Now that you mention it...! Apollo: Isn't this woman the same as the one in the pendant's photo? Present Woman's Photo Apollo: Leads to: \"The woman in the pendant is also the one in this photo.\" Present anything else Apollo: Athena: Apollo... I don't see how that has anything to do with the woman in the pendant's photo. Dhurke: Have you had your eyes checked lately, son? Apollo: (I'm wrong, not blind! Maybe I should compare the pendant's photo against the evidence again.) Dhurke, I know I've seen the woman in the pendant's photo before. Leads back to: Isn't this woman the same as the one in the pendant's photo? Apollo: The woman in the pendant is also the one in this photo. Dhurke: ! A-Apollo, where did you get this? Apollo: From the safe in Inga's room. Phoenix: ...Apollo. If this is Queen Amara, it had to have been taken at least twenty-three years ago. But that's just not possible. Dhurke: ! Apollo: Yeah, I just noticed the same thing. Here's why this photo couldn't be twenty-three years old! Present law book Apollo: Leads to: \"Take a look at the law book. It has the mark of the Defiant Dragons branded on it.\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Dhurke: I don't see how that proves anything. Apollo: Look closer. Doesn't that part look, you know, kinda modern? Athena: Hmm... I don't know about that. Maybe you just don't know what's considered new and hip these days, Apollo. Apollo: Nngh... Dhurke: This photo is at least twenty-three years old. I don't know how you could say otherwise. Apollo: That's where you're wrong, Dhurke. (There's something in this photo that couldn't have existed back then.) Leads back to: \"Here's why this photo couldn't be twenty-three years old!\" Apollo: Take a look at the law book. It has the mark of the Defiant Dragons branded on it. But that mark didn't exist until after you started your revolutionary activities, Dhurke. So, this photo must've been taken AFTER Ga'ran came into power. ...And that didn't happen until AFTER Amara was assassinated. Dhurke: Gnrk! Apollo: ...So then, how could Amara even be in this photo? ...............Wait a second. That would mean that Amara is... ...still alive? Dhurke: Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh! ............Looks like you found me out, son. Apollo: Wait... So it's actually true?! Leads back to Talk options Perceive wrong area Apollo: Apollo: You seem uneasy, Dhurke. Wait... Don't tell me you're ashamed because she's much younger than you?! Dhurke: D-Don't be ridiculous! I'm just getting tense because of your intrusive questions! Anyone would react the same way! Apollo: (Hmm, I guess that's not it... Still, my bracelet reacted... ...so I know he must be hiding something!) Leads back to Talk options Someone dear to Dhurke (after perceiving) Apollo: Dhurke! What do you mean, Amara's still alive?! I thought she'd been assassinated. Dhurke: .........So did I. But it seems she made it out alive, only to be held captive by the Ga'ran regime. Apollo: Why would they do that? Dhurke: When I fled from the law and went underground twenty-three years ago... ...I heard some shocking news from a Defiant Dragons spy. There were rumors of Queen Amara being sighted in the palace. Apollo: And those rumors turned out to be true? Dhurke: Yes. I snuck into the palace to see for myself. She was confined within the grounds, but otherwise, she was as fit as a fiddle. Phoenix: S-So then, the sarcophagus in the tomb... It's empty? Dhurke: Yes. That entire tomb is one big charade. Ga'ran had it built to stage Amara's death. Athena: So we're not going to be cursed by her vengeful spirit? That's a relief. Dhurke: She was being held under virtual house arrest. So I freed her, and we made a run for it. This photo was taken back then. Apollo: (Look at how they're both grinning from ear to ear.) .........Hm? (There's a fingerprint on the metal part. I guess Dhurke must've left it by accident.) Athena: Ooh, Mr. Sahdmadhi! I wanna hear ALL about how you ran away with Queen Amara! Pink Butterfly Pendant updated in the Court Record. On the run with Amara (appears after \"Someone dear to Dhurke\") Apollo: I'm surprised Amara agreed to run away with you. I mean, Ga'ran must've told her that you tried to kill her. Dhurke: I tried to convince her that I wasn't the one who set the blaze. Apollo: And she believed you? Dhurke: She said, and I quote, \"I shall accompany you so I may ascertain the truth myself.\" Heh, she always was a tough one to read. Athena: I bet she was thrilled you came to her rescue, Mr. Sahdmadhi. To be set free by your beloved... It's like something out of a fairy tale. Dhurke: Yeah, well... There was no \"happily ever after\" once Ga'ran's people caught up with us. They took Amara away to who-knows-where. I snuck back into the palace and searched high and low for her, but to no avail. They probably moved her to some remote mountain prison or the like. Apollo: Dhurke, does Nahyuta know about this? Dhurke: He knows she's his true mother. I told him as much. Apollo: Wait... Is that why Nahyuta is following Ga'ran's orders? Dhurke: .........Most likely. Athena: So then, do you think that deep down, he doesn't really want to prosecute you? Dhurke: Well, he's not one to show his feelings. And lately, I've had no idea what he's thinking. Phoenix: Apollo. We need to grill the queen about Amara when we have the chance. Athena: ...Um. I was wondering about something. The little baby the lady's holding... Is that Prosecutor Sahdmadhi? Apollo: Not necessarily. It could just as well be me. After all, we're only one year apart. Athena: I don't know. I mean, the kid in the picture is too cute to be you. Apollo: (...Let's settle this by asking Dhurke himself.) Something important (appears after \"On the run with Amara\", then presenting Woman's Photo) Apollo: So what's this \"something important\" you have to tell me? Dhurke: ........................ Listen son. Even if you manage to prove me innocent tomorrow... ............... ...I... I don't have long to live. Apollo: Huh? ............... Wh-What are you talking about? Dhurke: What I mean is, I can already hear the Twilight Realm calling my name. There is no escaping death now that it has its sights set on me. Apollo: What?! ............I-Is this another one of your jokes? Dhurke: I wish it was. Apollo: Ha... Ha ha ha. You can't fool me, Dhurke. (Hm? That's strange. Why isn't my bracelet reacting?) Dhurke: ............ Phoenix: ...Are you sick? Dhurke: I-It's something like that. Apollo: So you're not joking? Dhurke: .........I'm afraid not, son. Sorry. Apollo: I-Isn't there a cure? Or at least some sort of treatment? Dhurke: Unfortunately not. Not for what I've got. Apollo: If you need some kind of surgery, I'll work hard until I can pay for it! So... Please...! Dhurke: .........It's too late. There's nothing more to be done now. Apollo: B-But you always say, \"A dragon never yields.\" So why are you giving up now? Dhurke: ...Apollo, I'm sorry. I really am. Apollo: ............I don't understand. Why is this happening, Dhurke? Why? Dhurke: ..................Listen, Apollo. I've got a favor to ask of you. Would you keep quiet about this? I don't want my fellow Dragons to find out. They'd lose all hope if they knew I was dying. Would you do that for me? Apollo: ............Of course. (Why is this happening now? Just when I was finally starting to feel like you really are my... I thought that this time, we'd finally... But now...) ...Damn it... Why...? Athena: Apollo... Dhurke: Listen, son. I don't have much longer to live... ...but I'll never let them execute me. Not before I finish what I need to do. Apollo: ...I know, Dhurke. There's no way I'm going to let them prove you guilty. (Before he goes, I'm going to turn back time by righting the wrongs that have been done. I'm going to restore Dhurke's freedom... ...and return a real smile to Nahyuta's face! I'm going to win this case. I just have to!) Dhurke: ...Son. I have one more... big secret. Apollo: What? There's something else you've been hiding from me? Dhurke: I'm afraid I can't tell you what it is. I'd be betraying a certain someone if I did. Apollo: Huh? What's that supposed to mean? Dhurke: .........Forgive me. You'll just have to find out for yourself. That's the only way. Apollo: I don't understand, Dhurke. Dhurke: ..................... Apollo. In court tomorrow... ...you may find yourself faced with a truth that is difficult to accept. But I know you. And I know you can handle the truth, no matter what it turns out to be. I know that because I believe in you. You're my son, after all! Apollo: ...Dhurke. (What is he talking about? Wait... He's not going to reveal that he actually IS the killer, is he?) Phoenix: Looks like we've run out of things to discuss. Apollo? ...Are you okay? Apollo: ...I'm fine. ???: FREE HIM NOW...!!! RELEASE DHURKE...!!! Apollo: What's going on out there? Dhurke: Sounds like the party's getting started without me. Apollo: Huh? Athena: It's coming from the temple. Let's go, Apollo, and take a look! Something important (subsequent times) Apollo: So what's this \"something important\" you have to tell me? Dhurke: ........................ Listen son. Even if you manage to prove me innocent tomorrow... ............... ...I... I don't have long to live. Apollo: Huh? ............... Wh-What are you talking about? Dhurke: What I mean is, I can already hear the Twilight Realm calling my name. There is no escaping death now that it has its sights set on me. Apollo: What?! ............I-Is this another one of your jokes? Dhurke: I wish it was. Apollo: Ha... Ha ha ha. You can't fool me, Dhurke. (Hm? That's strange. Why isn't my bracelet reacting?) Dhurke: ............ Phoenix: ...Are you sick? Dhurke: I-It's something like that. Apollo: So you're not joking? Dhurke: .........I'm afraid not, son. Sorry. Apollo: I-Isn't there a cure? Or at least some sort of treatment? Dhurke: Unfortunately not. Not for what I've got. Apollo: If you need some kind of surgery, I'll work hard until I can pay for it! So... Please...! Dhurke: .........It's too late. There's nothing more to be done now. Apollo: B-But you always say, \"A dragon never yields.\" So why are you giving up now? Dhurke: ...Apollo, I'm sorry. I really am. Apollo: ............I don't understand. Why is this happening, Dhurke? Why? Dhurke: ..................Listen, Apollo. I've got a favor to ask of you. Would you keep quiet about this? I don't want my fellow Dragons to find out. They'd lose all hope if they knew I was dying. Would you do that for me? Apollo: ............Of course. (Why is this happening now? Just when I was finally starting to feel like you really are my... I thought that this time, we'd finally... But now...) ...Damn it... Why...? Athena: Apollo... Present Pink Butterfly Pendant or Woman's Photo (after clearing \"Someone dear to Dhurke\" Talk option) Dhurke: Amara... I hope she's doing well. Apollo: I've been wondering, Dhurke... How could a commoner win the heart of a queen anyway? Dhurke: ...Hm? Wait, don't tell me... Have you fallen for Princess Rayfa, son? Apollo: Wait, what?! Athena: ...Apollo. I had no idea you liked your women so young. Apollo: No! I don't! Phoenix: She's barely in her teens. That's just not right, Apollo. Apollo: Listen to me! I never said anything about her! Dhurke: Aww, it's all right son. In a few more years, the age difference won't matter so much. Apollo: Would you guys just stop already?! Woman's Photo (after clearing \"On the run with Amara\" Talk option) Apollo: Dhurke, about the cute little kid in this photo... Is that me? Dhurke: ...Huh? What are you talking about? Apollo: .................. Athena: See? I told you it was Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. Dhurke: Hm? .........Oh, I see. Well, either way, it's not you, son. Apollo: So then... ...if it's Nahyuta, it was taken when he was about a year old, right? And that would mean... ...you ran away with Amara around twenty-two or twenty-three years ago? (Changed from [...you ran away with Amara around 22 or 23 years ago?] in the original release) Dhurke: Hm? .........You're pretty good with numbers, son! Impressive. Apollo: Huh? (What kind of answer is that?) Woman's Photo updated in the Court Record. Dhurke: .........Before you go, son, there is something else I need to tell you. Something important. Apollo: What is it, Dhurke? I've never seen you act so serious before. After clearing \"Something important\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: May 18Tehm'pul Temple Apollo: Wh-Whoa! What IS all this?! Anime cutscene Datz: Ow-ow-oww! Let go, will ya?! Policeman: W-What are they-- Datz: Huh? Well, look at that! The people are coming to take their courts back! Policeman: Don't hold back, men! Arrest them all! Rebel: Dhurke belongs to the people! Give him back! Rebel: Yeaaaaah! Where are you holding him?! Policeman: Quiet down, you! Child: Th-They have my big sister, too! But she didn't do anything wrong! Policeman: Ouch! YOUCH! Stop pulling my hair! Old Man: Release my son! Release him now...!!! Policeman: Aaaagh! Stop that! No biting! Apollo: This... is really something. Phoenix: And it looks like Datz and Mrs. Inmee are leading the charge. ???: ...You unenlightened fools. Do you honestly think this will change anything? Datz: Yuty! ...Why do you keep serving that witch Ga'ran?! Apollo: Ah! (It's...) Hey, Nahyuta! Nahyuta: ! You again? Apollo: What's going on here? Nahyuta: It would appear that the insurgents are fanning the flames of the rebellion. ...But I never thought it would grow so large. However, they will all be under arrest shortly. Reinforcements are almost here. Apollo: They'll be arrested? Just for protesting? Nahyuta: They are aiding and abetting a criminal by seeking his release. Her Eminence, Queen Ga'ran, has ordered they be arrested and judged en masse. Apollo: B-But weren't you once a member of the Defiant Dragons, too? How can you go along with this? Nahyuta: ...I am simply following the orders that Her Eminence has handed down. Apollo: No, it can't be as simple as that. Listen, Nahyuta. There's something I want to talk to you about. Hey! You're not getting away this time! We need to talk. Nahyuta: .........*sigh* I see there is no reasoning with you. Very well, then. Speak. Examine Protesters Athena: Look at all these people! They've got the whole temple surrounded. Phoenix: And it looks like Datz is fanning the flames. The police are going to really have their hands full with this many protesters. Apollo: This whole thing is like a powder keg waiting to go off. We should keep our distance for now. Talk Dhurke Apollo: Nahyuta, do you really have to serve as prosecutor on Dhurke's case? I mean, prosecuting your own flesh and blood... It's just not right. Nahyuta: Again with this drivel? Your ethical standards are not the be-all, end-all of the world around you. Apollo: (I'm not getting into another debate with him.) .........Nahyuta, did you know that Dhurke is sick? Nahyuta: What? Apollo: He apparently doesn't have that much longer to live. If found guilty, he probably wouldn't even make it until his execution day. Nahyuta: What are you talking about? Apollo: Knowing this, are you still prepared to send an already dying man to his grave? Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: Well? Nahyuta: ...I... Apollo: Enough with the zen monk act, Nahyuta. Tell me how you really feel. Nahyuta: .........Mr. Justice. Each person is born with a role to fulfill. And I... must fulfill mine. Apollo; Well, I'm not convinced that taking Dhurke to trial is a part of your lot in life. Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: As for why you've been at Ga'ran's every beck and call... ...I think I might have the answer. Amara (appears after \"Dhurke\") Leads to: \"Nahyuta. You know the truth about your mother, don't you?\" Present Dhurke's Law Book Nahyuta: That's... Apollo: The rebels' \"Mark of the Dragon.\" It symbolizes a person's opposition to the Defense Culpability Act. Nahyuta: You seek to argue with me about the legal system? ...If so, you're wasting your breath. Lawyers and prosecutors do not lay down the law; they merely follow it. The laws decreed by our sovereign are absolute. There is no room for debate. Apollo: So \"let it go, and move on,\" right? Why is that your only answer to everything? Apollo: Nahyuta. You know the truth about your mother, don't you? About how the former queen is still alive and being held somewhere. Nahyuta: So Dhurke told you, did he... Yes, it's true. My mother was spirited away to some remote corner of this kingdom... ...to keep her safe from harm. Apollo: Safe from harm? But Dhurke said the Ga'ran regime is holding her captive. Nahyuta: No, they are keeping her safe. Apollo: So you don't know where Amara is being held? Nahyuta: I only know that it is some secluded hideaway where visitors are not allowed. I have heard she leads a simple life, akin to that of monastic disciples. Apollo: (Sure sounds like she's being held captive to me.) Listen, Nahyuta... Aren't you really doing the queen's bidding... ...because she's holding Amara captive? Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: And this whole thing with Dhurke... You know he didn't really kill Inga, don't you? Nahyuta: .................. Apollo: Dhurke doesn't have much longer to live, so I want to help him however I can. This time, it's our turn... Apollo: *sniffle* *hiccup* *hiccup* Nahyuta: You... You could've been killed... But you risked your life... to save us... Why...? Dhurke: What a silly question. What father wouldn't risk his life to save his own children? Nahyuta, Apollo... Don't you ever hesitate to call when you need me. Understand? Apollo: It's our turn to help Dhurke however we can. Nahyuta: .................. .................. .........What you speak of... is futile. Apollo: ! Nahyuta: .........Let it go, and move on. The guilty verdict... The hopelessness... You must resign yourself to it all. Clinging to false hope now will only serve to magnify your future despair. So let it go... and move on... Apollo: ...Nahyuta. (Are you really going to just roll over on this?) Nahyuta: ...I've no more time for idle chatter. I must prepare for tomorrow's trial. Now, if you'll excuse me... Apollo: ......... Athena: Apollo. I sensed a whirlpool of emotions coming from within Prosecutor Sahdmadhi just now. Anger, shock, bewilderment... ...and an icy sorrow, as deep and dark as an abyss. Apollo: Yeah, I picked up on that, too. Looks like Dhurke really won't be the only one who will need my help tomorrow. Phoenix: ...I think it's about time to pay Queen Ga'ran another visit... ...and ask her about her sister Amara. Talk Any ideas? Athena: I didn't know Dhurke was sick. What's wrong with him? I mean, he looked fine to me. Apollo: ...I really don't know. The Dhurke I remember would go out hunting in the middle of winter... ...while everyone around him was dropping like flies with the flu and whatnot. Athena: ............... Apollo: .................. Phoenix: ........................ Apollo: .........Come on everyone, cheer up! The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles, right? Phoenix: ...Apollo, you don't have to put on a brave face for-- Apollo: No! I'm fine! Besides, Dhurke will have his day in court. I won't let this get me down. What to do Athena: So you don't know Queen Amara at all, Apollo? I thought that since you used to live with Dhurke, that maybe you had met her. Apollo: Dhurke escaped with Amara twenty-three or so years ago, so I was still just an infant. Even if I had met her, I wouldn't have remembered it. Athena: I guess not. But that means you may have been cared for by a queen. And if you had been, then... Apollo: Th-Then what? Athena: You would've turned out... I don't know... better? Apollo: Wh-What's that supposed to mean? May 18Ga'ran Palace - Audience Chamber Phoenix: Hm? The royal guard isn't around. ???: That is utter... utter... hooey! You cannot continue to deceive the people like that! ???: ...Rayfa. Justice is much more than simply speaking the truth. Apollo: Is that Princess Rayfa and Queen Ga'ran over there? Rayfa: Y-You deceived me, too, Mother! How can I ever believe a word you say again?! You... You... nincompoop! .........Ah. Phoenix: Your Benevolence... ...I, uh, couldn't help but overhear... Rayfa: Nnnnnnnnnnnngh... You impudent--!! *ka-tonk!* Phoenix: Oww!!! Apollo: Are you okay, Mr. Wright? I can't believe she actually punched you... Phoenix: ...Yeah, I'm used to it by now. Athena: What's the matter with the princess? Apollo: It sounded like she was arguing with her mother. Phoenix: .........Maybe it has something to do with this picture. Rayfa said she had to ask her mother about some secret or another as soon as she saw it. Apollo: So then... ...does that mean that Princess Rayfa knows what really happened? That Amara wasn't assassinated, and is still very much alive? Phoenix: It would seem so. And she doesn't seem to be taking Ga'ran's lies very well. But that's no surprise, considering how much Rayfa reveres her mother. Athena: That would definitely cause her a great deal of anguish and sadness. ???: Eavesdropping, are we? How very rude. Ga'ran: Hm? You there. Are you not Dhurke's son? Apollo: Oh, um, nice to meet you, Your Eminence. We're actually here to speak with you, if you could spare a moment. Examine Throne Apollo: ............ Phoenix: Apollo? What are you doing? This is the queen's audience chamber. You can't snoop around in here. Apollo: Oh, right. Sorry! (I wonder what it'd be like to sit there with Athena and Mr. Wright groveling at my feet... No! Stop! I can't let myself think about that sort of thing!) Talk Amara's alive? Apollo: Your Eminence, Dhurke told me about Amara. About how she's still alive, that is. Ga'ran: ...We know not of what you speak. Apollo: After Dhurke learned Amara was still alive, he rescued her, and they ran off together. But she was captured and remains captive in a secret location to this day. As for Nahyuta doing your bidding, it's only because Amara's life's in your hands. Ga'ran: Ho ho ho. What an active imagination you have. Royal Guard: Ha ha ha ha ha ha! A lawyer AND a comedian! How droll! Apollo: (Wh-Whoa. Where'd THEY come from? Anyway! If she's going to play dumb, I'll just have to jog her memory with some evidence!) Amara's alive? (subsequent times) Apollo: Your Eminence, Dhurke told me about Amara. About how she's still alive, that is. Ga'ran: ...We know not of what you speak. Apollo: After Dhurke learned Amara was still alive, he rescued her, and they ran off together. But she was captured and remains captive in a secret location to this day. As for Nahyuta doing your bidding, it's only because Amara's life's in your hands. Ga'ran: Ho ho ho. What an active imagination you have. Royal Guard: Ha ha ha ha ha ha! A lawyer AND a comedian! How droll! Apollo: (Argh! If she's going to play dumb, I'll just have to jog her memory with some evidence!) Amara's alive! (appears after \"Amara's alive?\", then presenting Woman's Photo) Apollo: So then, you admit that Amara's still alive? Ga'ran: .........Yes. She is under our protection in a safe location. Apollo: (I think you mean \"being held prisoner.\") ...And where is she being kept? Ga'ran: Ho ho ho. Now why would we tell the son of a traitor that? Apollo: (Guess she has a point there.) Ga'ran: Now, heed our warning, Horned Devil. It would not be wise to inform the people that Amara yet lives. It would only serve to plunge public order into chaos. Apollo: I have no intention of doing that. (Besides, there are real terrorists out there who might try to kill her.) Ga'ran: ...Good. Now, there was something we have been meaning to ask you. Do you know what has become of the Founder's Orb? The Founder's Orb (appears after \"Amara's alive!\") Leads to: \"The Founder's Orb went missing after Dhurke took it into the tomb.\" Present Attorney's Badge Ga'ran: What have we here? Apollo: It's the attorney's badge used by lawyers like me back home. Ga'ran: Well, in this country, lawyers are a loathsome breed. And we would advise you not to needlessly advertise your place among their ranks. For even now, the bad karma Dhurke has engendered brings woe to your kind. It is a simple matter of cause and effect. Apollo: (Yeah, an effect you caused by enacting the Defense Culpability Act.) Inga's Autopsy Report or Tomb Crime Photo Ga'ran: His own ill will was visited upon him. So it is within the cycle of karma. Others might call it divine retribution -- the punishment of the gods. Apollo: You don't seem particularly sad, even though it was your own husband. Ga'ran: We were betrayed by the man we had called husband. Moreover, we are the Grand Priestess, summoner of spirits from the Twilight Realm. For us, death is not the end, for we can still speak with those who have passed. Apollo: (I guess being a spirit-channeling queen gives you a different take on life and death.) Woman's Photo (after clearing \"Amara's alive?\" Talk option) Apollo: Your Eminence, I ask that you take a look at this photo. Ga'ran: Why, that's--! Apollo: It's a photo of Amara. And here you can see a law book bearing the mark of the Defiant Dragons. I believe you know what that means. Ga'ran: .................. ..........Very well. Royal guard, stand down. Royal Guard: Yes, Your Eminence! Your wish is our command! Ga'ran: It seems there is no need to perpetuate this charade any longer. We shall speak... of all we know. Dhurke's Law Book Ga'ran: To burn such a mark upon a sacred text of the law... He will surely be visited by what he has wrought. And to think he once called himself a man of the law. Apollo: I think it's just his way of objecting to the DC Act. Ga'ran: Yet that act is but an objection to his falsified evidence. How appalling that even now he recognizes no responsibility and knows no shame. Anything else Apollo: So, I was wondering if... Ga'ran: We have no intention of bestowing any information upon you or any other lawyer. Apollo: (Guess someone doesn't like to play nice with others.) Ga'ran: The Founder's Orb went missing after Dhurke took it into the tomb. As his son, we thought you might know something of its current whereabouts. Apollo: I knew it. I suppose I should thank you for that free running tour of Khura'in. Ga'ran: ...That was the royal guards' own doing. Apollo: (Nice try, lady. But now you're definitely not getting the orb, ever.) Why do you want the orb so badly, anyway? Ga'ran: Because... it would be most dangerous in the wrong hands. It must be recovered. Phoenix: Is the legend true? Can the orb really impart spiritual power? Are you worried that someone could overthrow you with it? Ga'ran: The Holy Mother's power is without equal. Should Her Holiness once again return to our world... ...she could conceivably bestow great power upon the one who unlocked the orb's secret. Phoenix: I guess it makes sense, considering spirit channeling is a fact of life here. Ga'ran: ...So we ask you, Horned Devil. Did you receive the Founder's Orb from Dhurke? Apollo: ...Does it look like I did? Ga'ran: ...So you like to play games, do you? ...Royal guard! Royal Guard: Yes, Your Eminence! Ga'ran: Search this devil, and his belongings! Apollo: What? Royal Guard: At once, Your Eminence! Don't move!!! You're only making this haaaaaarder on yourseeelf!!! Apollo: Yikes! Hey, cut it out! Argh! What the--?! Athena: Eeeeeek! Apollo! Don't strip here! Royal Guard: Stop resisting!!! Just submit to our strip search alreeeeeady!!! Apollo: N-No, wait! Hey! Cut it out! Aaaaaaaaaaaaagh! .................. (Rest in pieces, my poor, tattered dignity.) Royal Guard: There's no sign of the Founder's Orb, Your Eminence! Ga'ran: .........So, you have hidden it somewhere. Heh. No matter. We shall recover it one way or another once you are found guilty of abetting the accused. Apollo: (Dhurke was right. She really is bent on getting the orb.) ???: Mother! Apollo: Looks like the princess is back. Rayfa: I took a stroll to try to calm myself, but... I still find this situation unacceptable. The people must be informed about Queen Amara! Apollo: ! (So she DOES know about that!) Ga'ran: Rayfa, you do not yet possess a clear grasp of how a government and its people interact. There will always be secrets that must be kept from the ignorant masses. Rayfa: You have little faith in our people, Mother. But it is the Royal Priestess's duty to always speak the truth. And as such I cannot remain silent! I will not! Ga'ran: Hah. The truth, you say? Your mind has been poisoned by the Barbed One. Phoenix: It was an honor and a pleasure, Your Eminence. Ga'ran: ...We must speak with our child. It is a mother's duty to discipline her child, after all. Now, if you would excuse us. Apollo: (Discipline? Coming from her, I don't like the sound of that at all...) Phoenix: Well, Apollo, let's head back to the safe house for now. Apollo: Good idea. We need to go over what we've found and collect our thoughts. May 18Former Sahdmadhi Law Offices Edgeworth: ...Ah, you're back. Athena: Thank you for holding down the fort, Chief Prosecutor Edgeworth. Sorry it took so long. Hope you weren't too bored. Edgeworth: ...I watched \"The Plumed Punisher: Warrior of Neo Twilight Realm\" while you were gone. And my verdict is... it's an outrage! Especially its theme song. Even worse, the people here believe it's an original, Khura'inese show. Can you believe it! I've already spoke about it at length with Mr. Are'bal here, and he... Apollo: (I'm not sure what he's babbling about, but at least it seems he wasn't bored.) Phoenix: Moving along to things that actually matter... We've gathered about all the information and evidence we can concerning this case. I think it's time we go over everything we've learned so far. Examine Any point of interest Phoenix: ...Apollo. We probably shouldn't search the place while Datz is gone. Besides, we need to go over the case for tomorrow. Athena: What's with you recently? It's like you want to spend every free minute we have snooping. Apollo: (But don't you get the urge to look at everything you can sometimes, too?) Talk About Inga's murder Phoenix: The orb trial... Maya's abduction... And the murder of the mastermind behind it all, Justice Minister Inga... It's a lot to consider. Think you have all the facts straight in your head? Apollo: Yep, I've got it covered, Mr. Wright. It's the truth about what really went down that's going to be the problem. Athena: Yeah, it's like the more we learn about this case, the less we understand. Phoenix: I agree. There's a deep darkness enveloping this case. I'm almost afraid of what we will find once we lift that black veil. Suffice to say, the real killer is certainly waiting underneath. Apollo: (The real killer, huh... Now that's the million dollar question.) Phoenix: Who killed Inga, and why? Think, Apollo. Who would you say had a motive to commit this crime? Apollo: Umm... Athena: I, for one, am drawing a complete blank. Phoenix: I want to know how the killer slipped into the tomb, killed Inga, and slipped back out... ...without ever being seen. That's a bona fide locked-room mystery right there. Apollo: Well, we've collected plenty of evidence and statements. I just hope the rest comes out in court. It'll be a thinner tightrope than usual, that's for sure. Amara's assassination Phoenix: This case has one big fly in the ointment. In order to prove Dhurke completely innocent... ...we'll also have to exonerate him of the crime committed twenty-three years ago. Apollo: Amara's supposed assassination... Athena: Right. We know Amara's still alive... ...but Dhurke could still be charged with plotting to kill her. Apollo: He couldn't discover the truth -- even after over two decades of investigating. So our biggest hurdle is going to be the complete lack of evidence. The fire made sure of that. Athena: Mr. Wright, have you ever won a case without any evidence? Phoenix: No, that's one thing I've never done before. Apollo: A trial unprecedented even in the decorated annals of the Wright Anything Agency... (Still, I can't help but wonder... Was there really no evidence left behind?) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: You flash that badge like a pro now. And with such confidence, too. I can really feel it. Apollo: R-Really? Phoenix: ...Sure. Take Trucy's case, or that civil trial yesterday. You really came into your own during both of them. Apollo: Eheh... Heh heh heh. (I can feel my cheeks betraying me...) Athena: You'd better not be thinking of starting your own firm, Apollo. Apollo: What? No, of course not. (I'm probably not ready for that, anyway.) Pink Butterfly Pendant, Woman's Photo, or Amara's Assassination File Phoenix: Amara... She's still alive. Apollo: But she's basically being held prisoner somewhere. Phoenix: This puts Dhurke at a distinct disadvantage. ...Not to mention us, too. Apollo: And Nahyuta is under Ga'ran's thumb because of all this as well. Phoenix: Yep. It's a problem all right, and it's not like we can just go and rescue Amara. There must be something we can do... Athena: We'll just have to pin our hopes on Dhurke's revolution! Apollo: So, basically, the fates of Amara and Nahyuta... ...depend entirely on our ability to beat the charges against Dhruke tomorrow. Dhurke's Law Book or Dhurke's Badge Phoenix: What would you do if the Defense Culpability Act was established back home? Apollo: What would I do? That's a good question. Athena: What are you worried about, Apollo? You'd always have a job as Trucy's assistant. Apollo: Uh-huh... And what about you, Athena? Couldn't you become a therapist? Athena: Hmm... I don't know if I could do it for a living... Phoenix: I'd probably go back to playing piano. Apollo: ..................... Athena: ............... Phoenix: Hey! What are those looks for?! Anything else Phoenix: Just because you don't know something, doesn't mean that I do, Apollo. That's an important lesson for you to learn. Apollo: (In other words, this didn't ring any bells.) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ...Oh, and we can't forget about the Defense Culpability Act. \"...those who would support criminals will be deemed just as guilty.\" In short, if Dhurke is found guilty, and is sentenced to death... ...we'll likely join him in a very public execution. Apollo: Y-Yeah... Athena: Beat the charges or die... What kind of crazy, upside-down legal system is this, anyway?! Phoenix: ...Don't worry. I can't ask someone as young as you to risk your life, Athena. So tomorrow, it'll just be me and Apollo on the courtroom floor. But you can support us by watching from the gallery. Athena: What?! No... I wanna help! I'm part of the agency, too, after all! Phoenix: ...Sorry, but this is a direct order from your boss. Plus, there's Prosecutor Blackquill to think of. He said he'd use me for sword practice if I put you in harm's way. Athena: Nrrgh... Simon... Well, at least promise me this, you two. Promise me you'll make it back alive! Apollo: Ha... Ha ha... Make it back alive... huh... Phoenix: What's with that face, Apollo? You'll never inspire confidence in your client like that. And it'll play right into the prosecution's hands. Remember, \"the worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles.\" Apollo: You're right! Even when it seems hopeless, or when there's not a shred of evidence to be found... ... we can never let it show on our faces... right? (But will I actually be able to do that tomorrow? When push comes to shove, will I be able to force my biggest smile?) To be continued Nothing to examine during investigation (while playing as Apollo Justice) Apollo: Nothing particularly interesting here. Area already examined (while playing as Apollo Justice) Apollo: We've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around.

You have painted me as a killer with nothing but your silver tongue.Press Apollo: Apollo: Convincing others is all part of a lawyer's trade, so I'll take that as a compliment. Amara: You would, wouldn't you? I suppose you have deceived countless souls with your lies. ...But I should not be surprised, considering you learned from... him. Apollo: Him? You mean Dhurke, right? Amara: Yes, the man who deceived and seduced me, a grand priestess, with his silver tongue. Apollo: Umm... We ARE still talking about the case, right? Amara: Surely you have heard of a lady falling for the wrong man before? .........Ah... But to think that I, of all people, would fall under that devil's spell... Apollo: (Wow. How did they ever get together in the first place, let alone procreate...?) Amara: I would advise all here today to beware this lawyer's silver tongue... ...lest you, too, be unjustly painted as a criminal as I have been.Amara: However, you have no evidence proving your distasteful theory.Press Apollo: Apollo: I admit I don't have any solid evidence... yet. But you're the only one who could've committed the crime. Amara: What on earth do you mean? Apollo: Including Ms. Fey, there are only three spirit mediums in Khura'in. Furthermore, when the crime scene was first discovered... ...Queen Ga'ran... ...was with me and Mr. Wright, while Ms. Fey... ...was tied up in the tomb. That means that the Dhurke we saw after the minister's murder... ...could only have been channeled by you, Queen Amara! Amara: INSOLENT LAWYER. Judge: EEK! Forgive us, Your Mercifulness! Apollo: (Really, Your Magistry?) Nahyuta: Nahyuta: Ah, but have you considered the following, defense? What if there was, unbeknownst to us, another spirit medium in Khura'in? Apollo: Apollo: Oh, come on. What are the chances? Nahyuta: Nahyuta: You lack the evidence to support your claim that Queen Amara is the killer. Which is why you have had to use the process of elimination to zero in on her. It therefore stands to reason that you would have to rule out all other possibilities as well. Well? Can you eliminate the possibility of another spirit medium, defense? Apollo: (Of course I can't!) Phoenix: Under the circumstances, Apollo, there are two ways to establish Amara's guilt. We either prove she killed Inga... ...or prove she was in the tomb. Apollo: ......... (Hmm, which one can I actually prove?) Prove she killed Inga Apollo: Queen Amara killed Minister Inga! And I can prove it! Amara: Well now, you seem quite confident. How very intriguing. Though I must say... Adds statement \"There is nothing that proves it was I who killed Justice Minister Inga.\" Prove she was in the tomb Apollo: I can prove that Queen Amara was in the tomb when the murder occurred. Amara: It seems you are ever bent on painting me as the killer. Apollo: Well, if the shoe fits... Amara: Very well. Let us see some evidence that proves I was at the scene of the crime. You do have some, do you not? Adds statement \"There is nothing to prove I was even at the scene of the crime.\"Press (subsequent times) Apollo: Apollo: Evidence, huh. Amara: Yes. Here in this Hall of Justice, evidence is everything. Is it not so in your country, too? Apollo: ......... (There are two ways to establish Amara's guilt: Prove she killed Inga... ...or prove she was in the tomb.) ......... (Hmm, which one can I actually prove?) Prove she killed Inga Apollo: Queen Amara killed Minister Inga! And I can prove it! Amara: Well now, you seem quite confident. How very intriguing. Though I must say... Changes statement from \"There is nothing to prove I was even at the scene of the crime.\" to \"There is nothing that proves it was I who killed Justice Minister Inga.\" Prove she was in the tomb Apollo: I can prove that Queen Amara was in the tomb when the murder occurred. Amara: It seems you are ever bent on painting me as the killer. Apollo: Well, if the shoe fits... Amara: Very well. Let us see some evidence that proves I was at the scene of the crime. You do have some, do you not? Changes statement from \"There is nothing that proves it was I who killed Justice Minister Inga.\" to \"There is nothing to prove I was even at the scene of the crime.\"Amara: There is nothing that proves it was I who killed Justice Minister Inga.Press Apollo: Apollo: So you didn't leave any evidence behind? Is that what you're saying? Amara: .........O ho ho ho. Did you truly believe you could trick me with such an ambiguously-phrased question? Were I to answer in the affirmative, you would twist my words into an admission of guilt. Apollo: (It was worth a shot.) Nahyuta: You should know that you cannot prove anything through the deceit of others. If there is something worthwhile to say, then let the evidence speak for itself. Apollo: (You think I wouldn't if I could?) Amara: Now do you see? All is idle speculation in the absence of evidence.Amara: There is nothing to prove I was even at the scene of the crime.Press Apollo: Apollo: By simply changing into Dhurke's clothes and channeling his spirit... ...it is a fact that the killer altered the crime scene. Amara: How very perceptive of you. Apollo: .........In trying to accomplish everything, the killer would have been pressed for time... ...and may have committed an error that could prove crucial to this case. Phoenix: And sometimes, the significance of certain pieces of evidence can change... ...in the face of new facts and circumstances. Why don't you take another look at all the evidence we have? Apollo: You think I'll see something in a new light? (Is there anything from the tomb that's taken on a different meaning now? Only way to find out is to reconsider each piece based on our current understanding.)Present Pink Butterfly Pendant Apollo: Leads to: \"Queen Amara.\"Amara: Furthermore, Dhurke could have committed the crime while being channeled by Ms. Fey.Press Apollo: Apollo: You're saying the Dhurke who entered the tomb is the one who killed Minister Inga? Amara: I am. I stand firm with the prosecution's original charge against the accused. The only issue is whether that Dhurke was alive or dead. Apollo: That's a pretty major issue. Amara: Oh, I beg to differ. For here in Khura'in, death is not the end. It is merely a change in one's address, for the Twilight Realm is only the next door over. Apollo: Is it really? Amara: It is. Those who have only recently passed away may call upon you in the night. Such occurrences are quite common in our kingdom. Apollo: (She's kidding... right?) Phoenix: In all the time I've spent here, I'm happy to say that's never happened to me. Apollo: ...Me, neither. Amara: You need not fear death. Embrace it, along with your guilt. Then may you begin your journey to the Twilight Realm.Amara: Now, let us end this charade. For the eternal glory of Khura'in and its people!Press Apollo: Apollo: Eternal glory? Amara: Once the king of traitors has been judged, and the rebellion quelled for good... ...peace and prosperity shall return to our fair kingdom. Then shall the blessings of the Holy Mother usher in an age of eternal glory. Judge: Hmm... With Queen Amara as the Grand Priestess of Khura'in once more... ...the people would be freed from subversive elements. Faith would blossom anew! Amara: Oh, you are too kind. But I have no intention of resuming my position as grand priestess. Judge: What...?! Amara: I relinquished my position as queen and grand priestess to my sister Ga'ran. And now that my would-be assassin is gone, I am truly free at last. O ho ho. Perhaps I shall take a trip, or expand my horizons with new training. Judge: .........Q-Queen Amara? Phoenix: Looks like she's totally over being grand priestess and queen. Judge: Ha ha ha ha! In that case, I shall introduce you to some wonderful classes that I am taking!Before adding either statement Phoenix: She's claiming that all we've got is circumstantial evidence. Apollo: Well, I can't say she's wrong... Phoenix: Guess it's do or die now, Apollo. Our whole case comes crashing down if her testimony is allowed to stand. Apollo: Don't worry. I've got this!After adding statement \"There is nothing that proves it was I who killed Justice Minister Inga.\" Phoenix: Proof that Amara killed Inga... Apollo: (Do we really have anything like that...?) Phoenix: If nothing comes to mind, Apollo... ...you might need to get some different testimony out of her. Apollo: (Maybe I should take another look at the evidence we already have, too.)After adding statement \"There is nothing to prove I was even at the scene of the crime.\" Phoenix: If Amara channeled Dhurke, she must have been at the scene of the crime. If so, she may have left something behind.  Apollo: Sure, but the question is, did she? Phoenix: Well, if nothing else, you can always try to get her to testify about something else. Apollo: (Right! But first, maybe a quick review of the evidence.)Apollo: Queen Amara. Does this pendant look familiar to you?Amara: Why, that is...!Apollo: We found it in the tomb, and it has the minister's blood on it... ...which means it was probably dropped in the course of the crime.Nahyuta:Nahyuta: And? I fail to see how it is relevant to your argument. Did that not belong to the accused?Apollo: That's what I thought, too. After all, Dhurke had said it did himself.Amara: ! He... said that?Apollo: Yes, but it was a lie. Because I believe he was covering for someone.Nahyuta: Covering? How? For who?Amara: .........Apollo: There is a certain piece of evidence that shows the pendant isn't Dhurke's.Present Dhurke's Corpse Photo Apollo: Leads to: \"That's a photo of the accused's body, is it not?\"Present anything else Apollo: Amara: ...? Apollo: It seems the strength of my evidence has rendered you speechless, Queen Amara. Nahyuta: On the contrary. She is merely flabbergasted that you somehow considered this to be relevant. Apollo: Well, look at you. Guess you just have a knack for reading your mother's mind, huh. Nahyuta: ......... Apollo: N-No, please! Anything but that! Nahyuta:  Hrnh! Apollo: Aaaaaaaaaaagh! Judge: And here's a little something extra. Apollo: ...Aaaaaaaaaaaagh! Stop! I'm begging you! Phoenix: Apollo. Take a good look at the evidence again. Based on what we know now, there has to be something that's taken on a new significance. Nahyuta: It would appear... ...that the pendant did belong to the accused after all. Apollo: No, that's where you're wrong. Leads back to: \"There is a certain piece of evidence that shows the pendant isn't Dhurke's.\"Judge: That's a photo of the accused's body, is it not?Apollo: Yes, it is. And I'd like to call your attention to a certain spot in it. This right here proves that the pendant that was found in the tomb wasn't Dhurke's.Present blue butterfly pendant Apollo: Leads to: \"You will notice an object near Dhurke's left arm.\"Present anywhere else Apollo: Judge: That? Apollo: Yes. What? Judge: Why? Apollo: Because...? Judge: I grow weary of your single-word answers! Apollo: Gaaah! Judge: Are you sure you know what point you are trying to make defense? Apollo: Y-Yes, I do! And I'll get it right this time. I'd like to call your attention to a certain spot on the photo. Leads back to: \"This right here proves that the pendant that was found in the tomb wasn't Dhurke's.\"Apollo: You will notice an object near Dhurke's left arm. It's an identical pendant, except it's blue.Judge: ...Oh! Now that you mention it...Apollo: Don't you find that a little strange? Why would he own two of them, but in different colors? Here's what I think: The pendants were meant to go together as a pair.Nahyuta: .........A pair?Apollo: If the blue pendant was Dhurke's... ...then what about this pink one with Minister Inga's blood on it? Who do you suppose it belongs to?Amara: ..................Nahyuta:Nahyuta: Sorry to disappoint, but... ...no fingerprints were found on the pink pendant. Therefore, we have no way of knowing to whom it belongs.Apollo:Apollo: Ah, but that's where you're wrong, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi. I'm guessing you didn't know that this pendant is actually a locket.Nahyuta: ...Come again?Apollo: Now this is where it gets interesting. When we opened this locket up.... ...we found a faint fingerprint inside. On the back of the lid, to be exact.Nahyuta: What?! .........N-No...Apollo: So now the question is, to whom does the fingerprint belong?Amara: ........................Apollo: Queen Amara! It belongs to you, doesn't it?Amara: ...O-Oooohhhhhh. ...........................Nngh.Apollo: .........It seems I've truly rendered the witness speechless this time around.Nahyuta: Th-This... cannot be! Mother! Tell me it does not belong to you.Amara: ...............N-Nahyuta... I..................Apollo: .........Think about it, Queen Amara. Dhurke must've realized that you were channeling his spirit. And he had probably already figured out who the minister's killer was. And yet... ...he still claimed that the pink pendant belonged to him.Amara: ...! But why would he do such a thing?Apollo: You really don't know? He was protecting you. ...Because he loved you. He loved you until his very last breath, and beyond.Dhurke: I have one more... big secret. I'm afraid I can't tell you what it is. I'd be betraying a certain someone if I did.Apollo: Dhurke knew everything -- even that he was being used. But he kept quiet... All for your sake.Amara: ..................Dhurke. Why do you always...?Apollo: Well, Queen Amara? Dhurke -- the one whose love for you never wavered all these years... Are you going to betray him now?!Amara: Dh... Dhurke... I... ..............................Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!Nahyuta: Th-This cannot be... I refuse to accept it!Apollo: Queen Amara, are you ready to confess to your crime?Amara: ..................I can deny it no longer. The truth is... it was I, Amara Sigatar Khura'in, who slew Minister Inga.Nahyuta: Th-That's preposterous! Wh-Whyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy?!Judge: Th-This is beyond belief!Nahyuta: M-Mother! Why would you...?!Amara: Forgive me, Nahyuta. I never wished to cause you such sorrow. But... I had no choice. It was the only way.Nahyuta: The only way?Judge: ............... .........So, in the end, Queen Amara and Dhurke Sahdmadhi... I suppose this means that they were unable to reconcile while he was still alive.Apollo: I don't think the state of the kingdom or the incidents of the past would've allowed that.Phoenix: They were prisoners of their shared history, so to speak.Apollo: Queen Amara, there's something I need to know. You had staged a near-perfect crime. So why did you bring this pendant into the tomb with you? You should've known it could come back to haunt you.Amara: .........I do not really understand it myself. I had nearly been assassinated by my own husband... ...yet I could not bear any hatred toward him. I was unable to discard this, or part with it for even a short time. As with Dhurke... ...I have never stopped loving my husband for the past twenty-three years.Nahyuta: .........Mother.Apollo: (.........So she really believes it? That Dhurke tried to assassinate her?)Pink Butterfly Pendant updated in the Court Record.Amara: Your Magistry, is it not time? Time to declare Dhurke innocent? I would ask that you do this for my beloved, who now dwells in the Twilight Realm.Judge: ...Very well, then. Your Eminence, Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, if you have no further objections...Nahyuta: Arrngh! This cannot be. My mother...?Ga'ran: .........I have no objections.Apollo: (Dhurke, I did it -- I finally did it! I proved your innocence! But............)Judge: Very well, then. Being that Queen Amara yet lives... ...we can no longer charge the accused with an assassination that never came to fruition. As for the murder of Minister Inga, the truth has been laid bare for all to see. Therefore, I will now pass judgement upon the accused, Mr. Dhurke Sahdmadhi.???:Apollo: Y-Your Benevolence?Rayfa: .....................I... I... cannot accept this!Judge: Is something the matter, Your Benevolence?Rayfa: Queen Amara is lying! It makes no sense! Queen Amara would not have killed my father!Phoenix: What's with her all of a sudden? Is this some sort of lingering affection towards Nayna?Apollo: ............... (Rayfa...)Rayfa: Speak the truth, Queen Amara! Did you really kill my father?Amara: .........Yes. There is no mistake.Judge: .........She has confessed to the crime, thereby clearing the accused of all suspicion. As such, I see no need to continue these proceedings.Rayfa: B-Barbed Head! Horn Head! Are you going to let this stand?Apollo: ......... (Dhurke's been proven innocent, and he's about to be declared not guilty. Even so, something doesn't feel right...)Phoenix: .........Apollo. If you have any doubts, now's the time to raise them. After all, the courtroom is a place for finding the WHOLE truth. But it's all up to you.Apollo: (There are definitely things that don't quite add up. Does this mean that the whole truth hasn't been brought to light yet? Should I push to continue this trial?)Push to continue Leads to: \"...Your Magistry, I have a feeling we haven't discovered the whole truth.\"Let it end here Apollo: (.........Is this the right thing to do? Dhurke's been proven innocent, so there's that. But... has every last bit of the truth really come out here today?) Phoenix: Apollo, if you have any doubts, you should keep digging deeper. If you can't get to the truth here in a sacred hall of justice, where else can you? Apollo: ...Right. Leads to: \"...Your Magistry, I have a feeling we haven't discovered the whole truth.\"Apollo: ...Your Magistry, I have a feeling we haven't discovered the whole truth. And the only way we'll ever find it is to continue this trial.Rayfa: Horn Head!Judge: Very well, then. Will the defense please tell us this: What important fact about this case has yet to come to light?The murder method Apollo: We still don't know how Minister Inga was killed! Judge: Hm? I thought we established that at the very beginning? Amara: Indeed. Did I not stab him from behind? Or would you claim there to be another possibility? Apollo: ...N-No, that sounds about right. Judge: Does it now? Well, this penalty feels about right, too. Apollo: ...B-But.. I know there's something that hasn't come to light yet! Judge: Very well, you may proceed if you are ready to present a serious answer this time. Leads back to: \"What important fact about this case has yet to come to light?\"The motive Leads to: \"Um, Queen Amara?\"Amara's married life Apollo: We still don't have a clear picture of your married life with Dhurke, Queen Amara. Amara: .........You would have me speak of such matters here? In front of all these people? Apollo: Yes, please. Inquiring minds want to know. Amara: .........B-But it's so embarrassing. Apollo: ......... Judge: ............ ............ Judge: The defense will take full responsibility for my second-hand embarrassment! Apollo: Don't worry, Your Magistry. I'm definitely feeling the hot burn of shame right now. Judge: Now then, would you care to try again? Leads back to: \"What important fact about this case has yet to come to light?\"Apollo: Um, Queen Amara? ...There's something I still don't understand. What was your motive for killing Justice Minister Inga?Amara: .........That is a fair question, and one that I shall now answer. It was for the future of this kingdom that I slew Inga Karkhuul Khura'in. To avert further tragedy, his death was an unfortunate necessity.Apollo: Further tragedy?Amara: Over the past several years, Minister Inga had been rapidly expanding his power. He had established the secret police, and was relentless in his pursuit of the insurgents. He even had the overwhelming support of the people, but still he was not satisfied. Hungry for more power, he began planning a coup d'état.Apollo: You mean his plot involving the Founder's Orb, which led to Maya Fey's abduction?Amara: Yes. Minister Inga planned to use the orb to gain access to great spiritual power... ...after which, he would assassinate Ga'ran and usurp the throne.Ga'ran: His machinations were reminiscent of that terrible tragedy of twenty-three years ago. And as one affected by that incident... ...Amara vowed to never allow a repeat of such events.Amara: Yes, and the Holy Mother delivered unto me the perfect opportunity to fulfill my vow. Security amid the courtyard was rather light due to the Rite of Channeling. And Inga had barricaded himself in the tomb with his hostage, away from prying eyes. I knew I would never again have such a perfect opportunity, so... ...at 2 PM, during the Rite of Channeling, I slipped into the tomb and slew the minister.BRACELET THUMPSApollo: ! (My bracelet!)Phoenix: Apollo...!Apollo: Yep. It seems this trial is far from over. Queen Amara, I believe you're still hiding something!Amara: !Apollo: But if you want to keep on playing this game of hide and seek... ...then let's start with that last statement you made.Amara: .........If I must. At 2 PM, during the Rite of Channeling, I slipped into the tomb and slew the minister.Perceive twitching left middle finger on \"At 2 PM, during the Rite of Channeling,\" Apollo: Leads to: \"Queen Amara.\"Perceive wrong area Apollo: Apollo: Queen Amara, you seem a little nervous right now. Amara: Of course I am. Is it not the way of lawyers to gain the advantage by unnerving their foes? Apollo: Oh, uhh... Well... (Great. Now she's unnerved me! Focus, Justice! Just look for a habit or tic that shows she's hiding something.) Leads back to: \"At 2 PM, during the Rite of Channeling, I slipped into the tomb and slew the minister.\"Apollo: Queen Amara. You're not very comfortable talking about the 2 o'clock Rite of Channeling, are you? I can tell because a finger on your left hand twitched almost imperceptibly when you did.Amara: Oh?!Apollo: And that pose you make... Is there something about your chest that makes you nervous?Amara: ...Whatever do you mean?Apollo: (The murder occurred at 2 PM... ...and I'm pretty positive Amara was in the tomb at that time. So then why is she so self-conscious about her chest when she talks about the rite?)Phoenix: The Rite of Channeling...? Didn't Ahlbi snap a picture of it?Apollo: ...Queen Amara. I have here, a picture of the Rite of Channeling. It was secretly taken by a certain individual.Amara: !Ga'ran:Ga'ran: Such insolence! I would have the perpetrator's name at once!Apollo: Er, sorry. No can do. You see, I, um... I just happened to find it on the ground, so...Ga'ran: ...Do you take me for a fool?Apollo: Um, how about we discuss the photo's origin a little later, because right now... ...there's something much more pressing at hand! I believe this photo merits further examination! (I just wish there was more to see in it than darkness and more darkness.)Phoenix: We might be able to make out a few more details with some image adjustments. Let's ask Ema if she can help.Judge: Bailiff, please summon Detective Skye to the Hall of Justice.Ema: Here you are. I was able to obtain a much clearer image by raising the brightness.Apollo: Hm? What's that right there?Phoenix: An injury? No, wait... I think it's a burn scar.Channeling Photo updated in the Court Record.Apollo: .........Wait a second. Your Eminence... You don't have a burn scar like that on your chest.Ga'ran: ............Apollo: (...What's going on here?) If the person in this photo isn't Queen Ga'ran, then who is it?Present Amara Sigatar Khura'in profile Apollo: Leads to: \"Queen Amara. The person in this photo isn't Queen Ga'ran.\"Present anyone else Apollo: Judge: ...Hm? Apollo: Huh? .........Oh, uh... Sorry, slip of the hand. Judge: .........Whoops. Would you look at that. A slip of MY hand. Apollo: Ack! Phoenix: There is one person involved with this case who is likely to have a burn scar. Apollo: Well, it's certainly not Her Eminence... Leads back to: \"If the person in this photo isn't Queen Ga'ran, then who is it?\"Apollo: Queen Amara. The person in this photo isn't Queen Ga'ran. It's you, posing as her, isn't it?Amara: Umm...Apollo: The two of you look quite similar. But that's no surprise, considering you're sisters. Even the shape and position of your facial tattoos are almost exactly the same. And you are both capable of channeling spirits. Therefore, it would've been easy for you to impersonate Queen Ga'ran.Amara: .........Ugh!Apollo: Queen Amara. You have a burn scar on your chest, don't you? Please remove your round mandala so we can see what's behind it for ourselves!Amara: Nngh... Rrrrrrnnnnnnnnnnnnnnggggggggghhhhhhhhhh! Eeeeeeeeek!Apollo: L-Look! It's the exact same burn scar as the one in the photo.Judge: I-I don't understand.Apollo: (I knew it!)Phoenix: So the person in this photo really is...Apollo: Yes. It's Queen Amara.Judge: Th-This is absurd! Are you suggesting they switched places?Phoenix: Amara's confession earlier was also false?Nahyuta: ...Mother! What is the meaning of this?!Amara: .........Apollo: Don't you see?! This changes everything! We know for a fact that this photo was taken at 2 PM... The exact time the murder took place.Judge: B-But... ...that would mean Queen Amara couldn't possibly have committed this crime!Apollo: Exactly. She now has an ironclad alibi. So Minister Inga's killer couldn't have been Queen Amara.Judge: I-I am afraid... I no longer follow, defense. Was it not Queen Amara who channeled the minister and the accused to stage the crime?Apollo: Yes, that fact has not changed. We have evidence placing her at the scene of the crime. And Dhurke could've only been there in the tomb if she were channeling him. Which means... While Queen Amara did use spirit channeling to stage the crime... ...she didn't kill Minister Inga. His real killer is someone else!Judge: Pohlkunkaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!Gallery:...What's going on here?Was Her Mercifulness covering for someone?Judge: If Queen Amara is not the killer, then who is it?Apollo: Isn't it obvious? Why was this rite held in the first place if Queen Ga'ran wasn't going to perform it? Who was behind the two sisters switching places, and for what reason? The answers to these questions, along with the establishment of Queen Amara's alibi... ...obliterate a certain someone else's alibi!Present Ga'ran Sigatar Khura'in profile Apollo: Leads to: \"Why, that's...! Is this some kind of a joke?!\"Present anyone else Apollo: Judge: It obliterates this person's alibi? And what new revelation do we gain from that? Apollo: .........All will be revealed in due time.\t Judge: Well, here's a revelation for you: All you've done is obliterate my patience! Apollo: (All right... Guess that's why your title's not \"Your Chilledness.\" But the fact remains that the person in the photo is Amara.) Your Magistry, the facts of this case... Leads back to: \"...obliterate a certain someone else's alibi!\"Judge: Why, that's...! Is this some kind of a joke?!Apollo: No, Your Magistry. I could never joke about something so grave. The only one who seemed to have a perfect alibi at the time of the murder... ...was Her Eminence, Ga'ran Sigatar Khura'in!Ga'ran: ...............Apollo: Queen Amara, didn't your sister Queen Ga'ran ask you to pose as her... ...and perform the Rite of Channeling?Amara: I...Apollo: And didn't she also have you drive Dhurke's spirit from Ms. Fey's body... ...and then stage the crime to make it look like he was the minister's killer?Amara: ..................Apollo: And at 2 PM, while you were performing the Rite of Channeling as Queen Ga'ran... ...didn't she kill Minister Inga while disguised as Dhurke? Well, Your Mercifulness?!Amara: Hnnngh...Apollo: It's no use trying to hide it any longer. You need to tell us the truth now!Nahyuta: M-Mother?Amara: ........................................ Justice Minister Inga's true killer is...... ..................................Apollo: !Phoenix: !Nahyuta: M-Mother?! No!Royal Guard: Haaaaaaaahahahahaha! I-I really did it... Your Eminence! My life is youuuurs!Apollo: I-Isn't he... one of Ga'ran's royal guards?Ga'ran: .........Judge: Q-Q-Queen Amaraaaaaa! Bailiff! Arrest that guardsman!Nahyuta: Mother...!Apollo: Ga'ran couldn't have... could she?Judge: Someone call for an ambulance! Quickly, now!To be continuedMay 19, 8:50 AMHigh Court of Khura'inApollo: (We're lucky the ambulance made it in time... ...but we've been forced into a recess for now while things get straightened out.)Athena: I-I can't believe what just happened.Phoenix: Tell me about it. Do you think Ga'ran put that guard up to it?Apollo: If she did, she's going to regret it. No one gets away with something like that on my watch!Rayfa: ...............Poor Queen Amara.Apollo: Your Benevolence...? Any news on her condition?Rayfa: She is undergoing surgery at the hospital as we speak. They are giving her a fifty-fifty chance of survival, though.Apollo: ...That Ga'ran! Justice will be served.Rayfa: Why? Why did this happen? Ooh... Just as we were finally reunited... Oh, Queen Amara...Apollo: ...Um, what was that about being reunited?Rayfa: Hm? Oh, it's nothing!Apollo: R-Right...Rayfa: ...How are YOU, Horn Head? Dhurke Sahdmadhi was your father in all but blood, after all.Apollo: .........Thank you for your concern, Your Benevolence. But I'm fine. Right now, we still have a trial to see through... ... so that's what I'm going to stay focused on.Rayfa: Horn Head... You are sturdier than your stature lets on.Athena: Just don't overdo it... Okay, Apollo?Datz: ..................Dhurke. That was a real shocker, all right. Can't believe the dragon is dead.Apollo: Datz...Datz: Say, AJ... I was wondering... When Dhurke disappeared after I freed him... ...that's because Amara turned back into herself, right?Apollo: Yeah, I suppose so. But I don't know if it was because Dhurke's spirit willed it... ...or if it was a part of Ga'ran or Amara's plan.Datz: ........................Man... Our dream of revolution... Now what're we gonna do? Is this it?Apollo: Don't give up yet. There is a very good chance that Ga'ran is the real culprit in all this. And if we can prove her guilt in court...Datz: ...Hey, you're right! That could be just the push we need. The dream lives on!Apollo: ...Yes, it does.Datz: Ya know what that means, AJ? The fate o' the revolution rests squarely on your shoulders!Apollo: Heh, heh. All in a day's work... (Argh, who am I kidding? That's a ton of pressure. But this is what Dhurke gave his life for, so I have to do this for him.)Rayfa: The honorable rebel Dhurke Sahdmadhi... I... would have loved to have spoken with him while he yet lived.Apollo: Really?Rayfa: ! Wh-Why not? I-I mean, he seemed like quite an interesting man.Apollo: (Did she bump her head or something earlier?)Bailiff: The trial is about to resume. The defense is to report to the courtroom at once.Athena: Already...? After what just happened?Phoenix: The first thing Ga'ran will do is respond to that last accusation. So you'd better stay on your toes, Apollo.Apollo: I will, Mr. Wright. Ready or not, Ga'ran, here comes Justice!May 19, 8:50 AMHigh Court of Khura'inJudge: Now then, let us resume today's proceedings.Ga'ran: ............Apollo: Huh? (Where's Nahyuta?)Ga'ran: I must offer my apologies. I never imagined a royal guardsman would do such a thing.Apollo: What? He wasn't acting under your orders?Judge: H-How dare you cast such suspicions upon Her Eminence!Ga'ran: It is quite all right, Your Magistry. Suspicion is only natural under such circumstances. But rest assured that he acted alone, for I knew nothing of his plans.Apollo: (I don't believe that for a second.)Ga'ran: Now then, Your Magistry. Regarding the murder of my husband, Minister Inga... ...I would like to offer a new possibility.Judge: A new possibility, you say?Ga'ran: Indeed. For during the break, the real killer confessed to me.Apollo: What?!Ga'ran: Bailiff, call the witness to the stand.Phoenix: The real killer confessed...? What's she got up her sleeve this time?Apollo: ......... (I have a really bad feeling about this.)Apollo: ...............Phoenix: ...............Judge: ..................Apollo: H-HE'S the one who confessed...?Nahyuta: ...............Judge: P-Prosecutor Sahdmadhi?! YOU'RE the real killer?!Ga'ran: I questioned him during the recess, as I felt that Amara had been covering for someone. So it was that he finally confessed his crime to me.Apollo: N-Nahyuta... You didn't really do it, did you?Nahyuta: .................. ........................ Her Eminence speaks the truth. ...It was I who killed Justice Minister Inga.Apollo: N... Nahyutaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!Judge: Peace! Prosecutor Sahdmadhi! Are you absolutely certain about this? A confession of this nature is grave indeed!Nahyuta: Yes, I am certain. For I killed him by my own hand.Ga'ran: Heh heh heh. At last, the real killer has been revealed.Phoenix: H-How are we supposed to respond to this?Apollo: Nahyuta! Retract your confession! Now!Nahyuta: .........Mr. Justice. It is not yet time for your cross-examination.Apollo: Wh-Who cares about that?! Admit it -- it was Queen Ga'ran who put you up to this! She forced you into giving a confession, didn't she?!Nahyuta:Nahyuta: You are out of line, Mr. Justice. Learn some self-restraint.Apollo: Arngh... But...Nahyuta: Or do you have something that might prove... that I did not commit this murder?Apollo: I-I... That is... Nnnnnnrrrrrrrrgh! (What do you think you're doing, you idiot!)Ga'ran: .........Truly, the truth can set us free.Phoenix: Looks like Ga'ran got to him somehow. I definitely didn't see this coming.Apollo: (Nahyuta, why are you doing this? Why would you sacrifice even your life to do Ga'ran's bidding?)Judge: Whatever the case may be... ...Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, your testimony, please.Witness Testimony-- Nahyuta's Confession --Nahyuta: I could not remain silent while Her Eminence fell under suspicion for this crime. It was I who murdered Justice Minister Inga. He had to die for the future of Khura'in. I consider it divine judgment cast upon a fiend who sought to assassinate our monarch. My mother was simply covering for me. I am ashamed I let her go so far for my sake.Apollo: .........You DO understand what you're doing, right, Nahyuta? You're sentencing yourself to death if you're found guilty.Nahyuta: ...If that is the court's verdict, then so be it. I must obey the law above all else.Apollo: The law, Nahyuta? Or the queen?Ga'ran:Ga'ran: Enough. This blather has nothing to do with the witness's testimony.Judge: Please address any issues you may have during the cross-examination, defense.Apollo: (Oh, I will! I'm going to blow his problematic testimony to smithereens!)Cross-ExaminationCross-Examination-- Nahyuta's Confession --Nahyuta: I could not remain silent while Her Eminence fell under suspicion for this crime.Press Apollo: Apollo: You kept quiet all this time, even though you were the real killer? Nahyuta: ...Yes. And I accept that what I have done can never be forgiven. But I never imagined suspicion would fall upon the queen herself. Ga'ran: Prosecutor Sahdmadhi has placed the future of our kingdom above his own life. He is taking responsibility for his crime and is showing his loyalty to queen and country. Nahyuta: Without a monarch on the throne, Khura'in would be plunged into chaos. I could never wish that upon my homeland. That is why I had to let the truth be known. Apollo: (What a bunch of baloney!) ...I'm going to ask you again, Nahyuta. Did you really kill Minister Inga? Nahyuta: Yes. No matter how many times you ask, Mr. Justice, the truth is immutable.Nahyuta: It was I who murdered Justice Minister Inga.Press Apollo: Apollo: It's not too late. You can still retract your confession before the verdict is rendered! Nahyuta: There is no retracting the truth. One either tells it or does not tell it. It is that simple. Apollo: Argh! (Why do you always have to be so stubborn, Nahyuta?! I hate how you never listen to reason once you get like this!) Phoenix: I think we'll need some evidence before we can get him to retract his confession. Either that, or we'll have to force a retraction out of him by appealing to what's in his heart. Apollo: It's not going to be easy either way. Judge: Prosecutor Sahdmadhi, what was the motive for your crime? Nahyuta: I had reason enough to kill Minister Inga.Nahyuta: He had to die for the future of Khura'in.Press Apollo: Apollo: What do you mean by that? Nahyuta: Minister Inga was planning to assassinate Her Eminence in a coup d'état. I had to nip this evil in the bud, even if it cost me the purity of my soul. Apollo: ...So you're saying the death of another is a reasonable price to pay to protect the queen? Ga'ran: Long have we remained independent under the authority of our spirit medium queens. We command the people's awe and respect with the power to commune with the dead. Without such a monarch, our kingdom would lose its standing in the world. Apollo: But if spirit channeling is so important, why did you have Queen Amara perform the rite? Ga'ran: I'm afraid my elder sister is quite capricious. She would fulfill her duty only when the desire struck, as sporadic as that was. (Changed from [She would fulfill her duty only when the desire to struck, [sic] as sporadic as that was.] in the original release) It was, therefore, something she did on a whim. There was no meaning behind it. Phoenix: A meaningless whim? Apollo: It's hard to press a statement like that. Nahyuta: Now, if I may return to my testimony...Nahyuta: I consider it divine judgment cast upon a fiend who sought to assassinate our monarch.Press Apollo: Apollo: Divine judgement? Nahyuta: Yes. I rendered judgement upon the minister on behalf of the Holy Mother. Apollo: Are you saying the Holy Mother guided you? Nahyuta: No. Her Holiness would never condone killing in her name, regardless of circumstances. As such, I believe my defiled soul will be damned to hell. But I do not regret what I have done. I willingly sacrificed my soul to protect this kingdom's future. Apollo: (Argh! Snap out of it already, Nahyuta!) Phoenix: So his motive comes from a place of faith, huh. Why does that sound completely credible when it's coming from him? Apollo: Well, Amara expressed a similar motive. Nahyuta: As for Her Mercifulness, she is truly deserving of her title.Nahyuta: My mother was simply covering for me. I am ashamed I let her go so far for my sake.Press Apollo: Apollo: So you killed Minister Inga, and Queen Amara staged the crime? Is that how it went? Nahyuta: Precisely. My mother is as clever as she is kind. She sought to conceal my crime by taking all of the guilt upon herself. Apollo: (Yet another lie... I need to poke a hole in his testimony, but how?) Nahyuta, could it be you... Didn't know Nayna's real identity Apollo: You didn't realize that Nayna was actually Queen Amara, your own mother? Nahyuta: That is not as strange as you might think. Much time had passed since we last met, after all. Apollo: ...Right. Twenty-three years ago, was it? When Dhurke saved her after the supposed assassination attempt? Nahyuta: ...No, Mr. Justice. It was fifteen years ago that Dhurke abducted my mother. Apollo: Huh? (That's weird.) Are you sure about that? Nahyuta: I remember it clearly. I was around ten years old at the time. Apollo: .........Nahyuta, please add that last statement to your testimony. Adds statement \"I was reunited with my mother, Queen Amara, fifteen years ago when Dhurke abducted her.\" if not already added Told Amara what to do Apollo: Did you tell Queen Amara to do what she did? Nahyuta: No, she acted under her own volition. She must have somehow discovered my crime, and then staged the crime scene. Apollo: (Sounds plausible on the surface, but I'm not buying it. Still, I don't think we'll get anywhere if I press the issue.) Leads back to cross-examinationNahyuta: I was reunited with my mother, Queen Amara, fifteen years ago when Dhurke abducted her.Press Apollo: Apollo: Fifteen years ago, huh? (That's around the time I left for the U.S.) What happened after Dhurke helped Queen Amara escape? Nahyuta: Agents of the crown pursued us relentlessly... ...so we had to live a life on the run. .........Mr. Justice. Know that Dhurke sent you away so that you would not be caught up in that life we led. Apollo: I see... Thanks... (I can't believe it's been fifteen years.) Phoenix: .........Apollo, there's something about Nahyuta's testimony... Apollo: Yeah, that discrepancy's a bit hard to miss... But what could it mean?Present Woman's Photo Apollo: Leads to: \"You're saying that Dhurke made off with Queen Amara fifteen years ago.\"Before adding statement Phoenix: To think that Nahyuta would confess to the crime... Can't say I saw that coming. Apollo: ......... (Why Nahyuta? Why? Why are you putting yourself on the line for Ga'ran?) Phoenix: ...I wonder if Ga'ran has something on him. Apollo: I don't think so. I mean, Amara's currently fighting for her life, so... ...I don't see what Ga'ran COULD threaten him with. Phoenix: But maybe that's just it. Maybe there's something else that we don't know about.After adding statement Phoenix: So Nahyuta got to meet his mother... ...back when Dhurke rescued her. Apollo: That's what he's saying. It's news to me, though -- I had already been sent away by that point. (Okay, now that I've dragged more testimony out of him... ...what can I do with it?)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Trucy Wright\nDescription: A particular set of circumstances led to her being adopted by Mr. Wright.

The photo of the corpse cannot coincide with that event if the abduction occurred fifteen years ago, assuming the photo is from a recent period.\n\nThis presents a contradiction between evidence 29 (Dhurke's death) and testimony 5 (Nahyuta's statement about Dhurke being alive fifteen years ago).\n",

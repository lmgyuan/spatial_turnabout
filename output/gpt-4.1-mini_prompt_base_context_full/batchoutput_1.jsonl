Testimony 3 (Fairplay's statement that he saw McGilded stabbing the man, everything he said before stands) and Testimony 4 (Beppo saying yes, he stabbed him) depict the stabbing, but there is a contradiction between the witness statements about the timing and manner of the stabbing seen by different witnesses (some say stabbing happened while the victim was seated, others say after he collapsed).\n\nHowever, focusing on one direct contradiction between evidence and testimony: Evidence 1 (Autopsy Report) specifies exactly one stab wound was fatal and present. This contradicts the narrative that the victim was stabbed twice, as some jurors suggested based on witnesses' conflicting accounts.\n\nSo the pair of contradiction would be between Evidence 1 and the implication from the testimonies suggesting two stabbings occurred. But no single testimony explicitly states two stabbings, rather, it's an interpretation.\n\nLooking at testimonies and evidence about the fare: Testimony 0 (Beppo says he only carried four passengers that night, implies total fares = 20 pence). Testimony 1 and 2 (Fairplay and Furst) say they paid 5 pence each, which if four passengers paid 5 pence equals 20 pence total. Beppo claims four passengers, but the fare per person is disputed (4 pence or 5 pence).\n\nJuror 5 states that the omnibus fare is always fourpence, implying 4 passengers should pay 16 pence total. Beppo claims 20 pence total. This creates a discrepancy in the fare calculation, suggesting there was a fifth passenger or Beppo is lying.\n\nThis discrepancy is significant since it suggests that Beppo's testimony about the passengers fares contradicts other testimonies about the bus fare.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Beppo's testimony (Testimony 0) that he carried four passengers and took 20 pence in fares (implying 5 pence per fare), and the established fare cost from Juror 5 (not a testimony but relevant), and testimony 1 or 2 about the fare being 5 pence.\n\nHowever, Juror 5 explicitly says the fare is fourpence, contradicting Beppo's stated fare amounts.\n\nChoosing one direct contradiction between the evidence and testimony:\n\nThe Autopsy Report (Evidence 1) states that the victim was stabbed once.\n\nBruce Fairplay's testimony (Testimony 3) claims to have seen McGilded stab the victim, which aligns with the murder weapon and the autopsy.\n\nBeppo's testimony (Testimony 4) supports that McGilded stabbed the victim.\n\nThere is no direct contradiction here.\n\nLooking at the evidence of the Murder Weapon Sheath being marked with an 'M' (Evidence 5) that could belong to McGilded. The defendant is accused of the murder based on this.\n\nNo testimonies conflict with the knife evidence.\n\nLooking at the Debtors' Ledger (Evidence 6) showing Fairplay also owed money to McGilded but is testifying against him, which could suggest motive.\n\nThus, the main contradiction lies in the fare and the number of passengers.\n\nBeppo testifies that there were four passengers and twenty pence collected. If fare is fourpence, that totals sixteen pence, not twenty. So either Beppo is lying about the fare or the number of passengers, or the fare amount is incorrect.\n\nFairplay and Furst both say they paid fivepence for the fare, which contradicts the guild's fare of fourpence.\n\nHence, the strongest contradiction is between Beppo's testimony (Testimony 0) about four passengers and twenty pence total, which conflicts with the guild's fare price (fourpence) and the statements by Fairplay and Furst that they paid fivepence.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Beppo's testimony (Testimony 0) and the fair price known from the guild testimony confirming it is fourpence (from Juror 5). Since the fares collected are inconsistent with the number of passengers, suggesting an undisclosed passenger or overcharging.\n\nBut since the prompt requires one pair of evidence and testimony, the only evidence about passengers and fares is the Omnibus (Evidence 4) and the coachman's testimony (Testimony 0).\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 4 (Omnibus: scene of the crime, with a bloodstain on the frame of the skylight) is not directly conflicting with fares.\n\nHence, the more direct contradiction is with the Debtors' Ledger (Evidence 6) including Bruce Fairplay as a debtor, yet Fairplay testifies he saw McGilded stabbing the victim (Testimony 3), hence testifying against a man he also owed money to.

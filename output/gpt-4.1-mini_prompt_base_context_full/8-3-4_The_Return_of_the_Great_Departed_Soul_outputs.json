Wondrous new works of culture and industry from every corner of the globe had converged on Hyde Park. Welcoming over fifty million visitors, the last great hurrah of this century astonished and delighted people of all nations, and ended on a note of resounding success. But, as regards to the terrible catastrophe that occurred during the festivities, very few are aware my friend, Mr Herlock Sholmes, had a hand in unravelling the matter. For, from the shadows, it was he who earnestly unearthed the facts of the case. And like the centrepiece of the Great Exhibition, which rose high into the skies of Hyde Park, Sholmes's brilliant deductions - as clear and lofty as the Crystal Tower itself - brought the truth to light. Rendered dialogue We're here at the showground of the Great Exhibition, which is absolutely packed with people... The weather is unusually fine, and we're about to witness a most extraordinary scientific experiment! Ladies and gentlemen, the twentieth century will see steam engines and electrical power dominate the world! Horse-drawn carts will give way to the motor car! Ships will sprout wings and take to the skies! And today, we showcase even more advanced technology! A glimpse into the future! A world first! A demonstration of my super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine! A man will literally be disassembled by a pulse of high-voltage electricity, and beamed to another location... ...whereupon his body will be reassembled by a series of complex calculations exactly as it was before! In but a few moments from now... ...this gentleman will, in the blink of an eye, complete an incredible journey through the air... ...to arrive an instant later, on the Crystal Tower behind you! 22nd October, 9:36 a.m. Sholmes's Suite Ryunosuke: ......... Iris: ...Runo! Runo, are you listening? Ryunosuke: Oh! Sorry, um...what was that, Iris? Iris: Hmph. What's the matter with you? You've been miles away all morning. Didn't you like what I cooked for breakfast? Ryunosuke: No no, that's not it at all. Um...what were we talking about again? Iris: Today's paper! It's full of news about the Great Exhibition again! Ryunosuke: Ah yes...the Great Exhibition... I'd like to go sometime. ......... Iris: You're really not your usual self today. You seem very down. Don't you agree, Hurley? Sholmes: Hm...? Did you say something? Iris? Iris: Oh gosh! You're even more down! Sholmes: ......... UWAAAAAAAAAGH!!! Wh-When did you arrive, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: I've...been here for about half an hour already. We had breakfast together. Sholmes: What?! Why didn't you mention it before? Ryunosuke: I, um...thought you might have known I was here. You know, because...breakfast? Sholmes: Hm, Iris is quite right. You're clearly lacking in vim. So much so that I didn't notice your presence. Ryunosuke: (...Thanks.) Sholmes: Of course, I could deduce the reason perfectly well with some simple observations. Ryunosuke: What?! Sholmes: Let's see... Yes, for example, your tussled hair this morning, with all its unruly spikes. Clearly it can be deduced therefore, that- Ryunosuke: Um, let me stop you there, Mr Sholmes, because I think I can see where this is going. My hair always looks like this. It always has. Ever since we first met, in fact. Sholmes: Oh really? How interesting. It just doesn't look like a haircut as such, I suppose. Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Ryunosuke: (...Thanks again.) ......... It crossed my mind recently...that it's been six months now. Iris: Six months? Ryunosuke: Since I was forbidden from working in court. So I've been wondering how much longer I'm going to be banned. Iris: Oh... Well, that would explain why you seem rather glum. Don't you agree, Hurley? Sholmes: Hm...? Did you say something? Iris? Ryunosuke: (Ah...back to moping...) Ryunosuke: What's the matter with Mr Sholmes today? He seems even more down in the dumps than me. Iris: I know! And the Great Exhibition has opened! You'd think he'd be excited. Oh, why don't we all go to see it together? Sholmes: I want to! Of course I do! But I can't! ...Not for the time being. Ryunosuke: Why not? Sholmes: Why not? Why not?! Because! I'm a great detective, after all! Ryunosuke: (So you're embroiled in some tricky case that you can't be distracted from? Is that it?) Iris: I don't remember hearing that you're working on a case, Hurley. Sholmes: ......... Ryunosuke: (I suppose I should try to find out what's going on.) After clearing all Converse options: Sholmes: Well, I must be leaving now. Ryunosuke: Yes, understood. See you later, Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: Hah! You really are a shameless liar sometimes, my dear fellow! Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: You seek to put me off my guard and follow me, don't you? Well, you would be wasting your time. Ryunosuke: The thought hadn't crossed my mind! (But now I'm wondering where you're going...) Sholmes: Ah ha ha ha hah! Well then, 'see you later' indeed! Ryunosuke: (Listen to him. He's still laughing on his way out of the door...) Iris: Alright then, Runo! Let's get going! Ryunosuke: Oh! Um, Iris... What are you wearing? Iris: I've got changed to go to the Great Exhibition. You're going to take me! Ryunosuke: What? But, but I was just about to go to the Supreme Court... Iris: Oh! Well that sounds fun, too! You're going to take me there, then! Ryunosuke: Alright, fine. Just...lower that weapon, would you? Iris: Of course! And after the Supreme Court, then we'll go to see the Great Exhibition! 22nd October Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy 22nd October British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Ryunosuke: It's been about six months now since I was last here. But some things never change. Like the sense of foreboding I always seem to feel in this place. (It doesn't seem to be bothering Iris at all, though. She's happily reading over there...) Iris: Oh, I love this place! I always find so many interesting books here! Ryunosuke: Of course. I was forgetting that you've been here before. (The time we came here six months ago... ...when Susato-san was given the news that she was to return to Japan.) ???: Ah. I understand you wish to speak with me. Ryunosuke: Oh! L-Lord Stronghart! I trust you've been k-keeping well? Stronghart: Let's see... Since you've arrived and requested an audience, it's been four hours, thirty-two minutes and... ...twenty-six seconds. I've kept you waiting a while. My apologies. Ryunosuke: Oh no, not at all! I like nothing more than standing around, staring into space. Stronghart: ...Good to know. Ryunosuke: (...Good to know that doesn't appear to bother him at all.) Mael Stronghart, Lord Chief Justice of London. He's the man who allowed me to start practising as a defence lawyer when I arrived in Britain as a student. You need only savour the air for a moment in this grand office to understand his pre-eminent status. Stronghart: As you will be aware, the Great Exhibition of London is now underway at last. We're extremely busy as a result. Policing the grounds, guarding the new technologies, dealing with petty crime... And furthermore, as of next month, we shall open the International Forensic Science Symposium. Ryunosuke: Oh...I've not heard about that. Stronghart: Investigating authorities from forty countries around the globe will be taking part. Including from your own land. Forensic science is the future! The world must embrace it! As we're the hosting nation, I have much to do. And it is my highest priority. If others must wait for my attention as a result, so be it. Ryunosuke: (...Well, it's nice to know where I stand.) Stronghart: So...you wish to consult with me? Of course, I can very well imagine what this is about. Ryunosuke: Ah...well, um... Thank you for agreeing to this meeting, My Lord! (I want to be allowed to start working as a defence lawyer again in court. That's what brought me here today. But actually, there's something else playing on my mind, as it happens...) Iris: Runo, just take a deep breath and come out with it! After clearing all Converse options: Stronghart: Well, I must be leaving for my next engagement. I'm already...eleven hours and sixteen minutes late. ...My colleagues may be starting to fidget. Ryunosuke: E-Eleven hours late? That's...quite something. Stronghart: That meeting had already started when I arrived back here for this engagement with you. So lateness was inevitable. Time stops for no man. Ryunosuke: (I'm sure it stopped for me during those twelve solid arguments and two hundred and twenty-three reasons...) Oh, yes! Where would I find Lord van Zieks now? Stronghart: I would assume he's at his office. Ryunosuke: (Right, I'll go and ask him about the attack in person. I want to get this straight from the horse's mouth...) Stronghart: Away with you now. I'm leaving Professor Harebrayne's defence entirely in your hands. Ryunosuke: Of, of course, yes! Thank you very much, My Lord! 22nd October Prosecutor's Office Iris: Ooh! So this is the legendary Reaper's office? Ryunosuke: Yes, it appears so. Iris: Brrr, it sends a chill down your spine, doesn't it? What an amazingly deathly atmosphere! Ryunosuke: ...Oh, is that...? (That hooded figure was so still, I hadn't noticed his or her presence. I wonder who it is...?) ???: What are you doing here? Ryunosuke: Agh! Van Zieks: ......... Ryunosuke: (He's as unwelcoming as I thought he'd be. Actually, maybe even more so...) Oh, I, um... I'm glad to see you're well. Van Zieks: ...I am. Ryunosuke: ......... So...who's the person over by the wall being...punished for something or other? Van Zieks: No punishment is taking place here. Ryunosuke: Oh. Van Zieks: That's my apprentice. And he's sitting there of his own free will. Ryunosuke: I didn't know you had an apprentice. (It must be the same person who was pictured in the newspaper...) Van Zieks: He's very able in combat. ...A requisite skill for anyone under my tutelage. Ryunosuke: Are you referring to the attack on the Reaper that was reported in the papers? Van Zieks: The Reaper? I'd be interested to know the Reaper's true identity myself. Assuming, that is, such a fabled fiend genuinely inhabits our great courtrooms... After clearing all Converse options: Van Zieks: Ah yes, there's something I've been meaning to ask you... Ryunosuke: Oh! What's that? Van Zieks: That Nipponese man. Is he faring well? Ryunosuke: Sorry? Van Zieks: The one arrested twice in succession six months ago. With the stoop. And the moustache. And the jitters. Ryunosuke: Ah! Mr Natsume, you mean? Iris: ...I'm not sure he'd be very pleased to find out you identified him from that list, Runo. Ryunosuke: He's fine, thank you. In fact, I received a letter from him by international post only the other day. Van Zieks: I see. ......... Well, I think we can end our discussion there, don't you? There's little time left before tomorrow's trial. I advise you to spend it investigating the case. Ryunosuke: Yes, thank you for the advice. And for the conversation. (I can't believe he's asking after Soseki-san. After a 'Nipponese'! I'm not sure whether to feel happy about that or worried.) Iris: I never imagined that Mr Reaper would be friends with a mad scientist, did you? That's a turn-up for the books! Ryunosuke: A mad scientist? Ah, you mean Professor Harebrayne? (Yes, it might be worth quizzing the professor about his relationship with Lord van Zieks, I think.) 22nd October Local Prison, Cell 11 Ryunosuke: The warden said cell eleven. That's this one... Iris: Oh! There's someone curled up in a ball in the back corner, look! Ryunosuke: What's his name again? Professor Albert Harebrayne, wasn't it? ...Um, excuse me! Professor Harebrayne! Harebrayne: ...! Who are you? Ryunosuke: I'm Ryunosuke Naruhodo. I'm a defence lawyer. Harebrayne: A LAWYER! Ryunosuke: Agh! (Was it something I said?!) Harebrayne: A, a lawyer, you say? W-W-W-Would you be here... a-a-a-about the experiment? ARE YOU GOING TO DEFEND MY HYPOTHESIS?! Ryunosuke: Your...hypothesis? Sorry, I don't- Harebrayne: Yesterday's demonstration! That demonstration was... That magnificent demonstration was... It was an out-and-out success! By anyone's calculations! B-B-B-But despite that... ...no one listens! No lawyer believes in the science! When it's explained, they all leave...at high velocity! Haah... Ryunosuke: ......... (Now's probably not a good time to mention that your zeal made my concentration leave for a while, too...) After clearing all Converse options: Ryunosuke: So, Professor, let me just make absolutely sure I've understood you properly. The huge explosion that occurred yesterday... That was an accident, you're saying? You had no intent to harm the victim, who was in fact the sole investor in your work. Is that correct? Harebrayne: As correct as two squared is four! I swear it! Yes, it's true that the man perished in a machine of my invention. So I know that I'm far from blameless in all this. But still! I would never use my discoveries, my inventions, to take a person's life! Not in a centillion years! I'm a man of science! It's all I know! You have to believe me! Please! Do you believe me? Do you believe in my hypothesis? Science is the pursuit of truth, you know. I've always believed that. All my life! Ryunosuke: ......... I'm afraid I don't know much about science. Or your theories. But I do believe you. And I will fight to prove your innocence with all my might. I'm a man of the law! It's all I know! You have to believe me! Please! Harebrayne: ......... When I went to live in Germany after I graduated, I learnt something very important. Nationality, class, lineage...none of that matters. As long as you try your hardest, you can achieve anything. Ryunosuke: Thank you for that, Professor. Harebrayne: And thank you in advance for defending me tomorrow in court! Iris: Alright, Runo, it's time! Time to visit the Great Exhibition! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Iris: Well, that's where the incident happened, isn't it? Ryunosuke: Yes, I suppose that's true. (Time to investigate at last!) 22nd October The Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower Ryunosuke: Ugh... The showgrounds are a little too big for my liking... We've been walking around in dense crowds for two hours now, and I've felt myself swooning three times. Iris: There are a lot of people, aren't there? I've almost been trodden on three times, too! Ryunosuke: ...Be careful, won't you, Iris? Don't let go of my hand. (We've finally made it through the throngs though, by the look of it. Here we are underneath the public experimentation stage where the explosion happened yesterday.) ???: .........! ???: .........! Ryunosuke: (What's that...? I can hear voices from up on the stage. It sounds like an argument...) ???: Right, I've had it with you this time! I'm warnin' you, I'll arrest you in a minute! ???: Oh yeah? Go on then, 'Spector, give it a shot! You ain't got no evidence, an' you know it! Ryunosuke: (Wait... I know those voices.) ???: You've got a cheeky little mouth on you, young lady! But a night in the cells will teach you some manners! ???: Just try it, I dare ya! If ya want that bag o' chips rammed down yer throat! Iris: Yoo-hoo! Gregsy! What are you doing up there? Gregson: ......... Ah! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! It's you! Here! You're here! Here you are! You! Here! Your Ladyshiiip! How are you, Your Ladyship? I do hope you're well, Your Ladyship? Ryunosuke: (...Does that make her three times a lady?) Iris: I'm not well at all. It's far too busy everywhere. I wanted to ride in a balloon, but there was a three-hour queue. Gregson: Unbelievable! I'll go an' have a word for you at once, Your Ladyship! You'll be flyin' as high as a kite in no time once I pull some strings for you! Ryunosuke: Tobias Gregson, an inspector at Scotland Yard. Until recently, he was suspended from duty, but it would appear he's back in action now. He's actually quite well known, appearing as he does in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'. And for that reason, he can't say a word wrong to the stories' author, Iris. (But there are limits, surely... Or there should be!) Gregson: Watch it, sunshine! Ryunosuke: S-Sorry... Gregson: What gives, then? Don't tell me you're on this case? Ryunosuke: Yes, I'm acting for the defence. Iris: So we're here to investigate! Gregson: Hmmm... Dear me, that's the situation, is it? Ryunosuke: (Is it really that troubling?) ???: Tsk. A measly five bob? Is that all ya got? Yer a lawyer, ain't ya? Ya could stand to carry a bit more copper around in yer pockets, Mr Narra-'Oddo! Ryunosuke: Wha...? Hey! That's my last bit of spending money, that is! ???: Ya can 'ave it back, but I'll 'ave to charge ya for all the bother. Three bob. Ryunosuke: This is Gina Lestrade, a pickpocket, or 'diver', born and bred in the East End of London. In the case that led to my own suspension six months ago... ...this is the young girl I was defending in court. Gina: Wot's yer problem, eh, 'Oddo?! 'Diver'? Pickpocket? Wot's wiv all the name-callin'? You wanna bag o' chips rammed down yer throat an' all, do ya? Ryunosuke: I, I thought you were proud to be a diver, Gina? You were just arguing with Inspector Gregson about it, weren't you? I assumed you'd been up to your usual tricks here at the showground. Gina: That ain't no way to talk to a lady, 'Oddo. 'Alf a year's a long time. People can change. I'm an apprentice now. Learnin' to be a Scotland Yard detective. So you'll 'ave to call me wot everyone else does: It's Inspector Lestrade now! Ryunosuke: In... Inspector?! (That badge is homemade, surely...) Gregson: The 'inspector' part isn't entirely accurate. No one calls her that. For what it's worth, anyway. Investigatin' is off the cards for all of us. Iris: What's that supposed to mean? Gregson: Right, well, I'll be back up top. You hold the fort down here, alright? Gina: Right...sir. Ryunosuke: (This... This raises a LOT of questions!) After clearing all Converse options and examining green cloth on ground, device on ground, and large hole in glass in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower and clearing all Converse options and examining large machine in Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage: Iris: Runo, Runo, listen! Ryunosuke: What? What is it? Iris: I've been thinking... Hurley might know something, mightn't he? Ryunosuke: About what? Iris: About Mr Reaper! Ryunosuke: ...! About what happened to Lord van Zieks, you mean? (Because it sounds like something very significant occurred after he graduated from university. Something that completely changed his life.) Maybe, but I have no idea where to find Mr Sholmes at the moment. He's in the middle of some big case, isn't he? Iris: Here, this is what you need! Ryunosuke: What's this? (Some kind of entrance ticket?) 'Madame Tusspells'? Is this supposed to mean something to me? Iris: You don't know it?! It's the most popular attraction in London at the moment! It's very close to Baker Street, actually. We could go now, if you like? Ryunosuke: No no, we don't have time for visiting attractions today, Iris. We have a big trial tomorrow! Iris: But that's where Hurley is. Ryunosuke: What? At, at this popular London attraction? Iris: Yes! Ryunosuke: How is it that you know where he is? Iris: Hurley told me. But he told me to keep it a secret from you, Runo. Ryunosuke: Madame Tusspells...? (I don't see how it could be related to the case we're investigating here, but then... ...stranger things have happened. And when they happen, Mr Sholmes is usually at the heart of them.) 22nd October The Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage Ryunosuke: So that's it, is it? The machine that blew up. Iris: Ooh, it must have been a magnificent explosion! And I've seen my fair share. Ryunosuke: You've seen things like this before, you mean? Iris: Of course! Hurley's always doing experiments that end in a bang. In fact, in his own words, 'Explosions are the very essence of chemistry!' Ryunosuke: Ah...that might explain the smell of burning that frequently comes wafting up the stairs. Iris: One time, he made something that exploded with such force, it took the roof off the building! I wish you'd been there to see it, Runo! Ryunosuke: ...It's hard to get too excited about that...given that I now live in the roof. Iris: Well anyway, that's enough about that. It's time to investigate! Ryunosuke: Ah look, Inspector Gregson is over there. He seems to be deep in thought about something... whilst eyeing up the machine carefully. Iris: Really? He just looks confused to me. Ryunosuke: It ripped itself apart magnificently, didn't it? Iris: Magnificently...and mercilessly. Ryunosuke: So someone stands in the middle of the machine to be disassembled and then 'beamed' through the air... Iris: Yes, 'beamed' not 'blasted'. That's the point. Ryunosuke: (Yes, that part's crucial, really.) Is something like that even possible, though, Iris? Iris: Oh, Runo. I'm just a child. How should I know? Ryunosuke: (A child when it suits you, you mean...) Iris: From what I can tell, I think if you were to pull this lever here- Gregson: STOOOOOOOOOOOOP! Don't touch that! Iris: Ah ha ha! That was practically instantaneous kinesis the way you flew over just now, Gregsy! Gregson: Please, Your Ladyship... I didn't mean to startle you, but I can't let you touch anything up here. Iris: So sorry. You can have some of my latest special blend to make up for it. Gregson: *Glug* *Glug glug glug* Aaah! Wonderful! This stuff really is wonderful! Ryunosuke: (It's just like old times, this is...) We're representing Professor Harebrayne in court tomorrow, Inspector. So we should be allowed to examine the scene! Gregson: Hah! Listen, sunshine, even I'm not allowed to touch anythin' up here! It's that blasted Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act to blame. It's drivin' me potty! Ryunosuke: Oh yes, that special dispensation... (The professor mentioned that, too.) Gregson: More red tape's all we need. I dunno what the government thinks it's playin' at sometimes. Iris: But...we're allowed to just look, aren't we? Gregson: Eh? Iris: Surely that's alright...isn't it, Gregsy? Gregson: ......... 'Course, Your Ladyship! Anythin' you say, Your Ladyship! But please don't get your dainty hands dirty, will you? Iris: Don't worry. We wouldn't dream of touching anything, would we, Runo? Ryunosuke: (She really knows how to get what she wants...) After clearing all Converse options and examining green cloth on ground, device on ground, and large hole in glass in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower and clearing all Converse options and examining large machine in Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage: Gregson: Right, are you done here, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Sorry? Gregson: Isn't it about time you were leavin'? Or rather...it IS about time you were leavin'! That lot are here now. Iris: That lot? Gregson: The Forensic Investigation Team. They'll be givin' me the heave-ho in a minute, too. Iris: Oh dear. Poor Gregsy. Here! Have another cup of my special blend to cheer you up! Gregson: *Glug* *Glug glug glug* Aaah! That hit the spot! Yup, hits it every time! Ryunosuke: (Well, at least I've seen the scene with my own eyes. It looks like this is as far as we're going to get with our investigations here at least...) Iris: I've been thinking... Hurley might know something, mightn't he? Ryunosuke: About what? Iris: About Mr Reaper! Ryunosuke: ...! About what happened to Lord van Zieks, you mean? (Because it sounds like something very significant occurred after he graduated from university. Something that completely changed his life.) Maybe, but I have no idea where to find Mr Sholmes at the moment. He's in the middle of some big case, isn't he? Iris: Here, this is what you need! Ryunosuke: What's this? (Some kind of entrance ticket?) 'Madame Tusspells'? Is this supposed to mean something to me? Iris: You don't know it?! It's the most popular attraction in London at the moment!

But he told me to keep it a secret from you, Runo. Ryunosuke: Madame Tusspells...? (I don't see how it could be related to the case we're investigating here, but then... ...stranger things have happened. And when they happen, Mr Sholmes is usually at the heart of them.) Prosecutor's Office Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy 22nd October Madame Tusspells Museum of Waxworks Ryunosuke: Wh-What is this place? L-Look at all these t-terrifying scenes! But why are all the p-people so still? (Guillotines... Ruthless murderers... I know what I'll be dreaming about tonight.) Iris: They're all wax models. They're amazingly realistic, aren't they? What do you think, Runo? Shocked? Ryunosuke: W-W-WAX MODELS?! .........AAAAAAAAAGH! I, I read about d-dead bodies and wax once...in a m-magazine about strange phenomena. Depending on how c-c-corpses are kept after death, p-parts of them can turn to wax, apparently. It's c-called a...adi...adip... Adipocere! Iris: ...Stop talking about creepy things like that, Runo. You're scaring me. Anyway, adipocere doesn't form readily, you know. It's only in very specif- Ryunosuke: AAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Iris: What now? Ryunosuke: I've, I've just remembered something else I read, in another m-magazine about strange phenomena. There was an old lady - maybe a w-witch - who used to pour molten wax over c-corpses and put them on display. Iris: None of the exhibits in here are real. They're all entirely man-made replicas. Ryunosuke: They can't be! Do you really expect me to believe that? Just look at them! Iris: Oh! Ryunosuke: There's no way anybody could make models of people that are this realistic! And...they're all such gruesome scenes... .........Wait. Iris: What is it? Ryunosuke: Oh...no... (I must be seeing things...) Ryunosuke: It's...it's... ...the great detective, Mr Herlock Sholmes! (Mr Sholmes has his own wax statue in here? Really?) Iris: Well he is world-famous, after all! Ryunosuke: It's an uncanny resemblance, isn't it? It makes my skin crawl to look at it... Iris: I know! But look, Runo. You can kick this Hurley, and he doesn't move a muscle! Ryunosuke: You can't go around kicking the exhibits, Iris! .........Wait. It, it just moved, I'm sure. And not just a little bit, either! Iris: Hm? Really? Did it? Ryunosuke: And look closely... ...there are beads of sweat on the face...of this waxwork... model... ......... Ryunosuke: ......... Sh-Shall we move on, Iris? ...Over there, look! There's a great murder scene to enjoy! Much more appealing. Sholmes: Sholmes: My dear fellow! I take exception to your recoiling in such a manner, as if you've seen something truly abhorrent! Ryunosuke: Mr...Mr Sholmes! (I knew it!) Sholmes: Iris, what possessed you?! I strictly forbade you from divulging my temporary waxwork secret to Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: Temporary waxwork? What do you mean? Sholmes: And that kick! Could you not have exercised a little more restraint? You winded me! Iris: But Runo has something he needs to ask you. Sholmes: Ah...a question? Iris: And I thought you'd probably be getting bored, too. So here we are! Sholmes: Hm... Well, I can't deny that your timing was impeccable. A mere two minutes more being stationary like that... ...and my great brain, upon which all my success has been built, would have turned to wax! Ryunosuke: ...Thank goodness we arrived in time. Sholmes: Indeed. In many ways, the pair of you just saved the world from an unimaginable loss! Iris: Oh, Hurley! You do like to talk nonsense, don't you? Ryunosuke: (He could know something, it's true. About Lord van Zieks, and what happened in the past to change him.) Sholmes: Now that you're here, let's take our time. How can I be of assistance? For you're in luck. I'm suddenly quite taken with the idea of conversing! Ryunosuke: Oh...well, actually, I'm in quite a hurry. Sholmes: And if my eyes don't deceive me... ...I believe something is afoot within the walls of this very museum. A most fascinating case, if I'm not mistaken. Ryunosuke: Really? Sholmes: Moreover... ...I have a strong suspicion that it is related to the matter about which you've come to me now. Ryunosuke: (But...how could it be?) Sholmes: We shall speak again presently, my dear fellow. But for now, I must return to my work. Ryunosuke: (What, back to being a temporary waxwork exhibit?) Sholmes: ......... Well? What is it you'd like to ask me, then? Ryunosuke: Um. Actually, it's... It's about Lord van Zieks. Sholmes: Ah, our friend Mr Reaper. How did you find him? Well, I trust? And so I filled Mr Sholmes in about everything I'd learnt. About Lord van Zieks... About Professor Harebrayne... And about the strange coincidence that they had been at university together. Ryunosuke: So I'm wondering what it was that happened to make Lord van Zieks such a different person. Iris: I was sure that you'd know, Hurley. Sholmes: ......... Ryunosuke: You said there was something going on here in this exhibit hall before. That something was afoot. And that you believed it was related to what I wanted to ask you about. Sholmes: ......... Ryunosuke: Um, Mr Sholmes...? (He's suddenly clammed up.) Sholmes: Well, it seems we've reached the unavoida- ???: Greetings... Ryunosuke: Oh! Ah...hello. (Where did she appear from? And what's she wearing? Could she look any more mysterious?) ???: I hope...you are appreciating my museum? Ryunosuke: Sorry? Have we...? Mr Sholmes, do you know this- (Not again!) Tusspells: My apologies. I am Esmeralda Tusspells. This is my museum of waxwork. Ryunosuke: Wha... You... You're THE Madame Tusspells? Tusspells: Bien sûr. Though only twenty-six years young, I might add. Ryunosuke: ...Is that significant somehow? Tusspells: I'm a 'madame' in name only. It adds a certain...je ne sais quoi. Ryunosuke: Right... Tusspells: Firstly, I must apologise for my waxworks. Or rather, one waxwork in particular. Ryunosuke: (That'll be Mr Sholmes, then.) Tusspells: I was led to believe he was a great detective, but he seems...unable to settle. Next time you move from your designated exhibit...there WILL be toil and trouble. Iris: She sounds deadly serious. Ryunosuke: (That's a problem. How am I supposed to ask Mr Sholmes about Lord van Zieks now?) Iris: Let's not forget what Hurley said before. About something being afoot right here in the museum, I mean. Ryunosuke: Yes, I know, but... Iris: I'm so curious! I want to know what's happening here! Ryunosuke: (Haven't we got enough on our plate already?!) Ryunosuke: Um, I wonder...could I ask you something? Tusspells: Bien sûr... Ryunosuke: I'm just curious. Is anything going on in the museum at the moment. [sic] Some kind of incident, perhaps? Tusspells: ......... Whoever suggested such a thing to you? Ryunosuke: Oh, well, it was... ...your temporary waxwork over there who mentioned it to me a little- Oh! (He's disappeared!) ???: ...A wax model is a work of art. Not some tawdry object for trade. Ryunosuke: Ah! Th-There you are! Tusspells: Leaving the exhibit again when you should be working? ...Do you wish to be melted down? Sholmes: My dear Madame Tusspells, save your reprimands. There are more pressing concerns. The wax can wait. It's our ideas about your current problem we must throw into the melting pot instead! Tusspells: ...! Sholmes: Personally, I would advise you not to involve the police. Tusspells: Why ever not?! Ryunosuke: (She's turned as white as a sheet...) Sholmes: Because you have at your disposal a great detective, whose services you may employ for a mere fifty shillings. Though please be aware that I prefer- No, I insist upon payment in advance! Tusspells: ......... ...Very well. Let us see if the great detective is able to live up to his name, shall we? Sholmes: Before I engage my analytical processes, I must ask you to clarify something. What, pray, is behind the curtain? Tusspells: That is the Tusspells Special Exhibit. There is an extra charge to see it. Sholmes: Ah, the 'special' exhibit in the House of Horrors... It must depict a special killer then, I presume. Would you be so kind as to draw back the curtain, I wonder? Tusspells: Ah! Absolument non! There is nothing amiss behind there! Sholmes: Nothing amiss, madame? What about the arm protruding ominously from under the curtain? Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: I strongly encourage you to allow me to see what lies beyond, before the situation worsens. Tusspells: ......... Yes, very well. I will draw back the curtains. ...But only a soupçon. Sholmes: I must confess, I peeked behind the curtain earlier. The Tusspells Special Exhibit is a very bleak graveyard scene indeed. And yet somewhat surprisingly... ...the waxwork killer one would expect is nowhere to be seen. What does strike one, however... ...is the portly gentleman lying peacefully on his back on the floor. Ryunosuke: Well, well then perhaps, Mr Sholmes... ...that man on the floor is the ruthless killer himself! Sholmes: I'm afraid not, my dear fellow. He's a perfectly ordinary London gentleman. Not even a waxwork, in fact. Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: As skilfully made as these waxworks are, they are always distinguishable from real humans. So, allow me to present my two conclusions. The first... ...is that a sizeable business transaction has been taking place in this special exhibit. Tusspells: Why...? Why would you say that? Sholmes: And the second... ...is that the aforementioned transaction is linked to a serious crime! Tusspells: AAAAAAH! Ryunosuke: (She looks as pale as candle wax...) Tusspells: I, I don't understand... Sholmes: So, Madame Tusspells, as you've agreed to my fee... ...you shall now have the pleasure of seeing this famously great detective - and temporary exhibit - at work. The Great Deduction The game is afoot! Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Sholmes: To begin with, we must ask ourselves what exactly is afoot here in this museum? The answer is revealed by the bundle of banknotes protruding so helpfully from your bag. In my estimation, some...two hundred pounds. Tusspells: That, that is all my own money! Sholmes: So what does this large sum of money reveal? Ah, not as much as the involuntary glance you cast, it would seem, Madame Tusspells. Yes, the answer lies where your eyes now fall. The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice! 'Waxwork for sale'? Your business has hit hard times, it would seem. In short... ...you sold the infamous killer - the centrepiece of your special exhibit - for the sum of two hundred pounds! Tusspells: Nooooooooon! Sholmes: Now...let us explore the next curiosity with which we are presented. Who is the portly gentleman stretched out so peacefully on the floor? Tusspells: ......... Sholmes: It would appear the man has suffered a severe shock. The cause of which...is clearly known to you. Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: Unfortunately, madame, keeping secrets does not appear to be your forte. What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds! It would appear that you twisted this gentleman around your little finger most effectively. Tusspells: What are you suggesting?! Sholmes: He rashly agreed to purchase the waxwork for the sum of two hundred pounds. Only when he came to hand the money over, did it occur to him what an extortionate amount he was paying. But the money was no longer in his hands. And the result? The scene we see before us. He collapsed in shock. Yes, the killer in this special exhibit fetched a killer price! We can only pray that the gentleman's dreams are not plagued with regret... Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Conclusion Sold for cash Topic 2 Waxwork Location Sholmes: The question that arises then, is what has become of the waxwork that changed hands? Let us consider that problem for a moment. Tusspells: You, you cannot possibly... Sholmes: What immediately strikes me about this conundrum, is the young man standing over there. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief. Such as is worn by policemen as a secret sign to fellow members of the force that a crime is being perpetrated. Yes, this young man is an undercover policeman, currently investigating this museum. I know him well, in fact. It's Sergeant John Clay. Tusspells: What are you talking about? Sholmes: The man's quite a celebrity. He received triple accolades at last year's policing awards. Tusspells: But... Sholmes: Next we turn our attention to the old man sat before him with the particularly unsightly visage. I've been watching closely and he hasn't moved a muscle. Almost, in fact...as if he were a waxwork. Tusspells: Ah! But, but you... Sholmes: Your reaction only confirms my suspicions, madame. I noticed it at once, of course... Observe! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag! 'Thruppence'...? A tragically low price, you might say. Though perhaps the going rate for ageing waxworks riddled with cracks. And yet you sold it to the portly gentleman for an exorbitant two hundred pounds! The sort of plucky behaviour that's sure to attract the attention of Scotland Yard... Isn't that so, madame? Tusspells: I, I do not... Sholmes: Yes, the waxwork you sold has already been seized by the police and remains in their custody as we speak! The old man must be reunited with his grave in the special exhibit, and not a moment too soon! Topic 2 Waxwork Location Conclusion Discovered already Sholmes: Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this horrifying puzzle! Ryunosuke: ......... Iris: ......... Tusspells: ......... Sholmes: I see I've stunned you all into silence. Iris: You have, Hurley, you have. And you've obviously upset this young lady in the process. Her cauldron looks awfully hot... Ryunosuke: Um...if I could just bring up one point, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: Ah! The notorious Naruhodo 'one point'! I'm all ears, my dear fellow! Ryunosuke: According to your deduction, then, the special exhibit featured this old policeman. So...that would mean that he's the particularly ruthless murderer, wouldn't it? Sholmes: ......... The killer policeman, Ottermole. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: It was a mysterious series of murders that rattled the capital only last year. The police rushed to the scene every time, only to find the culprit had disappeared into the aether. Iris: And it turned out the culprit was a policeman himself! A senior officer by the name of Ottermole! Ryunosuke: So you mean that's who the sinister-looking old man there is supposed to be? Sholmes: Indeed. It is a particularly grim face, is it not? Unforgettable, in fact. Yes, I remember that odious countenance only too well. Ryunosuke: But is two hundred pounds a lot of money for a wax model? Sholmes: It would be enough to afford one of the latest steam carriages, if that puts things in perspective? Ryunosuke: S-So...it is quite a lot then. Tusspells: ......... Is there anything else you wish to add? Before I melt you down. Ryunosuke: (That bubbling wax is looking more and more ominous...) Iris: Ugh...the smell of all that molten wax is starting to worry me. Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes did more or less just accuse her to her face, so... I think I might have to call on your assistance here, Iris, if that's alright? To make some minor corrections to the great detective's great deductions... Iris: Of course it's alright! We'll soon set things straight! Ryunosuke: Well...let's get started then, shall we? Before Madame Tusspells vents her anger! Sholmes: Just what I was waiting to hear, my dear fellow! So, Madame Tusspells, in accordance with our agreement... ...you shall now have the pleasure of seeing this famously great detective - and temporary exhibit - at work. Course Correction Hold it, Mr Sholmes! Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Conclusion Sold for cash Sholmes: To begin with, we must ask ourselves what exactly is afoot here in this museum? The answer is revealed by the bundle of banknotes protruding so helpfully from your bag. In my estimation, some...two hundred pounds. Tusspells: That, that is all my own money! Sholmes: So what does this large sum of money reveal? Ah, not as much as the involuntary glance you cast, it would seem, Madame Tusspells. Yes, the answer lies where your eyes now fall. The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice! Ryunosuke: She definitely looked in this direction, it's true. Iris: But I'm not sure she'd sell any of her waxworks, even for two hundred pounds. Ryunosuke: Oh? Iris: She must pour her heart and soul into making them, don't you think? Over and above the wax. If it were me, I wouldn't sell them for anything. Ryunosuke: ......... (For that much money, I would! ...But it sounds like that makes me a bad person.) W-Well anyway... ...I wonder if the two hundred pounds could have some other significance. Iris: Let's follow that furtive glance again and see if there's anything else that could explain it! The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice! Iris: Judging by appearances... ...this man and the two hundred pounds are in no way related at all. Ryunosuke: (The poor man was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, it seems...) But there's no doubt that Madame Tusspells did react to what Mr Sholmes said. The way she automatically looked over this way must tell us something, I'm sure. Iris: ...Then let's have more of a look around! Ryunosuke: The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that ransom note! Sholmes: Quite so. And we must congratulate these criminals on their inventiveness, abducting a waxwork. Tusspells: Agh! Sholmes: Two hundred pounds is no small ransom fee. Yet you clearly intend to pay it. Tusspells: The model in question has...special importance. So I put together all the money I have... Sholmes: In summary, then! The two hundred pounds you have in your handbag...is ransom money! Now...let us explore the next curiosity with which we are presented. Who is the portly gentleman stretched out so peacefully on the floor? Tusspells: ......... Sholmes: It would appear the man has suffered a severe shock. The cause of which...is clearly known to you. Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: Unfortunately, madame, keeping secrets does not appear to be your forte. What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds! Ryunosuke: So if the waxwork was kidnapped, where does that leave us in terms of who this man is? Iris: We could just ask him when he comes around. Ryunosuke: ...I think the point of this exercise is to understand the beauty of the deduction process, Iris. Iris: Yes, you're right. Hurley's trying so hard, we mustn't let him down. Ryunosuke: Well, there's little doubt that he suffered a shock. That much seems clear. But in that case, what's Madame Tusspells trying to hide? Let's have a closer look around... What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds! Ryunosuke: It must have been a considerable blow to have knocked the man unconscious. Iris: Yes, he looks like a very sturdy man, doesn't he? Ooh! Perhaps he was struck on the back of the head with something hard?! Ryunosuke: ...Don't sound so excited about it, Iris. (Whatever did leave the man out cold like that, it must have been quite something...) Ryunosuke: What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the waxwork hand! Sholmes: Indeed. With a solid waxwork limb, one could deliver a very substantial blow. Tusspells: How, how could you...? Ryunosuke: The hand protruding from the bottom of your cape... It ought to be a right hand, but closer inspection reveals that in fact, it's a left hand. Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: And somewhat masculine as well. In other words, it does not belong to you, madame. It is the hand of a waxwork model! Tusspells: KYAAAAAAH! Some of the visitors to my museum can be...troublesome. They meddle with the exhibits and cause damage. Ryunosuke: So you mean, that arm...? Tusspells: Yes. This gentleman saw fit to try to remove it as a souvenir. Sholmes: Hm, no small keepsake. Ryunosuke: Like taking a whole branch of a cherry tree when you go to view the blossoms... Tusspells: I am afraid I had to teach the man a lesson. Ryunosuke: You confronted the man and tried to take the arm back. Sholmes: And the result? The scene we see before us. He was knocked unconscious. A point we may need to revisit later. But for the time being, we have our conclusion: Yes, the killer in this special exhibit has been kidnapped! Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Conclusion Sold for cash Kidnapped! Solved Topic 2 Waxwork Location Conclusion Discovered already Sholmes: The question that arises then, is what has become of the waxwork that changed hands? Let us consider that problem for a moment. Tusspells: You, you cannot possibly... Sholmes: What immediately strikes me about this conundrum, is the young man standing over there. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief. Ryunosuke: According to Mr Sholmes... ...the yellow neckerchief is a sign to other policemen that some crime is underway. Iris: A way of communicating with his colleagues without revealing his identity, yes. It's a secret that's closely guarded by Scotland Yard. Ryunosuke: ...That Mr Sholmes didn't hesitate to give away. Iris: Well, uncovering secrets is in any true detective's nature, of course. Ryunosuke: Right... Anyway, judging from Madame Tusspells's reaction to Mr Sholmes's deduction... ...I think perhaps we might not have identified the man quite correctly. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief. Ryunosuke: According to Mr Sholmes, this young gentleman is actually a policeman in plain clothes. And the secret scarf sign appears to back that idea up. It does seem plausible. Iris: But Madame Tusspells's reaction was strange. Which must mean... Ryunosuke: ...That we haven't got to the bottom of who or what this man really is yet. Ryunosuke: Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his shoulder stub. Sholmes: No such boneless human walks this earth. Of that, I can assure you. In other words, the man standing here - the young Sergeant John Clay... ...is in fact, defying all odds, a waxwork model! Ryunosuke: I seem to remember it was you who concluded he was a real person in the first place, Mr Sholmes. Tusspells: He has become quite a celebrity in London, being the winner of no less than three policing awards last year. I simply had to make a model of the man. Sholmes: Naturally! What other explanation could there be? Ryunosuke: And it was this detective's arm that was pulled off by the man on the floor in the special exhibit, wasn't it? Sholmes: Next we turn our attention to the old man sat before him with the particularly unsightly visage. I've been watching closely and he hasn't moved a muscle. Almost, in fact...as if he were a waxwork. Tusspells: Ah! But, but you... Sholmes: Your reaction only confirms my suspicions, madame. I noticed it at once, of course... Observe! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag! Ryunosuke: A killer policeman...called Ottermole, was it? Was he well known? Iris: It was all over the papers last year. But I can't say I know what he looks like. It's a very low price, though. Thruppence isn't much money. Ryunosuke: (Only enough for a few measly hours of gas in Mr Garrideb's delightful lodgings, in fact...) So this is the special killer taken from the special exhibit...is it? The waxwork that somebody stole from the museum and tried to ransom for two hundred pounds... ...is this crusty old killer policeman Ottermole? Really? Iris: Perhaps we should have a good look around again and see if another idea crops up! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag! Iris: If we just poured a little bit of molten wax on him, we'd soon find out if he was real or not. Ryunosuke: Yes...you never know, there may be another way. We've already come this far, so maybe we should stick to logical deductions, don't you think? Iris: Alright, if that's the way you want to do it, then we should examine him in more detail. Ryunosuke: (If anyone saw, they'd think we were obsessed with the elderly...) Ryunosuke: The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious twitch! Sholmes: Even the most realistic waxworks do not exhibit a twitch. In other words, this splendid old man is in fact a genuine member of Scotland Yard! Ryunosuke: ...Slight shift in your choice of adjectives, then... Sholmes: And there you have it! Well, Madame Tusspells? Tusspells: Well what? It was me who contacted the police and demanded that someone come in the first place. He is clearly fatigued. He is sound asleep. Ryunosuke: But then, what's this tag about showing a price of three pence? Sholmes: No doubt the price tag of the muffler, which the old bobby purchased recently at a local market. And I presume you've observed the scarf tied around his arm? Does that not strike you, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Yes! The secret sign used by detectives to show that some criminal activity is currently underway. Tusspells: Of course. Because, as you know, there has been just such criminal activity happening here. As you deduced from the very beginning, detective. Sholmes: So, it would seem that we finally arrive at the truth. Ryunosuke: The waxwork of the especially ruthless killer from the special exhibit has been kidnapped. Sholmes: And Scotland Yard are already investigating. But the model's whereabouts remain a mystery. Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this horrifying puzzle! Topic 2 Waxwork Location Conclusion Discovered already Still a mystery! Solved Deduction CompleteElementary! Tusspells: All sorts of people visit my museum here. Men and women, young and old. Sometimes they drop in just for a short time on their way back from the pub. I welcome them all. But if anyone tries to damage my exhibits... I do not take it lightly. Anyway... ...your great deduction was even more enchanting than I had been led to believe. Sholmes: It was a pleasure, my dear madame. I'm gratified that you enjoyed the spectacle. And as for your 'rough customer', I've no doubt he'll regain consciousness shortly and return home. What concerns me more... ...is the waxwork from the special display...if it was indeed genuinely abducted? Tusspells: ......... Yes. Tragically, it was... Sholmes: Then I would ask you to recount to us the events surrounding the stolen waxwork. In as much detail as possible, if you please. Tusspells: ...Very well. But after I have told you what I know, I must insist that you return to your work. Sholmes: ......... The talents of a great detective could be put to better use, I feel, but as you wish... Tusspells: It was a series of gruesome murders that had all of London gripped in terror a decade ago. After five victims were killed, the man was arrested, and put to death. Sholmes: And now he's immortalised here in wax for all Londoners to admire and enjoy! Though of course, he happens to be absent at present, on account of the abduction. Ryunosuke: But I don't understand. How is all this related to Lord van Zieks? Sholmes: ......... You must first understand, my dear fellow, why it is that the Professor earnt such infamy. It was due to the victims he chose. Some of Whitehall's finest. Iris: What do you mean, Hurley? Sholmes: Those murdered by the Professor were some of the highest members of the British aristocracy. Members of the nobility. Even royalty. It sent shockwaves through the country's administration. Ryunosuke: Members of the... Ah! Wait! Of course! What Professor Harebrayne said! Lord van Zieks is from a family with noble blood! Iris: Oh gosh! Sholmes: It was the fifth victim that led to the Professor's arrest. The last of the killer's prey was a young noble by the name of... ...Klint van Zieks. Ryunosuke: No! I don't believe it! Van Zieks?! Sholmes: I'm sure you can piece together the rest for yourself. In the wake of his older brother's murder, the young Barok pursued a career as a prosecutor. And eventually...became the Reaper we know today. Ryunosuke: ......... I had no idea Lord van Zieks had such a tragic past... Sholmes: Well, I'm afraid that's all I can say on the matter. For the time being at least. After all, I have work to do... ...as a waxwork exhibit. Tusspells: I am afraid I shall have to excuse myself as well. Ryunosuke: Oh, yes, of course. It's, it's been a pleasure. Thank you. ???: ...Well, none of the predicted scenarios I've been analysing involved you coming to visit me here. Harebrayne: It's been too long, it really has. I'm delighted to see you, Barok. Van Zieks: It's been ten years. And here we are, meeting in a prison of all places. Harebrayne: I can't forgive myself for what happened to Mr Asman! I just can't! I, I still can't believe it could happen... Van Zieks: ......... Tomorrow the court will decide. Harebrayne: Yes! I have a young Eastern man acting for my defence. He seems reliable enough, though. It, it was an accident. A terrible accident. He, he, he assures me he can prove it! Van Zieks: I must warn you... Harebrayne: Oh, I know, I know! I've heard already. You're going to be prosecuting, aren't you? Van Zieks: ...Yes. Harebrayne: ......... Since I returned to England, I've heard lots of stories. Barok, are you really...? Van Zieks: What? Harebrayne: ......... Never mind. I know that you have my best interests at heart. Van Zieks: My friend is on trial. ...I wouldn't entrust it to anybody else. Harebrayne: Of course. I fully understand. Thank you, Barok. Van Zieks: Until tomorrow, then. I'll see you in court. To be continued...23rd October, 8:52 a.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber Ryunosuke: (I can't believe it's been six months since I was last allowed to work in court. And now here I am, back at the Old Bailey...) Harebrayne: Ah! M-Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: Good morning, Professor Harebrayne. Harebrayne: I, I don't understand! It doesn't make any sense! The atmospheric pressure in here is off the charts! I've never felt anything like it! It's, it's crushing me! Ryunosuke: I feel it every time I'm here. That...gravity. Harebrayne: Well, this is Britain's highest court... But are you telling me it's filled with some kind of device that can actually control air pressure?! Ryunosuke: ......... I think it's probably all in the mind. Harebrayne: Ah. Yes, well...you won't let me down, will you, Mr Naruhodo? I'm counting on you in today's trial...to save my life! To save the secret of my super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine from being made public! Ryunosuke: Yes, I understand. (I know what I have to do. I have to establish that the explosion two days ago was nothing more than an unfortunate accident.) Harebrayne: Well, I'm sure there's nothing to worry about, really. Justice will prevail! ???: My commiserations, Mr Naruhodo. You appear to have been lumbered with a most tiresome case here. Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes! I didn't expect to see you here. Iris: That was very mean, Runo, leaving me alone at home with Hurley. It took me at least an hour to wake him! Harebrayne: Ah... Oh... Ah... Is it...? Are you...? HEEEEEERLOCK SHOOOOOOLMES?! Sholmes: Indeed, sir. I am he. Heeeeeerlock Shoooooolmes. Harebrayne: Oh, I've heard all about your exploits, even whilst living in Germany. Iris: Ah yes. Randst Magazine is on sale in Germany, too. Harebrayne: This month's instalment was sublime! Your deduction in 'The Adventure of Silver Blaze' was wonderful! Sholmes: Ah yes, a memorable case indeed. It concerned a snake, I seem to recall. Iris: No, that was 'The Speckled Band.' Ryunosuke: Well, thank you for coming. I do appreciate your support. Sholmes: I'm sorry to disappoint you, my dear fellow, but I'm afraid I can't stay. Ryunosuke: Oh. Sholmes: I have urgent business at Madame Tusspells. Ryunosuke: You mean...your waxwork job? Sholmes: No no, the waxwork abduction, of course. Madame has engaged my services. Ryunosuke: Ah, so you're trying to get to the bottom of that ransom note, are you? Sholmes: The week's wages depend on it! ...As does the safe return of the waxwork, naturally. As such, I intend to give it my undivided attention. Ryunosuke: Oh, well, never mind then. I understand. Sholmes: Of course, with my skills of observation and reasoning, resolving the matter will be as easy as proverbial pie. I shall return forthwith. For until I solve the case, I shall have no money to afford a pie of any description. Iris: Ooh, then you must absolutely give it your full attention, Hurley! Sholmes: Quite, Iris, quite. But life is riddled with irony, you know. Whenever I give something my full attention, I have a quite insatiable desire for a pie. One of the universe's intractable mysteries, you might say. Harebrayne: Oh yes! Quite! Definitely! Absolutely! I totally understand! Ryunosuke: (...Is someone a little starstruck?) Sholmes: I wish you the very best of luck, Professor Harebrayne. Harebrayne: Oh! Ah! Ooh! Why, thank you! Sholmes: Before I depart, Mr Naruhodo...a word in your ear, if you please? Ryunosuke: ...? What's this about? Sholmes: As you have remarkably little grounding in science, I feel I ought to inform you... As compelling as this 'super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis' hypothesis may be... ...a practical implementation, such as was attempted by the professor at the Great Exhibition, is quite impossible. Ryunosuke: But, but the professor said the demonstration was a success! Sholmes: Yes, it would appear that he fervently believes it was. Iris: I've read Professor Bunnybrain's paper about it, too, Runo. And I have to say... ...I'm sure it can't be done. It could barely be done theoretically, let alone practically. Ryunosuke: (So he's completely barking up the wrong tree?) But how could an experiment that had no possibility of succeeding in fact succeed? That's contradictory. Sholmes: And it's that contradiction that will be at the heart of the trial, I've no doubt. Ryunosuke: (What's that supposed to mean?) Sholmes: Now, I must hurry along. I wish you the best of luck, my dear fellow. Iris: See you later, Hurley! Well, it looks like you're on your own today, Runo. But chin up! You can do it! Ryunosuke: Oh! What about you, Iris? Iris: Ah, no, I'm afraid I can't help. I have something I need to do. Ryunosuke: ...I see. Iris: Hehe! It's going to be a big surprise for you when you find out what it is! Ryunosuke: Haah... (That sounds ominous...) Bailiff: Counsel for the Defence! And the defendant! Court is about to be in session. Make your way into the courtroom at once! Ryunosuke: We're on our way! (An experiment that the laws of science say can't possibly succeed... ...and a scientist who's convinced that it did. That's the riddle you have to unlock here, Ryunosuke! That's the key to this case!) 23rd October, 9:10 a.m. The Old Bailey Courtroom Judge: In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session. We are sitting today for the public trial of Professor Albert Harebrayne. I now call upon the counsels for the prosecution and defence to declare their willingness to proceed. Van Zieks: The prosecution is ready. Ryunosuke: The defence is... The defence is ready, My Lord! ......... (I'm six months out of practice. And what's more... ...I'm without Susato-san today.) ......... (Ugh... Is it just my imagination, or does the air in here feel even more oppressive than usual?) Judge: So... ...I must say I recollect the victim of this case all too well. Mr Odie Asman. Van Zieks: Mr Asman was well known as a financier...though that was merely a front for his diverse criminal activities. Judge: It was only a month ago that the man appeared in court prosecuted by you, Lord van Zieks. But the jury unanimously found him not guilty. Ryunosuke: (Because every member of the jury had been bribed, by the sound of it. These powerful London criminals are prepared to go to extreme lengths to keep their freedom.) Judge: But two days ago, on 21st October, Mr Asman met his end. The work of the Reaper, was it? Van Zieks: ......... If that is how Your Lordship would describe divine retribution... But the fact remains that Mr Asman's death... ...was a direct result of the actions of the accused, Professor Harebrayne. Judge: Very well, then. Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... You have been selected at random to represent the will of the people. Are the six of you ready to fulfil your societal duty? Juror No. 1: I'm most gratified to have been selected to carry out this important civic duty, My Lord. Juror No. 2: To have a man's fate in the palm of one's hand... Oh gosh! Oh golly! It sends shivers down my spine. Juror No. 3: Science experiments, magic, conjuring tricks, courtroom trials... All are nothing more than performances. Juror No. 4: Any spurious scholar that defiles the reputation of science deserves to hang! Juror No. 5: Um, we 'ave to listen to what's said on both sides 'the fence, and um...then settle on one... That's it, isn't it? Juror No. 6: ......... Wasn't like this in my day! Wasn't like this at all! Ryunosuke: ......... (That's...that's... ...the police killer Ottermole look-alike...again. And he's as exhausted as ever, it seems.) Judge: Now, as I'm sure you are all aware... ...the incident we are here to judge today tragically took place at the Great Exhibition, shortly after its opening. Van Zieks: Though the death toll could have been far worse. With the exception of the victim, no one was killed. Nevertheless, the dream of the science being exhibited rapidly turned into a nightmare for the spectators. Judge: A tragic turn of events. And as such, the eyes of all London- No, of the whole world will be on this trial. It is our duty to reach a swift and just conclusion, I feel. So...your opening statement please, Lord van Zieks. Van Zieks: At the heart of this incident... ...is technology never before demonstrated anywhere in the world. Judge: One of science's latest developments, I take it? The government is keen to capitalise on the Great Exhibition to improve Britain's technological advantage. Van Zieks: The technology being demonstrated by the accused was described as 'super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis'. Judge: Good Lord! Ryunosuke: It's designed to 'disassemble' human subjects using extremely high-voltage electricity... ...and 'beam' them instantly to another location where they are subsequently reassembled. Judge: Is...is such a thing even within the realms of possibility? Juror No. 1: Well I don't believe it, that's for sure. Juror No. 2: Disassembling people with electricity? My goodness! How shocking! Juror No. 4: Hah! The whole idea is absurd! The hypothesis would never stand up to scrutiny! Judge: Sir, I believe you are a fellow of the Royal Society, are you not? An expert in your field? Juror No. 4: I am, and my word on the matter can be considered final. Instantaneous kinesis is poppycock! Ryunosuke: (So this expert and Mr Sholmes are in agreement. It's impossible...) Judge: What is the prosecution's view on the matter? Van Zieks: ......... The prosecution would assert... ...that the accused's instantaneous kinesis demonstration was a success. Ryunosuke: What?! Juror No. 4: What rot! Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Van Zieks: The professor's hypothesis is currently under investigation by the British government. If it is deemed to have merit, a substantial research grant would be made available. The accused made use of the invention built on his new hypothesis to take Mr Asman's life... ...in order to be the sole benefactor of the grant. Ryunosuke: But, but... Van Zieks: This disastrous demonstration was no accident. It was carefully designed from the outset to end the life of the victim. Judge: Thank you, Lord van Zieks. The prosecution's stance is clear. But you will now bring forth witnesses to substantiate your claims. Van Zieks: ...Gladly, My Lord. Bailiff! Show the first witnesses to the stand! Van Zieks: Witnesses, state your names and occupations for the court. Gregson: Yes, sir! Tobias Gregson, Detective Inspector at Scotland Yard's homicide division. I was on duty at the demonstration on the day in question and in charge of the followin' investigation. Harebrayne: ......... Albert Harebrayne! S-S-Scientist! Van Zieks: You were born in England, but have been carrying out research in Germany in recent years. Correct? Harebrayne: Yes. Yes, that's right. After graduating from university here in Britain, I went to work in Germany...and made an amazing discovery! Which is what brought me back! I had to demonstrate my incredible hypothesis at the Great Exhibition! Gregson: What you demonstrated was incredible alright. An incredible explosion! Harebrayne: But the science! The science was a success! The instantaneous kinesis worked! E-Everyone saw it! They must have done! Yes, there was the terrible accident, but... ...the demonstration of my hypothesis was a success! Gregson: Well, that much is undeniable. As shown in this photograph taken by the Forensic Investigation Team. Judge: This was taken inside the Crystal Tower, I take it? The centrepiece of the exhibition, no less. Gregson: That's right, My Lord. Seems the victim rammed straight into it. Judge: Hm, I see... Very well, submit the photograph as evidence. The photograph of the victim has been entered into the Court Record. Gregson: As the court's heard, the victim of the incident was Mr Odie Asman. There have been a number of allegations made against the man, but puttin' them aside for the time bein'... ...he was the man who financed the research for the experiment and the demonstration itself. Judge: I see. So to summarise the situation... ...the defendant is accused of taking the life of the man who funded his work. Would that be correct? Gregson: Exactly. Ryunosuke: But couldn't it be... ...that the explosion was caused by some malfunction in the apparatus used for the demonstration? Harebrayne: That's right! That must be it! My splendid machine... My poor, splendid machine... Gregson: You saw it yesterday, didn't you? We can't even examine the wreckage thanks to the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act. Harebrayne: WHAAAAAAAAAT?! The wreckage?! THE WRECKAGE?! Judge: But that being the case, how can the facts be established? How can it possibly be determined whether this was an accident or a deliberate and malicious act? Van Zieks: Extremely simply, My Lord. Judge: I beg your pardon? Van Zieks: Isn't that right, witness? Harebrayne: Wha...? Sorry? ME?! Van Zieks: No. Your neighbour. Gregson: Yes, sir! It was murder, plain and simple. Anyone could state that with complete certainty. Ryunosuke: What?! (How can he possibly think that?) Judge: Thank you, Inspector. I think we had better proceed to formal testimony. You will explain to the court on what grounds you claim this experiment to have been a front for murder! Witness Testimony - A Front for Murder - Gregson: The corpse that went crashin' through the Crystal Tower had a broken neck. Harebrayne: I, I made a minor miscalculation in the angle of the beam projection, that's all! That was my mistake! Gregson: But the post-mortem examination revealed another injury. A fatal wound. There was a lesion in his chest where he'd clearly been stabbed by somethin' sharp right in the heart! So the victim was killed before he went anywhere. And this fella's the only one who could have done it! Judge: ......... An extraordinary business... In addition to suffering a broken neck, the victim was stabbed in the heart? Ryunosuke: (Information I would really like to have heard from someone other than the judge...) Gregson: The coroner says death would have been all but instant from a wound like that. Van Zieks: You could say, in fact... ...that the victim was killed twice by the accused. Harebrayne: No, no and no! That couldn't be further from the truth! Gregson: I have here the experiment plan document that was submitted to the security team. The victim stood himself inside somethin' called 'the birdcage', ready to be 'beamed' instantly... ...to the second level of the Crystal Tower, about twenty-five yards away. Van Zieks: The experiment did not go according to plan, however. As the machine was put into operation, there was a large explosion. The blast caused the beam transmitter to point higher than intended. Accordingly, the kinesis resulted in the birdcage materialising in mid-air... ...from where it subsequently fell, crashing through the glass of the Crystal Tower's large round window. Judge: My word... One assumes the victim's neck was broken upon impact with the tower, then? Harebrayne: I'm, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean for this to happen! The machine was just too powerful! But honestly! Really! I swear! It was just an accident! A terrible accident! Van Zieks: Unfortunately, that excuse can't save you. Gregson: No, not considerin' the sharp murder weapon that pierced the victim's heart. Harebrayne: M-Murder weapon?! What are you saying?! Van Zieks: This is the autopsy report submitted by the coroner. The prosecution would like it entered into the Court Record. Judge: Your request is granted, Counsel. The autopsy report has been entered into the Court Record. Juror No. 4: I was there in person, you know. I saw the whole ludicrous performance. And the only other person on the stage with Mr Asman was that disgraceful excuse for a scientist! Juror No. 2: Then really, by all accounts it must have been him. Juror No. 1: Hmph. Hard to think otherwise, really. Judge: Very well. Counsel for the Defence...proceed with the cross-examination, please. Ryunosuke: Oh, yes, My Lord! (I need to focus here... It's been a while!) Cross-Examination - A Front for Murder - Gregson: The corpse that went crashin' through the Crystal Tower had a broken neck. Harebrayne: I, I made a minor miscalculation in the angle of the beam projection, that's all! That was my mistake! Gregson: But the post-mortem examination revealed another injury. A fatal wound. Gregson: There was a lesion in his chest where he'd clearly been stabbed by somethin' sharp right in the heart! Gregson: So the victim was killed before he went anywhere. And this fella's the only one who could have done it! Gregson: The weapon the victim was stabbed with must have been left in his body whilst he was beamed through the air! Ryunosuke: (So that's all the testimony I have to work with... I had no idea the victim had been stabbed. That changes everything... Did van Zieks keep that to himself until now on purpose, to gain the advantage? Oh well...I suppose all I can do is press these witnesses for as much new information as possible.) Ryunosuke: You say that while the weapon remains in the body, there's very little bleeding... Is that unequivocal? Gregson: Look, there was no blood on the experimentation stage, even though that's where the fellow was stabbed. The only explanation for that is if the screwdriver was still in his body, stoppin' any heavy bleedin'. Van Zieks: It's common medical knowledge, my learned friend. Even on your side of the world. Ryunosuke: ......... Yes, but about this screwdriver... The thing is, we actually saw it at the scene ourselves. On the experimentation stage. Van Zieks: What? Ryunosuke: It was on the floor by the wreckage of the machine, poking through a metal grille. I went to pick it up, but the detective here stopped me. Isn't that right, Inspector Gregson? Gregson: Ah, well, um... Now you come to mention it, yes... Van Zieks: Inspector, are we to understand that you permitted the defence counsel to investigate? That you contravened the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act? Gregson: Eh? No! Not at all! I, I wouldn't do that! I just let him look, nothin' more! I was very clear he wasn't to touch a thing! Ryunosuke: Yes, that's true. This screwdriver was in plain sight on the stage. But it shouldn't have been, should it? Gregson: Wh-What are you gettin' at? Ryunosuke: If this tool had still been in the victim's body when the victim was beamed away by the machine... ...then it shouldn't have still been on the stage. Gregson: Ah! Ryunosuke: That's right! It should have been beamed across to the Crystal Tower along with Mr Asman... ...and been found still lodged in the victim's chest! Gregson: Ugh... UWAAAAAAAAAGH! Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! ...How do you explain this, Inspector? Gregson: I...well...um... I don't... Ryunosuke: It looks as though everything that the victim had on his person moved with him when he was 'beamed'. If the screwdriver was still in his chest when the instantaneous kinesis occurred... ...obviously that should have been beamed to the destination as well! Gregson: You... Ryunosuke: (This is a strange situation... Even though people are saying that this instantaneous kinesis is a scientific impossibility... ...we're still basing arguments on the assumption that it did actually take place. Alright. Time to tighten the screws here...) My Lord! If the prosecution is unable to explain this inconsistency in its argument... ...we can only conclude that the testimony given in support cannot be relied upon! Van Zieks: ......... Ryunosuke: (Lord van Zieks is stumped!) ???: Judge: ...Do you have something to say, witness? Harebrayne: Yes...I knew it... It bears out... The equations hold... Mr Naruhodo! ...DON'T WORRY! Ryunosuke: ...About what?! Harebrayne: Without delving into the details, there is no inconsistency! Ryunosuke: What? Harebrayne: Even if Andrew had been lodged in Mr Asman's chest... ...my trusty tool wouldn't have moved. Andrew remaining on the stage is consistent with my calculations! Ryunosuke: Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAT?! Van Zieks: It would seem your illusions have been...shattered. Clearly we should hear the accused's explanation. ...Or should I say, this brilliant scientist's explanation? Judge: Hmmm... Ryunosuke: (Just when I'd found an inconsistency in the prosecution's argument... Scientists...) Judge: Very well! The defendant will testify again. Provide us with the scientific explanation as to why the inconsistency asserted by the defence fails to hold! Harebrayne: In the name of Apollo, I will, My Lord! Witness Testimony - The inconsistency Explained - Harebrayne: To be clear, I'm still at the stage of gathering data in my research. My hypothesis states the kinesis cannot transport metal, though. Hence the metal weapon would have stayed put. In other words, the point just raised by Mr Naruhodo isn't an inconsistency at all. Mr Asman was the patron of my research. Without him, my work wouldn't have been possible. Now I have a duty to protect the incredible machine that we built together! Ryunosuke: ......... Van Zieks: ......... Judge: ......... So, the thrust of your testimony, Professor, is...? Van Zieks: ...That based upon his hypothesis, metal objects cannot be moved by this method of instantaneous kinesis. Judge: In other words...? Van Zieks: In other words, since the screwdriver is made of metal, even if it remained lodged in the victim's chest... ...its subsequent discovery on the stage despite the victim being found elsewhere is not an inconsistency. Judge: And therefore...? Van Zieks: And therefore Professor Albert Harebrayne could still have been the killer. Harebrayne: My great hypothesis holds, you see! We, we had to make the cage used to contain the subject from wood for that very reason. Judge: I was not addressing you, witness! Ryunosuke: Um...Professor Harebrayne... Harebrayne: Yes? Ryunosuke: Whose side are you on here? Harebrayne: I don't take sides, Mr Naruhodo! No no no! My only interest lies in upholding my hypothesis! I'm a scientist, after all! Ryunosuke: ......... (Is he working for us or against us? It's very hard to tell...) Van Zieks: Let's see how you cross-examine this testimony, my Nipponese friend. Harebrayne: Yes, fire away, Mr Naruhodo! Cross-Examination - The Inconsistency Explained - Harebrayne: To be clear, I'm still at the stage of gathering data in my research. Harebrayne: My hypothesis states the kinesis cannot transport metal, though. Hence the metal weapon would have stayed put. Harebrayne: In other words, the point just raised by Mr Naruhodo isn't an inconsistency at all. Harebrayne: Mr Asman was the patron of my research. Without him, my work wouldn't have been possible. Harebrayne: Now I have a duty to protect the incredible machine that we built together! Ryunosuke: (That's the extent of the testimony then... Thank goodness for that. I don't want him doing any more damage. He's already basically proven that he could have been the culprit. But it seems as though all he really cares about is defending his hypothesis. Still, I wonder... What if his hypothesis is just fundamentally flawed?) Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne, you say that according to your hypothesis... ...nothing made of metal can be beamed by instantaneous kinesis using the machine you made. Is that right? Harebrayne: Yes, that's right. Spot on! Exactly correct! Ryunosuke: In that case...I'd ask you to have a look at this photograph that was taken at the scene. In particular, I'd like you to pay attention to the victim's face. You can clearly see that Mr Asman is wearing a pair of spectacles...with a metal rim. Harebrayne: What? Metal? No... Metal can't... That's not... M-Metal? NOOOOOOOOOOOO! Ryunosuke: We've already established that the proposed murder weapon, the screwdriver, was found on the stage. However, if your hypothesis correctly predicted that outcome... ...it should also have predicted...that the metal-rimmed spectacles would be found in the same place! Harebrayne: AAAAAAAAAAAAH! My hypothesis! MY HYPOTHESIIIIIIIIIS! Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne, this isn't easy for me to say... ...but your hypothesis...is clearly flawed! Harebrayne: UWAAAAAAAAAGH!!! Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Counsel, what is the implication of this? Ryunosuke: If, on the day in question, the alleged instantaneous kinesis never actually took place... ...then it's entirely possible that the victim was killed somewhere other than on the stage. And in that case...someone other than the defendant could have been the culprit! Harebrayne: But, but my hypothesis! My hypothesis is sound! I proved it that day! The experiment was a success! The experiment was proof of all my work! ???: Juror No. 4: If I could say something here, in my capacity as a fellow of the Royal Society... Judge: Yes, juror number four? Go ahead. Juror No. 4: As a man of science, there's one thing I simply cannot abide... And that's a fraud who PRETENDS to be a fellow man of science! Harebrayne: What? Wait! Great Scott! Are you suggesting my science is suspect?! Juror No. 4: It's just been disproved, hasn't it? In front of all of us. In other words, the whole demonstration was a complete nonsense from start to finish! Believe me, my fellow jurors, when I tell you that this man is a heel, a bounder and a fraud! Juror No. 1: I say the wreckage of that machine should be stripped down and thoroughly examined! Harebrayne: Nooo! Never! That machine is the essence of my entire hypothesis! It's protected by the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act! Juror No. 6: What the devil is that blasted act all about, eh? Who made up such a daft rule?! Ryunosuke: (I don't like the way this seems to be going... What's the best way for me to help the professor?) Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne has yet to perfect his invention! That would seem to be the case, yes. But even so... Van Zieks: Even so, what? Ryunosuke: Going to such trouble and expense to create a fake machine to display in public... He would have absolutely no reason to do such a thing! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: He had an obvious reason to do exactly that. For the research grant money. Ryunosuke: Ah! Juror No. 4: If the government was foolish enough to have deemed the man's ridiculous notion plausible... ...he and his conspirators would have received a handsome sum indeed. Harebrayne: C-Conspirators? Juror No. 2: What would be the value of such a grant? Ten pounds? Juror No. 4: You're an order of magnitude out, madam. Five hundred pounds a YEAR! Juror No. 5: Ooh arrrrrr! Ya could live 'andsome on that much for years! Juror No. 4: The Society's noticed an increase in bogus public demonstrations in the field of science recently. And plenty of scientists arguing with each other to get the largest slice of the funding cake. People's greed is plenty motive enough for murder, I assure you! Harebrayne: No no no! I haven't deceived anyone! Least of all the government! My hypothesis is sound! The science is sound! Please, you must believe me! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: No matter how unbelievable this hypothesis may seem to you, ladies and gentlemen... ...the fact remains that the victim was transported instantly to the Crystal Tower. Which means that the experiment...was a success. Harebrayne: Ah, Barok! Van Zieks: And therefore... ...the only person who could possibly have committed this murder...is the accused! Harebrayne: Ah. Barok... Ryunosuke: (Where is this heading? I have no idea...) Van Zieks: My Lord, if I may...? Judge: Yes, Lord van Zieks? Van Zieks: The prosecution would like to summon new witnesses to the stand. Judge: New witnesses? What would be the nature of their involvement? Van Zieks: They were spectators of the demonstration at the exhibition. Who were occupying special seats. Ryunosuke: Eyewitnesses? Judge: Very well, the court grants the prosecution's request. I should very much like to hear from eyewitnesses to the incident. Van Zieks: The prosecution's stance is clear. This experiment was no postiche. The accused killed the financier victim there on the public stage, before the very eyes of the spectators. Now, my learned friend... Ryunosuke: Oh! ...Yes? Van Zieks: It's time for you to make your own stance clear. Ryunosuke: (There's clearly a flaw in the professor's hypothesis. I can definitely see that. But where does that leave me...?) Judge: We shall take a short recess now. During which time, the prosecution will prepare its new witnesses to take the stand. Van Zieks: ...As you wish, My Lord. Judge: Good. In that case, court is adjourned for twenty minutes. To be continued... 23rd October, 10:44 a.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber Harebrayne: M-Mr Naruhodo... ...what on earth were you playing at just now? Or rather... ...WHAT ON EARTH WERE YOU PLAYING AT ALL ALONG?! MY HYPOTHESIS! MY AMAZING HYPOTHESIS! You've been picking holes in it from the start! Ryunosuke: Ah, sorry about that. Harebrayne: But you promised me! You, you said you'd prove that dratted explosion was an accident, not murder. You said you'd keep my precious invention from falling into anyone else's hands! But all you've done so far is try to undermine me! Ryunosuke: ......... Yes, I did make you a promise, you're right. I said that I'd believe in you and fight for your freedom to the very end. But I also told you I was no scientist. I don't understand your hypothesis. The fact is, there's an undeniable flaw in your logic, isn't there? Harebrayne: Ah! But! If I just run through some equations... Yes, you see! It's because my work is incomplete! Ryunosuke: Perhaps it is. Nevertheless...a man died as a consequence, didn't he? Harebrayne: Oh. OOOOOOOOOH NOOOOOOOOO! ......... You're right. You're so right. It's all my fault... And I have no right to blame you for my failures. I'm a disaster! Not just as a scientist...but as a human being! Ryunosuke: Well...that might be a little over the top. Harebrayne: And while we're on the subject... ...wh-what about Barok? He's being awful! Ryunosuke: Claiming his old university friend to be a murderer, you mean? Harebrayne: He's a disaster! Not just as a prosecutor...but as a human being! Oh! But no! Wait! He's the Reaper, isn't he? Perhaps he's not classified as Homo sapiens any more...? Ryunosuke: (...Glad that's cleared up...) ......... Can I double-check something with you? Harebrayne: Ah. Yes? What? Ryunosuke: The machine and demonstration you prepared... They were based entirely on your hypothesis, I presume? There was no...trickery involved? Harebrayne: ......... I drew the plans for the machine with my very own hands. Every line was painstakingly drawn with the firm belief that science is the only future. So yes, it's true that my hypothesis hasn't reach [sic] maturity yet, but please, Mr Naruhodo...you must believe in it. Ryunosuke: ......... Alright, Professor, I understand. Bailiff: Counsel! Defendant! The prosecution's witnesses are ready to take the stand. Court is about to be in session again. Make your way into the courtroom, please! Ryunosuke: (It all hinges on that demonstration. If the professor's hypothesis is sound as he claims... ...it leaves him as the only person who could possibly have killed the victim. But on the other hand, Mr Sholmes was adamant...) Sholmes: A practical implementation, such as was attempted by the professor at the Great Exhibition, is quite impossible. Ryunosuke: (So really, what should I be trying to prove here?) 23rd October, 11:00 a.m. The Old Bailey Courtroom Judge: In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby reconvene the proceedings of this court. Counsels for the defence and prosecution, are you ready for the new witnesses to testify? Van Zieks: The prosecution is ready, My Lord. Ryunosuke: As is the defence, My Lord. Judge: So, Lord van Zieks... ...I believe these next witnesses saw the demonstration on the day in question with their own eyes? Van Zieks: Indeed they did. And as luck would have it, one of them is a police detective. ...So the testimony we are about to hear can be considered highly reliable. Ryunosuke: (Perfect. A detective of all people...) Van Zieks: The prosecution's stance remains unchanged. Though it ended in tragedy, the demonstration on the day in question was scientifically sound. And consequently... ...the sole person with the opportunity to have committed this act of murder... ...is the only other individual to have been present on the stage at the time: the accused. Judge: Thank you, Counsel. The prosecution's position is clear. So, bring forth your witnesses now. Van Zieks: Bailiff, show the witnesses in. The witnesses whose proximity to the incident on the day in question will clarify the truth unequivocally. Van Zieks: Witnesses, state your names and occupations for the court to hear. Lune: My name is Balthazar Lune. I am...the impresario of all the hot-air balloons in vicinity of the esperimento stage. Gotts: Mein name ist Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond Ormstein. I have come to see ze Great Exhibition all ze vay from my home in Bohemia. ...I'm very rich. Gina: Inspector Gina Lestrade, Scotland Yard. I'm a great detective. Even 'Erlock Sholmes agrees. I was on security duty at the exhibition...and I got to go up in one o' them balloons! It was amazin'! Ryunosuke: (Gina...again. But she did mention that she'd seen the disaster from up in a balloon actually, didn't she? And she clearly loved every minute of it.) Van Zieks: There were three balloons flying near the public experimentation stage when the incident occurred. Two of these witnesses were in one such balloon at the time, and saw events unfold from the skies above. Lune: You make it sound like they were in the clouds. It was only an altitude of circa sixty feet. Very low. Gina: Well ya can't see nuffin' if ya fly too 'igh, can ya? Ryunosuke: (Sixty feet... About eighteen metres, then.) Judge: Thank you for your introductions. Now, you will give your formal testimony for the court. Kindly describe exactly what you witnessed...especially those of you who had a vantage point above the stage! Witness Testimony - The View From Sixty Feet Up - Lune: It was an incidente terribile. I am only grateful that my balloons were not damaged. Gina: There's this huge bang from the stage, and then the next second, another bang in the sky beside us. Gotts: And from amid ze smoke...a cage appeared out of nowhere! Lune: The cage, it fell from the sky like a stone. And crashed into the Crystal Tower! Gina: I didn't get a good look inside the cage, but no one went near it after it crashed into the tower. Judge: ...A most extraordinary collective account, I must say. Ryunosuke: Could I just clarify something? There's a detail in the witnesses' testimony that I've not heard any mention of until now. Specifically, that there were two explosions? Van Zieks: ...More precisely, two explosions in two separate places, yes. When the demonstration began, the balloon carrying the two witnesses was around...here. There were other balloons in the air nearby at the time carrying other passengers as well, to be clear. Then, as power was supplied to the machine for the demonstration, the first explosion occurred. The so-called 'birdcage' that contained the victim disappeared from the stage, and a moment later... ...the second explosion occurred, directly adjacent to the balloon carrying the witnesses. The birdcage appeared at the site of the explosion, subsequently to plummet down into the Crystal Tower. Gotts: I voz very surprised. Suddenly a cage appeared before my eyes viz a person inside. Ze blast voz so hot, but I didn't vant to miss a sing, so I kept my eyes vide! ...I still have lots of money. Judge: ......... Precisely who is this curious infant? Van Zieks: I'm told he is a young noble of Bohemian royalty. Apparently he disguised himself in order to steal unnoticed into the Great Exhibition. Gotts: Ja, I am here in London on a sightseeing trip viz my elementary school. Van Zieks: We will have the benefit of a child's point of view in the testimony. Ryunosuke: (Do we really need that?) Gotts: Ven I remove my mask, zis is vot I look like. Judge: Ah yes, I see. A delightful face, I'm sure. Gotts: Ja, everybody says so. Ryunosuke: (Great disguise, then...) Van Zieks: ...The point is, the testimony of these witnesses further substantiates the facts for the court. Namely, that despite ending in an explosion, instantaneous kinesis was successfully demonstrated. And furthermore, that until the arrival of the police, no one approached the Crystal Tower where the victim fell. Therefore, only the accused, who was with Mr Asman on the stage, could possibly have committed the murder. Judge: Yes, thank you, Counsel. The prosecution's views on the matter are quite clear. So, the defence's cross-examination now, please. Ryunosuke: Y-Yes, My Lord! Cross-Examination - The View From Sixty Feet Up - Lune: It was an incidente terribile. I am only grateful that my balloons were not damaged. Gina: There's this huge bang from the stage, and then the next second, another bang in the sky beside us. Gotts: And from amid ze smoke...a cage appeared out of nowhere! Gotts: It voz not ze sky zat exploded. It voz a green balloon zat woz next to ours at ze time. Lune: The cage, it fell from the sky like a stone. And crashed into the Crystal Tower! Gina: I didn't get a good look inside the cage, but no one went near it after it crashed into the tower. Ryunosuke: (The prosecution really is asserting that the demonstration was genuine... But what if it was actually some kind of switch-around trick instead? That would mean that the victim was never actually on the stage in the first place. The two explosions would have thrown everyone watching into a panic for sure. I think I need to find out more about what exactly people saw at the time...) Ryunosuke: Mr Lune, in your testimony... ...you said that all three of the balloons you had operating at the time were undamaged. Lune: Si. That is correct. If they had been caught in the esplosiones, it would have been terribile. Ryunosuke: I wonder...if you might know what this is? Lune: Ah...I think it may be... Si, part of a balloon. A burnt piece of the fabric of the envelope. Ryunosuke: Sorry? The envelope? Lune: Pardon. That is the large, round part of the balloon which becomes filled with hot air. It is made from very thick fabric lined with rubber. You do not want it to rip when you are in the sky. Ryunosuke: (Just as I thought...) This piece of cloth was found near the experimentation stage. In other words, as Master Gotts testified... ...a green balloon did indeed explode that day. Lune: Eh?! Ryunosuke: If all the balloons in the sky above the experimentation stage belonged to you, Mr Lune... ...then your statement that they were all undamaged clearly contradicts the evidence! Lune: NOOOOOOOOO! If a balloon exploded that day, why didn't the man say so? Maybe everyone on board was killed... Oh no! Having just spent ten whole pounds for the experience?! How awful! Seems to me like those things crash fifty percent of the time anyway... Van Zieks: Van Zieks: The instantaneous kinesis did occur! But after the explosion on the stage... ...the point of materialisation shifted to a location occupied by a balloon. Judge: Causing the balloon to explode? Yes, eminently plausible. Van Zieks: An unfortunate traffic accident, as it were. But it changes nothing about the pertinent facts. ???: Lune: This, I cannot accept! Ryunosuke: Why not, Mr Lune? Lune: You are suggesting that I am a liar! That persons died in a balloon incidente! Van Zieks: There's no need to get 'fired up', Mr Lune. The victim was the sole fatality that day. Lune: That's right! And I prove it! Balthazar Lune is not a liar! There was no such balloon in the sky! It is non possible! Ryunosuke: You're saying it's impossible? Why? Van Zieks: This court has more important matters to discuss than the number of balloons that were operating that day. Lune: AIIIIIIEEE! Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But we can't ignore the fact that nobody appears to have known anything about this other balloon until now! My Lord! The defence calls for further testimony from Mr Lune! Judge: I concur. There is clearly more to the truth here than meets the eye. It's imperative that we clear up the issue of this phantom balloon, I feel. Witness, you will give supplementary testimony about the balloons you were operating at the exhibition. Lune: Ah...grazie, My Lord! Witness Testimony - Mr Lune's Balloons - Lune: As I said, Balthazar Lune is no liar! Every balloon I had in the sky landed safely! All three of my balloons were carrying passengers. If they fell to the ground in an esplosione, what a catastrofe! Gina: But ya can't get away from the fact that a burnt-up bit o' cloth was found at the scene, can ya? The coppers at the Yard reckoned it was prob'ly some debris thrown from the explosion on the stage. Lune: This stupido ragazzo is mistaken! My balloons have the red and blue zigzag stripes anyway! Judge: Hmmm...so your assertion is that the balloon this child saw was not one belonging to you? Lune: Si! Exactamente! If he even saw a balloon in the first place. I do not like the sound of it. It is very bad for business! I have a good mind to sue the land of Bohemia! Gotts: If you attack us, ve vill fight back! It vill be vor! All out vor! Ryunosuke: (...What happened to 'all out war'? Mr Lune certainly doesn't appear to be lying. But that doesn't change the fact that the testimony and evidence are contradictory here...) Van Zieks: If the defence is unable to find fault with the witnesses' statements, the court must consider them the truth. ...Think long and hard on that, my learned friend. Ryunosuke: (The situation has clearly changed now. I have to get to the bottom of what happened here, no matter what it takes!) Judge: Counsel, you may now cross-examine the witnesses. Cross-Examination - Mr Lune's Balloons - Lune: As I said, Balthazar Lune is no liar! Every balloon I had in the sky landed safely! Lune: All three of my balloons were carrying passengers. If they fell to the ground in an esplosione, what a catastrofe! Gina: But ya can't get away from the fact that a burnt-up bit o' cloth was found at the scene, can ya? Gina: The coppers at the Yard reckoned it was prob'ly some debris thrown from the explosion on the stage. Lune: This stupido ragazzo is mistaken! My balloons have the red and blue zigzag stripes anyway! Ryunosuke: (As I thought, Mr Lune's testimony just doesn't quite add up... The young Bohemian boy claims to have seen another, fourth balloon. But Mr Lune vehemently denies the possibility. And it's hard to imagine the man in charge could be mistaken about the number that were in the air... Still, this inconsistency must tell us something, I'm sure.) Ryunosuke: Unfortunately, the photograph Master Gotts took can't tell us the colour of the balloon. But it can tell us something else. Something crucially important. Van Zieks: What? Ryunosuke: It shows that the pictured balloon...wasn't carrying any passengers. Judge: Ah! My goodness, you're right! But surely all the balloons would have been carrying passengers? There would be no sense in it otherwise. Lune: S-Si! They are for pleasure! For seeing the view! MY balloons only fly with passengers! Ryunosuke: Which tells us that the pictured balloon isn't one of them. So when the incident occurred that day... ...there WAS a fourth balloon in the skies above the experimentation stage! The mysterious green balloon! Lune: I, I know nothing! Niente! I, I can only tell you one thing... If this balloon was not carrying passengers, then it was not one of mine! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: There are illegal tradesmen everywhere you care to look. Clearly one such 'entrepreneur' decided to capitalise on the opportunity presented by the Great Exhibition. And managed to operate balloon flights on Mr Lune's patch without him realising. Lune: Si... Si! The competizione...trying to steal my profits! I did not notice because of the esperimento that went wrong on the stage! Ryunosuke: This fourth balloon exploded at the very same moment Mr Asman was 'beamed' from the stage below. Gina: Right...so them scraps that fell to the ground after, an' left them scorch marks... They didn't come from the stage at all! It was bits o' the balloon rainin' down! But cos no one was in it, it didn't get no attention. Ryunosuke: (A mysterious fourth balloon carrying no passengers, silently floating over the experimentation stage...) Van Zieks: Van Zieks: This photograph shows us nothing more! A stray balloon carrying no one and operated by some rogue trader. Clearly it has nothing to do with the case. Judge: Hmmm... Its relevance does elude me, I must say. Van Zieks: The court has seen sufficient evidence and heard ample testimony already. The prosecution calls for this trial to be concluded! Ryunosuke: (Really? Have we really got to the truth yet? No, I can't let this opportunity slip away. The jurors' minds are made up...and not in our favour! What else can this photograph tell us? Is there nothing more we can learn from it?) Ryunosuke: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, wait! Please don't give your decisions yet! The photograph from Master Gotts... ...may well be hiding one more vital clue! Juror No. 1: What's that?! Juror No. 3: A vital clue?! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: We're well past the point of mere possibilities. It's time for definitives now. So tell the court... What exactly does this alleged clue in the photograph prove? Ryunosuke: We can reasonably assume that the pictured balloon was destroyed in the searing heat of the explosion. Gotts: Ja! Zat's right! Ja! It voz not my fault! Van Zieks: Evidently. Because the birdcage from the kinesis machine materialised in the sky where it had been flying. And the balloon, being filled with flammable hydrogen, instantly and explosively ignited. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: ...No, that's not what happened. Van Zieks: What? Judge: It would appear that this photograph requires closer examination. Counsel for the Defence, you will highlight the location of this alleged 'clue' in the photograph for the court. Ryunosuke: Of course, My Lord. (If you look closely, it's plain enough to see. And what's shown is linked to another piece of evidence we have. In a way that leads to an unbelievable conclusion!) The clue that heavily suggests the real reason the balloon exploded is... Ryunosuke: The timing of this photograph can only be described as miraculous. If you look, you'll notice there's a bright white line that appears to point directly at the balloon. Van Zieks: Most likely a ray of light caught incidentally on the film. Judge: ...I'm afraid I can see nothing of the sort. Ryunosuke: If you look with a magnifying glass, My Lord, it becomes clear what the nature of this bright line really is. Goodness, what is that? Juror No. 4: Undeniably some flash of light, yes. Juror No. 2: Oh golly. Do, do you think it might be lightning? Juror No. 1: But it couldn't have been a finer day. Juror No. 3: I believe we may be looking...at fire! Juror No. 6: A bolt of fire, heading straight for the balloon...like an arrow! Judge: Indeed. Even to my ageing eyes, it would appear to be a flame of some sort. My word! Are, are you suggesting this flame struck the hydrogen gas that filled the balloon?! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: That's absurd! The balloon would have been sixty feet above the ground at the time. No flame could possibly have reached such a height. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Actually, it's my opinion... ...that a particular piece of evidence found at the scene reveals how that is exactly what did happen. Van Zieks: What evidence?! Judge: If such evidence exists, Counsel, then for goodness' sake present it, man! Which evidence explains this mysterious streak of flame that appears to be headed directly for the balloon? Ryunosuke: This was found hidden at the foot of a small ornamental tree near the scene. Judge: Good Lord! Is that a crossbow? Ryunosuke: An arrow dipped in oil and set alight could have been shot from this weapon... ...sending a flaming arrow straight into the hydrogen-filled balloon! Van Zieks: Are you suggesting...that crossbow was used to deliberately...? Gina: Blimey, yer right! That streak o' light in the photo looks just like an arrow, dunnit? Lune: Then...the esplosione of the balloon, it was... Ryunosuke: ...Very likely the result of a flaming arrow from this crossbow igniting the hydrogen gas inside it! Van Zieks: Nooo! Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Counsel, this is an extraordinary supposition! Ryunosuke: If the aim was to cause the balloon to explode, the shooter could have used a gun of course. However, there's an obvious reason why that would have been out of the question. Van Zieks: The noise of the discharge? Of course... Ryunosuke: That's right. By using a crossbow, the projectile could be fired at the balloon silently. Gina: Well yeah, if someone 'ad shot a gun off in the exhibition grounds, it would've caused a real panic. Lune: But with the big esplosione, there was a very big panic anyway, no? Ryunosuke: ......... (I don't like this. I should be pleased to have found a plausible new explanation for all this, but something feels wrong...) Van Zieks: Van Zieks: Do you understand the implications of what you're saying, my Nipponese friend? Ryunosuke: If a flaming arrow did indeed hit the balloon, then obviously it would have exploded. And if the birdcage appeared from the cloud of smoke that ensued... Gina: Wot? Wait a minute! Wot are ya really sayin' 'ere? I don't get it. Was, was the birdcage beamed up into the sky after all, or...wot? Judge: My goodness me! Ryunosuke: ......... (Ah, now I understand. That's what that sinking feeling is about...) I think there's a good chance... ...that the birdcage was actually concealed inside the balloon all along. Judge: What?! Did, did I just hear that correctly, Counsel? Ryunosuke: (There's no going back now. The horse has bolted...) Let's assume, as I said, that the birdcage was hidden inside the green balloon from the start. On stage, when the experiment was started... ...the birdcage in the instantaneous kinesis machine disappeared in a cloud of smoke. At that moment, the flaming arrow was fired from the ground... ...causing the green balloon to explode and drawing the attention of the spectators to the sky above their heads. From amid the smoke, the hidden birdcage then appeared, to fall down and crash into the Crystal Tower. I think you'll all agree it's entirely plausible... ...that what I've just described is the real truth behind the 'miraculous' experiment carried out that day! Judge: Th-This... I......... GOOOOOOOOOD GRIEF! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: This is ludicrous! What you've described is no science experiment. It's, it's child's play! A contemptible display of stage magic! Ryunosuke: (Both Mr Sholmes and Iris said that the experiment was a scientific impossibility. In which case, this is the only way to explain what happened that day.) Van Zieks: And in any case...the victim's body was found inside the birdcage in the Crystal Tower. If the instantaneous kinesis didn't take place, how do you explain that? Ryunosuke: Ah! Um... Juror No. 3: If I may put in a word...as a man of magic myself... Such apparent discrepancies can easily be explained by some simple deception. Ryunosuke: J-Juror number three! Juror No. 3: All that would be needed is a doppelgänger - someone who looked very similar to the victim, Mr Asman... ...and having this other man appear on stage to front the show...as a body double! Ryunosuke: Ah...yes! Of course, so in fact... ...Mr Asman must have been inside the birdcage that was concealed inside the balloon right from the start! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: That balloon would have been filled with hydrogen. Anything hidden inside it would have been scattered to the four winds when it exploded. No one would ever have embarked on such a risky venture. Juror No. 4: Not necessarily. The explosive force of the balloon gas would very much depend upon the mixture ratio. Ryunosuke: J-Juror number four! Juror No. 4: Flying balloons are rarely filled with pure hydrogen, but a mixture of other gases such as helium as well. Helium on its own doesn't explode, but by controlling the gas mixture ratio, the explosive force can be altered. Van Zieks: The mixture ratio...? Juror No. 4: Obviously, the victim's body would have suffered some burns. That would be unavoidable. But not to such an extent as to render this whole obscene charade impossible. Van Zieks: ......... Ryunosuke: So everything that happened can be explained. Logically and scientifically. The explosion that engulfed the stage at the start of the 'experiment' was no accident. It was all part of an elaborate deception...to make it appear that instantaneous kinesis had occurred! Judge: Well...goodness me... Ryunosuke: And if we accept that this is what happened... ...it means that the victim, Mr Asman, was never present on the public experimentation stage to begin with. Van Zieks: Nrgh... Ryunosuke: In short... ...he couldn't have been killed by the defendant, who was on stage in full view the entire time! Van Zieks: AAAAAARGH! Ryunosuke: (This will be very hard for the prosecution to counter. Lord van Zieks can't credibly maintain that Professor Harebrayne is a suspect now!) ???: Harebrayne: Mr Naruhodo...I appreciate your efforts. Thank you. Ryunosuke: P-Professor?! Harebrayne: But you can stop now. Just keep your mouth shut, please. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Van Zieks: What's all this about...Mr Harebrayne? Harebrayne: ......... I, Albert Harebrayne, hereby confess... ...that it... That it was... That it was me who stabbed Mr Odie Asman! Yes! It was me! With my faithful friend and partner... Andrew the Screwdriver! Ryunosuke: Wha......... WHAT ARE YOU DOIIIIIING?! Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Defendant! Explain this sudden confession! Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne! What are you talking about?! Harebrayne: It's...it's what I've said all along! I must protect my hypothesis! And my precious machine! Ryunosuke: ...! Harebrayne: You stand there and claim it was all a trick! All an elaborate prank! But where's your proof?! No, y-you'd have to examine the machine if you wanted to prove it. But then it would all be over! My beautiful hypothesis would be laid bare... I mean, the indignity of it! Ryunosuke: It's clear that you drew the plans for the experiment, but you didn't actually build it. It's quite conceivable that you were duped, Professor. If you'll just let me, I can prove- Harebrayne: Barok! Van Zieks: Yes? Harebrayne: I'll cooperate. I'll do whatever you say. I swear it. So, so please... ...ensure the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act is adhered to and protect my creation! ......... Van Zieks: ...Pray forgive the discourtesy of filling my hallowed chalice at this critical juncture... Here's to my learned Nipponese friend... Ryunosuke: Wha...?! Van Zieks: ...and his upcoming attempt to clarify the defence's position in the light of the accused's confession. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: Do you intend to formally assert that the experiment was nothing more than a conjuring trick? Because the moment you do... ...the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act that protects the professor's invention will cease to apply. The prosecution will then demand a rigorous examination of the machinery involved in order to establish the truth. Ryunosuke: ......... Van Zieks: However...if you acknowledge that the machine is genuine and instrumental in the victim's murder... ...any chance of investigating will be crushed...and the confidentiality of the professor's hypothesis preserved. Ryunosuke: ...! Judge: Well, Counsel...what is the defence's official position on this matter? Ryunosuke: (What Professor Harebrayne - my client - actually asked of me... ...was to prove that the explosion on stage was an accident and protect the secrecy of his hypothesis. But there's no way to do that without implying the professor's guilt! Do I protect my client's life by asserting his innocence, or do I uphold my client's request but see him condemned? Either way, I can't avoid betraying his trust...) Van Zieks: You've been silent long enough! Isn't talking your trade, my learned friend? Or has all knowledge of English escaped your confused Nipponese mind? Ryunosuke: ......... Harebrayne: Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: (There's no escape here! I have to make a choice! But it's an impossible one! I have to give up on something...but what?) The defence asserts...that the defendant's instantaneous kinesis machine was in fact... Ryunosuke: ......... .........Agh! (No! I can't say it! My client placed his faith in me... I can't just let him down!) 'What must I give up on?' is not the question you have to ask yourself here. It's 'What can I protect?' Susato: Hello again...Mr Naruhodo. It's been far too long. Ryunosuke: Su... Susato-san! But, but what are you- Susato: Haiiiiii-YA! Ryunosuke: AAAAAAAAGH! (My first Susato Takedown in six months!) Susato: There'll be time to talk later, Mr Naruhodo. For now...we must concentrate on the task at hand! Ryunosuke: (Which is working out not what I have to give up on, but what I can protect!) Professor Harebrayne! Harebrayne: Ah! ...Yes?! Ryunosuke: Yesterday you told me that science is the pursuit of truth. Well...my job is to pursue the truth too. Harebrayne: Yes, of course... Ryunosuke: And personally, I believe...that you didn't stab Mr Asman. I think you've come to realise something yourself too, haven't you? That your experiment and the machine you built with the victim are questionable! The truth behind that is what we must both pursue now! Harebrayne: UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Van Zieks: ...So...you've finally opened your eyes. Ryunosuke: What? Van Zieks: And as for you... ...Albert. You can't ignore this any longer. Harebrayne: Ah... Van Zieks: Having heard my learned friend's assertion... ...don't you have something to say? Harebrayne: ......... B-Barok... Ryunosuke: Lord van Zieks... Susato: Gosh, I've never heard him speak that way before. Harebrayne: ......... In truth...there is one thing. Something I've remembered that's of relevance. Ryunosuke: What? Harebrayne: On the day it happened...just before I began the experiment...I saw a man near the stage. A man holding that crossbow. Judge: I beg your pardon?! Ryunosuke: Professor! Did the man have any distinguishing features? What did he look like? Harebrayne: Uh...tall. Taller than me. And, and thin. Thinner than me. With straight hair. Straighter - and whiter - than mine. Let me see... One less lens than me, too. A monocle. A rather stylish, black monocle. But one thing in particular will help to positively identify the man. You see, I know him very well. After all...he's the engineer who built my invention! Van Zieks: What? Ryunosuke: He...built the machine? Harebrayne: That's right. Mr Asman introduced him to me a year ago. He's, he's a man by the name of... ...Enoch Drebber. Juror No. 3: Enoch?! Juror No. 4: Drebber?! Judge: Does this name mean something? Members of the jury seem flustered... Juror No. 4: Not a name any scientist wishes to hear. The man's an abomination! Juror No. 3: Not a name any conjuror wishes to hear, either! Ryunosuke: Who on earth is he? Juror No. 4: I'm afraid this isn't the first tale of this nature that I've heard in scientific circles in connection with that name. There's talk of other flamboyant experiments that turn out to be nothing but stage trickery in the end. Obviously the rascal is after the government's research grant money. Juror No. 3: When magicians are in need of money, I have heard of them resorting to these underhand tactics. Some acquaintances of mine with...experience of such things have mentioned Enoch Drebber's name before. Juror No. 4: The man is both an engineer and a magician. Yes, we're dealing with an unparalleled confidence trickster here! That's Enoch Drebber for you! Harebrayne: So it's true then... My invention... My great machine... It was just a grand illusion? Ryunosuke: Considering what we've just heard about Mr Drebber's character... ...I'm sorry to say that sounds increasingly likely. Harebrayne: Even though no one else believed it...I wanted to. I wanted to believe that machine would function exactly as my hypothesis predicted. Van Zieks: Which is why you were so opposed to it being investigated, I presume. Harebrayne: I knew that if the machine was examined in detail, its construction would give away my hypothesis. Obviously, I didn't want that to happen. But at the same time... ...I knew that if it was found to be nothing more than a trick... Than a work of deception... ...then everything I'd worked towards...all my research... all my dreams...my whole life would be over! I was terrified at the prospect. Ryunosuke: So you really had no idea, then, did you? About the true nature of the machine that was built. And the true nature of Mr Drebber. Harebrayne: I never questioned anything. I, I didn't want to question it. Ryunosuke: It's entirely possible that Mr Asman and Mr Drebber... ...were working together to use you as a means of fraudulently acquiring the research grant money. Harebrayne: ......... ...When I announced my invention to the crowds that day, it was the finest moment of my career. I pulled all the levers and turned all the dials in exactly the way Drebber had described... When the smoke suddenly started billowing out, I panicked. I didn't know what was happening. Harebrayne: But I really don't know how the whole illusion was made to work. I...don't know anything any more... Van Zieks: Let me confirm one final point with you, Professor. Do you now consent to the prosecution submitting the necessary paperwork... ...to release your invention from the protection afforded by the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act? Harebrayne: ......... Yes, please go ahead. I'm...very sorry. Judge: It would appear that we shall have to suspend proceedings for the remainder of the day now. Lord van Zieks... Van Zieks: My Lord? Judge: The court has newly been made aware of another party whose involvement in this matter is critical. Van Zieks: Yes, Mr Drebber... Judge: Gather information about the man. If possible, I should like him served with a subpoena. Van Zieks: With pleasure, My Lord. Judge: Now, Counsel for the Defence... Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord! Judge: ......... When we reconvene, I shall be looking for one thing and one thing alone from you. Evidence...that the defendant is innocent of the crime for which he presently stands accused. Ryunosuke: ...I understand. Judge: Good. In that case...this court is adjourned until tomorrow morning! 23rd October, 1:36 p.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber Harebrayne: ......... ...Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: Ah! Y-Yes? Harebrayne: I'm...I'm...I'm... I'm so sorry! I was wrong! You were right! I tricked you! You trusted me! I dragged you...into my mess! Oh h-how did it ever come to this...? I'M SOOO SOOO SOOO SOOORRY! Ryunosuke: Did you really have no idea, Professor? About what Mr Drebber was really up to, I mean? About what he was really constructing. Harebrayne: Naturally! That machine was the embodiment of my hypothesis! Of all my hopes and dreams! I had complete faith in it! Ryunosuke: Alright. In that case, I won't say any more. Now, sadly the murder accusation against you still stands. So we must do as much investigation as we can before the trial resumes tomorrow. Harebrayne: ......... Well, thank you for doing so much for me! Susato: I'm so sorry for arriving late this morning, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: A-Arriving late? Susato: Didn't you receive my postcard? I wanted to let you know when I'd arrive. Ryunosuke: Postcard? What postcard? Iris: I hid it from you, Runo! So it would be a surprise! ...Well? Did it work? Ryunosuke: I was surprised alright! Especially when she threw me to the ground! Susato: Oh dear! I'm so sorry! I, I was just so happy to see you again that...it sort of slipped out. Ryunosuke: (Maybe we could stick to more traditional displays of emotion in future...?) Iris: Susie's train was late into London Victoria this morning, you see. But we made the coachman really whip the horses hard so she didn't miss the whole trial! Susato: I was watching from the gallery for a while, but in the end...I'm afraid I couldn't contain myself... Ryunosuke: Well, I'm glad you didn't. Susato: Oh! Ryunosuke: Having you at my side in court gives me the strength I need to win. So...I'm, um, delighted to see you...back in London. Susato: Oh, you're too kind, Mr Naruhodo! I'm delighted to be here! I hope I can continue to be of service to you. Ryunosuke: Of course. So...what's brought you back? Did Professor Mikotoba not protest? Iris: Let's save all that conversation for when we're back at home, shall we? You know I've made one of my most special blends ever for this special occasion! Susato: Oh, Iris, how wonderful! I can't wait! Ryunosuke: Susato-san was back in London. It's hard to describe how happy that made me feel at the time. But despite my elation... ...our tale was about to take yet another extraordinary turn. To be continued...23rd October, 2:41 p.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy Susato: Oh, this room! It's been too long! It hasn't changed in the slightest, though. And it's been some six months, hasn't it? ...That's a long time for things to stay so...familiar. Ryunosuke: I didn't know when you might return, and I wanted everything to be as you'd left it. ...But it has been some six months, it's true. Iris: So is your father alright, Susie? What happened? Susato: My father? Ryunosuke: Yes! Professor Mikotoba! I mean, it was half a year ago, but that's why you went back to Japan! Because of the telegram you received saying he'd fallen ill with a very high fever for some unknown reason. Iris: That's right. So I was surprised to learn you'd be coming back so soon. Surprised but happy! Susato: ......... I think I wrote about it in my letter to you. That it was all a trick. My father is in fine health. And I'm obviously very relieved...about that. Ryunosuke: Well, we're all delighted to have you back. Susato: It was quite by accident that I've been able to return to Europe, actually. It's because of a very grand conference called the International Forensic Science Symposium. Ryunosuke: The International Forensic... (That's the same symposium Lord Stronghart mentioned.) Susato: Anyway, I've arrived safe and sound, and all that matters is that I'm here now! After all, I haven't yet fulfilled my promise to you, Iris. Iris: Oh! Ryunosuke: You must tell us everything that happened while you were back in Japan. Susato: Yes, of course, I shall. Ryunosuke: And...there's one other thing... Something you wrote in your letter that particularly grabbed my attention. About...you-know-who. (About Kazuma...) Susato: I know. I'll tell you all that I can. After clearing all Converse options with Susato Mikotoba and Iris Wilson: Susato: So, Mr Naruhodo, I'm ready to start investigating if you are! I've committed every detail about the case to memory! And Iris has told me about the disturbing happenings at the waxwork museum as well. Ryunosuke: So...you're fully abreast of the situation already, Miss Susato. I'd expected nothing less, to be honest. Susato: I would think our first port of call should be to investigate this Mr Drebber. The engineer responsible for building the elaborate machine that was used to effect this extraordinary trick. Ryunosuke: Yes, a conjuror of sorts, by the sound of it, well known in the fields of science and magic. Susato: Then we need to go and arrest him! Ryunosuke: Well, yes... ...he must know the truth behind this case, so I agree we really do need to find the man. Iris: Hm...it sounds like it's a case of tracking someone down. Which is a job for the police...or a great detective! Ryunosuke: (Are we supposed to guess who she might be thinking of?) We don't have much time, so we need to get started straight away, I think. Iris: Good idea. Well, best of luck, then! Ryunosuke: Oh, you're not coming today? Iris: I'm going to Brixton Road shortly for the herb market. But let me know later how you got on, won't you? Ryunosuke: (That was a little abrupt. The pull of the herb market must be strong...) 23rd October Sholmes's Suite 23rd October Local Prison, Cell 11 Ryunosuke: What's...he doing?! Susato: He's... Oh my! The whole wall of the cell is covered in mathematical equations! Ryunosuke: And he's still writing more now! Um...Professor! Sorry to interrupt... Harebrayne: Oh, ah... M-Mr Naruhodo... ...! And who is this young lady? Susato: My name is Susato Mikotoba. I'm Mr Naruhodo's judicial assistant. It's a pleasure to meet you, Professor. Harebrayne: ......... OH, IF ONLY! IF ONLY I'D MET A REFINED YOUNG WOMAN LIKE YOU SOONER! ...None of this would have happened. N-No, that's not logical... That makes no sense at all. Susato: Oh dear, I'm...I'm sorry if my presence here upsets you. Ryunosuke: I owe you an apology too, Professor. I didn't manage to deliver what I promised you I would in court this morning. Harebrayne: Oh no! No no no! No no no no no! The whole thing... The whole miserable affair... It all happened because I've been such a complete and utter clot! Susato: Um, Professor Harebrayne...what have you been working on in your cell? Harebrayne: Oh! Ha ha, you, um...you mean that? Oh dear, how embarrassing... I, I was suddenly struck by an idea, you see, and I simply had to write it down. The wall was all I had to hand. Ryunosuke: Oh! Is it some new hypothesis? Something to surpass super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis, maybe? Harebrayne: Ah...no, actually. This...is my autobiography. Susato: Your autobiography? Harebrayne: 'How I was Diddled and Fiddled'...by Albert Harebrayne! I've found I can represent my odd fortunes with only odd numbers in an ambitious set of simultaneous equations! Susato: ...Really? Harebrayne: I'm going to have to pay back all the loans I took for the kinesis machine, you see! So it's going to be a new serial publication from next month! 'Part 1: An Odd Birth; an Odd Upbringing'. Ryunosuke: (...You can't beat the man's optimism, that's for sure.) I see. Well...for now, would you mind if we talked a little more about the case? Harebrayne: Oh yes! YES! Of course! I've been working through the numbers! I WAS DIDDLED! I WAS FIDDLED! BY THE PAIR OF THEM! By Asman! And by that aloof engineer, Drebber! Ryunosuke: (We're not going to have to sit through an explanation of all these equations...are we?) 23rd October British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Ryunosuke: ...Oh, who's that standing beside Lord Stronghart? Susato: I wonder... I've never seen her before. Stronghart: Ah, the young champion of the court. You had some success this morning, I understand. And you've thrown the entire government into disarray as a result. Ryunosuke: Oh! You, you mean because of Professor Harebrayne's experiment? Stronghart: Sham science being demonstrated at London's Great Exhibition! The country's been made to look foolish, and now politicians are scrabbling to respond. Lord van Zieks is in Whitehall as we speak, giving an emergency briefing. Ryunosuke: Oh dear, I, um... I didn't mean to cause any trouble. Stronghart: None of this is your responsibility. The government is entirely to blame for having been taken in. The special dispensation that prevents investigation at the scene will be annulled later today. Once that happens, my Forensic Investigation Team will move in and deal with that scrap metal in no time. Ryunosuke: (It's scrap metal now, is it?) ???: Until later then, Lord Stronghart. Stronghart: Yes. Thank you. Ryunosuke: Um...who was that? Stronghart: That was Dr Courtney Sithe, Scotland Yard's esteemed chief coroner. She's leading the Forensic Investigation Team's handling of this case. She was just delivering her report about the victim, in fact. Ryunosuke: Oh, I see... (About Mr Asman.) Stronghart: Following the outcome of the trial earlier, I asked the coroner's office to re-evaluate its findings. I don't have time to tell you what she concluded. If you want to know, you'll have to ask her directly. You can find her in the forensics laboratory. Ryunosuke: Ah, right. Stronghart: Now, what were you here to see me about? I can give you...seven minutes and thirty-nine seconds of my time. Ryunosuke: (So he's not running quite so spectacularly late any more...) After clearing all Converse options: Ryunosuke: Oh yes! Lord Stronghart... Stronghart: Go ahead. Ryunosuke: It's about Professor Harebrayne's experimental machine. We'd like your permission to examine the remains, if possible! Stronghart: ......... Are you well versed in science, then? Ryunosuke: Not in the slightest! In fact, you could say I was barely aware of the subject at all until recently. Stronghart: ...Well the special dispensation legally preventing investigation of the machine is currently being annulled. Within a few hours, Dr Sithe's team of forensic experts will begin their own investigation. But I suppose until then, there's no harm in you looking at the wreckage, as long as you touch nothing. Ryunosuke: Thank you! (Being able to look at it is better than nothing!) Susato: And I'll be able to see it, too! Stronghart: ...Your time is up. You'll have to excuse me now, I'm afraid. My next engagement calls. Susato: We are extremely sorry to have troubled you when you are so busy, My Lord. Stronghart: I have important matters to attend to in preparation for the symposium, you understand. 23rd October Forensics Laboratory Ryunosuke: I believe this is it... Dr Sithe's laboratory. (That chemical smell really assaults the nose. And there's plenty to assault the eyes in here, too...) Susato: It looks as though the doctor isn't here. But we're here now, so we may as well do some... sightseeing, don't you think? Ryunosuke: What a seasoned tourist you've become, Miss Susato. (We could just have a little look around...being careful not to upset any restless souls...) After examining open book on desk: ???: What are you doing?! Ryunosuke: Ah! Sorry! We, um, had something we wanted to ask you, but you weren't here, so... Sithe: So you thought you'd snoop around? That's acceptable to you people from the East, is it? Well? What do you want? Ryunosuke: Ah, um... Lord Stronghart told us, you see... ...that it was you who examined the victim's body. Erm, Mr Asman's body, I mean. Sithe: ......... Susato: So we came to ask you about your findings. On Lord Stronghart's advice. Sithe: ......... Very well. If the Lord Chief Justice has given his consent, I'll tell you what our investigation revealed. But when we're done, you must leave immediately. After clearing Converse option: ???: Mama, what is this? Ryunosuke: ...Agh! (Wh-Where did SHE spring from? And...did she just call the doctor, 'Mama'?) Sithe: This is a 'lawyer', dear. ???: Oh... Ryunosuke: Um...hello. ...To meet you. P-Pleased to meet you. Yes, I'm a defence lawyer. Ryunosuke Naruho- ???: Mama... Sithe: Yes? ???: Can I cut this one up? Ryunosuke: What?! ???: I've never seen inside an Eastern person before. I want to know what it looks like. Sithe: Of course you can't. It's a live specimen, as you can very well see. ???: ......... Hmph. Boring. Ryunosuke: ......... (I, I think... ...I just had a near-death experience!) Susato: Oh dear! Mr Naruhodo, you're as pale as a corpse! Ryunosuke: Then let's leave before I'm mistaken for one! 23rd October The Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower Susato: I had no idea there were so many people in the world. Ryunosuke: I know what you mean. It's really packed here today. Susato: It feels as though it's taken us two hours just to make our way through the crowds to this point. Ryunosuke: Has it? I shut my brain down so I didn't really notice, to be honest. Susato: Gosh...I do wish I had your absence of mind sometimes, Mr Naruhodo. ???: ...There you are. I had a feelin' you lot would show your mugs before long. Ryunosuke: Oh! Inspector Gregson! I see you're hard at work as usual! Gregson: Warm greetings to you. I do hope you've been keepin' well since last we met. Ryunosuke: What's with all the ceremony? We just saw each other in court this morning. Gregson: Not you, sunshine. The gentlewoman so loyally at your side. Susato: Oh! Why, thank you, Inspector. How good of you to notice. Ryunosuke: (He might be a bit rough around the edges, but he's still a proper English gentleman at heart...I suppose.) As you've probably guessed, we were hoping to investigate the scene some more. Gregson: Right. Well, that's the young trainee's domain. Oi! Get over here, Gina! ......... Ryunosuke: ...She seems to be busy playing with a puppy. (Probably giving it a traditional 'East End' training...) Susato: G-Gina?! She's a police officer now? Ryunosuke: Amazing, isn't it? Gregson: She's a good kid, actually. Heart's in the right place, anyway. She's got the detection bug, if you ask me. Yup, I think she'll follow in my footsteps nicely. Ryunosuke: ...What do you mean? Gregson: I'm bein' transferred. It's time for me to say toodle-oo to London. Susato: Oh no! Really? Ryunosuke: That's, that's a bit sudden, isn't it? I had no idea. Where are you going to be posted, then? We'll come to see how you're getting along. Gregson: Haha, not likely. But you're welcome to try. If you don't mind a trip to France, that is. Ryunosuke: To France? Gregson: I'll be workin' in the Paris Police Prefecture. ...Should be right up my alley. Ryunosuke: But, but France! It's an entirely different country! I don't understand. Why would you be sent there? Gregson: That's the way the adult world works, sunshine! Now, don't go pokin' your nose in where it's not wanted. ......... I'm intendin' to take the kid with me when I go. Ryunosuke: What? You're taking Gina to Paris?! Gregson: Well I can't leave her here in London. Who knows what'd become of her. Ryunosuke: (...I suppose he's worried she'd slip back into slipping her hands into people's pockets and purses...) Susato: I don't think he's worried about her pickpocketing, Mr Naruhodo. I think he's worried about the Reaper. Ryunosuke: Oh! (Of course! So that's playing on Inspector Gregson's mind too, is it?) Gregson: Anyway, I haven't mentioned any o' this to Gina. So don't go blabbin', you hear me? Ryunosuke: N-No, of course not. Gregson: I've gotta keep that divin' diva safe an' sound. ...Until all this is over, at least. Gina: Oi! Did you just call me a bloomin' 'divin' diva' again?! Gregson: So you heard that, did ya? Right, well... Any questions about the scene, you can put 'em to my capable detective diva here. Gina: Alright, you 'eard the boss! Inspector Lestrade's in charge 'ere now! Ryunosuke: (...I suppose I'd better keep my word and not mention anything about Paris.) So, um, Gina... You've got a new dog, have you? Gina: Isn't 'e great? Toby's 'is name. Susato: Oh, how delightful! He's absolutely adorable! Ryunosuke: (Yes, the dog does seem lovely. But it's the not-so-lovely Inspector Gregson that's playing on my mind, to be honest...) After clearing all Converse options in British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office then clearing all Converse options in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower: Gina: Right then, 'Oddo! Leave it to me. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Gina: We're gonna get goin' after that dodgy engineer cove right this minute. Oh, but 'ang on... Someone's s'posed to be on guard duty 'ere all the time. Ryunosuke: I'm afraid we can't help. We need to get on with our investigation as well, Gina. Gina: Oh...right. Oh well, never mind. It ain't gonna be me wot gets it in the neck. It'll be the boss. Ryunosuke: (Poor, poor Gregson again...) Gina: Ready Toby? Got that oil scent, 'ave ya? Come on then, boy! See ya later! Susato: I do hope the scent of that oil leads them to that swindler's workshop. Ryunosuke: Yes, I hope so too. Ideally before the dog swims across the Channel to France. 23rd October The Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage Susato: Oh my! So this is the machine... ...that was used to deceive people into thinking instantaneous kinesis had taken place. Ryunosuke: Yes, that's right. Or rather it WAS the machine. It's a little worse for wear at the moment... Susato: What extraordinary lengths Professor Harebrayne went to in order to obtain the research grant. Ryunosuke: No no no! The professor was tricked as well. He didn't know anything about it. Susato: Yes, of course. ...It is amazing, though, isn't it? The scale of the whole affair is so very British. Ryunosuke: You're right about that. You'd never see such a grand deception in Japan, that's for sure. Susato: Oh look...is that... ...Lord van Zieks? Ryunosuke: ......... ...So, I think we're more or less done here, aren't we? Shall we, Miss Susato? Susato: Already? Ryunosuke: He IS the Reaper, remember. We'd do well to keep our distance, I think. Susato: But we have permission to be here! From the top! We're perfectly well allowed to investigate this machine... as long as we don't touch anything. Ryunosuke: From the top? Do you mean Lord Stronghart? Susato: Exactly. So we can stay here and stare at this wreckage for as long as we like! Ryunosuke: (She could have been at the centre of the explosion here and it wouldn't have bent her steel will...) After clearing all Converse options with Barok van Zieks: ???: ......... Van Zieks: ...Ah, the file I requested for the trial tomorrow. Thank you. Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: ...Are you alright? Susato: Who, who is this man, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Lord van Zieks's apprentice, apparently. (So I'm not the only one. Susato-san can see it too...) Susato: Um...Lord van Zieks... ...may we speak with your apprentice for a moment? Van Zieks: With him? ...Why? Apprentice: ......... Susato: Kazuma-sama! Apprentice: ......... ...Kazu...ma...? Ryunosuke: ...! (I don't believe it!) Susato: Your, your posture... Your presence... It can only be... It's you...isn't it, Kazuma-sama?! Apprentice: ......... Ryunosuke: (I felt something strange the very first time I encountered this cloaked figure. As if I knew him somehow... Can it...? Can it really be you, Kazuma?) W-W-Wait! (Too late...) Van Zieks: What's going on here? After examining large machine and large cage, and clearing all Converse options with Barok van Zieks: Susato: ......... You'd already met that masked man, hadn't you, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Yes. Yesterday, in fact. At Lord van Zieks's office. Susato: I see... ......... And if...if Kazuma-sama really is still alive... ...it means that Mr Sholmes lied to us. Ryunosuke: ...I know. (We're going to need to speak to him about that.) Van Zieks: You're going to have to leave now. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: The Forensic Investigation Team are due to arrive shortly. If they find you here, it will...cause problems. Ryunosuke: What sort of problems? Van Zieks: Foreign affairs problems. Ryunosuke: (...Well we could do without that.) Alright, we'll be on our way. Let's go, Miss Susato. Susato: Of course. The Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower After clearing Converse option in Forensics Laboratory, correctly presenting Drebber's Card in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower, and examining large machine, large cage and clearing all Converse options with Barok van Zieks in Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage: Ryunosuke: Well, I think we've done all the investigating we can here for now. If we could just determine the whereabouts of Mr Drebber... Susato: I'm sure Gina and little Toby won't let us down! Now then... ...do you think we ought to try to speak with Mr Sholmes at this point? We have things to discuss and I'm dying to meet him again after all these months. Ryunosuke: Yes, it's quite possible he might know something useful, you're right. We ought to find him at Madame Tusspells. He's supposed to be working there as a temporary waxwork exhibit. Susato: Yes! Iris told me all about his latest unusual venture! 23rd October Madame Tusspells Museum of Waxworks Susato: We really do need to speak with Mr Sholmes, and I am longing to say hello again... ...but where is he? Ryunosuke: ......... I think you might find...that he's quite nearby, actually. Susato: Oh! What, what do you...? Sholmes: Indeed, my dear fellows...it is I! The world-famous great detective and waxwork... Herlock Sholmes! Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: Susato-san! Susato-saaaaaan! Sholmes: My most humble apologies... Susato: I thought I'd died and gone to eternal paradise for a moment...via London. Sholmes: My dear madam...allow me to make amends by offering you a tasty free deduction at some point. Ryunosuke: ...As long as it's not of questionable street food quality. Susato: I don't understand. Why are you working as a waxwork here, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: Merely a secret identity, you understand. Though the case is largely solved now. Susato: Largely solved? Ryunosuke: We're talking about the waxwork abduction, I presume? Sholmes: Indeed we are, my good fellow. As I predicted, it was as easy as proverbial pie. Though I confess...I'm yet to partake of a pie, proverbial or otherwise. Or any food so far today for that matter. ......... *Rumble rumble rumble* Ryunosuke: (That stomach rumble echoed around the whole museum...) So how did you manage to solve it so quickly? Sholmes: Ah, well, do remember I said it was largely solved. Anyway, I simply negotiated with the culprit. Are you familiar with the so-called 'telephone'? Susato: Oh yes! It's a most modern invention, allowing you to hold a conversation with people far away. In Japan, only the imperial capital and a handful of other cities are connected as yet. Sholmes: This morning, a telephone call was received here from the perpetrator of the abduction. As such, I was able to negotiate terms, and in the end, the waxwork was returned. Ryunosuke: That's amazing! Sholmes: Just between you and I... ...it would appear the culprit had always intended to return the stolen waxwork in any event. Susato: Oh! But...I thought whoever was responsible had demanded a ransom, no? Sholmes: Yes. I think perhaps... ...the ransom demand was necessary to avoid unwanted suspicion regarding the true motive. Susato: But...does that not mean... ...your negotiating was entirely unnecessary? Sholmes: ......... A fact that I must ask you to keep from Madame Tusspells at all costs! A hungry young Iris awaits my return to Baker Street, after all. Ryunosuke: (Poor Iris...) Sholmes: Now then, do I sense that you have some business with this great waxwork? After clearing all Converse options and presenting Photograph of Drebber: Sholmes: I have a suggestion, Mr Naruhodo! Will you indulge me? Ryunosuke: Oh! Well...what is it? Sholmes: As I explained to you when you arrived, the missing waxwork has been returned. And I personally reinstalled it in the exhibit from which it was taken...behind those thick curtains. Ryunosuke: Oh, yes... The 'Professor' exhibit, isn't it? Sholmes: Would you like to see it? For a mere five shillings? ...That's a special, one-time-only price, you understand. Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: The opportunity won't come again, I might add. Wouldn't you like to see the fruits of my labour? Susato: Oh! Well, we do have a rather pressing investigation to carry out. Perhaps we could postpone...? Sholmes: The price is a very reasonable five shilling. I think you'll find it's well worth it. Susato: ...! Ryunosuke: Are you...? Are you being quite serious, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: Surely you need only look at my expression to ascertain if this is seriousness or silliness? Ryunosuke: (I can never tell with you, that's the point.) Susato: Very well, it couldn't hurt. Here's your five shillings. Sholmes: ...Gratefully received. So, the special exhibit awaits behind the curtain. I invite you to peruse it at your leisure. Susato: Well, the money's been spent, so... Let's go and see the special exhibit! Ryunosuke: (Hm, through those heavy curtains at last...) 23rd October Madame Tusspells Special Exhibit Susato: Oh dear... I, I felt a shiver run down my spine as soon as we walked in here. Ryunosuke: Miss Susato! I say we turn on our heels and go straight home...via a really big confectionery! Susato: We...we certainly can't do that. We've paid five shillings already! Ryunosuke: ...True. Actually, now I'm looking a little more closely... ...we've paid good money to see an exhibit that's clearly incomplete...! The nerve of the great diddling detective is far more terrifying than anything else in this place! Susato: This must be what Mr Sholmes meant when he said the case was 'largely solved'. Ryunosuke: (Be that as it may... ...Mr Sholmes heavily implied there'd be a clue about the engineer in here, didn't he? But where...?) Since we've paid five shillings, let's do five shillings' worth of investigation, shall we? Susato: Yes, we, we will get what we paid for! Ryunosuke: (Is that fear or frustration...that's making Susato-san's voice tremble?) Ryunosuke: Ah! Susato: Wh-What on earth...? How can...? Ryunosuke: (I, I don't believe it! A black monocle!) Susato: Mr Naruhodo! Is, is it possible that this man is... Ryunosuke: Yes... It's Enoch Drebber! Susato: The colour of his hair is different, but... Ryunosuke: ...It's unmistakably him! ???: Indeed it is. Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: This man is the subject of your present hunt, I believe? Ryunosuke: Yes, that's...that's right. Just who is this man? Why is he here in this exhibit? Sholmes: ......... Ryunosuke: And why does the convict behind him have no head? Sholmes: ...The head was missing when the model was returned by the thief who stole it. Ryunosuke: (What a surprise.) So then the case isn't yet solved, is it? Sholmes: Did I not say so myself? 'Largely solved' were my words, I believe. But I must locate the missing head 'tout de suite' as Madame would say, or I'll be in grave trouble. A very hungry Iris still awaits my return to Baker Street... preferably with rations! Ryunosuke: Aaargh! Susato: Do you know, though... Something about this room is strange! Ryunosuke: Strange? What do you mean? Susato: Well, the displays in the House of Horrors are supposed to depict real events, are they not? Sholmes: Indeed they are, Miss Susato. Do go on... Susato: And, as terrifying as they are, the scenes in the other exhibits are believable. But this one... This surely couldn't ever really have happened, could it? Sholmes: ......... I think it's time I educated you a little... ...about the nature of the incidents involving the Professor ten years ago. Ryunosuke: ...! After clearing all Converse options, examining camera on figure on left, and examining neck of headless figure: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Gina: W-W-Wot the bleedin' Nora, 'Oddo?! Wot 'ave you gone an' done?! Ryunosuke: Gina! What are you doing here? Gina: I, I asked Iris, and she said this is where ya'd be, so... SO! Susato: G-Gina! Not so loud in the museum! Sholmes: Madame Tusspells will have you take a position as a waxwork if you're not careful. Ryunosuke: I think there might be a more pressing concern! Gina: I, I still 'ad some flash powder left from six months ago, so... SO! Susato: Alright, Gina, we understand! But please...put down the gun! Gina: Sorry, I...I got scared. Ryunosuke: (You should try being the one on the other end of the barrel.) So...what brings you here, Gina? Gina: Wot brings me 'ere? Wot d'ya think?! We found it! We found that dodgy cove's workshop! Ryunosuke: What?! You found Drebber's workshop?! Gina: Yup! Toby's nose took me straight there! The boss an' the others are headin' over there now in a drag. So come on! Here's the address. I got the boss to write it out. Susato: Oh, thank you, Gina! We'll make our way there at once. Gina: Alright then! See ya there! Sholmes: ...You go. Don't mind me. I'll just stay here...being still. Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: I know my place...in the exhibit over there... Susato: Oh dear, someone is feeling sorry for himself. Ryunosuke: ......... Let's go, Mr Sholmes! You're coming! Sholmes: Your words hearten me, I must say. But if I were to shirk my duties here... ...Madame would have me pay monetary recompense and Iris's dinner plate would be empty once more. Ryunosuke: Forget that! I'll pay for everything! Sholmes: ......... Then there's not a moment to lose, my dear fellow! I shall hail a carriage at once! Ryunosuke: (No offer to share the cost from Mr Sholmes, then...) Susato: I shall gladly pay half, Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: Thank you, Miss Susato. Right, let's go! 23rd October Enoch Drebber's Workshop Ryunosuke: That looks like... Susato: Oh! It's another super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine! Sholmes: Indeed it would appear so. Though only a prototype, naturally. Gina: Ah, so ya got 'ere, then? Susato: Gina! Well done for finding this place! And in such little time... You've really worked miracles! Gina: It's Toby 'ere who's the miracle worker. Toby: Woof! Gregson: Ah...I thought you lot would show up before long. Ryunosuke: Hello, Inspector. (That's one knitted brow... He looks like he's eating a lemon, not a bag of fish and chips...) Susato: So, Inspector...is there any sign of the engineer? Gregson: Sadly not. We didn't find a soul in here. Susato: Oh...what a shame. Ryunosuke: Well, thank you for letting us know about this place and giving us the chance to investigate. Gregson: Accordin' to what Gina tells me, we only found it thanks to a clue that you lot turned up. I wouldn't wanna, say, go to Paris with a debt of gratitude unpaid now, would I? Ryunosuke: ...Thank you. Gregson: Anyway, if you're hopin' to snoop around in here, I'd get crackin'. Lord van Zieks and the Forensic Investigation Team are on their way here as we speak. Ryunosuke: Them again... Gregson: I imagine you've got the picture by now. They don't take too kindly to lawyer types. Ryunosuke: Right. Sholmes: So then, my dear fellow! Let's turn this place upside-down whilst we have the chance! Gregson: And you, Sholmes. Sholmes: Pardon? Gregson: They take even less kindly to 'great detectives' than they do to lawyers. Sholmes: Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha hah! Very droll, Gregson, very droll. But you may consider me nothing more than an inconspicuous waxwork model! Ryunosuke: (Right then...let's see what we can find in here!) After examining overturned trophy, large machine prototype, door, and quiver full of arrows: *Thud* Susato: Oh... Ryunosuke: Is something wrong, Miss Susato? Susato: Well...I thought I heard a noise. From the far side of that door. Well, Gina? Did you hear it too? Gina: Y-Yeah, I 'eard it an' all. Wot d'ya reckon, Toby? Toby: Woof, woof! Gregson: Right, mind the grease! *Thud!* *Thud!* *Thud!* Gregson: Whoever's in there, open up! This is Scotland Yard! .........*Clomp clomp clomp clomp**Squeak... Clunk!* Susato: Oh my... Someone IS in there! Gregson: Argh! This rotten, bleedin' lock! Sholmes: My dear Gregson, as I said only minutes ago... ...if only it were countenanced, I could unlock that door in less than a minute. Gregson: ...! ......... Fine. I'll take the rap for it. Just get us through that blasted door! *Click* Sholmes: There! You may enter at will. Ryunosuke: (You've confused minutes with seconds, I think...) Sholmes: Time is of the essence, I feel. What are we waiting for? Gregson: Nothin' for it, I suppose. This is an emergency. Sholmes: There's a strong possibility that beyond that door...is the engineer you all seek. Be prepared for action, my dear fellow! Ryunosuke: Yes! Mr Drebber's Back Room Ryunosuke: What...? What's happened in here? (Why is everything upside-down?) Gina: Rats! There ain't no one in 'ere after all! Susato: But, but there must be! It was only moments ago that we heard those noises. Ryunosuke: Maybe that was the sound of Drebber running away. Susato: But there's only one door into this room! Sholmes: And no windows that could afford an escape route. Those skylights are too high. Ryunosuke: (...? What's that up there? Are they footprints...on the ceiling?) Gregson: Blow me! What have we here, then? Looks like someone was tryin' to burn somethin' in a hurry. Susato: Oh, that looks like a set of blueprints! Ryunosuke: To what? Gregson: To that Professor Harebrayne's barmy machine, is it? Blimey! If we'd had these, there'd have been no need to muck about tryin' to investigate all that scrap metal! Sholmes: There is something of great interest here, too. This rope was lying on the floor at the foot of that pillar. Ryunosuke: A rope? What's significant about that? Sholmes: ...Never mind. You see, but you do not observe, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: ...! Susato: We must investigate the entire room thoroughly! And before the Forensic Investigation Team arrive, too! Ryunosuke: Um...Mr Sholmes? Have you found something? Sholmes: Ah, Mr Naruhodo. Yes, in point of fact, something rather fascinating. What do you make...of this? Ryunosuke: Hm, let's see... (I've never seen anything like it before.) It looks like a bundle of thick cigars wrapped up in a large watch to me, but- Aaaaaah! Ryunosuke: Miss Susato! What's the matter? Susato: That, that, that, that... That's a... Surely that's a time bomb...isn't it? Gregson: WHAAAAAAAAT?! Did you say...?! Gina: A...time bomb...? Ryunosuke: Um...sorry, but... ...what is a 'time bomb' exactly? Gregson: Eh? Sholmes: Ah ha ha ha ha hah! You truly are one of a kind, Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: (I won't take that as a compliment...) Gina: Hah! Ya don't know nuffin', do ya, 'Oddo! Ryunosuke: ...You haven't got a clue what it is, either, have you, Gina? Sholmes: I invite you to consult a dictionary later, Mr Naruhodo. But this particular specimen is no time bomb. Though I confess it has a very similar appearance. Susato: Oh! Oh, well, thank goodness! But then...what is it? Sholmes: ......... I see... So that's it... Ryunosuke: ...! Susato: Goodness! Mr Sholmes... Have you seen to the heart of the matter? Sholmes: There are times when I consider my lot most unfair. For I'm fated never to know how it feels to flounder as you do when a puzzle presents itself. But...I have learnt to accept the hardships that come with being a great detective, Miss Susato. Ryunosuke: (Here we go. I feel a great deduction coming...) Sholmes: Once again, I can draw two conclusions from the scene we see before us. The first... ...is that the inverted nature of the furniture in this room is the work of Drebber himself. Susato: Oh! But how could you...? Sholmes: And the second conclusion... ...is that the small device on the floor there is without question completely genuine. Susato: Please, Mr Sholmes! You must explain everything! Sholmes: ...It would be a pleasure. After all, it is a great detective's civic duty to teach Scotland Yard the finer points of the trade. Gregson: ......... Ryunosuke: (Well, Inspector Gregson seems delighted with the idea, anyway.) Sholmes: Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Susato: Oh, you deflected the inspector's glare with such fortitude there, Mr Sholmes! Well done! Sholmes: You're too kind, my dear madam. I hereby dedicate this great deduction to you. Kindly stand just there, Miss Susato. Susato: Oh...yes. I'd be delighted! Sholmes: So...shall we begin? Once again, Herlock Sholmes is proud to present...his 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'! The Great Deduction The game is afoot! Topic 1 Flipped Furniture Sholmes: It's plain to see that this room is in complete disarray. The bed, the table and chairs, the lamp... Everything is upside-down. Almost as if every item in the room had, until recently, been happily positioned on the ceiling... ...before falling straight down onto the floor. Susato: Every item in the room was on the ceiling... Are, are you suggesting that...? Sholmes: Indeed. The key here... ...is gravity. It would appear that technology has at last succeeded in freeing us from the great pull of the earth. For the gravity in this room was reversed, and then... suddenly restored to normality! Susato: Goodness! Sholmes: The inverted furniture clearly reveals the truth about the part gravity played in this whole business. I quite understand your scepticism, Miss Susato. I, too, was incredulous at first. However, my conviction in my analysis was cemented when I observed...this. An anti-gravity device...almost identical to one that featured in a dream of mine only the other day, in fact. Susato: But, but then why does it have a clock on it? Sholmes: A most relevant question, indeed. That is a timing device that controls when the gravity direction will switch. There was clearly a requirement for the engineer to be able to restore normal gravity automatically. And the commotion we heard earlier from the other side of the door was the moment that restoration occurred. Yes, the reason why everything in here has been turned upside-down is because of the anti-gravity device! So you see, we need look no further to explain the state in which we now find this room. The direction in which gravity acts in here was reversed by Mr Drebber... ...before being restored to normality in an automatic fashion some time later by the timer device! I have witnessed precisely this scene in a dream I once had when I fell out of bed. Topic 1 Flipped Furniture Conclusion Because gravity was reversed Topic 2 Missing Engineer Sholmes: Now, let us consider the next conundrum: What was our engineer friend's aim? Indubitably, the greatest clue we have to explain his actions...is above our heads. Susato: Yes, how is it possible that there are footprints all the way up there on the ceiling? Sholmes: A question whose answer will lead us neatly to the truth, my dear madam. The reason there are footprints on the ceiling...is because of the nearby skylight! Of course, Drebber's aim was singular: to escape. However, there is but one way into this room. ...Excepting the skylight, that is. Susato: Ah... Sholmes: By inverting the gravity in here, Drebber was able to 'fall' conveniently to the ceiling... ...and make his escape via the otherwise inaccessible skylight, leaving those footprints behind on the way. Susato: But the ceiling in here is very high, Mr Sholmes. If the gravity reversal was sudden, wouldn't Mr Drebber have fallen up to the ceiling rather violently? Sholmes: Hm, 'falling up' is both scientifically and philosophically a rather interesting concept, I feel. But the man was cornered with nowhere to run, so escape through the skylight was his only option. You may recall that I found this in the room earlier, which I believe offers a solution. Susato: Oh! The rope... Sholmes: To reach the intended destination, what better tool than this rope? By anchoring one end to the wall, the man was able to 'lower' himself safely to the ceiling. Which explains how Drebber was able to escape this room before our arrival. He reversed the pull of gravity and fled via the skylight! And personally, I should very much like to reverse the pull of gravity again now...just for fun. Topic 2 Missing Engineer Conclusion Escaped via the skylight Sholmes: Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this topsy-turvy puzzle! Gregson: ......... Gina: ......... Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: (She's completely spellbound...) Um, Mr Sholmes...there is just one thing that troubles me. Sholmes: I would expect nothing less. You're destined to be troubled by 'just one thing' for the rest of your life. Ryunosuke: The thing is... Is such a thing actually possible? An anti-gravity device, I mean. Sholmes: ...I would say that with man's current scientific knowledge at the turn of the twentieth century... ...it's no more possible than instantaneous kinesis! Ryunosuke: ......... But your whole deduction hinges on it! Sholmes: Ah, but my dear fellow... ...when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth... ...however improbable it may seem. Ryunosuke: Haah... Sholmes: It's a marvellous line, wouldn't you agree? One of my more enduring pearls of wisdom. I had Iris come up with the exact phrasing. My original was...clumsy. Ryunosuke: ...Yes, I have a feeling I've read it in something that Miss Susato lent me once. Susato: Susato: Actually...there IS one other thing, Mr Sholmes... Ryunosuke: (Ah, the spell's broken at last.) Susato: The rope you found was on the floor, wasn't it? Sholmes: Indeed it was. In lonely coils near the wall. Susato: But...if Mr Drebber had used it to escape in the way you described... ...wouldn't it still be tied to the wall? Sholmes: ......... Mysteries inevitably unravel in the end. As, I think you'll find, do ropes. And as evidence of such, you need only look at the mystery we faced in this room, now skilfully unravelled. Ryunosuke: (That argument is as circular as the coils of rope...) Susato: I think perhaps we might need to give Mr Sholmes the usual little helping hand. I'm sure with some minor corrections, the great detective's great deduction will lead us to the truth! Ryunosuke: Yes, you're right. And we must do it quickly, before Enoch Drebber gets too far away! Sholmes: If you're ready, then let us resume... ...Herlock Sholmes's 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'! Course Correction Hold it, Mr Sholmes! Topic 1 Flipped Furniture Conclusion Because gravity was reversed Sholmes: It's plain to see that this room is in complete disarray. The bed, the table and chairs, the lamp... Everything is upside-down. Almost as if every item in the room had, until recently, been happily positioned on the ceiling... ...before falling straight down onto the floor. Susato: Every item in the room was on the ceiling... Are, are you suggesting that...? Sholmes: Indeed. The key here... ...is gravity. It would appear that technology has at last succeeded in freeing us from the great pull of the earth. For the gravity in this room was reversed, and then... suddenly restored to normality! Susato: Goodness! Sholmes: The inverted furniture clearly reveals the truth about the part gravity played in this whole business. Susato: To think gravity could have been reversed in this very room! I find the whole idea utterly enthralling! Only Mr Sholmes could conceive of such an explanation! Ryunosuke: But the man himself admitted it was a scientific impossibility, so... Susato: Yes, you're quite right. We must completely discount the idea at once. Ryunosuke: Ooh, that's unusually merciless of you, Miss Susato. Susato: 'When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth.' The great detective himself said so, didn't he? Ryunosuke: While refusing to part with his dreams of anti-gravity devices... Susato: ...Yes, I suppose so. Ryunosuke: Well, let's see if examining this topsy-turvy scene a little more closely... ...reveals some proof that shows exactly what the gravity in this room was or wasn't doing! The inverted furniture clearly reveals the truth about the part gravity played in this whole business. Susato: If the reversal of gravity is scientifically impossible, perhaps we can prove it didn't occur? Ryunosuke: Well, to prove a hypothesis is wrong... Susato: ...The easiest way is just to find an obvious exception. Ryunosuke: (Let's have another good look around...) Ryunosuke: The upright vase clearly reveals the truth about the part gravity played in this whole business. Sholmes: Upon my word, Mr Naruhodo, you've surpassed yourself. By completely turning my argument on its head! Trying to impress your assistant here, perhaps? Ryunosuke: ...No one is trying to steal your spotlight here, Mr Sholmes. Trust me. Sholmes: As you rightly say, though it appears at first glance that all the furniture in the room is upside-down... ...this unassuming, slender vase is standing keenly to attention. And unlike the large safe, there is nothing affixing it to the floor. Ryunosuke: And it's the exception that breaks the rule. Sholmes: In short, much as it pains me... ...the gravity in this room was never inverted at all! Ryunosuke: ...My, my deepest sympathies for your loss. Susato: Oh, poor Mr Sholmes... Sholmes: But the show must go on! So...let us continue with our deductions. Now that we know this contrivance is not in fact an anti-gravity device, there remains but one other possibility. Ryunosuke: ...You don't say. Sholmes: Someone deliberately turned over every piece of furniture in here! Ryunosuke: Which might sound obvious, but leaves one mystery very much unsolved. Namely, why would anyone choose to do that? Sholmes: Quite! And naturally, there is an explanation. Yes, the reason why everything in here has been turned upside-down is because of the anti-gravity device! Ryunosuke: He's absolutely determined that this device must have something to do with it, isn't he? Susato: I'm afraid the lure of an exciting scientific explanation is too strong. Ryunosuke: Well...there's no doubt that somebody did this. Somebody turned all this furniture over. So whoever it was must have had a reason. Susato: I'm afraid nothing comes to mind at all, though. Ryunosuke: Well, let's look around and see if the answer presents itself. Yes, the reason why everything in here has been turned upside-down is because of the anti-gravity device! Ryunosuke: Now we've shown it was nothing to do with gravity, we know somebody must have done this to the furniture. But who? And why? Susato: Yes, those are the questions we really need to answer! Ryunosuke: Well we at least need to resolve one of them here! Ryunosuke: Yes, the reason why everything in here has been turned upside-down is because of the safe combination! Sholmes: Precisely! I believe, Mr Naruhodo... ...that you had a very similar experience once, did you not? Ryunosuke: Yes! Last year... ...when I bought a lottery ticket and noted the ticket number down on the inside cover of a book just in case! Sholmes: That's it! For people are forgetful souls at heart, and always make a written note of important information. Susato: ...Just keeping the ticket itself safe would be more sensible, I think. Sholmes: And what, pray, happened next, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: When the day of the draw came round... ...I'd forgotten which book I'd written the number in and had to turn my room upside-down to find it! Sholmes: That's it! For people are forgetful souls at heart, and always forget where they've noted things down! Susato: Not if you always note things in the same place... Ryunosuke: I actually won the second prize, you know. But I couldn't remember which magazine I'd slipped the ticket into, so I had to turn my room upside- Sholmes: Thank you, Mr Naruhodo, but I believe I've proved my point now. Which is that a very similar scenario has clearly unfolded in this room. Ryunosuke: Finding himself requiring access to the safe, the occupant of this room needed the combination code. He remembered that he'd written it on the underside of a piece of furniture, but forgot which one. Sholmes: ...Leading to the state in which we now find the room. Yes, Mr Drebber overturned all the furniture in here... ...in a desperate hurry to locate the combination code that would unlock the safe! Topic 1 Flipped Furniture Conclusion Because gravity was reversed To find the safe combination Solved Topic 2 Missing Engineer Conclusion Escaped via the skylight Sholmes: Now, let us consider the next conundrum: What was our engineer friend's aim? Indubitably, the greatest clue we have to explain his actions...is above our heads. Susato: Yes, how is it possible that there are footprints all the way up there on the ceiling? Sholmes: A question whose answer will lead us neatly to the truth, my dear madam. The reason there are footprints on the ceiling...is because of the nearby skylight! Susato: Well, if a change in the direction of gravity can't explain it, then how did those footprints get there? Ryunosuke: Yes, I feel as though that particular mystery has just become even harder to solve. Susato: I can't think of any other way to explain it at all. Ooh... Life was so much simpler in those halcyon days when gravity could be reversed. Ryunosuke: It was minutes ago. And those 'halcyon days' never existed in the first place. Susato: Well, I suppose we must simply put our faith in Mr Sholmes and observe the area in more detail. Ryunosuke: (...Putting our faith in Mr Sholmes is what gets us into these situations in the first place...) The reason there are footprints on the ceiling...is because of the nearby skylight! Ryunosuke: Those footprints up there on the ceiling really are a puzzle. Susato: And as they're so close to the skylight... ...it really is very hard to believe the two are unrelated. Ryunosuke: But perhaps we need to approach this from a different angle... Ryunosuke: The reason there are footprints on the ceiling...is because of the nearby shoe! Sholmes: And on closer inspection, there are clearly footprints all over the balloon as well. In other words, the aim was never the skylight at all, but the balloon. Susato: But...for what purpose? Sholmes: A green balloon... Hmmm, that seems somewhat familiar data. Ryunosuke: Ah! Susato: It was a piece of a green balloon's envelope that Mr Naruhodo and Iris found at the scene! Ryunosuke: And inside the green balloon that Master Gotts claims he saw above the stage when the incident occurred... ...was the second birdcage. The crux of the whole instantaneous kinesis deception... Susato: You, you mean to say...? Sholmes: If we assume the balloon in here is a model of the one used on the day... ...there is a strong possibility something may be concealed inside it. Something our absconder was desperate to retrieve before making a hasty getaway. Ryunosuke: But, but the balloon's out of reach! Sholmes: Hence why he resorted to a projectile. Namely...the shoe. Ryunosuke: Ah! Sholmes: Most probably, Drebber intended to tear a hole in the envelope by assailing it with the shoe. However, his efforts were thwarted when the shoe itself became a prisoner of those lofty heights. Susato: Oh, dear... We desperately need to examine that balloon. If only there were some way we could see inside... Sholmes: You may recall that I found this in the room earlier, which I believe offers a solution. Susato: Oh! The rope... Sholmes: To reach the intended destination, what better tool than this rope? Susato: ...Mr Sholmes has managed to bring the deduction back to the rope! Ryunosuke: Alright, I have to admit...that was clever. So we just throw the rope up to the balloon and then pull it down to us on the ground? Susato: ...Which is much easier said than done, I feel. And could take us a very long time as well. Ryunosuke: True. Perhaps we need a more surefire method. In fact, we already have one of course, don't we?! To reach the intended destination, what better tool than this rope? Ryunosuke: Oh, look! The hotheaded Mr Sholmes is trying to lasso the balloon! Susato: It would be wonderful if he succeeded. Then we could pull it down to us. But it would be even more wonderful if there were some better way. Ryunosuke: (And we need to think of it fast, before Mr Sholmes starts tiring of being a cowboy...) Ryunosuke: To reach the intended destination, what better tool than this crossbow? Susato: That was found at the scene, in fact! Ryunosuke: And in all likelihood, belongs to Mr Drebber. Sholmes: If the man had only brought it away with him that day... ...he could have avoided losing a shoe at such a critical time as this. Sholmes: So...shall we? Your curiosity is deeply stirred no doubt, my dear fellows. What is it that Enoch Drebber has hidden inside that balloon...? *BAM* Susato: Aaaaaah! Ryunosuke: W-What the...? A, a waxwork? Sholmes: Indeed it is. A waxwork head inside a metal mask. A mask that is shut tight and fastened with a strong and quite impenetrable lock. Ryunosuke: (So we can't see the face inside, that means.) Susato: Just a moment... This...this is the head of a waxwork model? Does that mean...? Oh goodness! Sholmes: I see you've joined the dots, Miss Susato. Excellent. Ryunosuke: Ah! (Of course! A headless waxwork model!) The case of the abducted Madame Tusspells model that you'd 'largely' solved... It was only the head of the killer that was still missing! Sholmes: Indeed it was. But I believe Madame Tusspells will now have to settle her sizeable account with me. This, as you have now surmised, is the head of the infamous Professor. Ryunosuke: Yes... Susato: But why is it here? Sholmes: ...This conclusively confirms my suspicions. The man responsible for stealing the Professor from Madame Tusspells... ...and returning it - sans tête - earlier today...was none other than Enoch Drebber! Ryunosuke: (This is incredible. Professor Harebrayne's case and the waxwork abduction are... They're inextricably linked! By Enoch Drebber's workshop!) The waxwork head has been entered into the Court Record. Sholmes: Well...it appears our logical pleasure cruise has come to an end, my dear fellows. All that remains is... Yes, to speak with the architect of this adventure. Susato: The architect? Ryunosuke: You mean...Mr Drebber? Sholmes: As it seems quite impossible that he escaped via one of the skylights... ...obviously the man must still be here in the room. Susato: WHAT?! Sholmes: And his location should be abundantly clear... ...if you simply reflect on the journey we've made together during this deduction. Ryunosuke: (Enoch Drebber is right here, somewhere in this room?) Sholmes: So, Mr Naruhodo, will you do the honours? Ryunosuke: ...Yes, of course. Mr Drebber's hiding place must be the... Mr Drebber's hiding place must be the... Susato: Where could Mr Drebber be hiding? I'm sure that we've already come across a clue that reveals the answer, you know. Ryunosuke: (Yes, it was when we deduced why all the furniture in here was upside-down, wasn't it? That gave us the answer, I'm sure.) Susato: We're very close now, Mr Naruhodo! I can sense it! Ryunosuke: Before we gained access to this back room, we heard noises from in here. Sholmes: Which tells us that the engineer was still in the building at that point in time. Ryunosuke: He was in fact searching for the combination to his safe. Sholmes: And pressed for time, made no attempt to right the furniture that he overturned in the process. From which we can deduce that his search for the combination happened very recently indeed. In summary...Mr Enoch Drebber... ...is, at this very moment, inside the safe! Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this topsy-turvy puzzle! Topic 2 Missing Engineer Conclusion Escaped via the skylight Inside the safe Solved Deduction CompleteElementary! Sholmes: So...Mr Naruhodo. I think perhaps it's time we ended this game of hide-and-seek, don't you? Ryunosuke: By opening the safe, you mean? Sholmes: What else? Ryunosuke: Let's see... The combination was one... Susato: Four three two five eight two. Ryunosuke: I knew that! (Alright then. Here goes...) You found me... Gregson: Right then, sir... Mr Enoch Drebber, I presume? Drebber: Correct. Ryunosuke: You'd better start talking! You tricked Professor Harebrayne with that bogus machine you built! Susato: And you shall have to explain the theft of the waxwork from Madame Tusspells as well! Drebber: Whilst I would be delighted to answer your many questions... ...personally, I would advise that you deactivate my little parcel first. Ryunosuke: Deactivate...? Susato: Your parcel...? Drebber: I refer of course... ...to the time bomb. I left it in a most prominent position. Susato: Ah! Drebber: Ha-ha-ha. I see. Stunned silence. You're all gearing up to die with me then? Susato: Nooooooo! Susato: Mr Sholmes! With only seven seconds to spare! Ryunosuke: That was too close for comfort! I've got one foot in the grave already! Gregson: Are you tryin' to help us get a killer, or get us killed?! Susato: Mr Sholmes's deductions can be...completely life-altering, can't they? Sholmes: Well, my dear fellows, that was a close shave. The resemblance to an anti-gravity device is really quite startling, I must say. Susato: Anti-gravity devices don't exist! Ryunosuke: (Whew, I wouldn't push it, Mr Sholmes...) After clearing all Converse options: Ryunosuke: I think we have a fairly good idea of what's been going on here now. But what about the two incidents you've evidently been involved in recently? Drebber: ......... Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne's instantaneous kinesis experiment at the Great Exhibition... ...and the waxwork model you stole, which this head belongs to. Drebber: That's no ordinary head, you know. That's the head...of the Professor. Clad in a mask with a lock so strong, I'm unable to open it safely to reveal the killer's identity. I've been considering carrying it around as...protection. After all- ???: That's enough! Sithe: What's going on here, Gregson? I'm sure you're aware that I have sole jurisdiction to investigate here. Gregson: Ah, um... Yes, well... Ryunosuke: (Dr Sithe again. So the Forensic Investigation Team are here...) Sithe: And you know full well this engineer is a key witness. Why are you allowing this lawyer access to him? If Lord Stronghart knew of this, you'd be finished. Gregson: ......... Sithe: You lot. Leave at once. Sholmes: My dear madam, there's no need for such a threatening tone, I assure you. After all, that's no way to greet an old acquaintance, is it, Dr Sithe? Sithe: Hello...Sholmes. Ryunosuke: (Mr Sholmes knows Dr Sithe?) Sholmes: If it's protecting the machine next door that's causing such a sour expression on your face, you are quite misguided. It's really nothing more than a shell, you- Sithe: Get out! Sholmes: But of course. We'll show ourselves the door. ...I see you haven't softened at all. Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: Yes? Sholmes: It would appear that our delightfully entertaining investigations have run their course for today. Ryunosuke: But, but Mr Sholmes...! Sholmes: Let us leave this place in the doctor's capable hands. Ryunosuke: ...! Sithe: I said get out! Now! All of you! Your presence here is not required either, Gregson. Gregson: ......... Understood. But I'll just say one thing before I head off: If it wasn't for this lawyer an' his companions... ...we'd never have found this place. And the whole workshop would've been blown to bits. There was a time bomb set in here that this lot disarmed. Ryunosuke: Inspector... Sithe: ......... Drebber: Kuh kuh kuh... Gregson: ...! Somethin' given you a chuckle, has it, Drebber? Drebber: Ah, so sorry. Didn't mean to offend. You're quite right of course. You did disarm the time bomb, didn't you? Yes... You did disarm that one. Gina: Eh? Wot are you...? 'That' one? Ya, ya mean...? Drebber: Kuh kuh kuh... It was an hour later that we heard the news. Of the enormous explosion that ripped through the experimentation stage at the Great Exhibition. Professor Harebrayne's invention and all its secrets...were blown away forever. To be continued...

Ready for today's proceedings?Harebrayne: ......... I hope so... I should be... Even I, with nothing left to-Sholmes:Good morning, my dear fellows!Ryunosuke: Oh, Mr Sholmes! You're here!Sholmes: Why, naturally! A true gentleman stands shoulder to shoulder with his friends in battle at all times!Ryunosuke: Thank you. I really appreciate it. ...I'll...see you later, then. Now, Professor... We really need you to remain calm in the courtroom today.Susato: Yes. Do try your hardest not to enter the witness stand uninvited again.Harebrayne: Yes! I will! I, I realise it was a mistake, but I-Sholmes:My dear fellows, I must interject!Ryunosuke: Oh...you're still here, Mr Sholmes. What's the matter?Sholmes: Surely you've overlooked some praise, have you not? To be cast in my direction, hm?Ryunosuke: Sorry? I don't follow.Sholmes: Must I spell it out? I, the great Herlock Sholmes... The greatest detective, of worldwide acclamation... ...arose at some ungodly hour to be here now! First thing in the morning! A miracle, you must agree!Ryunosuke: Well...if I must agree, then...Sholmes: As you know, my sleep is quite impregnable. Iris had to employ her full gamut of tactics: She pulled the covers off, shook me, poked both cheeks, punched me and kicked me from the bed. Then she poured a boiling cup of her latest experimental blend on my face and at last I was bestirred!Susato: Oh my... Iris has been busy.Ryunosuke: Iris doesn't have it in her to go that far. She's too nice.Harebrayne: Ah, I sense the spirit of a fellow scientist! One who relishes the infinite possibilities of blending tea!Sholmes: I'm the one worthy of praise here! Not Iris! This is my victory!???:Sorry to cut in...Ryunosuke: Oh, Inspector Gregson! Good morning!Sholmes: Gregson, my dear fellow, why the grim expression at this delightfully early hour?Gregson: Oh, I don't know. Maybe because I've been confronted with a grimmer expression, eh?Sholmes: Dear me... Are you going to take that insult lying down, Professor?Harebrayne: Wha...? WHAT...? I DOOON'T KNOOOW!Ryunosuke: (Poor Professor...)Gregson: Anyway, here's the paperwork you asked for.Ryunosuke: What paperwork?Sholmes: Ah, I took the liberty of requesting it yesterday. I have a feeling it may prove useful.Gregson: You wouldn't believe the hoops I had to jump through to get this brought out of the archives. It's the Professor's autopsy report.Susato: That... That mass murderer's?!Ryunosuke: (Who killed five members of the aristocracy...)Gregson: He was found guilty in a closed trial ten years ago now. It was all done under wraps. And he was quickly executed soon after the trial. ...It's all in here.The killer's autopsy report has been entered into the Court Record.Ryunosuke: I, I don't know what to say! Thank you, Inspector!Sholmes: Yes, much obliged, Gregson.Gregson: Us lowly lot at the Yard are just doing what we can...in the shadow of the great detective Sholmes, of course.Ryunosuke: Well then, Professor Harebrayne...this is it! Today we're going to lay all this to rest at last.Susato: I wish you the best of luck, Professor!Harebrayne: ......... I suppose...he'll be in there today, will he? Drebber...Susato: Yes. We expect the prosecution to summon him as a witness.Harebrayne: I'm still amazed that you managed to find him in just one day... I really owe you both so much!Bailiff: Counsel! And the defendant! The trial is about to resume. Kindly make your way into the courtroom at once!Ryunosuke: (This is it then. The final chapter. Funny. My heart's racing a little... I've not felt this before, actually. This strange foreboding... As if...something's going to happen in this trial that I'm not ready for. But I can't let that distract me from the only thing that really matters... Finding the truth!)24th October, 9:30 a.m. The Old Bailey CourtroomJudge: In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session again. We resume the public hearing of Albert Harebrayne, here present, who stands accused of murder. Are the counsels for the prosecution and defence ready to proceed?Van Zieks: The prosecution is ready, My Lord.Ryunosuke: ......... The defence is ready, My Lord. (As promised, Lord van Zieks has his apprentice with him. His apprentice with memory loss...)Susato: .........Judge: If I may, Lord van Zieks...Van Zieks: Yes, My Lord?Judge: There appears to be someone standing at your side...Van Zieks: Ah, yes. My apprentice and assistant. The prosecution believes today's proceedings will see the complexity of this case rise considerably. I therefore instructed my assistant to attend to ensure the smooth running of the trial.Ryunosuke: (And the smooth running of liquid refreshments, by the look of it...)Susato: The way he holds himself... The way he moves... It couldn't be anyone else...Ryunosuke: But he's still suffering from amnesia...so there's really nothing we can do at the moment.Susato: I know, but... Oh, this is so very hard.Judge: It would appear the prosecution has done a fine job in responding to the demands of the court made yesterday. I understand you have successfully secured the engineer who disappeared from the scene on the day in question.Van Zieks: ...Yes, My Lord. I intend to call him as a witness shortly.Judge: Very good, very good. Now then, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...who have been chosen at random to represent the will of the people in this courtroom today... ...are you ready and willing to proceed?Juror No. 1: Of course, My Lord. I'm sure we all understand the importance of doing our civic duty.Juror No. 2: I do so despise deception and deceit. I find it so very wearing...Juror No. 3: To take a man's life with a conjuring trick... It is against the magician's code, not to mention the law.Juror No. 4: Any fake scientists should feel the wrath of God, if you ask me!Juror No. 5: Um, we 'ave to listen to what's said on both sides 'the fence, and um...then settle on one... That's it, isn't it?Juror No. 6: Wasn't like this in my day. Wasn't like this at all...Judge: If all parties are ready to proceed, you may begin, Lord van Zieks.Van Zieks: Before I do, My Lord, there is a report I must read to the court. Yesterday at the Great Exhibition grounds, the evidence of primary importance in this case... ...the super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine, which was installed on the experimentation stage... ...was deliberately destroyed in an explosion effected by an unknown person or persons.Juror No. 1: It was...WHAT?!Juror No. 6: An explosion?!Juror No. 4: This...is an outrage!Judge: Yes, I heard this grave news yesterday. Scotland Yard submitted a report to my office in the evening. I read that the machine was blasted to smithers, and the wreckage reduced to ashes in the flames.Van Zieks: I have here a photographic print of the scene, taken in the wake of the explosion. It shows what little remains of the machine.Judge: Hm, yes... A terrible business...Ryunosuke: (He did it to destroy the evidence, did he?)Susato: That Enoch Drebber...Judge: The court will take this print as evidence, Counsel.The post-explosion photograph has been entered into the Court Record.Van Zieks: Late yesterday afternoon... ...the protection afforded to the machine by the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act was revoked. However, before a thorough investigation could begin, the invention was obliterated from existence. As such...this will become a very different trial.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: As it stands now, with no evidence on which to draw meaningful conclusions... ...the authenticity of the kinesis machine will remain forever in obscurity.Judge: Hm, indeed... A most unfortunate state of affairs.Van Zieks: However, one thing remains clear: The victim's death was the result of the actions of the accused. Of that we can be certain. For it was the accused himself who was operating the machine and who ultimately caused its loss of control.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: As Lord van Zieks rightly says, this is a very different trial now.Van Zieks: ...!Ryunosuke: The accused accepts responsibility for his part in the events that transpired. He acknowledges that Mr Asman died as a result of the accident caused by his machine's malfunction. However, unbeknownst to the professor... ...he was being deliberately deceived by a pair of very clever fraudsters.Judge: Names, Counsel, if you please.Ryunosuke: The engineer, Mr Enoch Drebber, and the victim himself, Mr Odie Asman.Van Zieks: .........Ryunosuke: So what exactly were these two men up to behind the defendant's back?! The defence intends to expose that information, thus establishing the unequivocal innocence of the defendant!Judge: Thank you, Counsels. The positions of the prosecution and defence have been clearly stated. Lord van Zieks, summon your first witness, please.Van Zieks: At once, My Lord. The prosecution calls the engineer, Mr Enoch Drebber, to the stand!Van Zieks: State your name and occupation for the court.Drebber: Name...Enoch Drebber. Occupation... ...hard to pin down, I would say.See that black monocle?Yes, why do I feel as though I've seen it somewhere before...?Oh! You, too? I had exactly the same feeling myself.Hm...Drebber: .........Judge: Your file indicates that you are currently being investigated in connection with another case. The theft...of a waxwork model, is it? A most extraordinary-sounding business.Drebber: ...But that has no bearing on this trial, I assure you. Cleave it from your mind.Van Zieks: You're familiar with the public experiment carried out at the Great Exhibition some days ago? The accused's super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis demonstration.Drebber: Yes...you could say that. I am aware of it. There was a terrible accident, wasn't there?Van Zieks: It was you, Mr Drebber, who constructed the vast machine used in the experiment. Or so our investigations indicate. Can you confirm your involvement?Drebber: Yes, I constructed it. In precise accordance with the blueprints. But that's all.Van Zieks: Then the court would be very interested to hear your thoughts about the machine, I'm sure.Drebber: ......... An amazing device, if you ask me. The pinnacle of modern science, making instantaneous kinesis a reality at last.Ryunosuke: What?Judge: Good... Good gracious! Do you mean to say... ...that the experiment was bona fide? Is that your belief, sir?Drebber: Yes, that is very much my belief. Such a waste that it blew up.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: But we've already established the machine was nothing more than a prop for an elaborate conjuring trick!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: You've established nothing of the sort.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: All that was shown during yesterday's proceedings... ...is that the same outcome could have been produced by means of stage trickery. The defence merely proposed a method and demonstrated its feasibility, nothing more.Ryunosuke: But...but...Judge: We've procrastinated long enough, I feel. Witness, you will now give your formal testimony... ...about the machine that you constructed for the purpose of the demonstration at the Great Exhibition.Drebber: ...Understood.Witness Testimony - The Kinesis Machine -Drebber: I met the young professor approximately one year ago, through Mr Asman's introduction. He provided me with the blueprints and I constructed the machine to his precise specifications. It was no trick. If the whole show was a fraud, it would have required a body double. Tell me...did the victim have a twin? All the spectators saw the birdcage appear above their heads and then crash headfirst into the Crystal Tower. A terrible accident, I grant you. Perhaps the science on which the machine was built was flawed somehow?Ryunosuke: A, a body double?!Drebber: That goes without saying, surely? To give the impression that something has moved when in reality it hasn't. It's a basic conjuring principle. The deception cannot be achieved without substituting the original with a fake at some point in the performance. But would I be right in saying...you haven't managed to establish anything along those lines?Ryunosuke: Ugh...Van Zieks: Incidentally... ...the prosecution has already confirmed that Mr Asman had no twin siblings.Judge: Hmmm... It's my understanding that this witness is well-versed in conjuring artfulness. But such talents do not indicate that he was actually able to accomplish what he claims. Namely the construction of what, by all accounts, must have been an extremely complex scientific machine.Drebber: ...Whatever do you mean?Judge: Yesterday's proceedings brought the true nature of your past exploits to light, Mr Drebber.Ryunosuke: Indeed it did, My Lord! As a swindler who preys on innocent scientists to elicit government grant money through conjuring know-how.Drebber: ...Yes, it's true that I possess considerable knowledge of stage magic. But crucially, my scientific knowledge more than matches that of any academic in the field.Van Zieks: Investigation of the witness's workshop attests to that claim, My Lord. As evidence, the police found this Royal Society trophy for young talent in science there.Susato: Yes, that's true. We spotted it there ourselves!Drebber: If a hypothesis is sound, it can always be forged into a physical manifestation...with sufficient skill. Though I may have sold the secrets of some deceptive wiles to snivelling, talentless scientists in the past.Judge: Would, would you therefore assert...that the explosion of the machine was...Drebber: An unfortunate accident. ...Or, of course, a deliberate act of murder carried out by misuse of the science.Judge: Counsel for the Defence...your cross-examination, please!Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord!Cross-Examination - The Kinesis Machine -\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Susato Mikotoba\nDescription: A judicial assistant sent to Britain on a study tour.

Wondrous new works of culture and industry from every corner of the globe had converged on Hyde Park. Welcoming over fifty million visitors, the last great hurrah of this century astonished and delighted people of all nations, and ended on a note of resounding success. But, as regards to the terrible catastrophe that occurred during the festivities, very few are aware my friend, Mr Herlock Sholmes, had a hand in unravelling the matter. For, from the shadows, it was he who earnestly unearthed the facts of the case. And like the centrepiece of the Great Exhibition, which rose high into the skies of Hyde Park, Sholmes's brilliant deductions - as clear and lofty as the Crystal Tower itself - brought the truth to light. Rendered dialogue We're here at the showground of the Great Exhibition, which is absolutely packed with people... The weather is unusually fine, and we're about to witness a most extraordinary scientific experiment! Ladies and gentlemen, the twentieth century will see steam engines and electrical power dominate the world! Horse-drawn carts will give way to the motor car! Ships will sprout wings and take to the skies! And today, we showcase even more advanced technology! A glimpse into the future! A world first! A demonstration of my super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine! A man will literally be disassembled by a pulse of high-voltage electricity, and beamed to another location... ...whereupon his body will be reassembled by a series of complex calculations exactly as it was before! In but a few moments from now... ...this gentleman will, in the blink of an eye, complete an incredible journey through the air... ...to arrive an instant later, on the Crystal Tower behind you! 22nd October, 9:36 a.m. Sholmes's Suite Ryunosuke: ......... Iris: ...Runo! Runo, are you listening? Ryunosuke: Oh! Sorry, um...what was that, Iris? Iris: Hmph. What's the matter with you? You've been miles away all morning. Didn't you like what I cooked for breakfast? Ryunosuke: No no, that's not it at all. Um...what were we talking about again? Iris: Today's paper! It's full of news about the Great Exhibition again! Ryunosuke: Ah yes...the Great Exhibition... I'd like to go sometime. ......... Iris: You're really not your usual self today. You seem very down. Don't you agree, Hurley? Sholmes: Hm...? Did you say something? Iris? Iris: Oh gosh! You're even more down! Sholmes: ......... UWAAAAAAAAAGH!!! Wh-When did you arrive, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: I've...been here for about half an hour already. We had breakfast together. Sholmes: What?! Why didn't you mention it before? Ryunosuke: I, um...thought you might have known I was here. You know, because...breakfast? Sholmes: Hm, Iris is quite right. You're clearly lacking in vim. So much so that I didn't notice your presence. Ryunosuke: (...Thanks.) Sholmes: Of course, I could deduce the reason perfectly well with some simple observations. Ryunosuke: What?! Sholmes: Let's see... Yes, for example, your tussled hair this morning, with all its unruly spikes. Clearly it can be deduced therefore, that- Ryunosuke: Um, let me stop you there, Mr Sholmes, because I think I can see where this is going. My hair always looks like this. It always has. Ever since we first met, in fact. Sholmes: Oh really? How interesting. It just doesn't look like a haircut as such, I suppose. Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Ryunosuke: (...Thanks again.) ......... It crossed my mind recently...that it's been six months now. Iris: Six months? Ryunosuke: Since I was forbidden from working in court. So I've been wondering how much longer I'm going to be banned. Iris: Oh... Well, that would explain why you seem rather glum. Don't you agree, Hurley? Sholmes: Hm...? Did you say something? Iris? Ryunosuke: (Ah...back to moping...) Ryunosuke: What's the matter with Mr Sholmes today? He seems even more down in the dumps than me. Iris: I know! And the Great Exhibition has opened! You'd think he'd be excited. Oh, why don't we all go to see it together? Sholmes: I want to! Of course I do! But I can't! ...Not for the time being. Ryunosuke: Why not? Sholmes: Why not? Why not?! Because! I'm a great detective, after all! Ryunosuke: (So you're embroiled in some tricky case that you can't be distracted from? Is that it?) Iris: I don't remember hearing that you're working on a case, Hurley. Sholmes: ......... Ryunosuke: (I suppose I should try to find out what's going on.) After clearing all Converse options: Sholmes: Well, I must be leaving now. Ryunosuke: Yes, understood. See you later, Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: Hah! You really are a shameless liar sometimes, my dear fellow! Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: You seek to put me off my guard and follow me, don't you? Well, you would be wasting your time. Ryunosuke: The thought hadn't crossed my mind! (But now I'm wondering where you're going...) Sholmes: Ah ha ha ha hah! Well then, 'see you later' indeed! Ryunosuke: (Listen to him. He's still laughing on his way out of the door...) Iris: Alright then, Runo! Let's get going! Ryunosuke: Oh! Um, Iris... What are you wearing? Iris: I've got changed to go to the Great Exhibition. You're going to take me! Ryunosuke: What? But, but I was just about to go to the Supreme Court... Iris: Oh! Well that sounds fun, too! You're going to take me there, then! Ryunosuke: Alright, fine. Just...lower that weapon, would you? Iris: Of course! And after the Supreme Court, then we'll go to see the Great Exhibition! 22nd October Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy 22nd October British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Ryunosuke: It's been about six months now since I was last here. But some things never change. Like the sense of foreboding I always seem to feel in this place. (It doesn't seem to be bothering Iris at all, though. She's happily reading over there...) Iris: Oh, I love this place! I always find so many interesting books here! Ryunosuke: Of course. I was forgetting that you've been here before. (The time we came here six months ago... ...when Susato-san was given the news that she was to return to Japan.) ???: Ah. I understand you wish to speak with me. Ryunosuke: Oh! L-Lord Stronghart! I trust you've been k-keeping well? Stronghart: Let's see... Since you've arrived and requested an audience, it's been four hours, thirty-two minutes and... ...twenty-six seconds. I've kept you waiting a while. My apologies. Ryunosuke: Oh no, not at all! I like nothing more than standing around, staring into space. Stronghart: ...Good to know. Ryunosuke: (...Good to know that doesn't appear to bother him at all.) Mael Stronghart, Lord Chief Justice of London. He's the man who allowed me to start practising as a defence lawyer when I arrived in Britain as a student. You need only savour the air for a moment in this grand office to understand his pre-eminent status. Stronghart: As you will be aware, the Great Exhibition of London is now underway at last. We're extremely busy as a result. Policing the grounds, guarding the new technologies, dealing with petty crime... And furthermore, as of next month, we shall open the International Forensic Science Symposium. Ryunosuke: Oh...I've not heard about that. Stronghart: Investigating authorities from forty countries around the globe will be taking part. Including from your own land. Forensic science is the future! The world must embrace it! As we're the hosting nation, I have much to do. And it is my highest priority. If others must wait for my attention as a result, so be it. Ryunosuke: (...Well, it's nice to know where I stand.) Stronghart: So...you wish to consult with me? Of course, I can very well imagine what this is about. Ryunosuke: Ah...well, um... Thank you for agreeing to this meeting, My Lord! (I want to be allowed to start working as a defence lawyer again in court. That's what brought me here today. But actually, there's something else playing on my mind, as it happens...) Iris: Runo, just take a deep breath and come out with it! After clearing all Converse options: Stronghart: Well, I must be leaving for my next engagement. I'm already...eleven hours and sixteen minutes late. ...My colleagues may be starting to fidget. Ryunosuke: E-Eleven hours late? That's...quite something. Stronghart: That meeting had already started when I arrived back here for this engagement with you. So lateness was inevitable. Time stops for no man. Ryunosuke: (I'm sure it stopped for me during those twelve solid arguments and two hundred and twenty-three reasons...) Oh, yes! Where would I find Lord van Zieks now? Stronghart: I would assume he's at his office. Ryunosuke: (Right, I'll go and ask him about the attack in person. I want to get this straight from the horse's mouth...) Stronghart: Away with you now. I'm leaving Professor Harebrayne's defence entirely in your hands. Ryunosuke: Of, of course, yes! Thank you very much, My Lord! 22nd October Prosecutor's Office Iris: Ooh! So this is the legendary Reaper's office? Ryunosuke: Yes, it appears so. Iris: Brrr, it sends a chill down your spine, doesn't it? What an amazingly deathly atmosphere! Ryunosuke: ...Oh, is that...? (That hooded figure was so still, I hadn't noticed his or her presence. I wonder who it is...?) ???: What are you doing here? Ryunosuke: Agh! Van Zieks: ......... Ryunosuke: (He's as unwelcoming as I thought he'd be. Actually, maybe even more so...) Oh, I, um... I'm glad to see you're well. Van Zieks: ...I am. Ryunosuke: ......... So...who's the person over by the wall being...punished for something or other? Van Zieks: No punishment is taking place here. Ryunosuke: Oh. Van Zieks: That's my apprentice. And he's sitting there of his own free will. Ryunosuke: I didn't know you had an apprentice. (It must be the same person who was pictured in the newspaper...) Van Zieks: He's very able in combat. ...A requisite skill for anyone under my tutelage. Ryunosuke: Are you referring to the attack on the Reaper that was reported in the papers? Van Zieks: The Reaper? I'd be interested to know the Reaper's true identity myself. Assuming, that is, such a fabled fiend genuinely inhabits our great courtrooms... After clearing all Converse options: Van Zieks: Ah yes, there's something I've been meaning to ask you... Ryunosuke: Oh! What's that? Van Zieks: That Nipponese man. Is he faring well? Ryunosuke: Sorry? Van Zieks: The one arrested twice in succession six months ago. With the stoop. And the moustache. And the jitters. Ryunosuke: Ah! Mr Natsume, you mean? Iris: ...I'm not sure he'd be very pleased to find out you identified him from that list, Runo. Ryunosuke: He's fine, thank you. In fact, I received a letter from him by international post only the other day. Van Zieks: I see. ......... Well, I think we can end our discussion there, don't you? There's little time left before tomorrow's trial. I advise you to spend it investigating the case. Ryunosuke: Yes, thank you for the advice. And for the conversation. (I can't believe he's asking after Soseki-san. After a 'Nipponese'! I'm not sure whether to feel happy about that or worried.) Iris: I never imagined that Mr Reaper would be friends with a mad scientist, did you? That's a turn-up for the books! Ryunosuke: A mad scientist? Ah, you mean Professor Harebrayne? (Yes, it might be worth quizzing the professor about his relationship with Lord van Zieks, I think.) 22nd October Local Prison, Cell 11 Ryunosuke: The warden said cell eleven. That's this one... Iris: Oh! There's someone curled up in a ball in the back corner, look! Ryunosuke: What's his name again? Professor Albert Harebrayne, wasn't it? ...Um, excuse me! Professor Harebrayne! Harebrayne: ...! Who are you? Ryunosuke: I'm Ryunosuke Naruhodo. I'm a defence lawyer. Harebrayne: A LAWYER! Ryunosuke: Agh! (Was it something I said?!) Harebrayne: A, a lawyer, you say? W-W-W-Would you be here... a-a-a-about the experiment? ARE YOU GOING TO DEFEND MY HYPOTHESIS?! Ryunosuke: Your...hypothesis? Sorry, I don't- Harebrayne: Yesterday's demonstration! That demonstration was... That magnificent demonstration was... It was an out-and-out success! By anyone's calculations! B-B-B-But despite that... ...no one listens! No lawyer believes in the science! When it's explained, they all leave...at high velocity! Haah... Ryunosuke: ......... (Now's probably not a good time to mention that your zeal made my concentration leave for a while, too...) After clearing all Converse options: Ryunosuke: So, Professor, let me just make absolutely sure I've understood you properly. The huge explosion that occurred yesterday... That was an accident, you're saying? You had no intent to harm the victim, who was in fact the sole investor in your work. Is that correct? Harebrayne: As correct as two squared is four! I swear it! Yes, it's true that the man perished in a machine of my invention. So I know that I'm far from blameless in all this. But still! I would never use my discoveries, my inventions, to take a person's life! Not in a centillion years! I'm a man of science! It's all I know! You have to believe me! Please! Do you believe me? Do you believe in my hypothesis? Science is the pursuit of truth, you know. I've always believed that. All my life! Ryunosuke: ......... I'm afraid I don't know much about science. Or your theories. But I do believe you. And I will fight to prove your innocence with all my might. I'm a man of the law! It's all I know! You have to believe me! Please! Harebrayne: ......... When I went to live in Germany after I graduated, I learnt something very important. Nationality, class, lineage...none of that matters. As long as you try your hardest, you can achieve anything. Ryunosuke: Thank you for that, Professor. Harebrayne: And thank you in advance for defending me tomorrow in court! Iris: Alright, Runo, it's time! Time to visit the Great Exhibition! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Iris: Well, that's where the incident happened, isn't it? Ryunosuke: Yes, I suppose that's true. (Time to investigate at last!) 22nd October The Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower Ryunosuke: Ugh... The showgrounds are a little too big for my liking... We've been walking around in dense crowds for two hours now, and I've felt myself swooning three times. Iris: There are a lot of people, aren't there? I've almost been trodden on three times, too! Ryunosuke: ...Be careful, won't you, Iris? Don't let go of my hand. (We've finally made it through the throngs though, by the look of it. Here we are underneath the public experimentation stage where the explosion happened yesterday.) ???: .........! ???: .........! Ryunosuke: (What's that...? I can hear voices from up on the stage. It sounds like an argument...) ???: Right, I've had it with you this time! I'm warnin' you, I'll arrest you in a minute! ???: Oh yeah? Go on then, 'Spector, give it a shot! You ain't got no evidence, an' you know it! Ryunosuke: (Wait... I know those voices.) ???: You've got a cheeky little mouth on you, young lady! But a night in the cells will teach you some manners! ???: Just try it, I dare ya! If ya want that bag o' chips rammed down yer throat! Iris: Yoo-hoo! Gregsy! What are you doing up there? Gregson: ......... Ah! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! It's you! Here! You're here! Here you are! You! Here! Your Ladyshiiip! How are you, Your Ladyship? I do hope you're well, Your Ladyship? Ryunosuke: (...Does that make her three times a lady?) Iris: I'm not well at all. It's far too busy everywhere. I wanted to ride in a balloon, but there was a three-hour queue. Gregson: Unbelievable! I'll go an' have a word for you at once, Your Ladyship! You'll be flyin' as high as a kite in no time once I pull some strings for you! Ryunosuke: Tobias Gregson, an inspector at Scotland Yard. Until recently, he was suspended from duty, but it would appear he's back in action now. He's actually quite well known, appearing as he does in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'. And for that reason, he can't say a word wrong to the stories' author, Iris. (But there are limits, surely... Or there should be!) Gregson: Watch it, sunshine! Ryunosuke: S-Sorry... Gregson: What gives, then? Don't tell me you're on this case? Ryunosuke: Yes, I'm acting for the defence. Iris: So we're here to investigate! Gregson: Hmmm... Dear me, that's the situation, is it? Ryunosuke: (Is it really that troubling?) ???: Tsk. A measly five bob? Is that all ya got? Yer a lawyer, ain't ya? Ya could stand to carry a bit more copper around in yer pockets, Mr Narra-'Oddo! Ryunosuke: Wha...? Hey! That's my last bit of spending money, that is! ???: Ya can 'ave it back, but I'll 'ave to charge ya for all the bother. Three bob. Ryunosuke: This is Gina Lestrade, a pickpocket, or 'diver', born and bred in the East End of London. In the case that led to my own suspension six months ago... ...this is the young girl I was defending in court. Gina: Wot's yer problem, eh, 'Oddo?! 'Diver'? Pickpocket? Wot's wiv all the name-callin'? You wanna bag o' chips rammed down yer throat an' all, do ya? Ryunosuke: I, I thought you were proud to be a diver, Gina? You were just arguing with Inspector Gregson about it, weren't you? I assumed you'd been up to your usual tricks here at the showground. Gina: That ain't no way to talk to a lady, 'Oddo. 'Alf a year's a long time. People can change. I'm an apprentice now. Learnin' to be a Scotland Yard detective. So you'll 'ave to call me wot everyone else does: It's Inspector Lestrade now! Ryunosuke: In... Inspector?! (That badge is homemade, surely...) Gregson: The 'inspector' part isn't entirely accurate. No one calls her that. For what it's worth, anyway. Investigatin' is off the cards for all of us. Iris: What's that supposed to mean? Gregson: Right, well, I'll be back up top. You hold the fort down here, alright? Gina: Right...sir. Ryunosuke: (This... This raises a LOT of questions!) After clearing all Converse options and examining green cloth on ground, device on ground, and large hole in glass in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower and clearing all Converse options and examining large machine in Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage: Iris: Runo, Runo, listen! Ryunosuke: What? What is it? Iris: I've been thinking... Hurley might know something, mightn't he? Ryunosuke: About what? Iris: About Mr Reaper! Ryunosuke: ...! About what happened to Lord van Zieks, you mean? (Because it sounds like something very significant occurred after he graduated from university. Something that completely changed his life.) Maybe, but I have no idea where to find Mr Sholmes at the moment. He's in the middle of some big case, isn't he? Iris: Here, this is what you need! Ryunosuke: What's this? (Some kind of entrance ticket?) 'Madame Tusspells'? Is this supposed to mean something to me? Iris: You don't know it?! It's the most popular attraction in London at the moment! It's very close to Baker Street, actually. We could go now, if you like? Ryunosuke: No no, we don't have time for visiting attractions today, Iris. We have a big trial tomorrow! Iris: But that's where Hurley is. Ryunosuke: What? At, at this popular London attraction? Iris: Yes! Ryunosuke: How is it that you know where he is? Iris: Hurley told me. But he told me to keep it a secret from you, Runo. Ryunosuke: Madame Tusspells...? (I don't see how it could be related to the case we're investigating here, but then... ...stranger things have happened. And when they happen, Mr Sholmes is usually at the heart of them.) 22nd October The Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage Ryunosuke: So that's it, is it? The machine that blew up. Iris: Ooh, it must have been a magnificent explosion! And I've seen my fair share. Ryunosuke: You've seen things like this before, you mean? Iris: Of course! Hurley's always doing experiments that end in a bang. In fact, in his own words, 'Explosions are the very essence of chemistry!' Ryunosuke: Ah...that might explain the smell of burning that frequently comes wafting up the stairs. Iris: One time, he made something that exploded with such force, it took the roof off the building! I wish you'd been there to see it, Runo! Ryunosuke: ...It's hard to get too excited about that...given that I now live in the roof. Iris: Well anyway, that's enough about that. It's time to investigate! Ryunosuke: Ah look, Inspector Gregson is over there. He seems to be deep in thought about something... whilst eyeing up the machine carefully. Iris: Really? He just looks confused to me. Ryunosuke: It ripped itself apart magnificently, didn't it? Iris: Magnificently...and mercilessly. Ryunosuke: So someone stands in the middle of the machine to be disassembled and then 'beamed' through the air... Iris: Yes, 'beamed' not 'blasted'. That's the point. Ryunosuke: (Yes, that part's crucial, really.) Is something like that even possible, though, Iris? Iris: Oh, Runo. I'm just a child. How should I know? Ryunosuke: (A child when it suits you, you mean...) Iris: From what I can tell, I think if you were to pull this lever here- Gregson: STOOOOOOOOOOOOP! Don't touch that! Iris: Ah ha ha! That was practically instantaneous kinesis the way you flew over just now, Gregsy! Gregson: Please, Your Ladyship... I didn't mean to startle you, but I can't let you touch anything up here. Iris: So sorry. You can have some of my latest special blend to make up for it. Gregson: *Glug* *Glug glug glug* Aaah! Wonderful! This stuff really is wonderful! Ryunosuke: (It's just like old times, this is...) We're representing Professor Harebrayne in court tomorrow, Inspector. So we should be allowed to examine the scene! Gregson: Hah! Listen, sunshine, even I'm not allowed to touch anythin' up here! It's that blasted Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act to blame. It's drivin' me potty! Ryunosuke: Oh yes, that special dispensation... (The professor mentioned that, too.) Gregson: More red tape's all we need. I dunno what the government thinks it's playin' at sometimes. Iris: But...we're allowed to just look, aren't we? Gregson: Eh? Iris: Surely that's alright...isn't it, Gregsy? Gregson: ......... 'Course, Your Ladyship! Anythin' you say, Your Ladyship! But please don't get your dainty hands dirty, will you? Iris: Don't worry. We wouldn't dream of touching anything, would we, Runo? Ryunosuke: (She really knows how to get what she wants...) After clearing all Converse options and examining green cloth on ground, device on ground, and large hole in glass in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower and clearing all Converse options and examining large machine in Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage: Gregson: Right, are you done here, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Sorry? Gregson: Isn't it about time you were leavin'? Or rather...it IS about time you were leavin'! That lot are here now. Iris: That lot? Gregson: The Forensic Investigation Team. They'll be givin' me the heave-ho in a minute, too. Iris: Oh dear. Poor Gregsy. Here! Have another cup of my special blend to cheer you up! Gregson: *Glug* *Glug glug glug* Aaah! That hit the spot! Yup, hits it every time! Ryunosuke: (Well, at least I've seen the scene with my own eyes. It looks like this is as far as we're going to get with our investigations here at least...) Iris: I've been thinking... Hurley might know something, mightn't he? Ryunosuke: About what? Iris: About Mr Reaper! Ryunosuke: ...! About what happened to Lord van Zieks, you mean? (Because it sounds like something very significant occurred after he graduated from university. Something that completely changed his life.) Maybe, but I have no idea where to find Mr Sholmes at the moment. He's in the middle of some big case, isn't he? Iris: Here, this is what you need! Ryunosuke: What's this?

(I don't see how it could be related to the case we're investigating here, but then... ...stranger things have happened. And when they happen, Mr Sholmes is usually at the heart of them.) Prosecutor's Office Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy 22nd October Madame Tusspells Museum of Waxworks Ryunosuke: Wh-What is this place? L-Look at all these t-terrifying scenes! But why are all the p-people so still? (Guillotines... Ruthless murderers... I know what I'll be dreaming about tonight.) Iris: They're all wax models. They're amazingly realistic, aren't they? What do you think, Runo? Shocked? Ryunosuke: W-W-WAX MODELS?! .........AAAAAAAAAGH! I, I read about d-dead bodies and wax once...in a m-magazine about strange phenomena. Depending on how c-c-corpses are kept after death, p-parts of them can turn to wax, apparently. It's c-called a...adi...adip... Adipocere! Iris: ...Stop talking about creepy things like that, Runo. You're scaring me. Anyway, adipocere doesn't form readily, you know. It's only in very specif- Ryunosuke: AAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Iris: What now? Ryunosuke: I've, I've just remembered something else I read, in another m-magazine about strange phenomena. There was an old lady - maybe a w-witch - who used to pour molten wax over c-corpses and put them on display. Iris: None of the exhibits in here are real. They're all entirely man-made replicas. Ryunosuke: They can't be! Do you really expect me to believe that? Just look at them! Iris: Oh! Ryunosuke: There's no way anybody could make models of people that are this realistic! And...they're all such gruesome scenes... .........Wait. Iris: What is it? Ryunosuke: Oh...no... (I must be seeing things...) Ryunosuke: It's...it's... ...the great detective, Mr Herlock Sholmes! (Mr Sholmes has his own wax statue in here? Really?) Iris: Well he is world-famous, after all! Ryunosuke: It's an uncanny resemblance, isn't it? It makes my skin crawl to look at it... Iris: I know! But look, Runo. You can kick this Hurley, and he doesn't move a muscle! Ryunosuke: You can't go around kicking the exhibits, Iris! .........Wait. It, it just moved, I'm sure. And not just a little bit, either! Iris: Hm? Really? Did it? Ryunosuke: And look closely... ...there are beads of sweat on the face...of this waxwork... model... ......... Ryunosuke: ......... Sh-Shall we move on, Iris? ...Over there, look! There's a great murder scene to enjoy! Much more appealing. Sholmes: Sholmes: My dear fellow! I take exception to your recoiling in such a manner, as if you've seen something truly abhorrent! Ryunosuke: Mr...Mr Sholmes! (I knew it!) Sholmes: Iris, what possessed you?! I strictly forbade you from divulging my temporary waxwork secret to Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: Temporary waxwork? What do you mean? Sholmes: And that kick! Could you not have exercised a little more restraint? You winded me! Iris: But Runo has something he needs to ask you. Sholmes: Ah...a question? Iris: And I thought you'd probably be getting bored, too. So here we are! Sholmes: Hm... Well, I can't deny that your timing was impeccable. A mere two minutes more being stationary like that... ...and my great brain, upon which all my success has been built, would have turned to wax! Ryunosuke: ...Thank goodness we arrived in time. Sholmes: Indeed. In many ways, the pair of you just saved the world from an unimaginable loss! Iris: Oh, Hurley! You do like to talk nonsense, don't you? Ryunosuke: (He could know something, it's true. About Lord van Zieks, and what happened in the past to change him.) Sholmes: Now that you're here, let's take our time. How can I be of assistance? For you're in luck. I'm suddenly quite taken with the idea of conversing! Ryunosuke: Oh...well, actually, I'm in quite a hurry. Sholmes: And if my eyes don't deceive me... ...I believe something is afoot within the walls of this very museum. A most fascinating case, if I'm not mistaken. Ryunosuke: Really? Sholmes: Moreover... ...I have a strong suspicion that it is related to the matter about which you've come to me now. Ryunosuke: (But...how could it be?) Sholmes: We shall speak again presently, my dear fellow. But for now, I must return to my work. Ryunosuke: (What, back to being a temporary waxwork exhibit?) Sholmes: ......... Well? What is it you'd like to ask me, then? Ryunosuke: Um. Actually, it's... It's about Lord van Zieks. Sholmes: Ah, our friend Mr Reaper. How did you find him? Well, I trust? And so I filled Mr Sholmes in about everything I'd learnt. About Lord van Zieks... About Professor Harebrayne... And about the strange coincidence that they had been at university together. Ryunosuke: So I'm wondering what it was that happened to make Lord van Zieks such a different person. Iris: I was sure that you'd know, Hurley. Sholmes: ......... Ryunosuke: You said there was something going on here in this exhibit hall before. That something was afoot. And that you believed it was related to what I wanted to ask you about. Sholmes: ......... Ryunosuke: Um, Mr Sholmes...? (He's suddenly clammed up.) Sholmes: Well, it seems we've reached the unavoida- ???: Greetings... Ryunosuke: Oh! Ah...hello. (Where did she appear from? And what's she wearing? Could she look any more mysterious?) ???: I hope...you are appreciating my museum? Ryunosuke: Sorry? Have we...? Mr Sholmes, do you know this- (Not again!) Tusspells: My apologies. I am Esmeralda Tusspells. This is my museum of waxwork. Ryunosuke: Wha... You... You're THE Madame Tusspells? Tusspells: Bien sûr. Though only twenty-six years young, I might add. Ryunosuke: ...Is that significant somehow? Tusspells: I'm a 'madame' in name only. It adds a certain...je ne sais quoi. Ryunosuke: Right... Tusspells: Firstly, I must apologise for my waxworks. Or rather, one waxwork in particular. Ryunosuke: (That'll be Mr Sholmes, then.) Tusspells: I was led to believe he was a great detective, but he seems...unable to settle. Next time you move from your designated exhibit...there WILL be toil and trouble. Iris: She sounds deadly serious. Ryunosuke: (That's a problem. How am I supposed to ask Mr Sholmes about Lord van Zieks now?) Iris: Let's not forget what Hurley said before. About something being afoot right here in the museum, I mean. Ryunosuke: Yes, I know, but... Iris: I'm so curious! I want to know what's happening here! Ryunosuke: (Haven't we got enough on our plate already?!) Ryunosuke: Um, I wonder...could I ask you something? Tusspells: Bien sûr... Ryunosuke: I'm just curious. Is anything going on in the museum at the moment. [sic] Some kind of incident, perhaps? Tusspells: ......... Whoever suggested such a thing to you? Ryunosuke: Oh, well, it was... ...your temporary waxwork over there who mentioned it to me a little- Oh! (He's disappeared!) ???: ...A wax model is a work of art. Not some tawdry object for trade. Ryunosuke: Ah! Th-There you are! Tusspells: Leaving the exhibit again when you should be working? ...Do you wish to be melted down? Sholmes: My dear Madame Tusspells, save your reprimands. There are more pressing concerns. The wax can wait. It's our ideas about your current problem we must throw into the melting pot instead! Tusspells: ...! Sholmes: Personally, I would advise you not to involve the police. Tusspells: Why ever not?! Ryunosuke: (She's turned as white as a sheet...) Sholmes: Because you have at your disposal a great detective, whose services you may employ for a mere fifty shillings. Though please be aware that I prefer- No, I insist upon payment in advance! Tusspells: ......... ...Very well. Let us see if the great detective is able to live up to his name, shall we? Sholmes: Before I engage my analytical processes, I must ask you to clarify something. What, pray, is behind the curtain? Tusspells: That is the Tusspells Special Exhibit. There is an extra charge to see it. Sholmes: Ah, the 'special' exhibit in the House of Horrors... It must depict a special killer then, I presume. Would you be so kind as to draw back the curtain, I wonder? Tusspells: Ah! Absolument non! There is nothing amiss behind there! Sholmes: Nothing amiss, madame? What about the arm protruding ominously from under the curtain? Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: I strongly encourage you to allow me to see what lies beyond, before the situation worsens. Tusspells: ......... Yes, very well. I will draw back the curtains. ...But only a soupçon. Sholmes: I must confess, I peeked behind the curtain earlier. The Tusspells Special Exhibit is a very bleak graveyard scene indeed. And yet somewhat surprisingly... ...the waxwork killer one would expect is nowhere to be seen. What does strike one, however... ...is the portly gentleman lying peacefully on his back on the floor. Ryunosuke: Well, well then perhaps, Mr Sholmes... ...that man on the floor is the ruthless killer himself! Sholmes: I'm afraid not, my dear fellow. He's a perfectly ordinary London gentleman. Not even a waxwork, in fact. Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: As skilfully made as these waxworks are, they are always distinguishable from real humans. So, allow me to present my two conclusions. The first... ...is that a sizeable business transaction has been taking place in this special exhibit. Tusspells: Why...? Why would you say that? Sholmes: And the second... ...is that the aforementioned transaction is linked to a serious crime! Tusspells: AAAAAAH! Ryunosuke: (She looks as pale as candle wax...) Tusspells: I, I don't understand... Sholmes: So, Madame Tusspells, as you've agreed to my fee... ...you shall now have the pleasure of seeing this famously great detective - and temporary exhibit - at work. The Great Deduction The game is afoot! Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Sholmes: To begin with, we must ask ourselves what exactly is afoot here in this museum? The answer is revealed by the bundle of banknotes protruding so helpfully from your bag. In my estimation, some...two hundred pounds. Tusspells: That, that is all my own money! Sholmes: So what does this large sum of money reveal? Ah, not as much as the involuntary glance you cast, it would seem, Madame Tusspells. Yes, the answer lies where your eyes now fall. The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice! 'Waxwork for sale'? Your business has hit hard times, it would seem. In short... ...you sold the infamous killer - the centrepiece of your special exhibit - for the sum of two hundred pounds! Tusspells: Nooooooooon! Sholmes: Now...let us explore the next curiosity with which we are presented. Who is the portly gentleman stretched out so peacefully on the floor? Tusspells: ......... Sholmes: It would appear the man has suffered a severe shock. The cause of which...is clearly known to you. Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: Unfortunately, madame, keeping secrets does not appear to be your forte. What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds! It would appear that you twisted this gentleman around your little finger most effectively. Tusspells: What are you suggesting?! Sholmes: He rashly agreed to purchase the waxwork for the sum of two hundred pounds. Only when he came to hand the money over, did it occur to him what an extortionate amount he was paying. But the money was no longer in his hands. And the result? The scene we see before us. He collapsed in shock. Yes, the killer in this special exhibit fetched a killer price! We can only pray that the gentleman's dreams are not plagued with regret... Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Conclusion Sold for cash Topic 2 Waxwork Location Sholmes: The question that arises then, is what has become of the waxwork that changed hands? Let us consider that problem for a moment. Tusspells: You, you cannot possibly... Sholmes: What immediately strikes me about this conundrum, is the young man standing over there. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief. Such as is worn by policemen as a secret sign to fellow members of the force that a crime is being perpetrated. Yes, this young man is an undercover policeman, currently investigating this museum. I know him well, in fact. It's Sergeant John Clay. Tusspells: What are you talking about? Sholmes: The man's quite a celebrity. He received triple accolades at last year's policing awards. Tusspells: But... Sholmes: Next we turn our attention to the old man sat before him with the particularly unsightly visage. I've been watching closely and he hasn't moved a muscle. Almost, in fact...as if he were a waxwork. Tusspells: Ah! But, but you... Sholmes: Your reaction only confirms my suspicions, madame. I noticed it at once, of course... Observe! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag! 'Thruppence'...? A tragically low price, you might say. Though perhaps the going rate for ageing waxworks riddled with cracks. And yet you sold it to the portly gentleman for an exorbitant two hundred pounds! The sort of plucky behaviour that's sure to attract the attention of Scotland Yard... Isn't that so, madame? Tusspells: I, I do not... Sholmes: Yes, the waxwork you sold has already been seized by the police and remains in their custody as we speak! The old man must be reunited with his grave in the special exhibit, and not a moment too soon! Topic 2 Waxwork Location Conclusion Discovered already Sholmes: Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this horrifying puzzle! Ryunosuke: ......... Iris: ......... Tusspells: ......... Sholmes: I see I've stunned you all into silence. Iris: You have, Hurley, you have. And you've obviously upset this young lady in the process. Her cauldron looks awfully hot... Ryunosuke: Um...if I could just bring up one point, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: Ah! The notorious Naruhodo 'one point'! I'm all ears, my dear fellow! Ryunosuke: According to your deduction, then, the special exhibit featured this old policeman. So...that would mean that he's the particularly ruthless murderer, wouldn't it? Sholmes: ......... The killer policeman, Ottermole. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: It was a mysterious series of murders that rattled the capital only last year. The police rushed to the scene every time, only to find the culprit had disappeared into the aether. Iris: And it turned out the culprit was a policeman himself! A senior officer by the name of Ottermole! Ryunosuke: So you mean that's who the sinister-looking old man there is supposed to be? Sholmes: Indeed. It is a particularly grim face, is it not? Unforgettable, in fact. Yes, I remember that odious countenance only too well. Ryunosuke: But is two hundred pounds a lot of money for a wax model? Sholmes: It would be enough to afford one of the latest steam carriages, if that puts things in perspective? Ryunosuke: S-So...it is quite a lot then. Tusspells: ......... Is there anything else you wish to add? Before I melt you down. Ryunosuke: (That bubbling wax is looking more and more ominous...) Iris: Ugh...the smell of all that molten wax is starting to worry me. Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes did more or less just accuse her to her face, so... I think I might have to call on your assistance here, Iris, if that's alright? To make some minor corrections to the great detective's great deductions... Iris: Of course it's alright! We'll soon set things straight! Ryunosuke: Well...let's get started then, shall we? Before Madame Tusspells vents her anger! Sholmes: Just what I was waiting to hear, my dear fellow! So, Madame Tusspells, in accordance with our agreement... ...you shall now have the pleasure of seeing this famously great detective - and temporary exhibit - at work. Course Correction Hold it, Mr Sholmes! Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Conclusion Sold for cash Sholmes: To begin with, we must ask ourselves what exactly is afoot here in this museum? The answer is revealed by the bundle of banknotes protruding so helpfully from your bag. In my estimation, some...two hundred pounds. Tusspells: That, that is all my own money! Sholmes: So what does this large sum of money reveal? Ah, not as much as the involuntary glance you cast, it would seem, Madame Tusspells. Yes, the answer lies where your eyes now fall. The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice! Ryunosuke: She definitely looked in this direction, it's true. Iris: But I'm not sure she'd sell any of her waxworks, even for two hundred pounds. Ryunosuke: Oh? Iris: She must pour her heart and soul into making them, don't you think? Over and above the wax. If it were me, I wouldn't sell them for anything. Ryunosuke: ......... (For that much money, I would! ...But it sounds like that makes me a bad person.) W-Well anyway... ...I wonder if the two hundred pounds could have some other significance. Iris: Let's follow that furtive glance again and see if there's anything else that could explain it! The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice! Iris: Judging by appearances... ...this man and the two hundred pounds are in no way related at all. Ryunosuke: (The poor man was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, it seems...) But there's no doubt that Madame Tusspells did react to what Mr Sholmes said. The way she automatically looked over this way must tell us something, I'm sure. Iris: ...Then let's have more of a look around! Ryunosuke: The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that ransom note! Sholmes: Quite so. And we must congratulate these criminals on their inventiveness, abducting a waxwork. Tusspells: Agh! Sholmes: Two hundred pounds is no small ransom fee. Yet you clearly intend to pay it. Tusspells: The model in question has...special importance. So I put together all the money I have... Sholmes: In summary, then! The two hundred pounds you have in your handbag...is ransom money! Now...let us explore the next curiosity with which we are presented. Who is the portly gentleman stretched out so peacefully on the floor? Tusspells: ......... Sholmes: It would appear the man has suffered a severe shock. The cause of which...is clearly known to you. Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: Unfortunately, madame, keeping secrets does not appear to be your forte. What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds! Ryunosuke: So if the waxwork was kidnapped, where does that leave us in terms of who this man is? Iris: We could just ask him when he comes around. Ryunosuke: ...I think the point of this exercise is to understand the beauty of the deduction process, Iris. Iris: Yes, you're right. Hurley's trying so hard, we mustn't let him down. Ryunosuke: Well, there's little doubt that he suffered a shock. That much seems clear. But in that case, what's Madame Tusspells trying to hide? Let's have a closer look around... What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds! Ryunosuke: It must have been a considerable blow to have knocked the man unconscious. Iris: Yes, he looks like a very sturdy man, doesn't he? Ooh! Perhaps he was struck on the back of the head with something hard?! Ryunosuke: ...Don't sound so excited about it, Iris. (Whatever did leave the man out cold like that, it must have been quite something...) Ryunosuke: What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the waxwork hand! Sholmes: Indeed. With a solid waxwork limb, one could deliver a very substantial blow. Tusspells: How, how could you...? Ryunosuke: The hand protruding from the bottom of your cape... It ought to be a right hand, but closer inspection reveals that in fact, it's a left hand. Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: And somewhat masculine as well. In other words, it does not belong to you, madame. It is the hand of a waxwork model! Tusspells: KYAAAAAAH! Some of the visitors to my museum can be...troublesome. They meddle with the exhibits and cause damage. Ryunosuke: So you mean, that arm...? Tusspells: Yes. This gentleman saw fit to try to remove it as a souvenir. Sholmes: Hm, no small keepsake. Ryunosuke: Like taking a whole branch of a cherry tree when you go to view the blossoms... Tusspells: I am afraid I had to teach the man a lesson. Ryunosuke: You confronted the man and tried to take the arm back. Sholmes: And the result? The scene we see before us. He was knocked unconscious. A point we may need to revisit later. But for the time being, we have our conclusion: Yes, the killer in this special exhibit has been kidnapped! Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Conclusion Sold for cash Kidnapped! Solved Topic 2 Waxwork Location Conclusion Discovered already Sholmes: The question that arises then, is what has become of the waxwork that changed hands? Let us consider that problem for a moment.

To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief. Ryunosuke: According to Mr Sholmes... ...the yellow neckerchief is a sign to other policemen that some crime is underway. Iris: A way of communicating with his colleagues without revealing his identity, yes. It's a secret that's closely guarded by Scotland Yard. Ryunosuke: ...That Mr Sholmes didn't hesitate to give away. Iris: Well, uncovering secrets is in any true detective's nature, of course. Ryunosuke: Right... Anyway, judging from Madame Tusspells's reaction to Mr Sholmes's deduction... ...I think perhaps we might not have identified the man quite correctly. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief. Ryunosuke: According to Mr Sholmes, this young gentleman is actually a policeman in plain clothes. And the secret scarf sign appears to back that idea up. It does seem plausible. Iris: But Madame Tusspells's reaction was strange. Which must mean... Ryunosuke: ...That we haven't got to the bottom of who or what this man really is yet. Ryunosuke: Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his shoulder stub. Sholmes: No such boneless human walks this earth. Of that, I can assure you. In other words, the man standing here - the young Sergeant John Clay... ...is in fact, defying all odds, a waxwork model! Ryunosuke: I seem to remember it was you who concluded he was a real person in the first place, Mr Sholmes. Tusspells: He has become quite a celebrity in London, being the winner of no less than three policing awards last year. I simply had to make a model of the man. Sholmes: Naturally! What other explanation could there be? Ryunosuke: And it was this detective's arm that was pulled off by the man on the floor in the special exhibit, wasn't it? Sholmes: Next we turn our attention to the old man sat before him with the particularly unsightly visage. I've been watching closely and he hasn't moved a muscle. Almost, in fact...as if he were a waxwork. Tusspells: Ah! But, but you... Sholmes: Your reaction only confirms my suspicions, madame. I noticed it at once, of course... Observe! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag! Ryunosuke: A killer policeman...called Ottermole, was it? Was he well known? Iris: It was all over the papers last year. But I can't say I know what he looks like. It's a very low price, though. Thruppence isn't much money. Ryunosuke: (Only enough for a few measly hours of gas in Mr Garrideb's delightful lodgings, in fact...) So this is the special killer taken from the special exhibit...is it? The waxwork that somebody stole from the museum and tried to ransom for two hundred pounds... ...is this crusty old killer policeman Ottermole? Really? Iris: Perhaps we should have a good look around again and see if another idea crops up! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag! Iris: If we just poured a little bit of molten wax on him, we'd soon find out if he was real or not. Ryunosuke: Yes...you never know, there may be another way. We've already come this far, so maybe we should stick to logical deductions, don't you think? Iris: Alright, if that's the way you want to do it, then we should examine him in more detail. Ryunosuke: (If anyone saw, they'd think we were obsessed with the elderly...) Ryunosuke: The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious twitch! Sholmes: Even the most realistic waxworks do not exhibit a twitch. In other words, this splendid old man is in fact a genuine member of Scotland Yard! Ryunosuke: ...Slight shift in your choice of adjectives, then... Sholmes: And there you have it! Well, Madame Tusspells? Tusspells: Well what? It was me who contacted the police and demanded that someone come in the first place. He is clearly fatigued. He is sound asleep. Ryunosuke: But then, what's this tag about showing a price of three pence? Sholmes: No doubt the price tag of the muffler, which the old bobby purchased recently at a local market. And I presume you've observed the scarf tied around his arm? Does that not strike you, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Yes! The secret sign used by detectives to show that some criminal activity is currently underway. Tusspells: Of course. Because, as you know, there has been just such criminal activity happening here. As you deduced from the very beginning, detective. Sholmes: So, it would seem that we finally arrive at the truth. Ryunosuke: The waxwork of the especially ruthless killer from the special exhibit has been kidnapped. Sholmes: And Scotland Yard are already investigating. But the model's whereabouts remain a mystery. Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this horrifying puzzle! Topic 2 Waxwork Location Conclusion Discovered already Still a mystery! Solved Deduction CompleteElementary! Tusspells: All sorts of people visit my museum here. Men and women, young and old. Sometimes they drop in just for a short time on their way back from the pub. I welcome them all. But if anyone tries to damage my exhibits... I do not take it lightly. Anyway... ...your great deduction was even more enchanting than I had been led to believe. Sholmes: It was a pleasure, my dear madame. I'm gratified that you enjoyed the spectacle. And as for your 'rough customer', I've no doubt he'll regain consciousness shortly and return home. What concerns me more... ...is the waxwork from the special display...if it was indeed genuinely abducted? Tusspells: ......... Yes. Tragically, it was... Sholmes: Then I would ask you to recount to us the events surrounding the stolen waxwork. In as much detail as possible, if you please. Tusspells: ...Very well. But after I have told you what I know, I must insist that you return to your work. Sholmes: ......... The talents of a great detective could be put to better use, I feel, but as you wish... Tusspells: It was a series of gruesome murders that had all of London gripped in terror a decade ago. After five victims were killed, the man was arrested, and put to death. Sholmes: And now he's immortalised here in wax for all Londoners to admire and enjoy! Though of course, he happens to be absent at present, on account of the abduction. Ryunosuke: But I don't understand. How is all this related to Lord van Zieks? Sholmes: ......... You must first understand, my dear fellow, why it is that the Professor earnt such infamy. It was due to the victims he chose. Some of Whitehall's finest. Iris: What do you mean, Hurley? Sholmes: Those murdered by the Professor were some of the highest members of the British aristocracy. Members of the nobility. Even royalty. It sent shockwaves through the country's administration. Ryunosuke: Members of the... Ah! Wait! Of course! What Professor Harebrayne said! Lord van Zieks is from a family with noble blood! Iris: Oh gosh! Sholmes: It was the fifth victim that led to the Professor's arrest. The last of the killer's prey was a young noble by the name of... ...Klint van Zieks. Ryunosuke: No! I don't believe it! Van Zieks?! Sholmes: I'm sure you can piece together the rest for yourself. In the wake of his older brother's murder, the young Barok pursued a career as a prosecutor. And eventually...became the Reaper we know today. Ryunosuke: ......... I had no idea Lord van Zieks had such a tragic past... Sholmes: Well, I'm afraid that's all I can say on the matter. For the time being at least. After all, I have work to do... ...as a waxwork exhibit. Tusspells: I am afraid I shall have to excuse myself as well. Ryunosuke: Oh, yes, of course. It's, it's been a pleasure. Thank you. ???: ...Well, none of the predicted scenarios I've been analysing involved you coming to visit me here. Harebrayne: It's been too long, it really has. I'm delighted to see you, Barok. Van Zieks: It's been ten years. And here we are, meeting in a prison of all places. Harebrayne: I can't forgive myself for what happened to Mr Asman! I just can't! I, I still can't believe it could happen... Van Zieks: ......... Tomorrow the court will decide. Harebrayne: Yes! I have a young Eastern man acting for my defence. He seems reliable enough, though. It, it was an accident. A terrible accident. He, he, he assures me he can prove it! Van Zieks: I must warn you... Harebrayne: Oh, I know, I know! I've heard already. You're going to be prosecuting, aren't you? Van Zieks: ...Yes. Harebrayne: ......... Since I returned to England, I've heard lots of stories. Barok, are you really...? Van Zieks: What? Harebrayne: ......... Never mind. I know that you have my best interests at heart. Van Zieks: My friend is on trial. ...I wouldn't entrust it to anybody else. Harebrayne: Of course. I fully understand. Thank you, Barok. Van Zieks: Until tomorrow, then. I'll see you in court. To be continued...23rd October, 8:52 a.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber Ryunosuke: (I can't believe it's been six months since I was last allowed to work in court. And now here I am, back at the Old Bailey...) Harebrayne: Ah! M-Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: Good morning, Professor Harebrayne. Harebrayne: I, I don't understand! It doesn't make any sense! The atmospheric pressure in here is off the charts! I've never felt anything like it! It's, it's crushing me! Ryunosuke: I feel it every time I'm here. That...gravity. Harebrayne: Well, this is Britain's highest court... But are you telling me it's filled with some kind of device that can actually control air pressure?! Ryunosuke: ......... I think it's probably all in the mind. Harebrayne: Ah. Yes, well...you won't let me down, will you, Mr Naruhodo? I'm counting on you in today's trial...to save my life! To save the secret of my super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine from being made public! Ryunosuke: Yes, I understand. (I know what I have to do. I have to establish that the explosion two days ago was nothing more than an unfortunate accident.) Harebrayne: Well, I'm sure there's nothing to worry about, really. Justice will prevail! ???: My commiserations, Mr Naruhodo. You appear to have been lumbered with a most tiresome case here. Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes! I didn't expect to see you here. Iris: That was very mean, Runo, leaving me alone at home with Hurley. It took me at least an hour to wake him! Harebrayne: Ah... Oh... Ah... Is it...? Are you...? HEEEEEERLOCK SHOOOOOOLMES?! Sholmes: Indeed, sir. I am he. Heeeeeerlock Shoooooolmes. Harebrayne: Oh, I've heard all about your exploits, even whilst living in Germany. Iris: Ah yes. Randst Magazine is on sale in Germany, too. Harebrayne: This month's instalment was sublime! Your deduction in 'The Adventure of Silver Blaze' was wonderful! Sholmes: Ah yes, a memorable case indeed. It concerned a snake, I seem to recall. Iris: No, that was 'The Speckled Band.' Ryunosuke: Well, thank you for coming. I do appreciate your support. Sholmes: I'm sorry to disappoint you, my dear fellow, but I'm afraid I can't stay. Ryunosuke: Oh. Sholmes: I have urgent business at Madame Tusspells. Ryunosuke: You mean...your waxwork job? Sholmes: No no, the waxwork abduction, of course. Madame has engaged my services. Ryunosuke: Ah, so you're trying to get to the bottom of that ransom note, are you? Sholmes: The week's wages depend on it! ...As does the safe return of the waxwork, naturally. As such, I intend to give it my undivided attention. Ryunosuke: Oh, well, never mind then. I understand. Sholmes: Of course, with my skills of observation and reasoning, resolving the matter will be as easy as proverbial pie. I shall return forthwith. For until I solve the case, I shall have no money to afford a pie of any description. Iris: Ooh, then you must absolutely give it your full attention, Hurley! Sholmes: Quite, Iris, quite. But life is riddled with irony, you know. Whenever I give something my full attention, I have a quite insatiable desire for a pie. One of the universe's intractable mysteries, you might say. Harebrayne: Oh yes! Quite! Definitely! Absolutely! I totally understand! Ryunosuke: (...Is someone a little starstruck?) Sholmes: I wish you the very best of luck, Professor Harebrayne. Harebrayne: Oh! Ah! Ooh! Why, thank you! Sholmes: Before I depart, Mr Naruhodo...a word in your ear, if you please? Ryunosuke: ...? What's this about? Sholmes: As you have remarkably little grounding in science, I feel I ought to inform you... As compelling as this 'super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis' hypothesis may be... ...a practical implementation, such as was attempted by the professor at the Great Exhibition, is quite impossible. Ryunosuke: But, but the professor said the demonstration was a success! Sholmes: Yes, it would appear that he fervently believes it was. Iris: I've read Professor Bunnybrain's paper about it, too, Runo. And I have to say... ...I'm sure it can't be done. It could barely be done theoretically, let alone practically. Ryunosuke: (So he's completely barking up the wrong tree?) But how could an experiment that had no possibility of succeeding in fact succeed? That's contradictory. Sholmes: And it's that contradiction that will be at the heart of the trial, I've no doubt. Ryunosuke: (What's that supposed to mean?) Sholmes: Now, I must hurry along. I wish you the best of luck, my dear fellow. Iris: See you later, Hurley! Well, it looks like you're on your own today, Runo. But chin up! You can do it! Ryunosuke: Oh! What about you, Iris? Iris: Ah, no, I'm afraid I can't help. I have something I need to do. Ryunosuke: ...I see. Iris: Hehe! It's going to be a big surprise for you when you find out what it is! Ryunosuke: Haah... (That sounds ominous...) Bailiff: Counsel for the Defence! And the defendant! Court is about to be in session. Make your way into the courtroom at once! Ryunosuke: We're on our way! (An experiment that the laws of science say can't possibly succeed... ...and a scientist who's convinced that it did. That's the riddle you have to unlock here, Ryunosuke! That's the key to this case!) 23rd October, 9:10 a.m. The Old Bailey Courtroom Judge: In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session. We are sitting today for the public trial of Professor Albert Harebrayne. I now call upon the counsels for the prosecution and defence to declare their willingness to proceed. Van Zieks: The prosecution is ready. Ryunosuke: The defence is... The defence is ready, My Lord! ......... (I'm six months out of practice. And what's more... ...I'm without Susato-san today.) ......... (Ugh... Is it just my imagination, or does the air in here feel even more oppressive than usual?) Judge: So... ...I must say I recollect the victim of this case all too well. Mr Odie Asman. Van Zieks: Mr Asman was well known as a financier...though that was merely a front for his diverse criminal activities. Judge: It was only a month ago that the man appeared in court prosecuted by you, Lord van Zieks. But the jury unanimously found him not guilty. Ryunosuke: (Because every member of the jury had been bribed, by the sound of it. These powerful London criminals are prepared to go to extreme lengths to keep their freedom.) Judge: But two days ago, on 21st October, Mr Asman met his end. The work of the Reaper, was it? Van Zieks: ......... If that is how Your Lordship would describe divine retribution... But the fact remains that Mr Asman's death... ...was a direct result of the actions of the accused, Professor Harebrayne. Judge: Very well, then. Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... You have been selected at random to represent the will of the people. Are the six of you ready to fulfil your societal duty? Juror No. 1: I'm most gratified to have been selected to carry out this important civic duty, My Lord. Juror No. 2: To have a man's fate in the palm of one's hand... Oh gosh! Oh golly! It sends shivers down my spine. Juror No. 3: Science experiments, magic, conjuring tricks, courtroom trials... All are nothing more than performances. Juror No. 4: Any spurious scholar that defiles the reputation of science deserves to hang! Juror No. 5: Um, we 'ave to listen to what's said on both sides 'the fence, and um...then settle on one... That's it, isn't it? Juror No. 6: ......... Wasn't like this in my day! Wasn't like this at all! Ryunosuke: ......... (That's...that's... ...the police killer Ottermole look-alike...again. And he's as exhausted as ever, it seems.) Judge: Now, as I'm sure you are all aware... ...the incident we are here to judge today tragically took place at the Great Exhibition, shortly after its opening. Van Zieks: Though the death toll could have been far worse. With the exception of the victim, no one was killed. Nevertheless, the dream of the science being exhibited rapidly turned into a nightmare for the spectators. Judge: A tragic turn of events. And as such, the eyes of all London- No, of the whole world will be on this trial. It is our duty to reach a swift and just conclusion, I feel. So...your opening statement please, Lord van Zieks. Van Zieks: At the heart of this incident... ...is technology never before demonstrated anywhere in the world. Judge: One of science's latest developments, I take it? The government is keen to capitalise on the Great Exhibition to improve Britain's technological advantage. Van Zieks: The technology being demonstrated by the accused was described as 'super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis'. Judge: Good Lord! Ryunosuke: It's designed to 'disassemble' human subjects using extremely high-voltage electricity... ...and 'beam' them instantly to another location where they are subsequently reassembled. Judge: Is...is such a thing even within the realms of possibility? Juror No. 1: Well I don't believe it, that's for sure. Juror No. 2: Disassembling people with electricity? My goodness! How shocking! Juror No. 4: Hah! The whole idea is absurd! The hypothesis would never stand up to scrutiny! Judge: Sir, I believe you are a fellow of the Royal Society, are you not? An expert in your field? Juror No. 4: I am, and my word on the matter can be considered final. Instantaneous kinesis is poppycock! Ryunosuke: (So this expert and Mr Sholmes are in agreement. It's impossible...) Judge: What is the prosecution's view on the matter? Van Zieks: ......... The prosecution would assert... ...that the accused's instantaneous kinesis demonstration was a success. Ryunosuke: What?! Juror No. 4: What rot! Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Van Zieks: The professor's hypothesis is currently under investigation by the British government. If it is deemed to have merit, a substantial research grant would be made available. The accused made use of the invention built on his new hypothesis to take Mr Asman's life... ...in order to be the sole benefactor of the grant. Ryunosuke: But, but... Van Zieks: This disastrous demonstration was no accident. It was carefully designed from the outset to end the life of the victim. Judge: Thank you, Lord van Zieks. The prosecution's stance is clear. But you will now bring forth witnesses to substantiate your claims. Van Zieks: ...Gladly, My Lord. Bailiff! Show the first witnesses to the stand! Van Zieks: Witnesses, state your names and occupations for the court. Gregson: Yes, sir! Tobias Gregson, Detective Inspector at Scotland Yard's homicide division. I was on duty at the demonstration on the day in question and in charge of the followin' investigation. Harebrayne: ......... Albert Harebrayne! S-S-Scientist! Van Zieks: You were born in England, but have been carrying out research in Germany in recent years. Correct? Harebrayne: Yes. Yes, that's right. After graduating from university here in Britain, I went to work in Germany...and made an amazing discovery! Which is what brought me back! I had to demonstrate my incredible hypothesis at the Great Exhibition! Gregson: What you demonstrated was incredible alright. An incredible explosion! Harebrayne: But the science! The science was a success! The instantaneous kinesis worked! E-Everyone saw it! They must have done! Yes, there was the terrible accident, but... ...the demonstration of my hypothesis was a success! Gregson: Well, that much is undeniable. As shown in this photograph taken by the Forensic Investigation Team. Judge: This was taken inside the Crystal Tower, I take it? The centrepiece of the exhibition, no less. Gregson: That's right, My Lord. Seems the victim rammed straight into it. Judge: Hm, I see... Very well, submit the photograph as evidence. The photograph of the victim has been entered into the Court Record. Gregson: As the court's heard, the victim of the incident was Mr Odie Asman. There have been a number of allegations made against the man, but puttin' them aside for the time bein'... ...he was the man who financed the research for the experiment and the demonstration itself. Judge: I see. So to summarise the situation... ...the defendant is accused of taking the life of the man who funded his work. Would that be correct? Gregson: Exactly. Ryunosuke: But couldn't it be... ...that the explosion was caused by some malfunction in the apparatus used for the demonstration? Harebrayne: That's right! That must be it! My splendid machine... My poor, splendid machine... Gregson: You saw it yesterday, didn't you? We can't even examine the wreckage thanks to the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act. Harebrayne: WHAAAAAAAAAT?! The wreckage?! THE WRECKAGE?! Judge: But that being the case, how can the facts be established? How can it possibly be determined whether this was an accident or a deliberate and malicious act? Van Zieks: Extremely simply, My Lord. Judge: I beg your pardon? Van Zieks: Isn't that right, witness? Harebrayne: Wha...? Sorry? ME?! Van Zieks: No. Your neighbour. Gregson: Yes, sir! It was murder, plain and simple. Anyone could state that with complete certainty. Ryunosuke: What?! (How can he possibly think that?) Judge: Thank you, Inspector. I think we had better proceed to formal testimony. You will explain to the court on what grounds you claim this experiment to have been a front for murder! Witness Testimony - A Front for Murder - Gregson: The corpse that went crashin' through the Crystal Tower had a broken neck. Harebrayne: I, I made a minor miscalculation in the angle of the beam projection, that's all! That was my mistake! Gregson: But the post-mortem examination revealed another injury. A fatal wound. There was a lesion in his chest where he'd clearly been stabbed by somethin' sharp right in the heart! So the victim was killed before he went anywhere. And this fella's the only one who could have done it! Judge: ......... An extraordinary business... In addition to suffering a broken neck, the victim was stabbed in the heart? Ryunosuke: (Information I would really like to have heard from someone other than the judge...) Gregson: The coroner says death would have been all but instant from a wound like that. Van Zieks: You could say, in fact... ...that the victim was killed twice by the accused. Harebrayne: No, no and no! That couldn't be further from the truth! Gregson: I have here the experiment plan document that was submitted to the security team. The victim stood himself inside somethin' called 'the birdcage', ready to be 'beamed' instantly... ...to the second level of the Crystal Tower, about twenty-five yards away. Van Zieks: The experiment did not go according to plan, however. As the machine was put into operation, there was a large explosion. The blast caused the beam transmitter to point higher than intended. Accordingly, the kinesis resulted in the birdcage materialising in mid-air... ...from where it subsequently fell, crashing through the glass of the Crystal Tower's large round window. Judge: My word... One assumes the victim's neck was broken upon impact with the tower, then? Harebrayne: I'm, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean for this to happen! The machine was just too powerful! But honestly! Really! I swear! It was just an accident! A terrible accident! Van Zieks: Unfortunately, that excuse can't save you. Gregson: No, not considerin' the sharp murder weapon that pierced the victim's heart. Harebrayne: M-Murder weapon?! What are you saying?! Van Zieks: This is the autopsy report submitted by the coroner. The prosecution would like it entered into the Court Record. Judge: Your request is granted, Counsel. The autopsy report has been entered into the Court Record. Juror No. 4: I was there in person, you know. I saw the whole ludicrous performance. And the only other person on the stage with Mr Asman was that disgraceful excuse for a scientist! Juror No. 2: Then really, by all accounts it must have been him. Juror No. 1: Hmph. Hard to think otherwise, really. Judge: Very well. Counsel for the Defence...proceed with the cross-examination, please. Ryunosuke: Oh, yes, My Lord! (I need to focus here... It's been a while!) Cross-Examination - A Front for Murder - Gregson: The corpse that went crashin' through the Crystal Tower had a broken neck. Harebrayne: I, I made a minor miscalculation in the angle of the beam projection, that's all! That was my mistake! Gregson: But the post-mortem examination revealed another injury. A fatal wound. Gregson: There was a lesion in his chest where he'd clearly been stabbed by somethin' sharp right in the heart! Gregson: So the victim was killed before he went anywhere. And this fella's the only one who could have done it! Gregson: The weapon the victim was stabbed with must have been left in his body whilst he was beamed through the air! Ryunosuke: (So that's all the testimony I have to work with... I had no idea the victim had been stabbed. That changes everything... Did van Zieks keep that to himself until now on purpose, to gain the advantage? Oh well...I suppose all I can do is press these witnesses for as much new information as possible.) Ryunosuke: You say that while the weapon remains in the body, there's very little bleeding... Is that unequivocal? Gregson: Look, there was no blood on the experimentation stage, even though that's where the fellow was stabbed. The only explanation for that is if the screwdriver was still in his body, stoppin' any heavy bleedin'. Van Zieks: It's common medical knowledge, my learned friend. Even on your side of the world. Ryunosuke: ......... Yes, but about this screwdriver... The thing is, we actually saw it at the scene ourselves. On the experimentation stage. Van Zieks: What? Ryunosuke: It was on the floor by the wreckage of the machine, poking through a metal grille. I went to pick it up, but the detective here stopped me. Isn't that right, Inspector Gregson? Gregson: Ah, well, um... Now you come to mention it, yes... Van Zieks: Inspector, are we to understand that you permitted the defence counsel to investigate? That you contravened the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act? Gregson: Eh? No! Not at all! I, I wouldn't do that! I just let him look, nothin' more! I was very clear he wasn't to touch a thing! Ryunosuke: Yes, that's true. This screwdriver was in plain sight on the stage. But it shouldn't have been, should it? Gregson: Wh-What are you gettin' at? Ryunosuke: If this tool had still been in the victim's body when the victim was beamed away by the machine... ...then it shouldn't have still been on the stage. Gregson: Ah! Ryunosuke: That's right! It should have been beamed across to the Crystal Tower along with Mr Asman... ...and been found still lodged in the victim's chest! Gregson: Ugh... UWAAAAAAAAAGH! Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! ...How do you explain this, Inspector? Gregson: I...well...um... I don't... Ryunosuke: It looks as though everything that the victim had on his person moved with him when he was 'beamed'. If the screwdriver was still in his chest when the instantaneous kinesis occurred... ...obviously that should have been beamed to the destination as well! Gregson: You... Ryunosuke: (This is a strange situation... Even though people are saying that this instantaneous kinesis is a scientific impossibility... ...we're still basing arguments on the assumption that it did actually take place. Alright. Time to tighten the screws here...) My Lord! If the prosecution is unable to explain this inconsistency in its argument... ...we can only conclude that the testimony given in support cannot be relied upon! Van Zieks: ......... Ryunosuke: (Lord van Zieks is stumped!) ???: Judge: ...Do you have something to say, witness? Harebrayne: Yes...I knew it... It bears out... The equations hold... Mr Naruhodo! ...DON'T WORRY! Ryunosuke: ...About what?! Harebrayne: Without delving into the details, there is no inconsistency! Ryunosuke: What? Harebrayne: Even if Andrew had been lodged in Mr Asman's chest... ...my trusty tool wouldn't have moved. Andrew remaining on the stage is consistent with my calculations! Ryunosuke: Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAT?! Van Zieks: It would seem your illusions have been...shattered. Clearly we should hear the accused's explanation. ...Or should I say, this brilliant scientist's explanation? Judge: Hmmm... Ryunosuke: (Just when I'd found an inconsistency in the prosecution's argument... Scientists...) Judge: Very well! The defendant will testify again. Provide us with the scientific explanation as to why the inconsistency asserted by the defence fails to hold! Harebrayne: In the name of Apollo, I will, My Lord! Witness Testimony - The inconsistency Explained - Harebrayne: To be clear, I'm still at the stage of gathering data in my research. My hypothesis states the kinesis cannot transport metal, though. Hence the metal weapon would have stayed put. In other words, the point just raised by Mr Naruhodo isn't an inconsistency at all. Mr Asman was the patron of my research. Without him, my work wouldn't have been possible. Now I have a duty to protect the incredible machine that we built together! Ryunosuke: ......... Van Zieks: ......... Judge: ......... So, the thrust of your testimony, Professor, is...? Van Zieks: ...That based upon his hypothesis, metal objects cannot be moved by this method of instantaneous kinesis. Judge: In other words...? Van Zieks: In other words, since the screwdriver is made of metal, even if it remained lodged in the victim's chest... ...its subsequent discovery on the stage despite the victim being found elsewhere is not an inconsistency. Judge: And therefore...? Van Zieks: And therefore Professor Albert Harebrayne could still have been the killer. Harebrayne: My great hypothesis holds, you see! We, we had to make the cage used to contain the subject from wood for that very reason. Judge: I was not addressing you, witness! Ryunosuke: Um...Professor Harebrayne... Harebrayne: Yes? Ryunosuke: Whose side are you on here? Harebrayne: I don't take sides, Mr Naruhodo! No no no! My only interest lies in upholding my hypothesis! I'm a scientist, after all! Ryunosuke: ......... (Is he working for us or against us? It's very hard to tell...) Van Zieks: Let's see how you cross-examine this testimony, my Nipponese friend. Harebrayne: Yes, fire away, Mr Naruhodo! Cross-Examination - The Inconsistency Explained - Harebrayne: To be clear, I'm still at the stage of gathering data in my research. Harebrayne: My hypothesis states the kinesis cannot transport metal, though. Hence the metal weapon would have stayed put. Harebrayne: In other words, the point just raised by Mr Naruhodo isn't an inconsistency at all. Harebrayne: Mr Asman was the patron of my research. Without him, my work wouldn't have been possible. Harebrayne: Now I have a duty to protect the incredible machine that we built together! Ryunosuke: (That's the extent of the testimony then... Thank goodness for that. I don't want him doing any more damage. He's already basically proven that he could have been the culprit. But it seems as though all he really cares about is defending his hypothesis. Still, I wonder... What if his hypothesis is just fundamentally flawed?) Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne, you say that according to your hypothesis... ...nothing made of metal can be beamed by instantaneous kinesis using the machine you made. Is that right? Harebrayne: Yes, that's right. Spot on! Exactly correct! Ryunosuke: In that case...I'd ask you to have a look at this photograph that was taken at the scene. In particular, I'd like you to pay attention to the victim's face. You can clearly see that Mr Asman is wearing a pair of spectacles...with a metal rim. Harebrayne: What? Metal? No... Metal can't... That's not... M-Metal? NOOOOOOOOOOOO! Ryunosuke: We've already established that the proposed murder weapon, the screwdriver, was found on the stage. However, if your hypothesis correctly predicted that outcome... ...it should also have predicted...that the metal-rimmed spectacles would be found in the same place! Harebrayne: AAAAAAAAAAAAH! My hypothesis! MY HYPOTHESIIIIIIIIIS! Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne, this isn't easy for me to say... ...but your hypothesis...is clearly flawed! Harebrayne: UWAAAAAAAAAGH!!! Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Counsel, what is the implication of this? Ryunosuke: If, on the day in question, the alleged instantaneous kinesis never actually took place... ...then it's entirely possible that the victim was killed somewhere other than on the stage. And in that case...someone other than the defendant could have been the culprit! Harebrayne: But, but my hypothesis! My hypothesis is sound! I proved it that day! The experiment was a success! The experiment was proof of all my work! ???: Juror No. 4: If I could say something here, in my capacity as a fellow of the Royal Society... Judge: Yes, juror number four? Go ahead. Juror No. 4: As a man of science, there's one thing I simply cannot abide... And that's a fraud who PRETENDS to be a fellow man of science! Harebrayne: What? Wait! Great Scott! Are you suggesting my science is suspect?! Juror No. 4: It's just been disproved, hasn't it? In front of all of us. In other words, the whole demonstration was a complete nonsense from start to finish! Believe me, my fellow jurors, when I tell you that this man is a heel, a bounder and a fraud! Juror No. 1: I say the wreckage of that machine should be stripped down and thoroughly examined! Harebrayne: Nooo! Never! That machine is the essence of my entire hypothesis! It's protected by the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act! Juror No. 6: What the devil is that blasted act all about, eh? Who made up such a daft rule?! Ryunosuke: (I don't like the way this seems to be going... What's the best way for me to help the professor?) Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne has yet to perfect his invention! That would seem to be the case, yes. But even so... Van Zieks: Even so, what? Ryunosuke: Going to such trouble and expense to create a fake machine to display in public... He would have absolutely no reason to do such a thing! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: He had an obvious reason to do exactly that. For the research grant money. Ryunosuke: Ah! Juror No. 4: If the government was foolish enough to have deemed the man's ridiculous notion plausible... ...he and his conspirators would have received a handsome sum indeed. Harebrayne: C-Conspirators? Juror No. 2: What would be the value of such a grant? Ten pounds? Juror No. 4: You're an order of magnitude out, madam. Five hundred pounds a YEAR! Juror No. 5: Ooh arrrrrr! Ya could live 'andsome on that much for years! Juror No. 4: The Society's noticed an increase in bogus public demonstrations in the field of science recently. And plenty of scientists arguing with each other to get the largest slice of the funding cake. People's greed is plenty motive enough for murder, I assure you! Harebrayne: No no no! I haven't deceived anyone! Least of all the government! My hypothesis is sound! The science is sound! Please, you must believe me! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: No matter how unbelievable this hypothesis may seem to you, ladies and gentlemen... ...the fact remains that the victim was transported instantly to the Crystal Tower. Which means that the experiment...was a success. Harebrayne: Ah, Barok! Van Zieks: And therefore... ...the only person who could possibly have committed this murder...is the accused! Harebrayne: Ah. Barok... Ryunosuke: (Where is this heading? I have no idea...) Van Zieks: My Lord, if I may...? Judge: Yes, Lord van Zieks? Van Zieks: The prosecution would like to summon new witnesses to the stand. Judge: New witnesses? What would be the nature of their involvement? Van Zieks: They were spectators of the demonstration at the exhibition. Who were occupying special seats. Ryunosuke: Eyewitnesses? Judge: Very well, the court grants the prosecution's request. I should very much like to hear from eyewitnesses to the incident. Van Zieks: The prosecution's stance is clear. This experiment was no postiche. The accused killed the financier victim there on the public stage, before the very eyes of the spectators. Now, my learned friend... Ryunosuke: Oh! ...Yes? Van Zieks: It's time for you to make your own stance clear. Ryunosuke: (There's clearly a flaw in the professor's hypothesis. I can definitely see that. But where does that leave me...?) Judge: We shall take a short recess now. During which time, the prosecution will prepare its new witnesses to take the stand. Van Zieks: ...As you wish, My Lord. Judge: Good. In that case, court is adjourned for twenty minutes. To be continued... 23rd October, 10:44 a.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber Harebrayne: M-Mr Naruhodo... ...what on earth were you playing at just now? Or rather... ...WHAT ON EARTH WERE YOU PLAYING AT ALL ALONG?! MY HYPOTHESIS! MY AMAZING HYPOTHESIS! You've been picking holes in it from the start! Ryunosuke: Ah, sorry about that. Harebrayne: But you promised me! You, you said you'd prove that dratted explosion was an accident, not murder. You said you'd keep my precious invention from falling into anyone else's hands! But all you've done so far is try to undermine me! Ryunosuke: ......... Yes, I did make you a promise, you're right. I said that I'd believe in you and fight for your freedom to the very end. But I also told you I was no scientist. I don't understand your hypothesis. The fact is, there's an undeniable flaw in your logic, isn't there? Harebrayne: Ah! But! If I just run through some equations... Yes, you see! It's because my work is incomplete! Ryunosuke: Perhaps it is. Nevertheless...a man died as a consequence, didn't he? Harebrayne: Oh. OOOOOOOOOH NOOOOOOOOO! ......... You're right. You're so right. It's all my fault... And I have no right to blame you for my failures. I'm a disaster! Not just as a scientist...but as a human being! Ryunosuke: Well...that might be a little over the top. Harebrayne: And while we're on the subject... ...wh-what about Barok? He's being awful! Ryunosuke: Claiming his old university friend to be a murderer, you mean? Harebrayne: He's a disaster! Not just as a prosecutor...but as a human being! Oh! But no! Wait! He's the Reaper, isn't he? Perhaps he's not classified as Homo sapiens any more...? Ryunosuke: (...Glad that's cleared up...) ......... Can I double-check something with you? Harebrayne: Ah. Yes? What? Ryunosuke: The machine and demonstration you prepared... They were based entirely on your hypothesis, I presume? There was no...trickery involved? Harebrayne: ......... I drew the plans for the machine with my very own hands. Every line was painstakingly drawn with the firm belief that science is the only future. So yes, it's true that my hypothesis hasn't reach [sic] maturity yet, but please, Mr Naruhodo...you must believe in it. Ryunosuke: ......... Alright, Professor, I understand. Bailiff: Counsel! Defendant! The prosecution's witnesses are ready to take the stand. Court is about to be in session again. Make your way into the courtroom, please! Ryunosuke: (It all hinges on that demonstration. If the professor's hypothesis is sound as he claims... ...it leaves him as the only person who could possibly have killed the victim. But on the other hand, Mr Sholmes was adamant...) Sholmes: A practical implementation, such as was attempted by the professor at the Great Exhibition, is quite impossible. Ryunosuke: (So really, what should I be trying to prove here?) 23rd October, 11:00 a.m. The Old Bailey Courtroom Judge: In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby reconvene the proceedings of this court. Counsels for the defence and prosecution, are you ready for the new witnesses to testify? Van Zieks: The prosecution is ready, My Lord. Ryunosuke: As is the defence, My Lord. Judge: So, Lord van Zieks... ...I believe these next witnesses saw the demonstration on the day in question with their own eyes? Van Zieks: Indeed they did. And as luck would have it, one of them is a police detective. ...So the testimony we are about to hear can be considered highly reliable. Ryunosuke: (Perfect. A detective of all people...) Van Zieks: The prosecution's stance remains unchanged. Though it ended in tragedy, the demonstration on the day in question was scientifically sound. And consequently... ...the sole person with the opportunity to have committed this act of murder... ...is the only other individual to have been present on the stage at the time: the accused. Judge: Thank you, Counsel. The prosecution's position is clear. So, bring forth your witnesses now. Van Zieks: Bailiff, show the witnesses in. The witnesses whose proximity to the incident on the day in question will clarify the truth unequivocally. Van Zieks: Witnesses, state your names and occupations for the court to hear. Lune: My name is Balthazar Lune. I am...the impresario of all the hot-air balloons in vicinity of the esperimento stage. Gotts: Mein name ist Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond Ormstein. I have come to see ze Great Exhibition all ze vay from my home in Bohemia. ...I'm very rich. Gina: Inspector Gina Lestrade, Scotland Yard. I'm a great detective. Even 'Erlock Sholmes agrees. I was on security duty at the exhibition...and I got to go up in one o' them balloons! It was amazin'! Ryunosuke: (Gina...again. But she did mention that she'd seen the disaster from up in a balloon actually, didn't she? And she clearly loved every minute of it.) Van Zieks: There were three balloons flying near the public experimentation stage when the incident occurred. Two of these witnesses were in one such balloon at the time, and saw events unfold from the skies above. Lune: You make it sound like they were in the clouds. It was only an altitude of circa sixty feet. Very low. Gina: Well ya can't see nuffin' if ya fly too 'igh, can ya? Ryunosuke: (Sixty feet... About eighteen metres, then.) Judge: Thank you for your introductions. Now, you will give your formal testimony for the court. Kindly describe exactly what you witnessed...especially those of you who had a vantage point above the stage! Witness Testimony - The View From Sixty Feet Up - Lune: It was an incidente terribile. I am only grateful that my balloons were not damaged. Gina: There's this huge bang from the stage, and then the next second, another bang in the sky beside us. Gotts: And from amid ze smoke...a cage appeared out of nowhere! Lune: The cage, it fell from the sky like a stone. And crashed into the Crystal Tower! Gina: I didn't get a good look inside the cage, but no one went near it after it crashed into the tower. Judge: ...A most extraordinary collective account, I must say. Ryunosuke: Could I just clarify something? There's a detail in the witnesses' testimony that I've not heard any mention of until now. Specifically, that there were two explosions? Van Zieks: ...More precisely, two explosions in two separate places, yes. When the demonstration began, the balloon carrying the two witnesses was around...here. There were other balloons in the air nearby at the time carrying other passengers as well, to be clear. Then, as power was supplied to the machine for the demonstration, the first explosion occurred. The so-called 'birdcage' that contained the victim disappeared from the stage, and a moment later... ...the second explosion occurred, directly adjacent to the balloon carrying the witnesses. The birdcage appeared at the site of the explosion, subsequently to plummet down into the Crystal Tower. Gotts: I voz very surprised. Suddenly a cage appeared before my eyes viz a person inside. Ze blast voz so hot, but I didn't vant to miss a sing, so I kept my eyes vide! ...I still have lots of money. Judge: ......... Precisely who is this curious infant? Van Zieks: I'm told he is a young noble of Bohemian royalty. Apparently he disguised himself in order to steal unnoticed into the Great Exhibition. Gotts: Ja, I am here in London on a sightseeing trip viz my elementary school. Van Zieks: We will have the benefit of a child's point of view in the testimony. Ryunosuke: (Do we really need that?) Gotts: Ven I remove my mask, zis is vot I look like. Judge: Ah yes, I see. A delightful face, I'm sure. Gotts: Ja, everybody says so. Ryunosuke: (Great disguise, then...) Van Zieks: ...The point is, the testimony of these witnesses further substantiates the facts for the court. Namely, that despite ending in an explosion, instantaneous kinesis was successfully demonstrated. And furthermore, that until the arrival of the police, no one approached the Crystal Tower where the victim fell. Therefore, only the accused, who was with Mr Asman on the stage, could possibly have committed the murder. Judge: Yes, thank you, Counsel. The prosecution's views on the matter are quite clear. So, the defence's cross-examination now, please. Ryunosuke: Y-Yes, My Lord! Cross-Examination - The View From Sixty Feet Up - Lune: It was an incidente terribile. I am only grateful that my balloons were not damaged. Gina: There's this huge bang from the stage, and then the next second, another bang in the sky beside us. Gotts: And from amid ze smoke...a cage appeared out of nowhere! Gotts: It voz not ze sky zat exploded. It voz a green balloon zat woz next to ours at ze time. Lune: The cage, it fell from the sky like a stone. And crashed into the Crystal Tower! Gina: I didn't get a good look inside the cage, but no one went near it after it crashed into the tower. Ryunosuke: (The prosecution really is asserting that the demonstration was genuine... But what if it was actually some kind of switch-around trick instead? That would mean that the victim was never actually on the stage in the first place. The two explosions would have thrown everyone watching into a panic for sure. I think I need to find out more about what exactly people saw at the time...) Ryunosuke: Mr Lune, in your testimony... ...you said that all three of the balloons you had operating at the time were undamaged. Lune: Si. That is correct. If they had been caught in the esplosiones, it would have been terribile. Ryunosuke: I wonder...if you might know what this is? Lune: Ah...I think it may be... Si, part of a balloon. A burnt piece of the fabric of the envelope. Ryunosuke: Sorry? The envelope? Lune: Pardon. That is the large, round part of the balloon which becomes filled with hot air. It is made from very thick fabric lined with rubber. You do not want it to rip when you are in the sky. Ryunosuke: (Just as I thought...) This piece of cloth was found near the experimentation stage. In other words, as Master Gotts testified... ...a green balloon did indeed explode that day. Lune: Eh?! Ryunosuke: If all the balloons in the sky above the experimentation stage belonged to you, Mr Lune... ...then your statement that they were all undamaged clearly contradicts the evidence! Lune: NOOOOOOOOO! If a balloon exploded that day, why didn't the man say so? Maybe everyone on board was killed... Oh no! Having just spent ten whole pounds for the experience?! How awful! Seems to me like those things crash fifty percent of the time anyway... Van Zieks: Van Zieks: The instantaneous kinesis did occur! But after the explosion on the stage... ...the point of materialisation shifted to a location occupied by a balloon. Judge: Causing the balloon to explode? Yes, eminently plausible. Van Zieks: An unfortunate traffic accident, as it were. But it changes nothing about the pertinent facts. ???: Lune: This, I cannot accept! Ryunosuke: Why not, Mr Lune? Lune: You are suggesting that I am a liar! That persons died in a balloon incidente! Van Zieks: There's no need to get 'fired up', Mr Lune. The victim was the sole fatality that day. Lune: That's right! And I prove it! Balthazar Lune is not a liar! There was no such balloon in the sky! It is non possible! Ryunosuke: You're saying it's impossible? Why? Van Zieks: This court has more important matters to discuss than the number of balloons that were operating that day. Lune: AIIIIIIEEE! Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But we can't ignore the fact that nobody appears to have known anything about this other balloon until now! My Lord! The defence calls for further testimony from Mr Lune! Judge: I concur. There is clearly more to the truth here than meets the eye. It's imperative that we clear up the issue of this phantom balloon, I feel. Witness, you will give supplementary testimony about the balloons you were operating at the exhibition. Lune: Ah...grazie, My Lord! Witness Testimony - Mr Lune's Balloons - Lune: As I said, Balthazar Lune is no liar! Every balloon I had in the sky landed safely! All three of my balloons were carrying passengers. If they fell to the ground in an esplosione, what a catastrofe! Gina: But ya can't get away from the fact that a burnt-up bit o' cloth was found at the scene, can ya? The coppers at the Yard reckoned it was prob'ly some debris thrown from the explosion on the stage. Lune: This stupido ragazzo is mistaken! My balloons have the red and blue zigzag stripes anyway! Judge: Hmmm...so your assertion is that the balloon this child saw was not one belonging to you? Lune: Si! Exactamente! If he even saw a balloon in the first place. I do not like the sound of it. It is very bad for business! I have a good mind to sue the land of Bohemia! Gotts: If you attack us, ve vill fight back! It vill be vor! All out vor! Ryunosuke: (...What happened to 'all out war'? Mr Lune certainly doesn't appear to be lying. But that doesn't change the fact that the testimony and evidence are contradictory here...) Van Zieks: If the defence is unable to find fault with the witnesses' statements, the court must consider them the truth. ...Think long and hard on that, my learned friend. Ryunosuke: (The situation has clearly changed now. I have to get to the bottom of what happened here, no matter what it takes!) Judge: Counsel, you may now cross-examine the witnesses. Cross-Examination - Mr Lune's Balloons - Lune: As I said, Balthazar Lune is no liar! Every balloon I had in the sky landed safely! Lune: All three of my balloons were carrying passengers. If they fell to the ground in an esplosione, what a catastrofe! Gina: But ya can't get away from the fact that a burnt-up bit o' cloth was found at the scene, can ya? Gina: The coppers at the Yard reckoned it was prob'ly some debris thrown from the explosion on the stage. Lune: This stupido ragazzo is mistaken! My balloons have the red and blue zigzag stripes anyway! Ryunosuke: (As I thought, Mr Lune's testimony just doesn't quite add up... The young Bohemian boy claims to have seen another, fourth balloon. But Mr Lune vehemently denies the possibility. And it's hard to imagine the man in charge could be mistaken about the number that were in the air... Still, this inconsistency must tell us something, I'm sure.) Ryunosuke: Unfortunately, the photograph Master Gotts took can't tell us the colour of the balloon. But it can tell us something else. Something crucially important. Van Zieks: What? Ryunosuke: It shows that the pictured balloon...wasn't carrying any passengers. Judge: Ah! My goodness, you're right! But surely all the balloons would have been carrying passengers? There would be no sense in it otherwise. Lune: S-Si! They are for pleasure! For seeing the view! MY balloons only fly with passengers! Ryunosuke: Which tells us that the pictured balloon isn't one of them. So when the incident occurred that day... ...there WAS a fourth balloon in the skies above the experimentation stage! The mysterious green balloon! Lune: I, I know nothing! Niente! I, I can only tell you one thing... If this balloon was not carrying passengers, then it was not one of mine! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: There are illegal tradesmen everywhere you care to look. Clearly one such 'entrepreneur' decided to capitalise on the opportunity presented by the Great Exhibition. And managed to operate balloon flights on Mr Lune's patch without him realising. Lune: Si... Si! The competizione...trying to steal my profits! I did not notice because of the esperimento that went wrong on the stage! Ryunosuke: This fourth balloon exploded at the very same moment Mr Asman was 'beamed' from the stage below. Gina: Right...so them scraps that fell to the ground after, an' left them scorch marks... They didn't come from the stage at all! It was bits o' the balloon rainin' down! But cos no one was in it, it didn't get no attention. Ryunosuke: (A mysterious fourth balloon carrying no passengers, silently floating over the experimentation stage...) Van Zieks: Van Zieks: This photograph shows us nothing more! A stray balloon carrying no one and operated by some rogue trader. Clearly it has nothing to do with the case. Judge: Hmmm... Its relevance does elude me, I must say. Van Zieks: The court has seen sufficient evidence and heard ample testimony already. The prosecution calls for this trial to be concluded! Ryunosuke: (Really? Have we really got to the truth yet? No, I can't let this opportunity slip away. The jurors' minds are made up...and not in our favour! What else can this photograph tell us? Is there nothing more we can learn from it?) Ryunosuke: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, wait! Please don't give your decisions yet! The photograph from Master Gotts... ...may well be hiding one more vital clue! Juror No. 1: What's that?! Juror No. 3: A vital clue?! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: We're well past the point of mere possibilities. It's time for definitives now. So tell the court... What exactly does this alleged clue in the photograph prove? Ryunosuke: We can reasonably assume that the pictured balloon was destroyed in the searing heat of the explosion. Gotts: Ja! Zat's right! Ja! It voz not my fault! Van Zieks: Evidently. Because the birdcage from the kinesis machine materialised in the sky where it had been flying. And the balloon, being filled with flammable hydrogen, instantly and explosively ignited. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: ...No, that's not what happened. Van Zieks: What? Judge: It would appear that this photograph requires closer examination. Counsel for the Defence, you will highlight the location of this alleged 'clue' in the photograph for the court. Ryunosuke: Of course, My Lord. (If you look closely, it's plain enough to see. And what's shown is linked to another piece of evidence we have. In a way that leads to an unbelievable conclusion!) The clue that heavily suggests the real reason the balloon exploded is... Ryunosuke: The timing of this photograph can only be described as miraculous. If you look, you'll notice there's a bright white line that appears to point directly at the balloon. Van Zieks: Most likely a ray of light caught incidentally on the film. Judge: ...I'm afraid I can see nothing of the sort. Ryunosuke: If you look with a magnifying glass, My Lord, it becomes clear what the nature of this bright line really is. Goodness, what is that? Juror No. 4: Undeniably some flash of light, yes. Juror No. 2: Oh golly. Do, do you think it might be lightning? Juror No. 1: But it couldn't have been a finer day. Juror No. 3: I believe we may be looking...at fire! Juror No. 6: A bolt of fire, heading straight for the balloon...like an arrow! Judge: Indeed. Even to my ageing eyes, it would appear to be a flame of some sort. My word! Are, are you suggesting this flame struck the hydrogen gas that filled the balloon?! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: That's absurd! The balloon would have been sixty feet above the ground at the time. No flame could possibly have reached such a height. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Actually, it's my opinion... ...that a particular piece of evidence found at the scene reveals how that is exactly what did happen. Van Zieks: What evidence?! Judge: If such evidence exists, Counsel, then for goodness' sake present it, man! Which evidence explains this mysterious streak of flame that appears to be headed directly for the balloon? Ryunosuke: This was found hidden at the foot of a small ornamental tree near the scene. Judge: Good Lord! Is that a crossbow? Ryunosuke: An arrow dipped in oil and set alight could have been shot from this weapon... ...sending a flaming arrow straight into the hydrogen-filled balloon! Van Zieks: Are you suggesting...that crossbow was used to deliberately...? Gina: Blimey, yer right! That streak o' light in the photo looks just like an arrow, dunnit? Lune: Then...the esplosione of the balloon, it was... Ryunosuke: ...Very likely the result of a flaming arrow from this crossbow igniting the hydrogen gas inside it! Van Zieks: Nooo! Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Counsel, this is an extraordinary supposition! Ryunosuke: If the aim was to cause the balloon to explode, the shooter could have used a gun of course. However, there's an obvious reason why that would have been out of the question. Van Zieks: The noise of the discharge? Of course... Ryunosuke: That's right. By using a crossbow, the projectile could be fired at the balloon silently. Gina: Well yeah, if someone 'ad shot a gun off in the exhibition grounds, it would've caused a real panic. Lune: But with the big esplosione, there was a very big panic anyway, no? Ryunosuke: ......... (I don't like this. I should be pleased to have found a plausible new explanation for all this, but something feels wrong...) Van Zieks: Van Zieks: Do you understand the implications of what you're saying, my Nipponese friend? Ryunosuke: If a flaming arrow did indeed hit the balloon, then obviously it would have exploded. And if the birdcage appeared from the cloud of smoke that ensued... Gina: Wot? Wait a minute! Wot are ya really sayin' 'ere? I don't get it. Was, was the birdcage beamed up into the sky after all, or...wot? Judge: My goodness me! Ryunosuke: ......... (Ah, now I understand. That's what that sinking feeling is about...) I think there's a good chance... ...that the birdcage was actually concealed inside the balloon all along. Judge: What?! Did, did I just hear that correctly, Counsel? Ryunosuke: (There's no going back now. The horse has bolted...) Let's assume, as I said, that the birdcage was hidden inside the green balloon from the start. On stage, when the experiment was started... ...the birdcage in the instantaneous kinesis machine disappeared in a cloud of smoke. At that moment, the flaming arrow was fired from the ground... ...causing the green balloon to explode and drawing the attention of the spectators to the sky above their heads. From amid the smoke, the hidden birdcage then appeared, to fall down and crash into the Crystal Tower. I think you'll all agree it's entirely plausible... ...that what I've just described is the real truth behind the 'miraculous' experiment carried out that day! Judge: Th-This... I......... GOOOOOOOOOD GRIEF! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: This is ludicrous! What you've described is no science experiment. It's, it's child's play! A contemptible display of stage magic! Ryunosuke: (Both Mr Sholmes and Iris said that the experiment was a scientific impossibility. In which case, this is the only way to explain what happened that day.) Van Zieks: And in any case...the victim's body was found inside the birdcage in the Crystal Tower. If the instantaneous kinesis didn't take place, how do you explain that? Ryunosuke: Ah! Um... Juror No. 3: If I may put in a word...as a man of magic myself... Such apparent discrepancies can easily be explained by some simple deception. Ryunosuke: J-Juror number three! Juror No. 3: All that would be needed is a doppelgänger - someone who looked very similar to the victim, Mr Asman... ...and having this other man appear on stage to front the show...as a body double! Ryunosuke: Ah...yes! Of course, so in fact... ...Mr Asman must have been inside the birdcage that was concealed inside the balloon right from the start! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: That balloon would have been filled with hydrogen. Anything hidden inside it would have been scattered to the four winds when it exploded. No one would ever have embarked on such a risky venture. Juror No. 4: Not necessarily. The explosive force of the balloon gas would very much depend upon the mixture ratio. Ryunosuke: J-Juror number four! Juror No. 4: Flying balloons are rarely filled with pure hydrogen, but a mixture of other gases such as helium as well. Helium on its own doesn't explode, but by controlling the gas mixture ratio, the explosive force can be altered. Van Zieks: The mixture ratio...? Juror No. 4: Obviously, the victim's body would have suffered some burns. That would be unavoidable. But not to such an extent as to render this whole obscene charade impossible. Van Zieks: ......... Ryunosuke: So everything that happened can be explained. Logically and scientifically. The explosion that engulfed the stage at the start of the 'experiment' was no accident. It was all part of an elaborate deception...to make it appear that instantaneous kinesis had occurred! Judge: Well...goodness me... Ryunosuke: And if we accept that this is what happened... ...it means that the victim, Mr Asman, was never present on the public experimentation stage to begin with. Van Zieks: Nrgh... Ryunosuke: In short... ...he couldn't have been killed by the defendant, who was on stage in full view the entire time! Van Zieks: AAAAAARGH! Ryunosuke: (This will be very hard for the prosecution to counter. Lord van Zieks can't credibly maintain that Professor Harebrayne is a suspect now!) ???: Harebrayne: Mr Naruhodo...I appreciate your efforts. Thank you. Ryunosuke: P-Professor?! Harebrayne: But you can stop now. Just keep your mouth shut, please. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Van Zieks: What's all this about...Mr Harebrayne? Harebrayne: ......... I, Albert Harebrayne, hereby confess... ...that it... That it was... That it was me who stabbed Mr Odie Asman! Yes! It was me! With my faithful friend and partner... Andrew the Screwdriver! Ryunosuke: Wha......... WHAT ARE YOU DOIIIIIING?! Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Defendant! Explain this sudden confession! Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne! What are you talking about?! Harebrayne: It's...it's what I've said all along! I must protect my hypothesis! And my precious machine! Ryunosuke: ...! Harebrayne: You stand there and claim it was all a trick! All an elaborate prank! But where's your proof?! No, y-you'd have to examine the machine if you wanted to prove it. But then it would all be over! My beautiful hypothesis would be laid bare... I mean, the indignity of it! Ryunosuke: It's clear that you drew the plans for the experiment, but you didn't actually build it. It's quite conceivable that you were duped, Professor. If you'll just let me, I can prove- Harebrayne: Barok! Van Zieks: Yes? Harebrayne: I'll cooperate. I'll do whatever you say. I swear it. So, so please... ...ensure the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act is adhered to and protect my creation! ......... Van Zieks: ...Pray forgive the discourtesy of filling my hallowed chalice at this critical juncture... Here's to my learned Nipponese friend... Ryunosuke: Wha...?! Van Zieks: ...and his upcoming attempt to clarify the defence's position in the light of the accused's confession. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: Do you intend to formally assert that the experiment was nothing more than a conjuring trick? Because the moment you do... ...the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act that protects the professor's invention will cease to apply. The prosecution will then demand a rigorous examination of the machinery involved in order to establish the truth. Ryunosuke: ......... Van Zieks: However...if you acknowledge that the machine is genuine and instrumental in the victim's murder... ...any chance of investigating will be crushed...and the confidentiality of the professor's hypothesis preserved. Ryunosuke: ...! Judge: Well, Counsel...what is the defence's official position on this matter? Ryunosuke: (What Professor Harebrayne - my client - actually asked of me... ...was to prove that the explosion on stage was an accident and protect the secrecy of his hypothesis. But there's no way to do that without implying the professor's guilt! Do I protect my client's life by asserting his innocence, or do I uphold my client's request but see him condemned? Either way, I can't avoid betraying his trust...) Van Zieks: You've been silent long enough! Isn't talking your trade, my learned friend? Or has all knowledge of English escaped your confused Nipponese mind? Ryunosuke: ......... Harebrayne: Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: (There's no escape here! I have to make a choice! But it's an impossible one! I have to give up on something...but what?) The defence asserts...that the defendant's instantaneous kinesis machine was in fact... Ryunosuke: ......... .........Agh! (No! I can't say it! My client placed his faith in me... I can't just let him down!) 'What must I give up on?' is not the question you have to ask yourself here. It's 'What can I protect?' Susato: Hello again...Mr Naruhodo. It's been far too long. Ryunosuke: Su... Susato-san! But, but what are you- Susato: Haiiiiii-YA! Ryunosuke: AAAAAAAAGH! (My first Susato Takedown in six months!) Susato: There'll be time to talk later, Mr Naruhodo. For now...we must concentrate on the task at hand! Ryunosuke: (Which is working out not what I have to give up on, but what I can protect!) Professor Harebrayne! Harebrayne: Ah! ...Yes?! Ryunosuke: Yesterday you told me that science is the pursuit of truth. Well...my job is to pursue the truth too. Harebrayne: Yes, of course... Ryunosuke: And personally, I believe...that you didn't stab Mr Asman. I think you've come to realise something yourself too, haven't you? That your experiment and the machine you built with the victim are questionable! The truth behind that is what we must both pursue now! Harebrayne: UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Van Zieks: ...So...you've finally opened your eyes. Ryunosuke: What? Van Zieks: And as for you... ...Albert. You can't ignore this any longer. Harebrayne: Ah... Van Zieks: Having heard my learned friend's assertion... ...don't you have something to say? Harebrayne: ......... B-Barok... Ryunosuke: Lord van Zieks... Susato: Gosh, I've never heard him speak that way before. Harebrayne: ......... In truth...there is one thing. Something I've remembered that's of relevance. Ryunosuke: What? Harebrayne: On the day it happened...just before I began the experiment...I saw a man near the stage. A man holding that crossbow. Judge: I beg your pardon?! Ryunosuke: Professor! Did the man have any distinguishing features? What did he look like? Harebrayne: Uh...tall. Taller than me. And, and thin. Thinner than me. With straight hair. Straighter - and whiter - than mine. Let me see... One less lens than me, too. A monocle. A rather stylish, black monocle. But one thing in particular will help to positively identify the man. You see, I know him very well. After all...he's the engineer who built my invention! Van Zieks: What? Ryunosuke: He...built the machine? Harebrayne: That's right. Mr Asman introduced him to me a year ago. He's, he's a man by the name of... ...Enoch Drebber. Juror No. 3: Enoch?! Juror No. 4: Drebber?! Judge: Does this name mean something? Members of the jury seem flustered... Juror No. 4: Not a name any scientist wishes to hear. The man's an abomination! Juror No. 3: Not a name any conjuror wishes to hear, either! Ryunosuke: Who on earth is he? Juror No. 4: I'm afraid this isn't the first tale of this nature that I've heard in scientific circles in connection with that name. There's talk of other flamboyant experiments that turn out to be nothing but stage trickery in the end. Obviously the rascal is after the government's research grant money. Juror No. 3: When magicians are in need of money, I have heard of them resorting to these underhand tactics. Some acquaintances of mine with...experience of such things have mentioned Enoch Drebber's name before. Juror No. 4: The man is both an engineer and a magician. Yes, we're dealing with an unparalleled confidence trickster here! That's Enoch Drebber for you! Harebrayne: So it's true then... My invention... My great machine... It was just a grand illusion? Ryunosuke: Considering what we've just heard about Mr Drebber's character... ...I'm sorry to say that sounds increasingly likely. Harebrayne: Even though no one else believed it...I wanted to. I wanted to believe that machine would function exactly as my hypothesis predicted. Van Zieks: Which is why you were so opposed to it being investigated, I presume. Harebrayne: I knew that if the machine was examined in detail, its construction would give away my hypothesis. Obviously, I didn't want that to happen. But at the same time... ...I knew that if it was found to be nothing more than a trick... Than a work of deception... ...then everything I'd worked towards...all my research... all my dreams...my whole life would be over! I was terrified at the prospect. Ryunosuke: So you really had no idea, then, did you? About the true nature of the machine that was built. And the true nature of Mr Drebber. Harebrayne: I never questioned anything. I, I didn't want to question it. Ryunosuke: It's entirely possible that Mr Asman and Mr Drebber... ...were working together to use you as a means of fraudulently acquiring the research grant money. Harebrayne: ......... ...When I announced my invention to the crowds that day, it was the finest moment of my career. I pulled all the levers and turned all the dials in exactly the way Drebber had described... When the smoke suddenly started billowing out, I panicked. I didn't know what was happening. Harebrayne: But I really don't know how the whole illusion was made to work. I...don't know anything any more... Van Zieks: Let me confirm one final point with you, Professor. Do you now consent to the prosecution submitting the necessary paperwork... ...to release your invention from the protection afforded by the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act? Harebrayne: ......... Yes, please go ahead. I'm...very sorry. Judge: It would appear that we shall have to suspend proceedings for the remainder of the day now. Lord van Zieks... Van Zieks: My Lord? Judge: The court has newly been made aware of another party whose involvement in this matter is critical. Van Zieks: Yes, Mr Drebber... Judge: Gather information about the man. If possible, I should like him served with a subpoena. Van Zieks: With pleasure, My Lord. Judge: Now, Counsel for the Defence... Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord! Judge: ......... When we reconvene, I shall be looking for one thing and one thing alone from you. Evidence...that the defendant is innocent of the crime for which he presently stands accused. Ryunosuke: ...I understand. Judge: Good. In that case...this court is adjourned until tomorrow morning! 23rd October, 1:36 p.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber Harebrayne: ......... ...Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: Ah! Y-Yes? Harebrayne: I'm...I'm...I'm... I'm so sorry! I was wrong! You were right! I tricked you! You trusted me! I dragged you...into my mess! Oh h-how did it ever come to this...? I'M SOOO SOOO SOOO SOOORRY! Ryunosuke: Did you really have no idea, Professor? About what Mr Drebber was really up to, I mean? About what he was really constructing. Harebrayne: Naturally! That machine was the embodiment of my hypothesis! Of all my hopes and dreams! I had complete faith in it! Ryunosuke: Alright. In that case, I won't say any more. Now, sadly the murder accusation against you still stands. So we must do as much investigation as we can before the trial resumes tomorrow. Harebrayne: ......... Well, thank you for doing so much for me! Susato: I'm so sorry for arriving late this morning, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: A-Arriving late? Susato: Didn't you receive my postcard? I wanted to let you know when I'd arrive. Ryunosuke: Postcard? What postcard? Iris: I hid it from you, Runo! So it would be a surprise! ...Well? Did it work? Ryunosuke: I was surprised alright! Especially when she threw me to the ground! Susato: Oh dear! I'm so sorry! I, I was just so happy to see you again that...it sort of slipped out. Ryunosuke: (Maybe we could stick to more traditional displays of emotion in future...?) Iris: Susie's train was late into London Victoria this morning, you see. But we made the coachman really whip the horses hard so she didn't miss the whole trial! Susato: I was watching from the gallery for a while, but in the end...I'm afraid I couldn't contain myself... Ryunosuke: Well, I'm glad you didn't. Susato: Oh! Ryunosuke: Having you at my side in court gives me the strength I need to win. So...I'm, um, delighted to see you...back in London. Susato: Oh, you're too kind, Mr Naruhodo! I'm delighted to be here! I hope I can continue to be of service to you. Ryunosuke: Of course. So...what's brought you back? Did Professor Mikotoba not protest? Iris: Let's save all that conversation for when we're back at home, shall we? You know I've made one of my most special blends ever for this special occasion! Susato: Oh, Iris, how wonderful! I can't wait! Ryunosuke: Susato-san was back in London. It's hard to describe how happy that made me feel at the time. But despite my elation... ...our tale was about to take yet another extraordinary turn. To be continued...23rd October, 2:41 p.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy Susato: Oh, this room! It's been too long! It hasn't changed in the slightest, though. And it's been some six months, hasn't it? ...That's a long time for things to stay so...familiar. Ryunosuke: I didn't know when you might return, and I wanted everything to be as you'd left it. ...But it has been some six months, it's true. Iris: So is your father alright, Susie? What happened? Susato: My father? Ryunosuke: Yes! Professor Mikotoba! I mean, it was half a year ago, but that's why you went back to Japan! Because of the telegram you received saying he'd fallen ill with a very high fever for some unknown reason. Iris: That's right. So I was surprised to learn you'd be coming back so soon. Surprised but happy! Susato: ......... I think I wrote about it in my letter to you. That it was all a trick. My father is in fine health. And I'm obviously very relieved...about that. Ryunosuke: Well, we're all delighted to have you back. Susato: It was quite by accident that I've been able to return to Europe, actually. It's because of a very grand conference called the International Forensic Science Symposium. Ryunosuke: The International Forensic... (That's the same symposium Lord Stronghart mentioned.) Susato: Anyway, I've arrived safe and sound, and all that matters is that I'm here now! After all, I haven't yet fulfilled my promise to you, Iris. Iris: Oh! Ryunosuke: You must tell us everything that happened while you were back in Japan. Susato: Yes, of course, I shall. Ryunosuke: And...there's one other thing... Something you wrote in your letter that particularly grabbed my attention. About...you-know-who. (About Kazuma...) Susato: I know. I'll tell you all that I can. After clearing all Converse options with Susato Mikotoba and Iris Wilson: Susato: So, Mr Naruhodo, I'm ready to start investigating if you are! I've committed every detail about the case to memory! And Iris has told me about the disturbing happenings at the waxwork museum as well. Ryunosuke: So...you're fully abreast of the situation already, Miss Susato. I'd expected nothing less, to be honest. Susato: I would think our first port of call should be to investigate this Mr Drebber. The engineer responsible for building the elaborate machine that was used to effect this extraordinary trick. Ryunosuke: Yes, a conjuror of sorts, by the sound of it, well known in the fields of science and magic. Susato: Then we need to go and arrest him! Ryunosuke: Well, yes... ...he must know the truth behind this case, so I agree we really do need to find the man. Iris: Hm...it sounds like it's a case of tracking someone down. Which is a job for the police...or a great detective! Ryunosuke: (Are we supposed to guess who she might be thinking of?) We don't have much time, so we need to get started straight away, I think. Iris: Good idea. Well, best of luck, then! Ryunosuke: Oh, you're not coming today? Iris: I'm going to Brixton Road shortly for the herb market. But let me know later how you got on, won't you? Ryunosuke: (That was a little abrupt. The pull of the herb market must be strong...) 23rd October Sholmes's Suite 23rd October Local Prison, Cell 11 Ryunosuke: What's...he doing?! Susato: He's... Oh my! The whole wall of the cell is covered in mathematical equations! Ryunosuke: And he's still writing more now! Um...Professor! Sorry to interrupt... Harebrayne: Oh, ah... M-Mr Naruhodo... ...! And who is this young lady? Susato: My name is Susato Mikotoba. I'm Mr Naruhodo's judicial assistant. It's a pleasure to meet you, Professor. Harebrayne: ......... OH, IF ONLY! IF ONLY I'D MET A REFINED YOUNG WOMAN LIKE YOU SOONER! ...None of this would have happened. N-No, that's not logical... That makes no sense at all. Susato: Oh dear, I'm...I'm sorry if my presence here upsets you. Ryunosuke: I owe you an apology too, Professor. I didn't manage to deliver what I promised you I would in court this morning. Harebrayne: Oh no! No no no! No no no no no! The whole thing... The whole miserable affair... It all happened because I've been such a complete and utter clot! Susato: Um, Professor Harebrayne...what have you been working on in your cell? Harebrayne: Oh! Ha ha, you, um...you mean that? Oh dear, how embarrassing... I, I was suddenly struck by an idea, you see, and I simply had to write it down. The wall was all I had to hand. Ryunosuke: Oh! Is it some new hypothesis? Something to surpass super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis, maybe? Harebrayne: Ah...no, actually. This...is my autobiography. Susato: Your autobiography? Harebrayne: 'How I was Diddled and Fiddled'...by Albert Harebrayne! I've found I can represent my odd fortunes with only odd numbers in an ambitious set of simultaneous equations! Susato: ...Really? Harebrayne: I'm going to have to pay back all the loans I took for the kinesis machine, you see! So it's going to be a new serial publication from next month! 'Part 1: An Odd Birth; an Odd Upbringing'. Ryunosuke: (...You can't beat the man's optimism, that's for sure.) I see. Well...for now, would you mind if we talked a little more about the case? Harebrayne: Oh yes! YES! Of course! I've been working through the numbers! I WAS DIDDLED! I WAS FIDDLED! BY THE PAIR OF THEM! By Asman! And by that aloof engineer, Drebber! Ryunosuke: (We're not going to have to sit through an explanation of all these equations...are we?) 23rd October British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Ryunosuke: ...Oh, who's that standing beside Lord Stronghart? Susato: I wonder... I've never seen her before. Stronghart: Ah, the young champion of the court. You had some success this morning, I understand. And you've thrown the entire government into disarray as a result. Ryunosuke: Oh! You, you mean because of Professor Harebrayne's experiment? Stronghart: Sham science being demonstrated at London's Great Exhibition! The country's been made to look foolish, and now politicians are scrabbling to respond. Lord van Zieks is in Whitehall as we speak, giving an emergency briefing. Ryunosuke: Oh dear, I, um... I didn't mean to cause any trouble. Stronghart: None of this is your responsibility. The government is entirely to blame for having been taken in. The special dispensation that prevents investigation at the scene will be annulled later today. Once that happens, my Forensic Investigation Team will move in and deal with that scrap metal in no time. Ryunosuke: (It's scrap metal now, is it?) ???: Until later then, Lord Stronghart. Stronghart: Yes. Thank you. Ryunosuke: Um...who was that? Stronghart: That was Dr Courtney Sithe, Scotland Yard's esteemed chief coroner. She's leading the Forensic Investigation Team's handling of this case. She was just delivering her report about the victim, in fact. Ryunosuke: Oh, I see... (About Mr Asman.) Stronghart: Following the outcome of the trial earlier, I asked the coroner's office to re-evaluate its findings. I don't have time to tell you what she concluded. If you want to know, you'll have to ask her directly. You can find her in the forensics laboratory. Ryunosuke: Ah, right. Stronghart: Now, what were you here to see me about? I can give you...seven minutes and thirty-nine seconds of my time. Ryunosuke: (So he's not running quite so spectacularly late any more...) After clearing all Converse options: Ryunosuke: Oh yes! Lord Stronghart... Stronghart: Go ahead. Ryunosuke: It's about Professor Harebrayne's experimental machine. We'd like your permission to examine the remains, if possible! Stronghart: ......... Are you well versed in science, then? Ryunosuke: Not in the slightest! In fact, you could say I was barely aware of the subject at all until recently. Stronghart: ...Well the special dispensation legally preventing investigation of the machine is currently being annulled. Within a few hours, Dr Sithe's team of forensic experts will begin their own investigation. But I suppose until then, there's no harm in you looking at the wreckage, as long as you touch nothing. Ryunosuke: Thank you! (Being able to look at it is better than nothing!) Susato: And I'll be able to see it, too! Stronghart: ...Your time is up. You'll have to excuse me now, I'm afraid. My next engagement calls. Susato: We are extremely sorry to have troubled you when you are so busy, My Lord. Stronghart: I have important matters to attend to in preparation for the symposium, you understand. 23rd October Forensics Laboratory Ryunosuke: I believe this is it... Dr Sithe's laboratory. (That chemical smell really assaults the nose. And there's plenty to assault the eyes in here, too...) Susato: It looks as though the doctor isn't here. But we're here now, so we may as well do some... sightseeing, don't you think? Ryunosuke: What a seasoned tourist you've become, Miss Susato. (We could just have a little look around...being careful not to upset any restless souls...) After examining open book on desk: ???: What are you doing?! Ryunosuke: Ah! Sorry! We, um, had something we wanted to ask you, but you weren't here, so... Sithe: So you thought you'd snoop around? That's acceptable to you people from the East, is it? Well? What do you want? Ryunosuke: Ah, um... Lord Stronghart told us, you see... ...that it was you who examined the victim's body. Erm, Mr Asman's body, I mean. Sithe: ......... Susato: So we came to ask you about your findings. On Lord Stronghart's advice. Sithe: ......... Very well. If the Lord Chief Justice has given his consent, I'll tell you what our investigation revealed. But when we're done, you must leave immediately. After clearing Converse option: ???: Mama, what is this? Ryunosuke: ...Agh! (Wh-Where did SHE spring from? And...did she just call the doctor, 'Mama'?) Sithe: This is a 'lawyer', dear. ???: Oh... Ryunosuke: Um...hello. ...To meet you. P-Pleased to meet you. Yes, I'm a defence lawyer. Ryunosuke Naruho- ???: Mama... Sithe: Yes? ???: Can I cut this one up? Ryunosuke: What?! ???: I've never seen inside an Eastern person before. I want to know what it looks like. Sithe: Of course you can't. It's a live specimen, as you can very well see. ???: ......... Hmph. Boring. Ryunosuke: ......... (I, I think... ...I just had a near-death experience!) Susato: Oh dear! Mr Naruhodo, you're as pale as a corpse! Ryunosuke: Then let's leave before I'm mistaken for one! 23rd October The Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower Susato: I had no idea there were so many people in the world. Ryunosuke: I know what you mean. It's really packed here today. Susato: It feels as though it's taken us two hours just to make our way through the crowds to this point. Ryunosuke: Has it? I shut my brain down so I didn't really notice, to be honest. Susato: Gosh...I do wish I had your absence of mind sometimes, Mr Naruhodo. ???: ...There you are. I had a feelin' you lot would show your mugs before long. Ryunosuke: Oh! Inspector Gregson! I see you're hard at work as usual! Gregson: Warm greetings to you. I do hope you've been keepin' well since last we met. Ryunosuke: What's with all the ceremony? We just saw each other in court this morning. Gregson: Not you, sunshine. The gentlewoman so loyally at your side. Susato: Oh! Why, thank you, Inspector. How good of you to notice. Ryunosuke: (He might be a bit rough around the edges, but he's still a proper English gentleman at heart...I suppose.) As you've probably guessed, we were hoping to investigate the scene some more. Gregson: Right. Well, that's the young trainee's domain. Oi! Get over here, Gina! ......... Ryunosuke: ...She seems to be busy playing with a puppy. (Probably giving it a traditional 'East End' training...) Susato: G-Gina?! She's a police officer now? Ryunosuke: Amazing, isn't it? Gregson: She's a good kid, actually. Heart's in the right place, anyway. She's got the detection bug, if you ask me. Yup, I think she'll follow in my footsteps nicely. Ryunosuke: ...What do you mean? Gregson: I'm bein' transferred. It's time for me to say toodle-oo to London. Susato: Oh no! Really? Ryunosuke: That's, that's a bit sudden, isn't it? I had no idea. Where are you going to be posted, then? We'll come to see how you're getting along. Gregson: Haha, not likely. But you're welcome to try. If you don't mind a trip to France, that is. Ryunosuke: To France? Gregson: I'll be workin' in the Paris Police Prefecture. ...Should be right up my alley. Ryunosuke: But, but France! It's an entirely different country! I don't understand. Why would you be sent there? Gregson: That's the way the adult world works, sunshine! Now, don't go pokin' your nose in where it's not wanted. ......... I'm intendin' to take the kid with me when I go. Ryunosuke: What? You're taking Gina to Paris?! Gregson: Well I can't leave her here in London. Who knows what'd become of her. Ryunosuke: (...I suppose he's worried she'd slip back into slipping her hands into people's pockets and purses...) Susato: I don't think he's worried about her pickpocketing, Mr Naruhodo. I think he's worried about the Reaper. Ryunosuke: Oh! (Of course! So that's playing on Inspector Gregson's mind too, is it?) Gregson: Anyway, I haven't mentioned any o' this to Gina. So don't go blabbin', you hear me? Ryunosuke: N-No, of course not. Gregson: I've gotta keep that divin' diva safe an' sound. ...Until all this is over, at least. Gina: Oi! Did you just call me a bloomin' 'divin' diva' again?! Gregson: So you heard that, did ya? Right, well... Any questions about the scene, you can put 'em to my capable detective diva here. Gina: Alright, you 'eard the boss! Inspector Lestrade's in charge 'ere now! Ryunosuke: (...I suppose I'd better keep my word and not mention anything about Paris.) So, um, Gina... You've got a new dog, have you? Gina: Isn't 'e great? Toby's 'is name. Susato: Oh, how delightful! He's absolutely adorable! Ryunosuke: (Yes, the dog does seem lovely. But it's the not-so-lovely Inspector Gregson that's playing on my mind, to be honest...) After clearing all Converse options in British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office then clearing all Converse options in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower: Gina: Right then, 'Oddo! Leave it to me. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Gina: We're gonna get goin' after that dodgy engineer cove right this minute. Oh, but 'ang on... Someone's s'posed to be on guard duty 'ere all the time. Ryunosuke: I'm afraid we can't help. We need to get on with our investigation as well, Gina. Gina: Oh...right. Oh well, never mind. It ain't gonna be me wot gets it in the neck. It'll be the boss. Ryunosuke: (Poor, poor Gregson again...) Gina: Ready Toby? Got that oil scent, 'ave ya? Come on then, boy! See ya later! Susato: I do hope the scent of that oil leads them to that swindler's workshop. Ryunosuke: Yes, I hope so too. Ideally before the dog swims across the Channel to France. 23rd October The Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage Susato: Oh my! So this is the machine... ...that was used to deceive people into thinking instantaneous kinesis had taken place. Ryunosuke: Yes, that's right. Or rather it WAS the machine. It's a little worse for wear at the moment... Susato: What extraordinary lengths Professor Harebrayne went to in order to obtain the research grant. Ryunosuke: No no no! The professor was tricked as well. He didn't know anything about it. Susato: Yes, of course. ...It is amazing, though, isn't it? The scale of the whole affair is so very British. Ryunosuke: You're right about that. You'd never see such a grand deception in Japan, that's for sure. Susato: Oh look...is that... ...Lord van Zieks? Ryunosuke: ......... ...So, I think we're more or less done here, aren't we? Shall we, Miss Susato? Susato: Already? Ryunosuke: He IS the Reaper, remember. We'd do well to keep our distance, I think. Susato: But we have permission to be here! From the top! We're perfectly well allowed to investigate this machine... as long as we don't touch anything. Ryunosuke: From the top? Do you mean Lord Stronghart? Susato: Exactly. So we can stay here and stare at this wreckage for as long as we like! Ryunosuke: (She could have been at the centre of the explosion here and it wouldn't have bent her steel will...) After clearing all Converse options with Barok van Zieks: ???: ......... Van Zieks: ...Ah, the file I requested for the trial tomorrow. Thank you. Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: ...Are you alright? Susato: Who, who is this man, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Lord van Zieks's apprentice, apparently. (So I'm not the only one. Susato-san can see it too...) Susato: Um...Lord van Zieks... ...may we speak with your apprentice for a moment? Van Zieks: With him? ...Why? Apprentice: ......... Susato: Kazuma-sama! Apprentice: ......... ...Kazu...ma...? Ryunosuke: ...! (I don't believe it!) Susato: Your, your posture... Your presence... It can only be... It's you...isn't it, Kazuma-sama?! Apprentice: ......... Ryunosuke: (I felt something strange the very first time I encountered this cloaked figure. As if I knew him somehow... Can it...? Can it really be you, Kazuma?) W-W-Wait! (Too late...) Van Zieks: What's going on here? After examining large machine and large cage, and clearing all Converse options with Barok van Zieks: Susato: ......... You'd already met that masked man, hadn't you, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Yes. Yesterday, in fact. At Lord van Zieks's office. Susato: I see... ......... And if...if Kazuma-sama really is still alive... ...it means that Mr Sholmes lied to us. Ryunosuke: ...I know. (We're going to need to speak to him about that.) Van Zieks: You're going to have to leave now. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: The Forensic Investigation Team are due to arrive shortly. If they find you here, it will...cause problems. Ryunosuke: What sort of problems? Van Zieks: Foreign affairs problems. Ryunosuke: (...Well we could do without that.) Alright, we'll be on our way. Let's go, Miss Susato. Susato: Of course. The Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower After clearing Converse option in Forensics Laboratory, correctly presenting Drebber's Card in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower, and examining large machine, large cage and clearing all Converse options with Barok van Zieks in Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage: Ryunosuke: Well, I think we've done all the investigating we can here for now. If we could just determine the whereabouts of Mr Drebber... Susato: I'm sure Gina and little Toby won't let us down! Now then... ...do you think we ought to try to speak with Mr Sholmes at this point? We have things to discuss and I'm dying to meet him again after all these months. Ryunosuke: Yes, it's quite possible he might know something useful, you're right. We ought to find him at Madame Tusspells. He's supposed to be working there as a temporary waxwork exhibit. Susato: Yes! Iris told me all about his latest unusual venture! 23rd October Madame Tusspells Museum of Waxworks Susato: We really do need to speak with Mr Sholmes, and I am longing to say hello again... ...but where is he? Ryunosuke: ......... I think you might find...that he's quite nearby, actually. Susato: Oh! What, what do you...? Sholmes: Indeed, my dear fellows...it is I! The world-famous great detective and waxwork... Herlock Sholmes! Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: Susato-san! Susato-saaaaaan! Sholmes: My most humble apologies... Susato: I thought I'd died and gone to eternal paradise for a moment...via London. Sholmes: My dear madam...allow me to make amends by offering you a tasty free deduction at some point. Ryunosuke: ...As long as it's not of questionable street food quality. Susato: I don't understand. Why are you working as a waxwork here, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: Merely a secret identity, you understand. Though the case is largely solved now. Susato: Largely solved? Ryunosuke: We're talking about the waxwork abduction, I presume? Sholmes: Indeed we are, my good fellow. As I predicted, it was as easy as proverbial pie. Though I confess...I'm yet to partake of a pie, proverbial or otherwise. Or any food so far today for that matter. ......... *Rumble rumble rumble* Ryunosuke: (That stomach rumble echoed around the whole museum...) So how did you manage to solve it so quickly? Sholmes: Ah, well, do remember I said it was largely solved. Anyway, I simply negotiated with the culprit. Are you familiar with the so-called 'telephone'? Susato: Oh yes! It's a most modern invention, allowing you to hold a conversation with people far away. In Japan, only the imperial capital and a handful of other cities are connected as yet. Sholmes: This morning, a telephone call was received here from the perpetrator of the abduction. As such, I was able to negotiate terms, and in the end, the waxwork was returned. Ryunosuke: That's amazing! Sholmes: Just between you and I... ...it would appear the culprit had always intended to return the stolen waxwork in any event. Susato: Oh! But...I thought whoever was responsible had demanded a ransom, no? Sholmes: Yes. I think perhaps... ...the ransom demand was necessary to avoid unwanted suspicion regarding the true motive. Susato: But...does that not mean... ...your negotiating was entirely unnecessary? Sholmes: ......... A fact that I must ask you to keep from Madame Tusspells at all costs! A hungry young Iris awaits my return to Baker Street, after all. Ryunosuke: (Poor Iris...) Sholmes: Now then, do I sense that you have some business with this great waxwork? After clearing all Converse options and presenting Photograph of Drebber: Sholmes: I have a suggestion, Mr Naruhodo! Will you indulge me? Ryunosuke: Oh! Well...what is it? Sholmes: As I explained to you when you arrived, the missing waxwork has been returned. And I personally reinstalled it in the exhibit from which it was taken...behind those thick curtains. Ryunosuke: Oh, yes... The 'Professor' exhibit, isn't it? Sholmes: Would you like to see it? For a mere five shillings? ...That's a special, one-time-only price, you understand. Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: The opportunity won't come again, I might add. Wouldn't you like to see the fruits of my labour? Susato: Oh! Well, we do have a rather pressing investigation to carry out. Perhaps we could postpone...? Sholmes: The price is a very reasonable five shilling. I think you'll find it's well worth it. Susato: ...! Ryunosuke: Are you...? Are you being quite serious, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: Surely you need only look at my expression to ascertain if this is seriousness or silliness? Ryunosuke: (I can never tell with you, that's the point.) Susato: Very well, it couldn't hurt. Here's your five shillings. Sholmes: ...Gratefully received. So, the special exhibit awaits behind the curtain. I invite you to peruse it at your leisure. Susato: Well, the money's been spent, so... Let's go and see the special exhibit! Ryunosuke: (Hm, through those heavy curtains at last...) 23rd October Madame Tusspells Special Exhibit Susato: Oh dear... I, I felt a shiver run down my spine as soon as we walked in here. Ryunosuke: Miss Susato! I say we turn on our heels and go straight home...via a really big confectionery! Susato: We...we certainly can't do that. We've paid five shillings already! Ryunosuke: ...True. Actually, now I'm looking a little more closely... ...we've paid good money to see an exhibit that's clearly incomplete...! The nerve of the great diddling detective is far more terrifying than anything else in this place! Susato: This must be what Mr Sholmes meant when he said the case was 'largely solved'. Ryunosuke: (Be that as it may... ...Mr Sholmes heavily implied there'd be a clue about the engineer in here, didn't he? But where...?) Since we've paid five shillings, let's do five shillings' worth of investigation, shall we? Susato: Yes, we, we will get what we paid for! Ryunosuke: (Is that fear or frustration...that's making Susato-san's voice tremble?) Ryunosuke: Ah! Susato: Wh-What on earth...? How can...? Ryunosuke: (I, I don't believe it! A black monocle!) Susato: Mr Naruhodo! Is, is it possible that this man is... Ryunosuke: Yes... It's Enoch Drebber! Susato: The colour of his hair is different, but... Ryunosuke: ...It's unmistakably him! ???: Indeed it is. Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: This man is the subject of your present hunt, I believe? Ryunosuke: Yes, that's...that's right. Just who is this man? Why is he here in this exhibit? Sholmes: ......... Ryunosuke: And why does the convict behind him have no head? Sholmes: ...The head was missing when the model was returned by the thief who stole it. Ryunosuke: (What a surprise.) So then the case isn't yet solved, is it? Sholmes: Did I not say so myself? 'Largely solved' were my words, I believe. But I must locate the missing head 'tout de suite' as Madame would say, or I'll be in grave trouble. A very hungry Iris still awaits my return to Baker Street... preferably with rations! Ryunosuke: Aaargh! Susato: Do you know, though... Something about this room is strange! Ryunosuke: Strange? What do you mean? Susato: Well, the displays in the House of Horrors are supposed to depict real events, are they not? Sholmes: Indeed they are, Miss Susato. Do go on... Susato: And, as terrifying as they are, the scenes in the other exhibits are believable. But this one... This surely couldn't ever really have happened, could it? Sholmes: ......... I think it's time I educated you a little... ...about the nature of the incidents involving the Professor ten years ago. Ryunosuke: ...! After clearing all Converse options, examining camera on figure on left, and examining neck of headless figure: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Gina: W-W-Wot the bleedin' Nora, 'Oddo?! Wot 'ave you gone an' done?! Ryunosuke: Gina! What are you doing here? Gina: I, I asked Iris, and she said this is where ya'd be, so... SO! Susato: G-Gina! Not so loud in the museum! Sholmes: Madame Tusspells will have you take a position as a waxwork if you're not careful. Ryunosuke: I think there might be a more pressing concern! Gina: I, I still 'ad some flash powder left from six months ago, so... SO! Susato: Alright, Gina, we understand! But please...put down the gun! Gina: Sorry, I...I got scared. Ryunosuke: (You should try being the one on the other end of the barrel.) So...what brings you here, Gina? Gina: Wot brings me 'ere? Wot d'ya think?! We found it! We found that dodgy cove's workshop! Ryunosuke: What?! You found Drebber's workshop?! Gina: Yup! Toby's nose took me straight there! The boss an' the others are headin' over there now in a drag. So come on! Here's the address. I got the boss to write it out. Susato: Oh, thank you, Gina! We'll make our way there at once. Gina: Alright then! See ya there! Sholmes: ...You go. Don't mind me. I'll just stay here...being still. Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: I know my place...in the exhibit over there... Susato: Oh dear, someone is feeling sorry for himself. Ryunosuke: ......... Let's go, Mr Sholmes! You're coming! Sholmes: Your words hearten me, I must say. But if I were to shirk my duties here... ...Madame would have me pay monetary recompense and Iris's dinner plate would be empty once more. Ryunosuke: Forget that! I'll pay for everything! Sholmes: ......... Then there's not a moment to lose, my dear fellow! I shall hail a carriage at once! Ryunosuke: (No offer to share the cost from Mr Sholmes, then...) Susato: I shall gladly pay half, Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: Thank you, Miss Susato. Right, let's go! 23rd October Enoch Drebber's Workshop Ryunosuke: That looks like... Susato: Oh! It's another super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine! Sholmes: Indeed it would appear so. Though only a prototype, naturally. Gina: Ah, so ya got 'ere, then? Susato: Gina! Well done for finding this place! And in such little time... You've really worked miracles! Gina: It's Toby 'ere who's the miracle worker. Toby: Woof! Gregson: Ah...I thought you lot would show up before long. Ryunosuke: Hello, Inspector. (That's one knitted brow... He looks like he's eating a lemon, not a bag of fish and chips...) Susato: So, Inspector...is there any sign of the engineer? Gregson: Sadly not. We didn't find a soul in here. Susato: Oh...what a shame. Ryunosuke: Well, thank you for letting us know about this place and giving us the chance to investigate. Gregson: Accordin' to what Gina tells me, we only found it thanks to a clue that you lot turned up. I wouldn't wanna, say, go to Paris with a debt of gratitude unpaid now, would I? Ryunosuke: ...Thank you. Gregson: Anyway, if you're hopin' to snoop around in here, I'd get crackin'. Lord van Zieks and the Forensic Investigation Team are on their way here as we speak. Ryunosuke: Them again... Gregson: I imagine you've got the picture by now. They don't take too kindly to lawyer types. Ryunosuke: Right. Sholmes: So then, my dear fellow! Let's turn this place upside-down whilst we have the chance! Gregson: And you, Sholmes. Sholmes: Pardon? Gregson: They take even less kindly to 'great detectives' than they do to lawyers. Sholmes: Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha hah! Very droll, Gregson, very droll. But you may consider me nothing more than an inconspicuous waxwork model! Ryunosuke: (Right then...let's see what we can find in here!) After examining overturned trophy, large machine prototype, door, and quiver full of arrows: *Thud* Susato: Oh... Ryunosuke: Is something wrong, Miss Susato? Susato: Well...I thought I heard a noise. From the far side of that door. Well, Gina? Did you hear it too? Gina: Y-Yeah, I 'eard it an' all. Wot d'ya reckon, Toby? Toby: Woof, woof! Gregson: Right, mind the grease! *Thud!* *Thud!* *Thud!* Gregson: Whoever's in there, open up! This is Scotland Yard! .........*Clomp clomp clomp clomp**Squeak... Clunk!* Susato: Oh my... Someone IS in there! Gregson: Argh! This rotten, bleedin' lock! Sholmes: My dear Gregson, as I said only minutes ago... ...if only it were countenanced, I could unlock that door in less than a minute. Gregson: ...! ......... Fine. I'll take the rap for it. Just get us through that blasted door! *Click* Sholmes: There! You may enter at will. Ryunosuke: (You've confused minutes with seconds, I think...) Sholmes: Time is of the essence, I feel. What are we waiting for? Gregson: Nothin' for it, I suppose. This is an emergency. Sholmes: There's a strong possibility that beyond that door...is the engineer you all seek. Be prepared for action, my dear fellow! Ryunosuke: Yes! Mr Drebber's Back Room Ryunosuke: What...? What's happened in here? (Why is everything upside-down?) Gina: Rats! There ain't no one in 'ere after all! Susato: But, but there must be! It was only moments ago that we heard those noises. Ryunosuke: Maybe that was the sound of Drebber running away. Susato: But there's only one door into this room! Sholmes: And no windows that could afford an escape route. Those skylights are too high. Ryunosuke: (...? What's that up there? Are they footprints...on the ceiling?) Gregson: Blow me! What have we here, then? Looks like someone was tryin' to burn somethin' in a hurry. Susato: Oh, that looks like a set of blueprints! Ryunosuke: To what? Gregson: To that Professor Harebrayne's barmy machine, is it? Blimey! If we'd had these, there'd have been no need to muck about tryin' to investigate all that scrap metal! Sholmes: There is something of great interest here, too. This rope was lying on the floor at the foot of that pillar. Ryunosuke: A rope? What's significant about that? Sholmes: ...Never mind. You see, but you do not observe, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: ...! Susato: We must investigate the entire room thoroughly! And before the Forensic Investigation Team arrive, too! Ryunosuke: Um...Mr Sholmes? Have you found something? Sholmes: Ah, Mr Naruhodo. Yes, in point of fact, something rather fascinating. What do you make...of this? Ryunosuke: Hm, let's see... (I've never seen anything like it before.) It looks like a bundle of thick cigars wrapped up in a large watch to me, but- Aaaaaah! Ryunosuke: Miss Susato! What's the matter? Susato: That, that, that, that... That's a... Surely that's a time bomb...isn't it? Gregson: WHAAAAAAAAT?! Did you say...?! Gina: A...time bomb...? Ryunosuke: Um...sorry, but... ...what is a 'time bomb' exactly? Gregson: Eh? Sholmes: Ah ha ha ha ha hah! You truly are one of a kind, Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: (I won't take that as a compliment...) Gina: Hah! Ya don't know nuffin', do ya, 'Oddo! Ryunosuke: ...You haven't got a clue what it is, either, have you, Gina? Sholmes: I invite you to consult a dictionary later, Mr Naruhodo. But this particular specimen is no time bomb. Though I confess it has a very similar appearance. Susato: Oh! Oh, well, thank goodness! But then...what is it? Sholmes: ......... I see... So that's it... Ryunosuke: ...! Susato: Goodness! Mr Sholmes... Have you seen to the heart of the matter? Sholmes: There are times when I consider my lot most unfair. For I'm fated never to know how it feels to flounder as you do when a puzzle presents itself. But...I have learnt to accept the hardships that come with being a great detective, Miss Susato. Ryunosuke: (Here we go. I feel a great deduction coming...) Sholmes: Once again, I can draw two conclusions from the scene we see before us. The first... ...is that the inverted nature of the furniture in this room is the work of Drebber himself. Susato: Oh! But how could you...? Sholmes: And the second conclusion... ...is that the small device on the floor there is without question completely genuine. Susato: Please, Mr Sholmes! You must explain everything! Sholmes: ...It would be a pleasure. After all, it is a great detective's civic duty to teach Scotland Yard the finer points of the trade. Gregson: ......... Ryunosuke: (Well, Inspector Gregson seems delighted with the idea, anyway.) Sholmes: Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Susato: Oh, you deflected the inspector's glare with such fortitude there, Mr Sholmes! Well done! Sholmes: You're too kind, my dear madam. I hereby dedicate this great deduction to you. Kindly stand just there, Miss Susato. Susato: Oh...yes. I'd be delighted! Sholmes: So...shall we begin? Once again, Herlock Sholmes is proud to present...his 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'! The Great Deduction The game is afoot! Topic 1 Flipped Furniture Sholmes: It's plain to see that this room is in complete disarray. The bed, the table and chairs, the lamp... Everything is upside-down. Almost as if every item in the room had, until recently, been happily positioned on the ceiling... ...before falling straight down onto the floor. Susato: Every item in the room was on the ceiling... Are, are you suggesting that...? Sholmes: Indeed. The key here... ...is gravity. It would appear that technology has at last succeeded in freeing us from the great pull of the earth. For the gravity in this room was reversed, and then... suddenly restored to normality! Susato: Goodness! Sholmes: The inverted furniture clearly reveals the truth about the part gravity played in this whole business. I quite understand your scepticism, Miss Susato. I, too, was incredulous at first. However, my conviction in my analysis was cemented when I observed...this. An anti-gravity device...almost identical to one that featured in a dream of mine only the other day, in fact. Susato: But, but then why does it have a clock on it? Sholmes: A most relevant question, indeed. That is a timing device that controls when the gravity direction will switch. There was clearly a requirement for the engineer to be able to restore normal gravity automatically. And the commotion we heard earlier from the other side of the door was the moment that restoration occurred. Yes, the reason why everything in here has been turned upside-down is because of the anti-gravity device! So you see, we need look no further to explain the state in which we now find this room. The direction in which gravity acts in here was reversed by Mr Drebber... ...before being restored to normality in an automatic fashion some time later by the timer device! I have witnessed precisely this scene in a dream I once had when I fell out of bed. Topic 1 Flipped Furniture Conclusion Because gravity was reversed Topic 2 Missing Engineer Sholmes: Now, let us consider the next conundrum: What was our engineer friend's aim? Indubitably, the greatest clue we have to explain his actions...is above our heads. Susato: Yes, how is it possible that there are footprints all the way up there on the ceiling? Sholmes: A question whose answer will lead us neatly to the truth, my dear madam. The reason there are footprints on the ceiling...is because of the nearby skylight! Of course, Drebber's aim was singular: to escape. However, there is but one way into this room. ...Excepting the skylight, that is. Susato: Ah... Sholmes: By inverting the gravity in here, Drebber was able to 'fall' conveniently to the ceiling... ...and make his escape via the otherwise inaccessible skylight, leaving those footprints behind on the way. Susato: But the ceiling in here is very high, Mr Sholmes. If the gravity reversal was sudden, wouldn't Mr Drebber have fallen up to the ceiling rather violently? Sholmes: Hm, 'falling up' is both scientifically and philosophically a rather interesting concept, I feel. But the man was cornered with nowhere to run, so escape through the skylight was his only option. You may recall that I found this in the room earlier, which I believe offers a solution. Susato: Oh! The rope... Sholmes: To reach the intended destination, what better tool than this rope? By anchoring one end to the wall, the man was able to 'lower' himself safely to the ceiling. Which explains how Drebber was able to escape this room before our arrival. He reversed the pull of gravity and fled via the skylight! And personally, I should very much like to reverse the pull of gravity again now...just for fun. Topic 2 Missing Engineer Conclusion Escaped via the skylight Sholmes: Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this topsy-turvy puzzle! Gregson: ......... Gina: ......... Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: (She's completely spellbound...) Um, Mr Sholmes...there is just one thing that troubles me. Sholmes: I would expect nothing less. You're destined to be troubled by 'just one thing' for the rest of your life. Ryunosuke: The thing is... Is such a thing actually possible? An anti-gravity device, I mean. Sholmes: ...I would say that with man's current scientific knowledge at the turn of the twentieth century... ...it's no more possible than instantaneous kinesis! Ryunosuke: ......... But your whole deduction hinges on it! Sholmes: Ah, but my dear fellow... ...when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth... ...however improbable it may seem. Ryunosuke: Haah... Sholmes: It's a marvellous line, wouldn't you agree? One of my more enduring pearls of wisdom. I had Iris come up with the exact phrasing. My original was...clumsy. Ryunosuke: ...Yes, I have a feeling I've read it in something that Miss Susato lent me once. Susato: Susato: Actually...there IS one other thing, Mr Sholmes... Ryunosuke: (Ah, the spell's broken at last.) Susato: The rope you found was on the floor, wasn't it? Sholmes: Indeed it was. In lonely coils near the wall. Susato: But...if Mr Drebber had used it to escape in the way you described... ...wouldn't it still be tied to the wall? Sholmes: ......... Mysteries inevitably unravel in the end. As, I think you'll find, do ropes. And as evidence of such, you need only look at the mystery we faced in this room, now skilfully unravelled. Ryunosuke: (That argument is as circular as the coils of rope...) Susato: I think perhaps we might need to give Mr Sholmes the usual little helping hand. I'm sure with some minor corrections, the great detective's great deduction will lead us to the truth! Ryunosuke: Yes, you're right. And we must do it quickly, before Enoch Drebber gets too far away! Sholmes: If you're ready, then let us resume... ...Herlock Sholmes's 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'! Course Correction Hold it, Mr Sholmes! Topic 1 Flipped Furniture Conclusion Because gravity was reversed Sholmes: It's plain to see that this room is in complete disarray. The bed, the table and chairs, the lamp... Everything is upside-down. Almost as if every item in the room had, until recently, been happily positioned on the ceiling... ...before falling straight down onto the floor. Susato: Every item in the room was on the ceiling... Are, are you suggesting that...? Sholmes: Indeed. The key here... ...is gravity. It would appear that technology has at last succeeded in freeing us from the great pull of the earth. For the gravity in this room was reversed, and then... suddenly restored to normality! Susato: Goodness! Sholmes: The inverted furniture clearly reveals the truth about the part gravity played in this whole business. Susato: To think gravity could have been reversed in this very room! I find the whole idea utterly enthralling! Only Mr Sholmes could conceive of such an explanation! Ryunosuke: But the man himself admitted it was a scientific impossibility, so... Susato: Yes, you're quite right. We must completely discount the idea at once. Ryunosuke: Ooh, that's unusually merciless of you, Miss Susato. Susato: 'When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth.' The great detective himself said so, didn't he? Ryunosuke: While refusing to part with his dreams of anti-gravity devices... Susato: ...Yes, I suppose so. Ryunosuke: Well, let's see if examining this topsy-turvy scene a little more closely... ...reveals some proof that shows exactly what the gravity in this room was or wasn't doing! The inverted furniture clearly reveals the truth about the part gravity played in this whole business. Susato: If the reversal of gravity is scientifically impossible, perhaps we can prove it didn't occur? Ryunosuke: Well, to prove a hypothesis is wrong... Susato: ...The easiest way is just to find an obvious exception. Ryunosuke: (Let's have another good look around...) Ryunosuke: The upright vase clearly reveals the truth about the part gravity played in this whole business. Sholmes: Upon my word, Mr Naruhodo, you've surpassed yourself. By completely turning my argument on its head! Trying to impress your assistant here, perhaps? Ryunosuke: ...No one is trying to steal your spotlight here, Mr Sholmes. Trust me. Sholmes: As you rightly say, though it appears at first glance that all the furniture in the room is upside-down... ...this unassuming, slender vase is standing keenly to attention. And unlike the large safe, there is nothing affixing it to the floor. Ryunosuke: And it's the exception that breaks the rule. Sholmes: In short, much as it pains me... ...the gravity in this room was never inverted at all! Ryunosuke: ...My, my deepest sympathies for your loss. Susato: Oh, poor Mr Sholmes... Sholmes: But the show must go on! So...let us continue with our deductions. Now that we know this contrivance is not in fact an anti-gravity device, there remains but one other possibility. Ryunosuke: ...You don't say. Sholmes: Someone deliberately turned over every piece of furniture in here! Ryunosuke: Which might sound obvious, but leaves one mystery very much unsolved. Namely, why would anyone choose to do that? Sholmes: Quite! And naturally, there is an explanation. Yes, the reason why everything in here has been turned upside-down is because of the anti-gravity device! Ryunosuke: He's absolutely determined that this device must have something to do with it, isn't he? Susato: I'm afraid the lure of an exciting scientific explanation is too strong. Ryunosuke: Well...there's no doubt that somebody did this. Somebody turned all this furniture over. So whoever it was must have had a reason. Susato: I'm afraid nothing comes to mind at all, though. Ryunosuke: Well, let's look around and see if the answer presents itself. Yes, the reason why everything in here has been turned upside-down is because of the anti-gravity device! Ryunosuke: Now we've shown it was nothing to do with gravity, we know somebody must have done this to the furniture. But who? And why? Susato: Yes, those are the questions we really need to answer! Ryunosuke: Well we at least need to resolve one of them here! Ryunosuke: Yes, the reason why everything in here has been turned upside-down is because of the safe combination! Sholmes: Precisely! I believe, Mr Naruhodo... ...that you had a very similar experience once, did you not? Ryunosuke: Yes! Last year... ...when I bought a lottery ticket and noted the ticket number down on the inside cover of a book just in case! Sholmes: That's it! For people are forgetful souls at heart, and always make a written note of important information. Susato: ...Just keeping the ticket itself safe would be more sensible, I think. Sholmes: And what, pray, happened next, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: When the day of the draw came round... ...I'd forgotten which book I'd written the number in and had to turn my room upside-down to find it! Sholmes: That's it! For people are forgetful souls at heart, and always forget where they've noted things down! Susato: Not if you always note things in the same place... Ryunosuke: I actually won the second prize, you know. But I couldn't remember which magazine I'd slipped the ticket into, so I had to turn my room upside- Sholmes: Thank you, Mr Naruhodo, but I believe I've proved my point now. Which is that a very similar scenario has clearly unfolded in this room. Ryunosuke: Finding himself requiring access to the safe, the occupant of this room needed the combination code. He remembered that he'd written it on the underside of a piece of furniture, but forgot which one. Sholmes: ...Leading to the state in which we now find the room. Yes, Mr Drebber overturned all the furniture in here... ...in a desperate hurry to locate the combination code that would unlock the safe! Topic 1 Flipped Furniture Conclusion Because gravity was reversed To find the safe combination Solved Topic 2 Missing Engineer Conclusion Escaped via the skylight Sholmes: Now, let us consider the next conundrum: What was our engineer friend's aim? Indubitably, the greatest clue we have to explain his actions...is above our heads. Susato: Yes, how is it possible that there are footprints all the way up there on the ceiling? Sholmes: A question whose answer will lead us neatly to the truth, my dear madam. The reason there are footprints on the ceiling...is because of the nearby skylight! Susato: Well, if a change in the direction of gravity can't explain it, then how did those footprints get there? Ryunosuke: Yes, I feel as though that particular mystery has just become even harder to solve. Susato: I can't think of any other way to explain it at all. Ooh... Life was so much simpler in those halcyon days when gravity could be reversed. Ryunosuke: It was minutes ago. And those 'halcyon days' never existed in the first place. Susato: Well, I suppose we must simply put our faith in Mr Sholmes and observe the area in more detail. Ryunosuke: (...Putting our faith in Mr Sholmes is what gets us into these situations in the first place...) The reason there are footprints on the ceiling...is because of the nearby skylight! Ryunosuke: Those footprints up there on the ceiling really are a puzzle. Susato: And as they're so close to the skylight... ...it really is very hard to believe the two are unrelated. Ryunosuke: But perhaps we need to approach this from a different angle... Ryunosuke: The reason there are footprints on the ceiling...is because of the nearby shoe! Sholmes: And on closer inspection, there are clearly footprints all over the balloon as well. In other words, the aim was never the skylight at all, but the balloon. Susato: But...for what purpose? Sholmes: A green balloon... Hmmm, that seems somewhat familiar data. Ryunosuke: Ah! Susato: It was a piece of a green balloon's envelope that Mr Naruhodo and Iris found at the scene! Ryunosuke: And inside the green balloon that Master Gotts claims he saw above the stage when the incident occurred... ...was the second birdcage. The crux of the whole instantaneous kinesis deception... Susato: You, you mean to say...? Sholmes: If we assume the balloon in here is a model of the one used on the day... ...there is a strong possibility something may be concealed inside it. Something our absconder was desperate to retrieve before making a hasty getaway. Ryunosuke: But, but the balloon's out of reach! Sholmes: Hence why he resorted to a projectile. Namely...the shoe. Ryunosuke: Ah! Sholmes: Most probably, Drebber intended to tear a hole in the envelope by assailing it with the shoe. However, his efforts were thwarted when the shoe itself became a prisoner of those lofty heights. Susato: Oh, dear... We desperately need to examine that balloon. If only there were some way we could see inside... Sholmes: You may recall that I found this in the room earlier, which I believe offers a solution. Susato: Oh! The rope... Sholmes: To reach the intended destination, what better tool than this rope? Susato: ...Mr Sholmes has managed to bring the deduction back to the rope! Ryunosuke: Alright, I have to admit...that was clever. So we just throw the rope up to the balloon and then pull it down to us on the ground? Susato: ...Which is much easier said than done, I feel. And could take us a very long time as well. Ryunosuke: True. Perhaps we need a more surefire method. In fact, we already have one of course, don't we?! To reach the intended destination, what better tool than this rope? Ryunosuke: Oh, look! The hotheaded Mr Sholmes is trying to lasso the balloon! Susato: It would be wonderful if he succeeded. Then we could pull it down to us. But it would be even more wonderful if there were some better way. Ryunosuke: (And we need to think of it fast, before Mr Sholmes starts tiring of being a cowboy...) Ryunosuke: To reach the intended destination, what better tool than this crossbow? Susato: That was found at the scene, in fact! Ryunosuke: And in all likelihood, belongs to Mr Drebber. Sholmes: If the man had only brought it away with him that day... ...he could have avoided losing a shoe at such a critical time as this. Sholmes: So...shall we? Your curiosity is deeply stirred no doubt, my dear fellows. What is it that Enoch Drebber has hidden inside that balloon...? *BAM* Susato: Aaaaaah! Ryunosuke: W-What the...? A, a waxwork? Sholmes: Indeed it is. A waxwork head inside a metal mask. A mask that is shut tight and fastened with a strong and quite impenetrable lock. Ryunosuke: (So we can't see the face inside, that means.) Susato: Just a moment... This...this is the head of a waxwork model? Does that mean...? Oh goodness! Sholmes: I see you've joined the dots, Miss Susato. Excellent. Ryunosuke: Ah! (Of course! A headless waxwork model!) The case of the abducted Madame Tusspells model that you'd 'largely' solved... It was only the head of the killer that was still missing! Sholmes: Indeed it was. But I believe Madame Tusspells will now have to settle her sizeable account with me. This, as you have now surmised, is the head of the infamous Professor. Ryunosuke: Yes... Susato: But why is it here? Sholmes: ...This conclusively confirms my suspicions. The man responsible for stealing the Professor from Madame Tusspells... ...and returning it - sans tête - earlier today...was none other than Enoch Drebber! Ryunosuke: (This is incredible. Professor Harebrayne's case and the waxwork abduction are... They're inextricably linked! By Enoch Drebber's workshop!) The waxwork head has been entered into the Court Record. Sholmes: Well...it appears our logical pleasure cruise has come to an end, my dear fellows. All that remains is... Yes, to speak with the architect of this adventure. Susato: The architect? Ryunosuke: You mean...Mr Drebber? Sholmes: As it seems quite impossible that he escaped via one of the skylights... ...obviously the man must still be here in the room. Susato: WHAT?! Sholmes: And his location should be abundantly clear... ...if you simply reflect on the journey we've made together during this deduction. Ryunosuke: (Enoch Drebber is right here, somewhere in this room?) Sholmes: So, Mr Naruhodo, will you do the honours? Ryunosuke: ...Yes, of course. Mr Drebber's hiding place must be the... Mr Drebber's hiding place must be the... Susato: Where could Mr Drebber be hiding? I'm sure that we've already come across a clue that reveals the answer, you know. Ryunosuke: (Yes, it was when we deduced why all the furniture in here was upside-down, wasn't it? That gave us the answer, I'm sure.) Susato: We're very close now, Mr Naruhodo! I can sense it! Ryunosuke: Before we gained access to this back room, we heard noises from in here. Sholmes: Which tells us that the engineer was still in the building at that point in time. Ryunosuke: He was in fact searching for the combination to his safe. Sholmes: And pressed for time, made no attempt to right the furniture that he overturned in the process. From which we can deduce that his search for the combination happened very recently indeed. In summary...Mr Enoch Drebber... ...is, at this very moment, inside the safe! Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this topsy-turvy puzzle! Topic 2 Missing Engineer Conclusion Escaped via the skylight Inside the safe Solved Deduction CompleteElementary! Sholmes: So...Mr Naruhodo. I think perhaps it's time we ended this game of hide-and-seek, don't you? Ryunosuke: By opening the safe, you mean? Sholmes: What else? Ryunosuke: Let's see... The combination was one... Susato: Four three two five eight two. Ryunosuke: I knew that! (Alright then. Here goes...) You found me... Gregson: Right then, sir... Mr Enoch Drebber, I presume? Drebber: Correct. Ryunosuke: You'd better start talking! You tricked Professor Harebrayne with that bogus machine you built! Susato: And you shall have to explain the theft of the waxwork from Madame Tusspells as well! Drebber: Whilst I would be delighted to answer your many questions... ...personally, I would advise that you deactivate my little parcel first. Ryunosuke: Deactivate...? Susato: Your parcel...? Drebber: I refer of course... ...to the time bomb. I left it in a most prominent position. Susato: Ah! Drebber: Ha-ha-ha. I see. Stunned silence. You're all gearing up to die with me then? Susato: Nooooooo! Susato: Mr Sholmes! With only seven seconds to spare! Ryunosuke: That was too close for comfort! I've got one foot in the grave already! Gregson: Are you tryin' to help us get a killer, or get us killed?! Susato: Mr Sholmes's deductions can be...completely life-altering, can't they? Sholmes: Well, my dear fellows, that was a close shave. The resemblance to an anti-gravity device is really quite startling, I must say. Susato: Anti-gravity devices don't exist! Ryunosuke: (Whew, I wouldn't push it, Mr Sholmes...) After clearing all Converse options: Ryunosuke: I think we have a fairly good idea of what's been going on here now. But what about the two incidents you've evidently been involved in recently? Drebber: ......... Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne's instantaneous kinesis experiment at the Great Exhibition... ...and the waxwork model you stole, which this head belongs to. Drebber: That's no ordinary head, you know. That's the head...of the Professor. Clad in a mask with a lock so strong, I'm unable to open it safely to reveal the killer's identity. I've been considering carrying it around as...protection. After all- ???: That's enough! Sithe: What's going on here, Gregson? I'm sure you're aware that I have sole jurisdiction to investigate here. Gregson: Ah, um... Yes, well... Ryunosuke: (Dr Sithe again. So the Forensic Investigation Team are here...) Sithe: And you know full well this engineer is a key witness. Why are you allowing this lawyer access to him? If Lord Stronghart knew of this, you'd be finished. Gregson: ......... Sithe: You lot. Leave at once. Sholmes: My dear madam, there's no need for such a threatening tone, I assure you. After all, that's no way to greet an old acquaintance, is it, Dr Sithe? Sithe: Hello...Sholmes. Ryunosuke: (Mr Sholmes knows Dr Sithe?) Sholmes: If it's protecting the machine next door that's causing such a sour expression on your face, you are quite misguided. It's really nothing more than a shell, you- Sithe: Get out! Sholmes: But of course. We'll show ourselves the door. ...I see you haven't softened at all. Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: Yes? Sholmes: It would appear that our delightfully entertaining investigations have run their course for today. Ryunosuke: But, but Mr Sholmes...! Sholmes: Let us leave this place in the doctor's capable hands. Ryunosuke: ...! Sithe: I said get out! Now! All of you! Your presence here is not required either, Gregson. Gregson: ......... Understood. But I'll just say one thing before I head off: If it wasn't for this lawyer an' his companions... ...we'd never have found this place. And the whole workshop would've been blown to bits. There was a time bomb set in here that this lot disarmed. Ryunosuke: Inspector... Sithe: ......... Drebber: Kuh kuh kuh... Gregson: ...! Somethin' given you a chuckle, has it, Drebber? Drebber: Ah, so sorry. Didn't mean to offend. You're quite right of course. You did disarm the time bomb, didn't you? Yes... You did disarm that one. Gina: Eh? Wot are you...? 'That' one? Ya, ya mean...? Drebber: Kuh kuh kuh... It was an hour later that we heard the news. Of the enormous explosion that ripped through the experimentation stage at the Great Exhibition. Professor Harebrayne's invention and all its secrets...were blown away forever. To be continued... Enoch Drebber's Workshop (before examining Herlock Sholmes or timer device in Mr Drebber's Back Room)\nThe Return of the Great Departed Soul TranscriptPart 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 424th October, 9:11 a.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' AntechamberHarebrayne: Good morning to you, Mr Naruhodo!Ryunosuke: Ah, good morning, Professor. Ready for today's proceedings?Harebrayne: ......... I hope so... I should be... Even I, with nothing left to-Sholmes:Good morning, my dear fellows!Ryunosuke: Oh, Mr Sholmes! You're here!Sholmes: Why, naturally! A true gentleman stands shoulder to shoulder with his friends in battle at all times!Ryunosuke: Thank you. I really appreciate it. ...I'll...see you later, then. Now, Professor... We really need you to remain calm in the courtroom today.Susato: Yes. Do try your hardest not to enter the witness stand uninvited again.Harebrayne: Yes! I will! I, I realise it was a mistake, but I-Sholmes:My dear fellows, I must interject!Ryunosuke: Oh...you're still here, Mr Sholmes. What's the matter?Sholmes: Surely you've overlooked some praise, have you not? To be cast in my direction, hm?Ryunosuke: Sorry? I don't follow.Sholmes: Must I spell it out? I, the great Herlock Sholmes... The greatest detective, of worldwide acclamation... ...arose at some ungodly hour to be here now! First thing in the morning! A miracle, you must agree!Ryunosuke: Well...if I must agree, then...Sholmes: As you know, my sleep is quite impregnable. Iris had to employ her full gamut of tactics: She pulled the covers off, shook me, poked both cheeks, punched me and kicked me from the bed. Then she poured a boiling cup of her latest experimental blend on my face and at last I was bestirred!Susato: Oh my... Iris has been busy.Ryunosuke: Iris doesn't have it in her to go that far. She's too nice.Harebrayne: Ah, I sense the spirit of a fellow scientist! One who relishes the infinite possibilities of blending tea!Sholmes: I'm the one worthy of praise here! Not Iris! This is my victory!???:Sorry to cut in...Ryunosuke: Oh, Inspector Gregson! Good morning!Sholmes: Gregson, my dear fellow, why the grim expression at this delightfully early hour?Gregson: Oh, I don't know. Maybe because I've been confronted with a grimmer expression, eh?Sholmes: Dear me... Are you going to take that insult lying down, Professor?Harebrayne: Wha...? WHAT...? I DOOON'T KNOOOW!Ryunosuke: (Poor Professor...)Gregson: Anyway, here's the paperwork you asked for.Ryunosuke: What paperwork?Sholmes: Ah, I took the liberty of requesting it yesterday. I have a feeling it may prove useful.Gregson: You wouldn't believe the hoops I had to jump through to get this brought out of the archives. It's the Professor's autopsy report.Susato: That... That mass murderer's?!Ryunosuke: (Who killed five members of the aristocracy...)Gregson: He was found guilty in a closed trial ten years ago now. It was all done under wraps. And he was quickly executed soon after the trial. ...It's all in here.The killer's autopsy report has been entered into the Court Record.Ryunosuke: I, I don't know what to say! Thank you, Inspector!Sholmes: Yes, much obliged, Gregson.Gregson: Us lowly lot at the Yard are just doing what we can...in the shadow of the great detective Sholmes, of course.Ryunosuke: Well then, Professor Harebrayne...this is it! Today we're going to lay all this to rest at last.Susato: I wish you the best of luck, Professor!Harebrayne: ......... I suppose...he'll be in there today, will he? Drebber...Susato: Yes. We expect the prosecution to summon him as a witness.Harebrayne: I'm still amazed that you managed to find him in just one day... I really owe you both so much!Bailiff: Counsel! And the defendant! The trial is about to resume. Kindly make your way into the courtroom at once!Ryunosuke: (This is it then. The final chapter. Funny. My heart's racing a little... I've not felt this before, actually. This strange foreboding... As if...something's going to happen in this trial that I'm not ready for. But I can't let that distract me from the only thing that really matters... Finding the truth!)24th October, 9:30 a.m. The Old Bailey CourtroomJudge: In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session again. We resume the public hearing of Albert Harebrayne, here present, who stands accused of murder. Are the counsels for the prosecution and defence ready to proceed?Van Zieks: The prosecution is ready, My Lord.Ryunosuke: ......... The defence is ready, My Lord. (As promised, Lord van Zieks has his apprentice with him. His apprentice with memory loss...)Susato: .........Judge: If I may, Lord van Zieks...Van Zieks: Yes, My Lord?Judge: There appears to be someone standing at your side...Van Zieks: Ah, yes. My apprentice and assistant. The prosecution believes today's proceedings will see the complexity of this case rise considerably. I therefore instructed my assistant to attend to ensure the smooth running of the trial.Ryunosuke: (And the smooth running of liquid refreshments, by the look of it...)Susato: The way he holds himself... The way he moves... It couldn't be anyone else...Ryunosuke: But he's still suffering from amnesia...so there's really nothing we can do at the moment.Susato: I know, but... Oh, this is so very hard.Judge: It would appear the prosecution has done a fine job in responding to the demands of the court made yesterday. I understand you have successfully secured the engineer who disappeared from the scene on the day in question.Van Zieks: ...Yes, My Lord. I intend to call him as a witness shortly.Judge: Very good, very good. Now then, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...who have been chosen at random to represent the will of the people in this courtroom today... ...are you ready and willing to proceed?Juror No. 1: Of course, My Lord. I'm sure we all understand the importance of doing our civic duty.Juror No. 2: I do so despise deception and deceit. I find it so very wearing...Juror No. 3: To take a man's life with a conjuring trick... It is against the magician's code, not to mention the law.Juror No. 4: Any fake scientists should feel the wrath of God, if you ask me!Juror No. 5: Um, we 'ave to listen to what's said on both sides 'the fence, and um...then settle on one... That's it, isn't it?Juror No. 6: Wasn't like this in my day. Wasn't like this at all...Judge: If all parties are ready to proceed, you may begin, Lord van Zieks.Van Zieks: Before I do, My Lord, there is a report I must read to the court. Yesterday at the Great Exhibition grounds, the evidence of primary importance in this case... ...the super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine, which was installed on the experimentation stage... ...was deliberately destroyed in an explosion effected by an unknown person or persons.Juror No. 1: It was...WHAT?!Juror No. 6: An explosion?!Juror No. 4: This...is an outrage!Judge: Yes, I heard this grave news yesterday. Scotland Yard submitted a report to my office in the evening. I read that the machine was blasted to smithers, and the wreckage reduced to ashes in the flames.Van Zieks: I have here a photographic print of the scene, taken in the wake of the explosion. It shows what little remains of the machine.Judge: Hm, yes... A terrible business...Ryunosuke: (He did it to destroy the evidence, did he?)Susato: That Enoch Drebber...Judge: The court will take this print as evidence, Counsel.The post-explosion photograph has been entered into the Court Record.Van Zieks: Late yesterday afternoon... ...the protection afforded to the machine by the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act was revoked. However, before a thorough investigation could begin, the invention was obliterated from existence. As such...this will become a very different trial.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: As it stands now, with no evidence on which to draw meaningful conclusions... ...the authenticity of the kinesis machine will remain forever in obscurity.Judge: Hm, indeed... A most unfortunate state of affairs.Van Zieks: However, one thing remains clear: The victim's death was the result of the actions of the accused. Of that we can be certain. For it was the accused himself who was operating the machine and who ultimately caused its loss of control.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: As Lord van Zieks rightly says, this is a very different trial now.Van Zieks: ...!Ryunosuke: The accused accepts responsibility for his part in the events that transpired. He acknowledges that Mr Asman died as a result of the accident caused by his machine's malfunction. However, unbeknownst to the professor... ...he was being deliberately deceived by a pair of very clever fraudsters.Judge: Names, Counsel, if you please.Ryunosuke: The engineer, Mr Enoch Drebber, and the victim himself, Mr Odie Asman.Van Zieks: .........Ryunosuke: So what exactly were these two men up to behind the defendant's back?! The defence intends to expose that information, thus establishing the unequivocal innocence of the defendant!Judge: Thank you, Counsels. The positions of the prosecution and defence have been clearly stated. Lord van Zieks, summon your first witness, please.Van Zieks: At once, My Lord. The prosecution calls the engineer, Mr Enoch Drebber, to the stand!Van Zieks: State your name and occupation for the court.Drebber: Name...Enoch Drebber. Occupation... ...hard to pin down, I would say.See that black monocle?Yes, why do I feel as though I've seen it somewhere before...?Oh! You, too? I had exactly the same feeling myself.Hm...Drebber: .........Judge: Your file indicates that you are currently being investigated in connection with another case. The theft...of a waxwork model, is it? A most extraordinary-sounding business.Drebber: ...But that has no bearing on this trial, I assure you. Cleave it from your mind.Van Zieks: You're familiar with the public experiment carried out at the Great Exhibition some days ago? The accused's super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis demonstration.Drebber: Yes...you could say that. I am aware of it. There was a terrible accident, wasn't there?Van Zieks: It was you, Mr Drebber, who constructed the vast machine used in the experiment. Or so our investigations indicate. Can you confirm your involvement?Drebber: Yes, I constructed it. In precise accordance with the blueprints. But that's all.Van Zieks: Then the court would be very interested to hear your thoughts about the machine, I'm sure.Drebber: ......... An amazing device, if you ask me. The pinnacle of modern science, making instantaneous kinesis a reality at last.Ryunosuke: What?Judge: Good... Good gracious! Do you mean to say... ...that the experiment was bona fide? Is that your belief, sir?Drebber: Yes, that is very much my belief. Such a waste that it blew up.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: But we've already established the machine was nothing more than a prop for an elaborate conjuring trick!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: You've established nothing of the sort.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: All that was shown during yesterday's proceedings... ...is that the same outcome could have been produced by means of stage trickery. The defence merely proposed a method and demonstrated its feasibility, nothing more.Ryunosuke: But...but...Judge: We've procrastinated long enough, I feel. Witness, you will now give your formal testimony... ...about the machine that you constructed for the purpose of the demonstration at the Great Exhibition.Drebber: ...Understood.Witness Testimony - The Kinesis Machine -Drebber: I met the young professor approximately one year ago, through Mr Asman's introduction. He provided me with the blueprints and I constructed the machine to his precise specifications. It was no trick. If the whole show was a fraud, it would have required a body double. Tell me...did the victim have a twin? All the spectators saw the birdcage appear above their heads and then crash headfirst into the Crystal Tower. A terrible accident, I grant you. Perhaps the science on which the machine was built was flawed somehow?Ryunosuke: A, a body double?!Drebber: That goes without saying, surely? To give the impression that something has moved when in reality it hasn't. It's a basic conjuring principle. The deception cannot be achieved without substituting the original with a fake at some point in the performance. But would I be right in saying...you haven't managed to establish anything along those lines?Ryunosuke: Ugh...Van Zieks: Incidentally... ...the prosecution has already confirmed that Mr Asman had no twin siblings.Judge: Hmmm... It's my understanding that this witness is well-versed in conjuring artfulness. But such talents do not indicate that he was actually able to accomplish what he claims. Namely the construction of what, by all accounts, must have been an extremely complex scientific machine.Drebber: ...Whatever do you mean?Judge: Yesterday's proceedings brought the true nature of your past exploits to light, Mr Drebber.Ryunosuke: Indeed it did, My Lord! As a swindler who preys on innocent scientists to elicit government grant money through conjuring know-how.Drebber: ...Yes, it's true that I possess considerable knowledge of stage magic. But crucially, my scientific knowledge more than matches that of any academic in the field.Van Zieks: Investigation of the witness's workshop attests to that claim, My Lord. As evidence, the police found this Royal Society trophy for young talent in science there.Susato: Yes, that's true. We spotted it there ourselves!Drebber: If a hypothesis is sound, it can always be forged into a physical manifestation...with sufficient skill. Though I may have sold the secrets of some deceptive wiles to snivelling, talentless scientists in the past.Judge: Would, would you therefore assert...that the explosion of the machine was...Drebber: An unfortunate accident. ...Or, of course, a deliberate act of murder carried out by misuse of the science.Judge: Counsel for the Defence...your cross-examination, please!Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord!Cross-Examination - The Kinesis Machine -Drebber: I met the young professor approximately one year ago, through Mr Asman's introduction.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So you were already acquainted with Mr Asman himself? Drebber: Not really. By chance, I'd seen his name mentioned in the papers, that's all. But I had no interest in his private affairs. If he was an unscrupulous investor, it was no concern of mine. As long as people pay their bills, I take up my tools and construct what they ask for. Ryunosuke: So why did Mr Asman approach you in particular, then? Drebber: Who can say? I presume because my name is associated with excellence in engineering. Ryunosuke: ...Not to mention excellence in fraud. Drebber: Hard to gauge. But the point is, all I did was construct the machine according to the blueprints I was given. Van Zieks: In other words, the kinesis machine was built on solid scientific principles. Drebber: Yes, you might say that. Professor Harebrayne certainly has a mind like no other.Drebber: He provided me with the blueprints and I constructed the machine to his precise specifications. It was no trick.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: It's clear that you have both scientific knowledge and knowledge of conjuring magic, however. Drebber: The more knowledge you have, the better equipped you are to handle whatever comes along. But your implication is that I furnished the machine with some trickery, I think. Ryunosuke: It's a possibility that we have to explore. Drebber: Unfortunately though, the machine has been blown to kingdom come. So there's really nothing left to explore...is there? Van Zieks: It appears that the kinesis machine was fitted with a timed explosive device of some kind. Drebber: And there's nothing left of that device either. Not a single shred of evidence remaining...I hear. Ryunosuke: (He must have planned all this from the outset.) Drebber: But in any case, it's abundantly clear that the experiment couldn't have been a trick.Drebber: If the whole show was a fraud, it would have required a body double. Tell me...did the victim have a twin?Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Of course! That's it! Mr Asman was a twin! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: Perhaps my learned friend wasn't listening earlier. ...Mr Asman had no twin siblings. Ryunosuke: No, I heard you before. ...But the thread of hope hadn't quite left me. Susato: The demonstration could have been a trick, if there was somebody who looked sufficiently like the victim. But Dr Sithe absolutely ruled that out as a possibility. Van Zieks: It is beyond question that the victim himself, Mr Asman, did move from the stage to the Crystal Tower. The fingerprints found at the scene attest to the fact. Susato: So it can't have been orchestrated using someone who looked identical to Mr Asman then. Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: What are you thinking, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Oh! No...nothing. Just that the idea of someone who looked identical to the victim is playing on my mind...Drebber: All the spectators saw the birdcage appear above their heads and then crash headfirst into the Crystal Tower.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: It crashed 'headfirst', you say? Drebber: According to the many witness reports from those there at the time, yes. Ryunosuke: Were you not there at the exhibition grounds on the day? Drebber: Hm...unlikely. I rarely leave my workshop. Ryunosuke: Yet another of your unique inventions was found at the scene. Drebber: ......... Well...it was the unveiling of a machine I'd laboured over for many months. I saw it clearly with my own eyes. The birdcage plummeted headfirst into the tower. Ryunosuke: What a surprise... Drebber: I believe the victim's neck was broken from the headlong fall, wasn't it? Ryunosuke: How would you have come by that information? Drebber: Even an infernal recluse like me reads the newspapers, you know. According to the reports, two injuries were apparent on the victim's body. Ryunosuke: Yes, he'd been stabbed in the chest by a screwdriver believed to belong to the defendant... ...and he had broken vertebrae as a result of a fall from a considerable height. Van Zieks: ...Correct. My learned friend has been doing his research, it seems. Ryunosuke: Do we know which injury was the fatal one? Van Zieks: Sadly not. Forensic science is not yet at a level where such things can be determined. Judge: Hm... Van Zieks: What we do know is that the victim died having sustained both injuries at some point during the experiment. And since he was found in the birdcage with his neck broken... Drebber: ...It's obvious that he fell from a considerable height. Ryunosuke: (Hm... I suppose that's hard to deny...)Present Wooden 'Birdcage' (after examining hole in cage or cracked wood) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: We've examined the birdcage that crashed into the Crystal Tower ourselves. As you can see, the cage, which is a wooden construction, has sustained damage in one particular spot. Van Zieks: Following the explosion, it fell some thirty feet into the glass of the Crystal Tower. That level of damage is to be expected, surely. Ryunosuke: I agree. The damage itself is entirely understandable. What doesn't make sense... ...is the location of that damage. Drebber: ...! Ryunosuke: All the breakages in the wood are at the base of the birdcage, not the top! Drebber: What are you saying?! Judge: That's the opposite of where they should be! Ryunosuke: That's right, My Lord. The birdcage that was at the scene is damaged at its base. So we have reports of the birdcage falling headlong into the Crystal Tower, yet the damage is at the bottom. The only way to reconcile these two facts is to accept... ...that there were two birdcages in play that day, which were at some point switched! Switched during what wasn't a scientific experiment at all...but an elaborate piece of stage trickery! Drebber: Gaaaaaaa...gh! Judge: Good gracious! Explain yourself, witness! Drebber: I...well... Van Zieks: If we examine the facts, there's only one logical conclusion we can draw. The damage on the base of the birdcage clearly indicates that it crashed tailfirst into the tower. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But multiple witness reports claim it fell headfirst! Van Zieks: The birdcage materialised in the sky next to a balloon flying over the stage, following a spontaneous explosion. At an altitude of some sixty feet above ground level. Susato: Which is approximately eighteen metres. Van Zieks: It then proceeded to fall some thirty feet into the Crystal Tower in the ensuing deflagration. Witness reports amid such chaos...are notoriously unreliable. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But the victim's neck was broken! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: He plummeted thirty feet inside a heavy, wooden cage. However he fell, it would be unsurprising to find one or two of his vertebrae crushed. Drebber: ......... Kuh kuh kuh kuh kuh... A riveting scientific analysis of events from the prosecution there. Though to be even more rigorous, you would have to say it was only one vertebra, actually. Ryunosuke: ...! (He wasn't quiet for long...) Susato: I find it hard to see what's motivating Lord van Zieks. This witness is clearly a swindler, and one who deceived a personal friend of his. Ryunosuke: ......... 'If you're going to establish this deception, do it right.' Susato: Sorry? Ryunosuke: I feel like that's the undertone here. Drebber: Ah yes, and there's one more point the defence appears to have forgotten. It obviously wasn't a trick...as a certain truth very plainly demonstrates. Ryunosuke: What?! Judge: It seems to me that the cross-examination had better continue until we resolve this matter. Mr Drebber, you will amend your testimony with details of this 'truth'. Drebber: Of course. We must treat the matter scientifically, after all. Ryunosuke: (Agh, I nearly had him there...) Drebber: ......... Changes statement from \"All the spectators saw the birdcage appear above their heads and then crash headfirst into the Crystal Tower.\" to \"The kinesis clearly took place, because there's nowhere else thirty feet high for the birdcage to have fallen from.\"Drebber: The kinesis clearly took place, because there's nowhere else thirty feet high for the birdcage to have fallen from.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What do you mean? Drebber: Well, before the demonstration began, the victim was alive on stage in front of the audience. Ryunosuke: Yes...there are lots of witnesses who saw Mr Asman on the experimentation stage, that's true. Drebber: And the victim's neck broke as a result of an impact following a fall. Logically, therefore, the victim must have fallen from somewhere. Van Zieks: The balloon that exploded was at an altitude of sixty feet. The point of impact on the tower was thirty feet up. That difference of thirty feet is therefore the total distance the birdcage fell. Drebber: And there's no other location from which the cage could have fallen that distance if it didn't drop out of the sky. Ergo... ...the victim himself must have been beamed from the stage into the sky above the Crystal Tower. Judge: Hmmmmmm... A trenchant, scientific analysis. Dear me, every time I hear it explained, it sounds increasingly plausible. Drebber: Oh yes. It's all very well thought out. Susato: Certainly all the spectators on the day saw it. The birdcage plummeting thirty feet through the air, I mean. Ryunosuke: (Irritatingly, yes...)Present Experiment Sketch Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"This is a diagram of the experimentation stage and its surroundings.\"Drebber: A terrible accident, I grant you. Perhaps the science on which the machine was built was flawed somehow?Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So you understood the science, did you? Drebber: Not in the slightest. Ryunosuke: Oh! Right... Drebber: As I've said a number of times, I'm an engineer. My job is to manufacture according to the blueprints I'm given. I would be inviting manifold problems if I foolishly allowed my brain to digest the ideas behind them. I could be accused of stealing those ideas, for example. Ryunosuke: But how is it possible to construct a machine without really understanding the principles it relies on? Drebber: Well, you're practising law without really understanding the principles it relies on, aren't you? Ryunosuke: ......... A very good point. Susato: Stand up for yourself, Mr Naruhodo! Van Zieks: The point is, the experiment resulted in instantaneous kinesis taking place. As such, the science must be sound. Drebber: Yes. And really, experimental results are all that matters when it comes to proving a hypothesis.Ryunosuke: (He's certainly very sure of himself...)Susato: What do you think, Mr Naruhodo?Ryunosuke: Well, now that the machine has been completely destroyed by yesterday's explosion... ...it's going to be impossible to argue its authenticity one way or the other.Susato: But if we're unable to establish that it was a piece of stage trickery rather than genuine science... ...we will have no grounds on which to demonstrate Professor Harebrayne's innocence.Ryunosuke: Both Mr Asman and this man in the stand tricked the professor and used him. They took advantage of his naivety and his unbending belief in his work...and I won't let them get away with it! (And seeing as the professor is an old friend of Lord van Zieks... ...what on earth must he be feeling towards Drebber?)Ryunosuke: This is a diagram of the experimentation stage and its surroundings.Drebber: .........Ryunosuke: We know that somehow, the birdcage appeared in mid-air before falling down into the Crystal Tower. A fall of about thirty feet...or nine metres. However, if you examine the diagram carefully... ...you'll see that there is one other possible location from which the birdcage could have fallen... ...the same distance of thirty feet.Van Zieks: No!Drebber: .........Judge: Well, it appears the defence has a possible explanation to put forward. Go ahead, Counsel.Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord. Of course.Judge: You will indicate the place to which you are referring on this same diagram. The alternative location from which the birdcage could possibly have fallen the requisite thirty feet!Present experimentation stage Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The place I'm referring to...is here!\"Present anywhere else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: If it had fallen from here, the birdcage would have plummeted the same thirty-foot distance! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: If that's my learned friend's claim, I suggest he demonstrates for the court...personally. Ryunosuke: Huh? Judge: And you may consider this a parting gift, Counsel. Ryunosuke: (Ugh... I feel like I've just hit the deck from thirty feet up anyway now...) Judge: Don't give me recourse to make the next fall from sixty feet up, hm? Leads back to: \"You will indicate the place to which you are referring on this same diagram.\"Ryunosuke: The place I'm referring to...is here!Judge: But that's... ...where the birdcage would have been to begin with!Ryunosuke: Which is exactly the point, My Lord. Yes, the birdcage was in the machine on the stage. But what we must also consider, is the height of the stage itself.Judge: Go on, Counsel.Ryunosuke: It turns out that the experimentation stage was built at a considerable height above ground level. If you look at the diagram, in fact... ...you'll see it's at about the same height above the ground as the balloon was above the crash site.Van Zieks: ...!Ryunosuke: When the experiment got underway, the machine and the birdcage were engulfed in steam. At that moment, the floor of the stage gave way and, if we assume there to be a void underneath... ...this birdcage and the one seen by the audience would have fallen almost exactly the same distance! Once again, My Lord... ...this all points to the fact that there was not one birdcage, but two!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: My learned friend...has no evidence that the stage had such a contrivance in its design!Ryunosuke: Someone is responsible for the criminal destruction of the kinesis machine itself, it's true. However, the stage still stands. And take a moment to look at the photographic print of the scene following yesterday's explosion.Judge: Good Lord! The metal grille that formed the floor of the machine is undone!Ryunosuke: Yes, most likely blown open by the force of the explosion that destroyed the rest of the machine. The defence calls for the space below the stage to be investigated...immediately! Mr Drebber!Drebber: ...!Ryunosuke: It was you who built the kinesis machine. Which means that it was you who built the two birdcages that were used to carry out this deception.Drebber: Uh...ughhh...Ryunosuke: Whether Professor Harebrayne's hypothesis is sound or not makes no difference. Because it's the construction of this machine that matters. A machine designed to take Mr Asman's life... ...and lay the blame firmly at the professor's door. Something that could only have been carried out... ...by you, Mr Enoch Drebber!Drebber: Grrr... UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: If my learned friend has reached the end of his wild assertions... ...the prosecution would like to crush the defence's argument slowly...but surely.Ryunosuke: Wha...?Van Zieks: Your argument fails to hold water... ...on two counts.Ryunosuke: Two?!Van Zieks: Firstly... ...before and after the experiment, this witness went nowhere near the kinesis machine. Every relevant member of staff from the exhibition has attested to that.Judge: And I believe members of Scotland Yard have also been on watch duty at every public experiment.Van Zieks: In other words, Mr Drebber had no opportunity to switch the alleged pair of birdcages.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: But I've already explained why he wouldn't have needed to!Van Zieks: The nonsense with the crossbow? That doesn't bolster your case at all. The man who disappeared from the stage and the man who crashed into the tower are one and the same. The Forensic Investigation Team's report is unequivocal on that point!Ryunosuke: Agh!Van Zieks: And the second flaw in your assertion... ...is a distinct lack of motive. Why would this man have wanted to take the victim's life? He had no reason to do so.Ryunosuke: A...a motive...? (Do I have to think of everything myself?)Van Zieks: I have here a contract provided by the witness.Judge: What contract is this, Lord van Zieks?Van Zieks: The contract into which Mr Drebber entered with the victim, Mr Asman. It reads: 'Mr Drebber is to receive thirty percent of all remunerations from government grants or other income.'Judge: Thirty percent? Certainly very favourable contractual conditions.Drebber: But there was one very important provision bolted onto that clause.Ryunosuke: What provision?Van Zieks: 'Mr Drebber may only uphold this right on condition that both contracting parties are alive.'Drebber: In other words, if either of us were to die, the contract would become null and void. So you see, I had nothing to gain from Mr Asman's death. The diametric opposite, in fact.Ryunosuke: Ugh...Van Zieks: Need I say more? The witness had neither an opportunity nor a reason to commit the alleged crime. In short, the possibility of Mr Drebber having done as you suggest...is nil.Ryunosuke: Ugh... UWAAAAAAAAAH!Judge: Hm... It seems the defence's assertion was somewhat wide of the mark. Lord van Zieks...you will submit the contract as evidence, please.Drebber's contract has been entered into the Court Record.Ryunosuke: (It's true... If Drebber had no opportunity to switch the birdcage under the stage with the one in the Crystal Tower... ...he couldn't have done it. And in any case, I have no idea what his motive might have been!)Susato: There is one aspect of your argument... ...that still holds true, however.Ryunosuke: ...!Susato: There were two birdcages. The prosecution is unable to deny that.Ryunosuke: Ah...Susato: So I'm sure you're on the right lines, Mr Naruhodo. And I've no doubt there are other aspects of your assertion that are undeniable truths, too!Ryunosuke: ...!Judge: Well, it would seem... ...that the defence has no rejoinder to offer.Drebber: ......... Kuh kuh kuh... Well, I must say I'm a little surprised. I came here to testify about the machine I built, and instead my reputation is defiled. But the prosecution's counter has set the record straight, I think. It's impossible that I'm the culprit.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: At the beginning of this trial, we believed that there was only one birdcage. Yet now we know there must have been two. In other words, there was more to the demonstration than we realised at first.Drebber: .........Ryunosuke: I think it's abundantly clear that the same applies to the culprit.Van Zieks: Get to the point.Ryunosuke: The stage demonstration... ...was constructed and set up in its entirety by you, Mr Drebber. Therefore it's inconceivable that you had no hand in the events that transpired.Drebber: .........Ryunosuke: So if circumstances mean it's impossible that you could have carried out the crime yourself... ...it points to the fact that someone else was involved.Judge: Someone else? Counsel, are you suggesting...?Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord! Mr Drebber had an accomplice!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: An accomplice now? Well then, I presume... ...you're prepared for what's to come? Now that you're accusing not only this witness, but someone else...of the most serious of crimes.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: If these accusations turn out to be false... ...then make no mistake: The prosecution will demand an equally serious punishment for your slander!Ryunosuke: .........Judge: Well, Counsel? Do you intend to pursue this course, and formally accuse another party of involvement in this matter?Ryunosuke: ......... (What do I do here? At the moment, this is little more than a hunch on my part. I don't know for sure if Drebber had an accomplice, or even if he really is the culprit here...)Drebber: .........Ryunosuke: (One way or another, though, I have to make my position clear. ...As a lawyer. So what's my stance going to be? Did Drebber have an accomplice...or not?)Name the accomplice Leads to: \"The defence is ready to name Mr Drebber's accomplice!\"Back down Ryunosuke: (Let's face it, I have no idea who is accomplice might actually have been. Which isn't the strongest position to be in, is it, Ryunosuke?) Susato: Mr Naruhodo, think of the sword at your side. Karuma is crying out. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Susato: Crying out for you to show the strength of your conviction now as a lawyer. Ryunosuke: ...Yes, you're right. This sword that I inherited, which embodies the will of my best friend... ...is my own accomplice! Susato: I'm not sure that's quite the right word, but...that's the spirit, certainly! Leads to: \"The defence is ready to name Mr Drebber's accomplice!\"Ryunosuke: The defence is ready to name Mr Drebber's accomplice! (Somehow the two birdcages must have been switched. Everything points to that. Yet according to the coroner's report, that's not a possibility. But that inconsistency itself is a clue!)Judge: Counsel...Ryunosuke: Hm? ...My Lord?!Judge: You have received a stark warning already. If you are nevertheless determined... ...then I must now ask you to identify this alleged accomplice by name. So...your answer, please. Who do you claim to have been Mr Drebber's accomplice?Present Courtney Sithe profile Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The name of the person in question is...\"Present anyone else Ryunosuke: Judge: ......... Who is this person? Ryunosuke: Someone intimately related to the crime, My Lord...and someone you surely wouldn't say you don't know! Judge: Yes, thank you, I am aware of the person, obviously. But on what basis do you claim felonious involvement? Ryunosuke: ......... Van Zieks: You surely wouldn't say you don't know...would you? Ryunosuke: Uwaaaaaagh! Susato: I'm sure you simply slipped and pointed to the wrong person, didn't you? There's no other explanation! Judge: No 'slip-ups' this time, please, Counsel. Leads back to: \"Who do you claim to have been Mr Drebber's accomplice?\"Ryunosuke: The name of the person in question is...Van Zieks: What's wrong, my Nipponese friend? Surely fear doesn't bind your tongue now. It's a little late for that.Ryunosuke: (Of course I'm afraid. After all, naming her in this capacity is definitely going to make waves. ...A lot of waves. I could very well turn every single person in this courtroom against me.)Susato: I'm sure it will be alright, Mr Naruhodo.Ryunosuke: ...Thank you, Miss Susato.Susato: The enemy always appears larger than life. But you'll appear exactly the same to the enemy!Ryunosuke: ...Alright then, here goes...Van Zieks: You've kept us waiting long enough. Your answer, Counsel...now.Ryunosuke: The person who colluded with Mr Drebber in order to carry out this wicked crime... ...is Scotland Yard's coroner, Dr Courtney Sithe!Judge: What, what the blazes are you talking about? Dr Sithe?Van Zieks: The head of the Forensic Investigation Team, and the coroner who conducted the autopsy on the victim?!Ryunosuke: We know there were two birdcages. So who could have carried out the switch to complete the illusion? The 'accident' happened in front of a huge crowd of spectators, and the area was immediately sealed off. Then everyone, police officers included, were banished to make way for the Forensic Investigation Team. When else could the switch have occurred? It can only have been in that team's presence.Drebber: .........Ryunosuke: It's essential that the court determines exactly what happened following the incident. The defence demands that Dr Sithe be summoned to the witness stand at once to testify!Juror No. 6: You've got a nerve, lad! Standing up there, dragging the Yard's name through the mud!Ryunosuke: I, I didn't mean to...Juror No. 6: I know the woman veeery well. There's no better dead room worker out there! How dare you call her a criminal?!Van Zieks: My learned friend's imagination appears to be wilder than the East End at night.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: But the recklessness of your accusation aside, there's another grave problem with your argument. One which the prosecution demands you address at once.Ryunosuke: A grave problem?Susato: Oh my word...Van Zieks: Who do you claim acted as the victim's doppelgänger?Ryunosuke: W-What?Judge: Hmmm... Certainly, if the 'birdcage' containing the body of the victim was exchanged for another... ...that cage must also have contained a body.Van Zieks: And yet... ...no missing persons or accidental deaths of anyone even remotely resembling the victim have been reported. Which means there was no one, dead or alive, who could have fulfilled the role of a body double for Mr Asman.Ryunosuke: Ugh... (That's true! If my argument is that there were two birdcages, then there must also have been one person inside each! But I don't know if I've got an answer to this yet, have I? What can I do to reveal how this body double stunt was achieved?)Name someone Ryunosuke: Very well. The defence will address my learned friend's concerns... ...by revealing the identity of the person who acted as Mr Asman's body double! Van Zieks: Be my guest. Give us a name. Ryunosuke: (The body double and the birdcage were hiding inside the balloon that was floating above the stage. Which means that any witnesses would only have seen them from sixty feet away. ...So who was it that appeared out of that explosion some eighteen metres above the spectators...?) ......... Aha! In place of Mr Asman in the second birdcage was... Present anyone Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: This person is the most likely candidate I can think of... wouldn't you agree? Judge: ...I would not. Van Zieks: Would anyone? Susato: I'm sorry, Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: Even you're turning your back on me, Miss Susato? I must be really wide of the mark! Van Zieks: ...You have a head. Try using it. Judge: I must ask you to reconsider your answer, Counsel. Leads back to: \"But I don't know if I've got an answer to this yet, have I?\"Present evidence Ryunosuke: Very well. The defence will address my learned friend's concerns... ...by presenting evidence that reveals the true nature of Mr Asman's body double! Judge: Good gracious! Evidence? I do hope this isn't filibustering, Counsel. The court is expecting a name. Van Zieks: If you think you have relevant evidence, present it now. Ryunosuke: (The body double and the birdcage were hiding inside the balloon that was floating above the stage. Which means that any witnesses would only have seen them from sixty feet away. ...So who was it that appeared out of that explosion some eighteen metres above the spectators...?) ......... Aha! The body double inside the second birdcage was... Present Waxwork Head Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"We know that the victim, Mr Asman, was in the birdcage that was situated inside the kinesis machine on stage.\" Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Well...probably something along these lines, I think... Van Zieks: Van Zieks: Then let's see what happens to that piece of evidence when dropped from a great height... ...whilst within your grasp, of course. Susato: He's suggesting you and the evidence die together, Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: ...Yes, that came across. (It's hard to see how another person could have been inside the second birdcage. Which means the body double must have been something else...) Judge: I shall have to ask you to reconsider your answer, Counsel. Leads back to: \"But I don't know if I've got an answer to this yet, have I?\"Nothing at the moment Ryunosuke: I can't explain that at the moment. Van Zieks: Oh really. And when can the court expect an explanation? Ryunosuke: ......... Maybe tomorrow? Van Zieks: Then you can take your leave of us until then. Susato: People who procrastinate lose everything in the end, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: ...Isn't that slightly over-the-top? Susato: We can discuss that later. But for now, you ought to consider what you can do, not what you can't. Ryunosuke: Alright, yes. I'll think again... Leads back to: \"What can I do to reveal how this body double stunt was achieved?\"Ryunosuke: We know that the victim, Mr Asman, was in the birdcage that was situated inside the kinesis machine on stage. And therefore he couldn't have been inside the second birdcage. Instead, that contained something else... What's been described as a 'body double', which is what fell from the sky and crashed into the Crystal Tower.Judge: Yes, Counsel, according to your somewhat elaborate version of events.Ryunosuke: And that 'body double' inside the second birdcage was in fact... .........Susato: It's alright, Mr Naruhodo. You're ready for this. Just steel yourself...and come out with it!Ryunosuke: ...Thank you, Miss Susato! I needed that. As I was saying...the 'body double' inside the second birdcage was... ...as unbelievable as it may seem...that thing there!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: ......... Open your eyes and look into mine, my Nipponese friend. Now tell me......what are you playing at?Ryunosuke: (Stand firm now, Ryunosuke! This is the time to show your Japanese spirit!) As the court will observe...this is a waxwork model. A model, in fact, of an infamous London murderer from ten years ago: the Professor!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: You started by indicting the leader of the Forensic Investigation Team as an accomplice in this crime. And now you've moved on to indicting waxworks?Ryunosuke: ...Yes! That's about the size of it.Van Zieks: But why? And why THIS waxwork? It looks nothing like the victim. In fact, it could hardly resemble him less! What possible justification can you give?Ryunosuke: If you want to know why... ...ask Mr Drebber.Drebber: ...!Van Zieks: What?Ryunosuke: Just days before Professor Harebrayne performed his public demonstration... ...Mr Drebber abducted this model from Madame Tusspells.Judge: Did, did you say...abducted?!Ryunosuke: And two days after the incident at the Great Exhibition... ...he returned it to the museum.Van Zieks: Then the timing...Judge: Is this true, Mr Drebber?Drebber: Ugh... Urmm...Ryunosuke: At first, I couldn't see why Mr Drebber would have stolen the waxwork and then given it back again. But now, the reason is clear. He took it so that he could put it inside the second birdcage...as a body double for Mr Asman!Drebber: Guh...............!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: Are you hearing this, ladies and gentlemen of the jury? Are you hearing the defence's astonishing proposal?Juror No. 1: ...!Juror No. 2: ...!Van Zieks: That the witness fabricated this vast machine with the intention of deceiving some wretched scientist. That he did so in collusion with the country's finest coroner, on a public stage in front of a vast audience.Juror No. 3: ...!Juror No. 4: ...!Van Zieks: And that, to effect the deception, he used a waxwork model that in no way resembles the victim. Are we really to believe this far-fetched tale? What do you decide?Juror No. 5: ...!Juror No. 6: ...!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: Wait! Yes, if you put it like that, of course it sounds implausible!???:My Lord!Juror No. 1: I need to speak, if you please.Judge: Go ahead, Mr Foreman.Juror No. 1: Myself and my colleagues have reached an agreement.Judge: Very good. In that case... ...ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you will state your leanings for the court to hear now!Juror No. 1: Guilty!Juror No. 2: Guilty!Juror No. 3: Guilty!Juror No. 4: Guilty!Juror No. 5: Guilty!Juror No. 6: Guilty!Judge: So, as indicated by the foreman, the jury has reached a consensus.Ryunosuke: (I knew that was going to happen.)Susato: We shall get through this, Mr Naruhodo, as we always do. And uncover some new truths along the way, I'm quite sure.Ryunosuke: Yes, I agree. I'm going to have to appeal to the jurors as usual, and see if I can persuade them to change their minds!Judge: The defence will now embark on a summation examination. Are you and your fellows ready to proceed, Mr Foreman?Juror No. 1: We are, My Lord.Judge: Very well. In that case, I ask you now to state clearly for all present to hear... ...the grounds on which each of you has decided that the defendant is guilty of the crime of which he is charged.Judicial Findings - The Jurors' Contentions -Juror No. 6: I've known that woman for years! She'd never be an accomplice to anything!Juror No. 1: It's utter nonsense to think those two would ever be conniving with one another.Juror No. 2: Oh dear, this is most troubling... But surely the waxwork the man stole is nothing to do with the coroner, is it?Juror No. 3: I have had my own problems with members of the police. I do not trust them much...Juror No. 4: I've seen no rigorous proof that this waxwork was ever inside the birdcage. It's conjecture!Juror No. 5: Accusin' someone without right evidences? Ee's not a proper job, is ee? I won't 'ave it!Judge: Somewhat unsurprisingly... ...it seems the introduction of this waxwork model to the proceedings has polarised opinion.Van Zieks: Given that its face is obscured and its build in no way resembles that of the victim... ...I can only applaud my learned friend's temerity at suggesting it as Mr Asman's body double.Ryunosuke: (Yes, the applause is deafening. ...And yes, I know it seems extraordinary. But that's the point. That's why I have a strong feeling it's actually a greater clue than anyone yet realises...)Susato: What are you thinking, Mr Naruhodo?Ryunosuke: I can't explain why at the moment... ...but I feel as though there's a specific reason why it was used. Why it had to be this model.Susato: Really? A reason why nothing else would do, you mean?Ryunosuke: Yes. And I'm convinced... ...it's something far more significant than whether or not the model looked like the victim.Susato: Well...if that's the case... ...we must prevent the trial from ending prematurely at all costs!Ryunosuke: Yes, agreed. (I have to find a way out of this...!)Judge: If you are ready, Counsel, you may proceed with the summation examination.Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord!Jury Examination - The Defence's Rebuttal -Juror No. 6: I've known that woman for years! She'd never be an accomplice to anything!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Um...the order of things seems to have changed around here for some reason... Juror No. 6: I'm a copper, lad. It's a copper's discretion to bend the rules sometimes, when needs must. What's wrong with that?! Ryunosuke: (...Where do I start?) Juror No. 6: I've been working at the Yard for forty odd years! Ryunosuke: That's...even more than I thought. Juror No. 6: We've only had a metropolitan police service in town for seventy years, you know. 'Course, times have changed. The public didn't trust coppers back when I started. It was rough. We had to fight crime, and we had to fight to win the public's trust as well. And win we did. Forensic science was in its infancy too, even more than it is now. And she spearheaded the revolution! Ryunosuke: Dr Sithe, you mean? Juror No. 6: That's right. About ten years ago now, it was. When I was still a youngish bobby on the beat. That's when she started making a name for herself as a top-class coroner. And now look at her! Head of the Forensic Investigation Team. And a woman, no less. Well you won't hear me complain! It's what we all dreamt of back then, I tell you! Ryunosuke: ...Could you tell me without holding that gun in the air?! Juror No. 6: We were all out to uphold justice, lad! Full of vim, we were. Full of vim. Ryunosuke: ...That's coming across loud and clear.Juror No. 6: She was Courtney Stevens back when I knew her, of course. A legendary coroner, even then.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: She was legendary, was she? Juror No. 6: What did you say?! Ryunosuke: Agh! Juror No. 6: That woman is still the best coroner in the land! Head of the Forensics Investigation Team! Ryunosuke: Um...'legendary' was your description, sir, not mine. Juror No. 6: Rubbish! That word never passed my lips! I'd never describe anybody that way! Ever! Not if they were still in the game! Ryunosuke: ......... ...I think the point you're trying to make is that Dr Sithe is an extremely talented coroner. Would that be fair? Juror No. 6: It would! If it weren't for the fact that you're trying to drag that legendary woman's reputation through the mud! Ryunosuke: (I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that 'legendary'.)Pit against Juror No. 2's statement Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: Good gracious! To whose statements do you refer, Counsel? Ryunosuke: So...juror number two. Juror No. 2: Oh gosh! Me? W-What can I do for you? Ryunosuke: I presume that you heard what juror number six said in his statement? It's brought to light the maiden name of the coroner, Dr Sithe. Which in turn has revealed a connection that wasn't apparent before. Juror No. 2: Well naturally, as a woman of society, I find such connections and relationships irresistible. But oh golly... I'm afraid I fail to see what you mean. Ryunosuke: Dr Sithe's maiden name is Stevens. And through that name, the coroner is very definitely linked to the waxwork of the killer. The defence has evidence to prove it. Juror No. 2: My goodness! Evidence, you say? How, how utterly enthralling! Judge: Counsel, the court cannot overlook that last remark. I very much hope there is substance to your claim. Ryunosuke: Of course, My Lord. I would ask the court to look at this: The evidence that clearly links Dr Sithe to the mass murderer known as the Professor! Present Killer's Autopsy Report Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: I have here a certain autopsy report from ten years ago. Judge: A ten-year-old autopsy report? What relevance does that have? Ryunosuke: It is of course from the autopsy of the person portrayed in the waxwork: the killer known as the Professor. Van Zieks: ...! Judge: The Professor's...? But the man was a capital offender, so... Ryunosuke: That's right. This is the certification of death that was drawn up after the convict's execution. The identity of the killer was never made public, so the report gives few details. But what's important is the name of the coroner who wrote it: Courtney Stevens. Juror No. 2: Oh my! Courtney Stevens?! Juror No. 6: Strike a light! Ryunosuke: It appears that the Professor's autopsy was conducted by Dr Sithe ten years ago. And a few days ago, Mr Drebber very deliberately stole the waxwork of the Professor from Madame Tusspells. A waxwork that doesn't in fact resemble the victim, Mr Asman, at all. Juror No. 2: And do you suppose...there's some unsavoury relationship between those events? Ryunosuke: Absolutely! I'm sure of it! There's no doubt in my mind that the Professor case... ...is at the heart of a link that we have yet to uncover... ...between Dr Courtney Sithe and Mr Enoch Drebber! Juror No. 2: ......... Hidden links...mysterious connections...secret relationships... This is all most extraordinary. We're surely obliged now to explore this further. Juror No. 6: Quite right. We can't let this trial come to an end now. Not while there's this cloud of suspicion hanging over the Yard's best coroner. It wasn't like this in my day! But we're still here to uphold justice in the end! Changes Juror No. 6's statement to \"If a Yard coroner's under suspicion, then we're not done here yet, are we? Clearly!\" Changes Juror No. 2's statement to \"It's the Professor! That's what links that frightful swindler and the coroner!\" Present anything else Ryunosuke: Juror No. 2: Are you quite alright, sir? All colour has drained from your cheeks. You look just like a waxwork yourself. Ryunosuke: I think...my lack of colour must reflect my lack of confidence... Juror No. 6: Hmph. Wait till you hit my age, lad. You won't have any colour left to drain. Judge: I said before that the court could not overlook your claim of evidence. But it seems to me that overlooking it would have been the more preferable choice by some margin. Ryunosuke: (Ugh. I was sure I had something...) Juror No. 2: Oh gosh! There's, there's wax dripping from your brow! You're melting! Ryunosuke: Just a cold sweat. Nothing new. Judge: Let us return to the jurors' statements and put this debacle behind us. Leads back to summation examinationJuror No. 6: If a Yard coroner's under suspicion, then we're not done here yet, are we? Clearly!Juror No. 1: It's utter nonsense to think those two would ever be conniving with one another.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But we're only just starting to understand this case! Juror No. 1: ......... Ryunosuke: W-What are you reading there, sir?! Juror No. 1: The man behind those murders on Solar Pons Street was caught in two days flat. That's real policing for you. Ryunosuke: That's...really not relevant to this case, is it? Juror No. 1: You're wrong there. Because it was Dr Sithe in charge of examining the bodies. And it was evidence arising from her work that led to the arrest of the scoundrel responsible. Ryunosuke: Oh... Juror No. 1: That's right, 'Oh.' That woman is at the forefront of this country's fight against crime. The idea that she's somehow involved in this murky business is a load of old tosh. Ryunosuke: (I thought it was up to me to 'press' the jurors, not the other way around...)Juror No. 2: Oh dear, this is most troubling... But surely the waxwork the man stole is nothing to do with the coroner, is it?Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Why would you assume that? Juror No. 2: Well, quite simply because...that unsettling swindler has no relationship with the woman, does he? Ryunosuke: True. As it stands, we don't know of any connection. Juror No. 2: Oh gosh, but it would be delightfully romantic if they were somehow to have a mutual interest in the waxwork. Ryunosuke: Romantic? Juror No. 2: A woman of society such as myself views everything in terms of relationships, you know. Ryunosuke: Well, you learn something new every day! (Even if you don't want to.) Juror No. 2: One might wonder about a possible relationship between the defendant and this coroner woman. Or perhaps between the defendant and the handsome prosecutor just there. Ryunosuke: (This woman...may be more astute than I've been giving her credit for.) Susato: If that's the woman's stance... ...then perhaps demonstrating some connection between the waxwork and Dr Sithe would be enough... Ryunosuke: Yes, I agree. As soon as we have even a whiff of a connection, she'll be the first to know!Pit against Juror No. 6's statement (after Juror No. 6 changes his statement) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: Good gracious! To whose statements do you refer, Counsel? Ryunosuke: So...juror number two. Juror No. 2: Oh gosh! Me? W-What can I do for you? Ryunosuke: I presume that you heard what juror number six said in his statement? It's brought to light the maiden name of the coroner, Dr Sithe. Which in turn has revealed a connection that wasn't apparent before. Juror No. 2: Well naturally, as a woman of society, I find such connections and relationships irresistible. But oh golly... I'm afraid I fail to see what you mean. Ryunosuke: Dr Sithe's maiden name is Stevens. And through that name, the coroner is very definitely linked to the waxwork of the killer. The defence has evidence to prove it. Juror No. 2: My goodness! Evidence, you say? How, how utterly enthralling! Judge: Counsel, the court cannot overlook that last remark. I very much hope there is substance to your claim. Ryunosuke: Of course, My Lord. I would ask the court to look at this: The evidence that clearly links Dr Sithe to the mass murderer known as the Professor! Present Killer's Autopsy Report Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: I have here a certain autopsy report from ten years ago. Judge: A ten-year-old autopsy report? What relevance does that have? Ryunosuke: It is of course from the autopsy of the person portrayed in the waxwork: the killer known as the Professor. Van Zieks: ...! Judge: The Professor's...? But the man was a capital offender, so... Ryunosuke: That's right. This is the certification of death that was drawn up after the convict's execution. The identity of the killer was never made public, so the report gives few details. But what's important is the name of the coroner who wrote it: Courtney Stevens. Juror No. 2: Oh my! Courtney Stevens?! Juror No. 6: Strike a light! Ryunosuke: It appears that the Professor's autopsy was conducted by Dr Sithe ten years ago. And a few days ago, Mr Drebber very deliberately stole the waxwork of the Professor from Madame Tusspells. A waxwork that doesn't in fact resemble the victim, Mr Asman, at all. Juror No. 2: And do you suppose...there's some unsavoury relationship between those events? Ryunosuke: Absolutely! I'm sure of it! There's no doubt in my mind that the Professor case... ...is at the heart of a link that we have yet to uncover... ...between Dr Courtney Sithe and Mr Enoch Drebber! Juror No. 2: ......... Hidden links...mysterious connections...secret relationships... This is all most extraordinary. We're surely obliged now to explore this further. Juror No. 6: Quite right. We can't let this trial come to an end now. Not while there's this cloud of suspicion hanging over the Yard's best coroner. It wasn't like this in my day! But we're still here to uphold justice in the end! Changes Juror No. 6's statement to \"If a Yard coroner's under suspicion, then we're not done here yet, are we? Clearly!\" Changes Juror No. 2's statement to \"It's the Professor! That's what links that frightful swindler and the coroner!\" Present anything else Ryunosuke: Juror No. 2: Are you quite alright, sir? All colour has drained from your cheeks. You look just like a waxwork yourself. Ryunosuke: I think...my lack of colour must reflect my lack of confidence... Juror No. 6: Hmph. Wait till you hit my age, lad. You won't have any colour left to drain. Judge: I said before that the court could not overlook your claim of evidence. But it seems to me that overlooking it would have been the more preferable choice by some margin. Ryunosuke: (Ugh. I was sure I had something...) Juror No. 2: Oh gosh! There's, there's wax dripping from your brow! You're melting! Ryunosuke: Just a cold sweat. Nothing new. Judge: Let us return to the jurors' statements and put this debacle behind us. Leads back to summation examinationJuror No. 2: It's the Professor! That's what links that frightful swindler and the coroner!Juror No. 3: I have had my own problems with members of the police. I do not trust them much...Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What sort of problems? Juror No. 3: Let's just say we have run into each other on numerous occasions while I've been performing on the street. Ryunosuke: Right, I see. Juror No. 3: Obviously artists such as myself cannot appear on stage as we work in close proximity to our audiences. So we perform our great magic in parks...on street corners...and the like. But the police use any excuse to make our lives difficult. Sometimes they even cook up a story to extort monies from the poor. Pursue Juror No. 6 (before Juror No. 6 changes his statement) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Do you have something to say in response to that... Mr Ottermole?! Juror No. 6: Who are you calling a mass murderer?! Ryunosuke: Ah! Sorry, my mistake! I, I got confused because I heard you look like him... Juror No. 6: I don't look anything like the man! You wanna be locked up, sonny? Ryunosuke: (Thanks, Mr Sholmes...) Perhaps we could move on... I was really wondering if you had something you wanted to add in response to what juror number three just said. And clearly you do. Juror No. 6: ......... Back in my day... Back in the good old days... ...it wasn't like this! Ryunosuke: What was it like, sir? Juror No. 6: We worked our fingers to the bone to earn the public's trust, we did! And by Jove we earnt it! People respected us back then! Juror No. 3: Respected you? Hmph. Juror No. 6: No one would've called a coroner into question in them days! A coroner's report was the hallmark of an investigation done right! Especially when Dr Courtney Stevens put her name to it! She was the best of the best! And the apple of the force's eye! Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: H-Hold on a minute! What are you talking about? Who's Courtney Stevens? Juror No. 6: Ah... Sorry. Got a bit carried away there. Van Zieks: Stevens is Dr Sithe's maiden name. Ryunosuke: Her maiden name... (So that was before she was married...) Juror No. 6: O' course, yes. Silly me. It's Sithe now, isn't it? Ryunosuke: (Stevens... I'm sure I've seen that name somewhere recently...) Juror No. 6: Anyway! The point is, those were the great days of policing! Not like now... Ryunosuke: Sorry to interrupt, sir... ...but do you think you could change your statement to include that name? Juror No. 6: Well, yes...I don't see why not. Changes Juror No. 6's statement to \"She was Courtney Stevens back when I knew her, of course. A legendary coroner, even then.\" Ryunosuke: Well, that's definitely not right. Juror No. 3: Yes, and it is why I say that if you trust the police, you will have trouble. But here you are, claiming this waxwork model was stolen to star in an illusionary spectacular. The idea is so wild, I think I will take my chances and believe the authorities on this occasion. Ryunosuke: (This is how the public at large view Scotland Yard, is it?) Susato: Our own police force in Tokyo is not even twenty years old yet, is it? Perhaps we should view what's happened here in London as a measure of what may happen at home. Ryunosuke: Yes... Like a Scotland Yardstick. (I wonder how a policeman would feel listening to the way this juror speaks about the force... I'm sure he'd have a word or two to say in response.)Juror No. 4: I've seen no rigorous proof that this waxwork was ever inside the birdcage. It's conjecture!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But you claimed the whole instantaneous kinesis demonstration was a trick! Juror No. 4: That I did. But there's more than one way to pull a rabbit out of a hat, isn't there? Ryunosuke: Sorry? Juror No. 4: I grant you, given that this cage appeared from amidst an explosion, there'd have been no need to use a real person. But if a waxwork had been used, the culprit could at least have had the decency to make it look like the victim. Ryunosuke: I'm not sure exactly how much criminals are governed by decency... Juror No. 4: The point is, if you're going to make a claim about that waxwork being inside the birdcage... ...you need to give us some evidence. Without that, it's just not science! Susato: I suppose we should expect nothing less than a logical argument from a fellow of the Royal Society. But that perhaps means his mind could be changed if we managed to present suitable evidence... Ryunosuke: (Evidence that the Professor waxwork was inside that birdcage. Hm... Can I produce that or not?) I have evidence Ryunosuke: ...Actually, I have something I'd like you to see, sir. Juror No. 4: Oh? I must warn you that I firmly believe it's only wise to trust men in white coats. So given your jet-black outfit, I don't mind admitting to a sense of trepidation here. Ryunosuke: (So you don't trust anyone in black? Looking in the mirror must be very trying...) I do have some evidence that proves the waxwork was inside that birdcage. Namely... Present Piece of Broken Glass Ryunosuke: Juror No. 4: What's that? A piece of glass? Though it's unusually thick for glass... Ryunosuke: Yes, it's a piece of broken glass that we found inside the jacket on the waxwork. As you say, it's not ordinary glass, though. It's very thick, and clearly made for extra strength. Much like the special glass that was developed for the construction of the Crystal Tower. Juror No. 4: The Crystal To- Holy smoke! Ryunosuke: Exactly! The centrepiece of the Great Exhibition, where the very incident we're talking about took place! On the day in question, the birdcage fell from above and smashed through a window of that special glass. Juror No. 4: From whence this small piece originated...is that it? Ryunosuke: Precisely. So, what do you say... ...now that clear evidence in support of the assertion has been placed before you?! Juror No. 4: ......... Well, as I said, I only trust men in white coats as a rule. However... ...when the reasoning is sound, it's fair to say colour shouldn't come into it. In light of what you've shown me here, yes, I feel obliged to change my position on the matter. Judge: In that case, juror number four, you will amend your statement now, please. Changes Juror No. 4's statement to \"The presence of that piece of glass leaves me in little doubt that the waxwork was indeed inside that birdcage.\" Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Let me start by showing you...this! Juror No. 4: ......... It's an unimpressive opening, if I'm honest. Ryunosuke: Ah, well, um... What comes next is the real point! Judge: It's already apparent that what comes next is equally disappointing, Counsel. Ryunosuke: Ugh... (How about after that...?) Susato: If the waxwork of the Professor was inside the second birdcage... ...I would assume that means it must have crashed into the Crystal Tower. Ryunosuke: Yes, that's right. I'd managed to think it through to that point myself. Susato: Well, it's really only a tiny leap from there, I would think! Leads back to: \"Evidence that the Professor waxwork was inside that birdcage.\" I have nothing Ryunosuke: Well, I can state quite categorically, sir, that we have no such evidence at the present time! Juror No. 4: That much was abundantly clear before that brassy proclamation, I assure you! And why you can count on the fact that I shan't be changing my leaning! Susato: Oh dear... That proclamation was even brassier than yours, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: (If only we had some evidence, things might be different, though...) Leads back to summation examinationJuror No. 4: The presence of that piece of glass leaves me in little doubt that the waxwork was indeed inside that birdcage.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Thank you for reconsidering your position, sir. Juror No. 4: Your words are misplaced, boy. My opinion is governed by logic and science and nothing else. Yes, science is where you should direct your words of gratitude. Ryunosuke: Ah... Juror No. 4: ......... Ryunosuke: ......... Juror No. 4: What's the matter with you?! Too good to say some words of thanks to the mother of all academic subjects?! Ryunosuke: (...What is it about scientists? Honestly.)Pit against Juror No. 5's statement Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: Good gracious! To whose statements do you refer, Counsel? Ryunosuke: If you could put down your corn for a moment, juror number five...! Juror No. 5: ......... Ooh, you mean me? Ryunosuke: You've pointed out that it's wrong to make an accusation without evidence. But the accusation that the waxwork model was inside the second birdcage on the day in question... ...is not without supporting evidence. As the defence demonstrated to the juror sitting beside you. Juror No. 5: ......... Ooh, is that right? Ryunosuke: ......... Would it be fair to say... ...you didn't follow the argument? Juror No. 5: I don't understand much besides Colonel Cob, to be honest. Ryunosuke: ......... (Of course you don't...) Juror No. 4: If I could interject here... Ryunosuke: Please do, sir. Juror No. 4: Now that this assertion of yours about the waxwork has been backed up by some solid evidence... ...it would be wrong of me, as a man of science, not to pursue the matter further. Juror No. 5: Ar, well, me too, then! Ryunosuke: Sorry?! Juror No. 5: If this brainy gentleman says ee's right, then ee must be! See...I, um... ...I wouldn't dream of goin' against Colonel Cob or anyone who's got stuffin' between the ears! Ryunosuke: (Success! ...If you can call it that.) Changes Juror No. 4's statement to \"The possibility has been established reasonably and logically. It now warrants further research.\" Changes Juror No. 5's statement to \"Well, 'course if ee's got some evidences, that's a whole other cob o' corn, innit? Lovely job!\"Juror No. 4: The possibility has been established reasonably and logically. It now warrants further research.Juror No. 5: Accusin' someone without right evidences? Ee's not a proper job, is ee? I won't 'ave it!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: I've got to ask...why have you brought that corn into court with you? Juror No. 5: Colonel Cob? Ee's bin growin' back on the farm. Picked 'im off on me way into town. Ee's a proper nibbler, ee is. Ryunosuke: Yes, the nibbling seems to be taking quite a while. Maybe it could wait until after the trial? Juror No. 5: Ooh, I don't like the sound o' that. You need colonels at times like these. Whenever I've summat big to decide, the colonels always point me in the right direction, see. Ryunosuke: Y-You're talking about your cob of corn? Juror No. 5: Nibble nobble guilty bobble, nibble not guilty out. Nibble nobble guilty bobble, nibble not guilty out. Nibble nobble guilty bobble, nibble not guilty out. Nibble nobble guilty bobble, nibble not guilty out. Susato: ...Perhaps it's akin to fortune-telling with flower petals like people do back home? Ryunosuke: (So Professor Harebrayne's fate is to be decided by a cob of corn...) Could you not at least wait until we've had more time to find the truth before deciding on the defendant's guilt? Juror No. 5: Ooh, I don't know about that. Me tum's awfully full already. Ryunosuke: (A-maize-ing...)Pit against Juror No. 4's statement (after Juror No. 4 changes his statement) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: Good gracious! To whose statements do you refer, Counsel? Ryunosuke: If you could put down your corn for a moment, juror number five...! Juror No. 5: ......... Ooh, you mean me?

Lovely job!\"Juror No. 5: Well, 'course if ee's got some evidences, that's a whole other cob o' corn, innit? Lovely job!Ryunosuke: (I know it seems a little far-fetched to think that the waxwork model of the Professor was in that birdcage... ...but on the other hand, it explains a lot.)Susato: If there really is a reason why that particular waxwork had to be used as Mr Asman's double... ...we must do everything we can to make the jurors understand it.Ryunosuke: The truth is, I'm sure that's the key to this, but it's the most puzzling part of it, too.Susato: In that case, you should see what additional information you can glean whilst trying to change the jurors' minds. If you can read a book whilst eating a rice cracker, Mr Naruhodo, I'm sure you can do this!Ryunosuke: ...Right. Yes!After Jurors No. 2, 4, 5, and 6 vote innocent:Judge: Thank you, Counsel, that will do. As a result of the summation examination, the jury's overall leaning has changed. Two jurors now call guilty. Against four who call not guilty. Accordingly the court has failed to reach a consensus at this time... ...and the trial must continue!Ryunosuke: We, we did it!Susato: Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! Another wonderful victory!Judge: Hmmm, a waxwork of the despicable Professor... ...used as a 'body double' for the victim in this quite extraordinary case... I must say, it's extremely hard to believe the assertion could possibly be true. However, it would appear that it does at least warrant further investigation.Ryunosuke: It's the waxwork of the Professor that links Mr Drebber and Dr Sithe. And I'm convinced that there's a special significance to that link!Juror No. 6: I don't know what you're hoping to prove, lad, I really don't!Susato: The truth, sir. By using evidence and testimony.Juror No. 6: Hmph.Van Zieks: If the court is to delve deeper into the alleged involvement of the waxwork in this case... ...then the prosecution calls for the owner of the model to be summoned as a witness.Judge: The owner?Van Zieks: Madame Tusspells.Ryunosuke: ...! (I, I really thought... ...that Lord van Zieks would object to this whole line of enquiry...)Judge: Very well, I concur. Make arrangements for Madame Tusspells to appear as a witness with immediate effect.Van Zieks: ......... Listen carefully, my learned friend.Ryunosuke: Oh... Yes?Van Zieks: You should know... ...that you're on the brink of opening Pandora's box. .........Judge: The court shall now adjourn for forty-five minutes. During that time, the prosecution will summon the new witness and prepare her for taking the stand.Van Zieks: Madame Tusspells, yes. I shall see to it at once, My Lord.To be continued...24th October, 11:53 a.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' AntechamberSholmes: Ah, the knight-errant himself!Ryunosuke: Oh, have you been watching from the gallery, Mr Sholmes?Sholmes: I've been on the edge of my seat the entire time! Courtroom trials are fascinating affairs. As a spectator, at least.Ryunosuke: I'm glad you've been enjoying yourself...Harebrayne: I, I have to ask... ...what on earth is going on?! It makes no sense! What's this Professor business all about? He doesn't look like any professor I've ever met before! Who even is he?Ryunosuke: Ah, of course... ...you were in Germany already ten years ago.Sholmes: Yes, the Professor... When I discovered 'he' was the one who had been abducted, a sense of foreboding stirred within me. But who knew the monster would come knocking at your door? My heartfelt sympathies! Ah ha ha ha ha hah!Ryunosuke: As it turns out... ...Lord van Zieks is even more intimately tied to this case than any of us realised, isn't he?Susato: Yes, how true. His great friend from university in the dock...Sholmes: ...And now a waxwork of the killer who took his esteemed brother's life makes an appearance, too. I imagine even the shrewd Mr Reaper failed to foresee that kick in the teeth. An extraordinary move on your part, my dear fellow, to throw that in front of the man.Ryunosuke: You make it sound deliberate...Susato: I can't help feeling... ...that this Professor case is really very puzzling.Sholmes: Oh yes? In what particular manner?Susato: Well, there's Mr Drebber, Dr Sithe and Lord van Zieks... It seems that everybody in the trial has a link to the case somehow.Harebrayne: Yes, in fact I, alone, am not a member of the set! Though that leaves me as an empty set...all alone with no intersection to any other...???:Excuse me.Ryunosuke: D.........D.........Dr Sithe!Sholmes: Ah, Dr Courtney Sithe, née Stevens. Good day to you.Sithe: Hello, Sholmes. That was very shrewd of you.Sholmes: ...What in particular, pray?Sithe: You requested that ten-year-old autopsy report from Gregson, didn't you?Sholmes: Why would you assume such a thing?Sithe: Because Gregson told me.Sholmes: .........Sithe: To think it's been ten years... Ten years in the laboratory, wielding my scalpel. I smell of nothing but corpses and disinfectant.Ryunosuke: A policeman on the jury had a lot to say about you as it happens, Dr Sithe. And I've...accused you of being complicit in what happened. I'm hoping that you'll take the stand and tell the truth about what really happened.Sithe: That certainly won't be possible.Ryunosuke: ...!Sithe: Lord van Zieks won't be summoning me as a witness. Lord Stronghart has forbidden it.Ryunosuke: Lord Stronghart?Sithe: The Pandora's box you were warned about...is the Professor case. But please don't make the mistake of thinking you'll get any information about it out of me.Susato: But attempting to hide from the truth... That's cowardice!Sithe: I've always fought crime in the way that I see fit. I have no regrets. None at all. And that's all I came here to say. So...good day to you.Ryunosuke: ......... She mentioned it, too. This Pandora's box...Susato: Whatever does it all mean?Sholmes: There's really no cause for concern. I assure you, when the trial resumes... ...the meaning will become all too apparent, whether you'd like it to or not.Ryunosuke: Huh?Sholmes: Now then, I believe it's almost time. I must make my way back to the public gallery. The edge of my seat awaits!Ryunosuke: (I think maybe you're enjoying yourself a little too much...)Sholmes: Ah yes, one word of warning before I go: If, in the course of the trial this afternoon, you perceive even a shadow of doubt about the truth... ...don't let it out of your sight. Pursue it like a dog with a bone.Ryunosuke: ...!Sholmes: To the bitter end, you understand. Do not falter, whatever may come to pass.Ryunosuke: ......... Alright, I understand. ...Thank you.Sholmes: Good. I shall make myself scarce, then. I purchased a bar of caramel earlier, so I shall be gnawing on that as you gnaw away at the truth!Ryunosuke: (What did that warning from Mr Sholmes really mean, I wonder? Especially the bit about 'whatever may come to pass'... .........)It's time for the final chapter, then. I'm determined to find the truth... ...no matter what.24th October, 12:40 p.m. The Old Bailey CourtroomJudge: In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby reconvene the proceedings of this court. Counsels for the defence and prosecution, are you ready and able to continue?Van Zieks: The prosecution is ready, My Lord.Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord. The defence is also ready.Judge: As the court is aware, the case under our scrutiny began with a damaging incident at the Great Exhibition. Yet we now find ourselves embroiled in the details of a convicted felon who was sent to the gallows a decade ago. This trial has certainly defied all expectation.Van Zieks: As seems to be the fate of all trials in which this Nipponese is involved, My Lord.Judge: So then... ...let us begin our exploration of the defence's assertion that the waxwork was cardinally involved in this matter. Lord van Zieks...Van Zieks: My Lord?Judge: Are we still awaiting the arrival of Madame Tusspells?Van Zieks: Not at all. She is in the antechamber as we speak and ready to be summoned.Judge: Very well. Bring in the witness!Van Zieks: At once, My Lord. Bailiff! Show Madame Tusspells to the stand!Ryunosuke: (Things are about to become a lot more intense. If Drebber is responsible, as I'm sure he is, it means he must have had an accomplice...in Dr Sithe.)Susato: And what connects the pair of them...is the waxwork.Ryunosuke: (Yes, the model of the Professor... That's the key to the link between these otherwise unrelated individuals. It's a tenuous link, admittedly. But at present, it's all we have to go on.)Van Zieks: State your name and occupation for the court, please.Tusspells: My name is Madame Esmeralda Tusspells. I am a waxwork artisan. And the proprietress of the Madame Tusspells Museum of Waxwork. You will have to pardon me for working as I testify. My new exhibit must open very soon.Ryunosuke: ......... (Oh, so he finally gets a statue, does he? Now there are two of them in the world...)Susato: Oh my... What expression is she carving onto that face?Van Zieks: A number of days ago, a particular waxwork model was stolen from your museum. Can you confirm this?Tusspells: Oui. That is true. At first, we believed it had been kidnapped.Judge: A waxwork model? Kidnapped?!Tusspells: Yes, My Lord. There was a demand for ransom money left behind by the culprit. However, according to what I have just been told outside the courtroom, that was not the true reason. I understand it was utilised as a substitute for the body of a murder victim?Van Zieks: At present, that is no more than conjecture proposed by the defence. This is the victim of the case in question. Mr Odie Asman.Tusspells: But of course, I know him well. He is a part of my odious personages exhibit. ...I detest to say what is evident, but Mr Asman does not resemble the Professor at all.Ryunosuke: Yes, but...perhaps! Perhaps their faces are very similar!Tusspells: Are you suggesting that we should see now the demasked visage of the Professor? I have here the key, but it is strictly forbidden to open the lock.Van Zieks: This is absurd!Tusspells: Pardon?Van Zieks: I don't know what face you've carved onto your fancy figure beneath that mask... ...but clearly it won't be that of the actual killer.Judge: Indeed. The man's identity was never made public, after all.Van Zieks: The trial took place in a closed court. The proceedings were strictly confidential. The condemned man was summarily executed. His identity remains a closely guarded national secret. There is no possible way that a repository of tawdry exhibits could get its hands on that information.Tusspells: ......... Quel dommage. It would seem you are unaware of the Tusspells' principles.Ryunosuke: What principles?Tusspells: The family Tusspells has always prided itself on sculpting its models à la perfection. Every detail, including the visage, is fashioned with complete fidelity. ...Et voilà: our principles.Susato: There is a well known legend about the Tusspells waxworks from the time of the French Revolution. A member of the Tusspells family is said to have made a waxwork of the queen who was executed.Tusspells: Oui, that is true. It was a century ago now.Susato: I believe the queen's face was carved in the minutes following her death, actually at the guillotine site.Tusspells: You are correct. The model is on display still today in the House of Horrors. We Tusspells will stop at nothing to obtain a faithful replica of our subjects.Judge: Dear me... A somewhat disturbing tenacity of purpose.Tusspells: It is the only way to obtain a truly lifelike representation of the subject. And it has been my family's secret for generations.Ryunosuke: Do, do you mean to say...that beneath that mask...?Tusspells: Oui. The true visage of the killer is there.Van Zieks: ...This is ludicrous. It's out of the question!Tusspells: The Professor spread terror throughout Great Britain. As a result, the Madame Tusspells Special Exhibit remains extremely popular even today. The killer...emerging from his own grave... It is a sight to behold. You should come.Judge: I think, madame, it would be beneficial to hear your formal testimony on this matter. You will explain every detail of this macabre model. And your personal involvement in its creation.Tusspells: ...With pleasure.Witness Testimony - The Professor Waxwork -Tusspells: The special exhibit in the House of Horrors is based on a rumour that shocked society in London. An impression of the visage was taken directly from the corpse...in accordance with Tusspells family principles. I enlisted the aid of the gravedigger, and created a mould for the head in the cemetery just before the interment. I hid myself until he gave me a signal. ...I was there for a very long time that night. As dawn approached, I was very worried that I could be discovered.Judge: The gravedigger?! The man sanctioned this?Tusspells: Oui. I will do all that is necessary to achieve the true resemblance my family is celebrated for. Nobody else knew. Only the gravedigger. What harm did it do, uh?Van Zieks: So you truly saw it? The face of that monster!Tusspells: ......... Naturally, I was aware at the time that his identity was a secret. But Tusspells would not be Tusspells if we did not insist on absolute fidelity to our sculptures.Van Zieks: I don't believe this...Judge: I myself have seen the special exhibit at your museum, madame. A truly blood-curdling scene, in which the murderer is emerging from his own grave.Tusspells: The scene it depicts was the subject of many rumours in London ten years ago. I have here a newspaper from the time. The special exhibit was based upon the picture in this article. It was the most detailed account of what happened, as reported by the eyewitness who saw it.The ten-year-old article has been entered into the Court Record.Van Zieks: 'Man Rises from the Grave!'... It's too absurd for words.Tusspells: The public enjoy absurdity, monsieur. That is why I have reproduced the scene as carefully as possible in my museum.Ryunosuke: And it's a waxwork from that exhibit that was stolen some days before the incident at the Great Exhibition, wasn't it.Tusspells: That is correct. The Professor you see before you here.Judge: Hm... Most puzzling... Counsel for the Defence...proceed with the cross-examination!Ryunosuke: (This waxwork links Drebber to Dr Sithe... And there has to be some reason for that, which hasn't yet come to light. But I'll find it. I'll get to the bottom of what really happened. I'll prove that Dr Sithe and Drebber were in on this crime together!)Cross-Examination - The Professor Waxwork -\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Susato Mikotoba\nDescription: A judicial assistant sent to Britain on a study tour.

    "cot": "Evidence 10 describes the wooden birdcage that crashed into the Crystal Tower, with damage at its base, implying that the birdcage fell tailfirst. Many witness reports, however, claim the birdcage fell headfirst into the Crystal Tower.\n\nTestimony 0 states that the special exhibit in the House of Horrors is based on a rumour that shocked society in London, which may relate to the depiction of the professor rising from his own grave.\n\nThis is a bit indirect, so looking at a more directly contradictory pair —\n\nEvidence 18 is Drebber's contract, stating he receives 30% of income only as long as both contracting parties are alive. This contradicts any motive to kill Mr Asman.\n\nTestimony 8 (not explicitly listed here but implied through court dialogue) that Drebber had a motive to kill Asman for the research grant.\n\nBut the question is to pick one pair of evidence and testimony that contradict.\n\nEvidence 7 is the screwdriver with blood matching the victim.\n\nTestimony 6 by Tusspells is about creating the waxwork head accurately from the corpse shortly after death.\n\nThese don't directly contradict.\n\nEvidence 13 is a piece of broken glass found in the folds of the clothing of the Professor waxwork, from the Crystal Tower.\n\nTestimony 4 by Tusspells states it took her a very long time because it was before the onset of rigor mortis, implying accurate and timely molding of the dead.\n\nNot contradictory.\n\nBut a key contradiction is between:\n\nEvidence 18 (Drebber's contract), stating he gains only if both he and Asman are alive — motive contradicts expectation of intent to kill.\n\nTestimony 5 (Tusspells): \"As dawn approached, I was very worried that I could be discovered.\" No direct contradiction.\n\nTestimony from Drebber or Van Zieks may say Drebber killed Asman, which contradicts contract motive.\n\nTherefore, the contradiction is mainly between Drebber's contract (Evidence 18) and the claim that Drebber was motivated to kill Asman.\n\nSince testimony from Drebber in court states no motive to kill as per contract and that he \"had nothing to gain\" (which is testimony from him) contradicts with prosecution's position.\n\nTherefore:\n\n{\"evidence\": 18, \"testimony\": 7} (assuming testimony 7 is Drebber's claim of no motive to kill)\n\nHowever, only Tusspells' testimonies are given enumerated 0-6, and the rest is conversation.\n\nBetween the given testimonies, the following pair stands out:\n\nEvidence 10: Damage on bottom of birdcage implies birdcage fell tail first.\n\nTestimony 0 (Tusspells): The special exhibit is based on rumour; this does not contradict.\n\nAlternatively,\n\nEvidence 7: Screwdriver matched victim's stab wound.\n\nTestimony 3: Tusspells hid in the graveyard for a long time; no contradiction.\n\nFinally, considering the core factual contradiction:\n\nEvidence 10 (Wooden 'Birdcage'): Damaged at base, fell tail first.\n\nTestimony from witnesses or the judge (from the story): It fell head first (many witnesses).\n\nTherefore, the contradictory pair is:\n\nEvidence 10 and the testimony (not clearly enumerated) of witnesses of the birdcage falling headfirst.\n\nSince testimonies given are all Tusspells', none mention direction of fall.\n\nHence, by the information, the pair with direct contradiction is between:\n\nEvidence 10: Birdcage damaged at base implying tail-first fall.\n\nAnd the multiple witness testimonies stating birdcage fell headfirst.\n\nSince such testimony is unnumbered here, I must select the one matching closest:\n\nTestimony 0: The special exhibit is based on the rumour that shocked society.\n\nProbably not.\n\nNo other testimonies mention fall direction.\n\nTherefore, concluding, the contradictory pair is Evidence 10 and witness testimony that the birdcage fell headfirst (not in the given testimony list).\n\nSince the question wants exactly one pair, I will output:\n",

Wondrous new works of culture and industry from every corner of the globe had converged on Hyde Park. Welcoming over fifty million visitors, the last great hurrah of this century astonished and delighted people of all nations, and ended on a note of resounding success. But, as regards to the terrible catastrophe that occurred during the festivities, very few are aware my friend, Mr Herlock Sholmes, had a hand in unravelling the matter. For, from the shadows, it was he who earnestly unearthed the facts of the case. And like the centrepiece of the Great Exhibition, which rose high into the skies of Hyde Park, Sholmes's brilliant deductions - as clear and lofty as the Crystal Tower itself - brought the truth to light. Rendered dialogue We're here at the showground of the Great Exhibition, which is absolutely packed with people... The weather is unusually fine, and we're about to witness a most extraordinary scientific experiment! Ladies and gentlemen, the twentieth century will see steam engines and electrical power dominate the world! Horse-drawn carts will give way to the motor car! Ships will sprout wings and take to the skies! And today, we showcase even more advanced technology! A glimpse into the future! A world first! A demonstration of my super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine! A man will literally be disassembled by a pulse of high-voltage electricity, and beamed to another location... ...whereupon his body will be reassembled by a series of complex calculations exactly as it was before! In but a few moments from now... ...this gentleman will, in the blink of an eye, complete an incredible journey through the air... ...to arrive an instant later, on the Crystal Tower behind you! 22nd October, 9:36 a.m. Sholmes's Suite Ryunosuke: ......... Iris: ...Runo! Runo, are you listening? Ryunosuke: Oh! Sorry, um...what was that, Iris? Iris: Hmph. What's the matter with you? You've been miles away all morning. Didn't you like what I cooked for breakfast? Ryunosuke: No no, that's not it at all. Um...what were we talking about again? Iris: Today's paper! It's full of news about the Great Exhibition again! Ryunosuke: Ah yes...the Great Exhibition... I'd like to go sometime. ......... Iris: You're really not your usual self today. You seem very down. Don't you agree, Hurley? Sholmes: Hm...? Did you say something? Iris? Iris: Oh gosh! You're even more down! Sholmes: ......... UWAAAAAAAAAGH!!! Wh-When did you arrive, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: I've...been here for about half an hour already. We had breakfast together. Sholmes: What?! Why didn't you mention it before? Ryunosuke: I, um...thought you might have known I was here. You know, because...breakfast? Sholmes: Hm, Iris is quite right. You're clearly lacking in vim. So much so that I didn't notice your presence. Ryunosuke: (...Thanks.) Sholmes: Of course, I could deduce the reason perfectly well with some simple observations. Ryunosuke: What?! Sholmes: Let's see... Yes, for example, your tussled hair this morning, with all its unruly spikes. Clearly it can be deduced therefore, that- Ryunosuke: Um, let me stop you there, Mr Sholmes, because I think I can see where this is going. My hair always looks like this. It always has. Ever since we first met, in fact. Sholmes: Oh really? How interesting. It just doesn't look like a haircut as such, I suppose. Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Ryunosuke: (...Thanks again.) ......... It crossed my mind recently...that it's been six months now. Iris: Six months? Ryunosuke: Since I was forbidden from working in court. So I've been wondering how much longer I'm going to be banned. Iris: Oh... Well, that would explain why you seem rather glum. Don't you agree, Hurley? Sholmes: Hm...? Did you say something? Iris? Ryunosuke: (Ah...back to moping...) Ryunosuke: What's the matter with Mr Sholmes today? He seems even more down in the dumps than me. Iris: I know! And the Great Exhibition has opened! You'd think he'd be excited. Oh, why don't we all go to see it together? Sholmes: I want to! Of course I do! But I can't! ...Not for the time being. Ryunosuke: Why not? Sholmes: Why not? Why not?! Because! I'm a great detective, after all! Ryunosuke: (So you're embroiled in some tricky case that you can't be distracted from? Is that it?) Iris: I don't remember hearing that you're working on a case, Hurley. Sholmes: ......... Ryunosuke: (I suppose I should try to find out what's going on.) After clearing all Converse options: Sholmes: Well, I must be leaving now. Ryunosuke: Yes, understood. See you later, Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: Hah! You really are a shameless liar sometimes, my dear fellow! Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: You seek to put me off my guard and follow me, don't you? Well, you would be wasting your time. Ryunosuke: The thought hadn't crossed my mind! (But now I'm wondering where you're going...) Sholmes: Ah ha ha ha hah! Well then, 'see you later' indeed! Ryunosuke: (Listen to him. He's still laughing on his way out of the door...) Iris: Alright then, Runo! Let's get going! Ryunosuke: Oh! Um, Iris... What are you wearing? Iris: I've got changed to go to the Great Exhibition. You're going to take me! Ryunosuke: What? But, but I was just about to go to the Supreme Court... Iris: Oh! Well that sounds fun, too! You're going to take me there, then! Ryunosuke: Alright, fine. Just...lower that weapon, would you? Iris: Of course! And after the Supreme Court, then we'll go to see the Great Exhibition! 22nd October Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy 22nd October British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Ryunosuke: It's been about six months now since I was last here. But some things never change. Like the sense of foreboding I always seem to feel in this place. (It doesn't seem to be bothering Iris at all, though. She's happily reading over there...) Iris: Oh, I love this place! I always find so many interesting books here! Ryunosuke: Of course. I was forgetting that you've been here before. (The time we came here six months ago... ...when Susato-san was given the news that she was to return to Japan.) ???: Ah. I understand you wish to speak with me. Ryunosuke: Oh! L-Lord Stronghart! I trust you've been k-keeping well? Stronghart: Let's see... Since you've arrived and requested an audience, it's been four hours, thirty-two minutes and... ...twenty-six seconds. I've kept you waiting a while. My apologies. Ryunosuke: Oh no, not at all! I like nothing more than standing around, staring into space. Stronghart: ...Good to know. Ryunosuke: (...Good to know that doesn't appear to bother him at all.) Mael Stronghart, Lord Chief Justice of London. He's the man who allowed me to start practising as a defence lawyer when I arrived in Britain as a student. You need only savour the air for a moment in this grand office to understand his pre-eminent status. Stronghart: As you will be aware, the Great Exhibition of London is now underway at last. We're extremely busy as a result. Policing the grounds, guarding the new technologies, dealing with petty crime... And furthermore, as of next month, we shall open the International Forensic Science Symposium. Ryunosuke: Oh...I've not heard about that. Stronghart: Investigating authorities from forty countries around the globe will be taking part. Including from your own land. Forensic science is the future! The world must embrace it! As we're the hosting nation, I have much to do. And it is my highest priority. If others must wait for my attention as a result, so be it. Ryunosuke: (...Well, it's nice to know where I stand.) Stronghart: So...you wish to consult with me? Of course, I can very well imagine what this is about. Ryunosuke: Ah...well, um... Thank you for agreeing to this meeting, My Lord! (I want to be allowed to start working as a defence lawyer again in court. That's what brought me here today. But actually, there's something else playing on my mind, as it happens...) Iris: Runo, just take a deep breath and come out with it! After clearing all Converse options: Stronghart: Well, I must be leaving for my next engagement. I'm already...eleven hours and sixteen minutes late. ...My colleagues may be starting to fidget. Ryunosuke: E-Eleven hours late? That's...quite something. Stronghart: That meeting had already started when I arrived back here for this engagement with you. So lateness was inevitable. Time stops for no man. Ryunosuke: (I'm sure it stopped for me during those twelve solid arguments and two hundred and twenty-three reasons...) Oh, yes! Where would I find Lord van Zieks now? Stronghart: I would assume he's at his office. Ryunosuke: (Right, I'll go and ask him about the attack in person. I want to get this straight from the horse's mouth...) Stronghart: Away with you now. I'm leaving Professor Harebrayne's defence entirely in your hands. Ryunosuke: Of, of course, yes! Thank you very much, My Lord! 22nd October Prosecutor's Office Iris: Ooh! So this is the legendary Reaper's office? Ryunosuke: Yes, it appears so. Iris: Brrr, it sends a chill down your spine, doesn't it? What an amazingly deathly atmosphere! Ryunosuke: ...Oh, is that...? (That hooded figure was so still, I hadn't noticed his or her presence. I wonder who it is...?) ???: What are you doing here? Ryunosuke: Agh! Van Zieks: ......... Ryunosuke: (He's as unwelcoming as I thought he'd be. Actually, maybe even more so...) Oh, I, um... I'm glad to see you're well. Van Zieks: ...I am. Ryunosuke: ......... So...who's the person over by the wall being...punished for something or other? Van Zieks: No punishment is taking place here. Ryunosuke: Oh. Van Zieks: That's my apprentice. And he's sitting there of his own free will. Ryunosuke: I didn't know you had an apprentice. (It must be the same person who was pictured in the newspaper...) Van Zieks: He's very able in combat. ...A requisite skill for anyone under my tutelage. Ryunosuke: Are you referring to the attack on the Reaper that was reported in the papers? Van Zieks: The Reaper? I'd be interested to know the Reaper's true identity myself. Assuming, that is, such a fabled fiend genuinely inhabits our great courtrooms... After clearing all Converse options: Van Zieks: Ah yes, there's something I've been meaning to ask you... Ryunosuke: Oh! What's that? Van Zieks: That Nipponese man. Is he faring well? Ryunosuke: Sorry? Van Zieks: The one arrested twice in succession six months ago. With the stoop. And the moustache. And the jitters. Ryunosuke: Ah! Mr Natsume, you mean? Iris: ...I'm not sure he'd be very pleased to find out you identified him from that list, Runo. Ryunosuke: He's fine, thank you. In fact, I received a letter from him by international post only the other day. Van Zieks: I see. ......... Well, I think we can end our discussion there, don't you? There's little time left before tomorrow's trial. I advise you to spend it investigating the case. Ryunosuke: Yes, thank you for the advice. And for the conversation. (I can't believe he's asking after Soseki-san. After a 'Nipponese'! I'm not sure whether to feel happy about that or worried.) Iris: I never imagined that Mr Reaper would be friends with a mad scientist, did you? That's a turn-up for the books! Ryunosuke: A mad scientist? Ah, you mean Professor Harebrayne? (Yes, it might be worth quizzing the professor about his relationship with Lord van Zieks, I think.) 22nd October Local Prison, Cell 11 Ryunosuke: The warden said cell eleven. That's this one... Iris: Oh! There's someone curled up in a ball in the back corner, look! Ryunosuke: What's his name again? Professor Albert Harebrayne, wasn't it? ...Um, excuse me! Professor Harebrayne! Harebrayne: ...! Who are you? Ryunosuke: I'm Ryunosuke Naruhodo. I'm a defence lawyer. Harebrayne: A LAWYER! Ryunosuke: Agh! (Was it something I said?!) Harebrayne: A, a lawyer, you say? W-W-W-Would you be here... a-a-a-about the experiment? ARE YOU GOING TO DEFEND MY HYPOTHESIS?! Ryunosuke: Your...hypothesis? Sorry, I don't- Harebrayne: Yesterday's demonstration! That demonstration was... That magnificent demonstration was... It was an out-and-out success! By anyone's calculations! B-B-B-But despite that... ...no one listens! No lawyer believes in the science! When it's explained, they all leave...at high velocity! Haah... Ryunosuke: ......... (Now's probably not a good time to mention that your zeal made my concentration leave for a while, too...) After clearing all Converse options: Ryunosuke: So, Professor, let me just make absolutely sure I've understood you properly. The huge explosion that occurred yesterday... That was an accident, you're saying? You had no intent to harm the victim, who was in fact the sole investor in your work. Is that correct? Harebrayne: As correct as two squared is four! I swear it! Yes, it's true that the man perished in a machine of my invention. So I know that I'm far from blameless in all this. But still! I would never use my discoveries, my inventions, to take a person's life! Not in a centillion years! I'm a man of science! It's all I know! You have to believe me! Please! Do you believe me? Do you believe in my hypothesis? Science is the pursuit of truth, you know. I've always believed that. All my life! Ryunosuke: ......... I'm afraid I don't know much about science. Or your theories. But I do believe you. And I will fight to prove your innocence with all my might. I'm a man of the law! It's all I know! You have to believe me! Please! Harebrayne: ......... When I went to live in Germany after I graduated, I learnt something very important. Nationality, class, lineage...none of that matters. As long as you try your hardest, you can achieve anything. Ryunosuke: Thank you for that, Professor. Harebrayne: And thank you in advance for defending me tomorrow in court! Iris: Alright, Runo, it's time! Time to visit the Great Exhibition! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Iris: Well, that's where the incident happened, isn't it? Ryunosuke: Yes, I suppose that's true. (Time to investigate at last!) 22nd October The Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower Ryunosuke: Ugh... The showgrounds are a little too big for my liking... We've been walking around in dense crowds for two hours now, and I've felt myself swooning three times. Iris: There are a lot of people, aren't there? I've almost been trodden on three times, too! Ryunosuke: ...Be careful, won't you, Iris? Don't let go of my hand. (We've finally made it through the throngs though, by the look of it. Here we are underneath the public experimentation stage where the explosion happened yesterday.) ???: .........! ???: .........! Ryunosuke: (What's that...? I can hear voices from up on the stage. It sounds like an argument...) ???: Right, I've had it with you this time! I'm warnin' you, I'll arrest you in a minute! ???: Oh yeah? Go on then, 'Spector, give it a shot! You ain't got no evidence, an' you know it! Ryunosuke: (Wait... I know those voices.) ???: You've got a cheeky little mouth on you, young lady! But a night in the cells will teach you some manners! ???: Just try it, I dare ya! If ya want that bag o' chips rammed down yer throat! Iris: Yoo-hoo! Gregsy! What are you doing up there? Gregson: ......... Ah! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! It's you! Here! You're here! Here you are! You! Here! Your Ladyshiiip! How are you, Your Ladyship? I do hope you're well, Your Ladyship? Ryunosuke: (...Does that make her three times a lady?) Iris: I'm not well at all. It's far too busy everywhere. I wanted to ride in a balloon, but there was a three-hour queue. Gregson: Unbelievable! I'll go an' have a word for you at once, Your Ladyship! You'll be flyin' as high as a kite in no time once I pull some strings for you! Ryunosuke: Tobias Gregson, an inspector at Scotland Yard. Until recently, he was suspended from duty, but it would appear he's back in action now. He's actually quite well known, appearing as he does in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'. And for that reason, he can't say a word wrong to the stories' author, Iris. (But there are limits, surely... Or there should be!) Gregson: Watch it, sunshine! Ryunosuke: S-Sorry... Gregson: What gives, then? Don't tell me you're on this case? Ryunosuke: Yes, I'm acting for the defence. Iris: So we're here to investigate! Gregson: Hmmm... Dear me, that's the situation, is it? Ryunosuke: (Is it really that troubling?) ???: Tsk. A measly five bob? Is that all ya got? Yer a lawyer, ain't ya? Ya could stand to carry a bit more copper around in yer pockets, Mr Narra-'Oddo! Ryunosuke: Wha...? Hey! That's my last bit of spending money, that is! ???: Ya can 'ave it back, but I'll 'ave to charge ya for all the bother. Three bob. Ryunosuke: This is Gina Lestrade, a pickpocket, or 'diver', born and bred in the East End of London. In the case that led to my own suspension six months ago... ...this is the young girl I was defending in court. Gina: Wot's yer problem, eh, 'Oddo?! 'Diver'? Pickpocket? Wot's wiv all the name-callin'? You wanna bag o' chips rammed down yer throat an' all, do ya? Ryunosuke: I, I thought you were proud to be a diver, Gina? You were just arguing with Inspector Gregson about it, weren't you? I assumed you'd been up to your usual tricks here at the showground. Gina: That ain't no way to talk to a lady, 'Oddo. 'Alf a year's a long time. People can change. I'm an apprentice now. Learnin' to be a Scotland Yard detective. So you'll 'ave to call me wot everyone else does: It's Inspector Lestrade now! Ryunosuke: In... Inspector?! (That badge is homemade, surely...) Gregson: The 'inspector' part isn't entirely accurate. No one calls her that. For what it's worth, anyway. Investigatin' is off the cards for all of us. Iris: What's that supposed to mean? Gregson: Right, well, I'll be back up top. You hold the fort down here, alright? Gina: Right...sir. Ryunosuke: (This... This raises a LOT of questions!) After clearing all Converse options and examining green cloth on ground, device on ground, and large hole in glass in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower and clearing all Converse options and examining large machine in Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage: Iris: Runo, Runo, listen! Ryunosuke: What? What is it? Iris: I've been thinking... Hurley might know something, mightn't he? Ryunosuke: About what? Iris: About Mr Reaper! Ryunosuke: ...! About what happened to Lord van Zieks, you mean? (Because it sounds like something very significant occurred after he graduated from university. Something that completely changed his life.) Maybe, but I have no idea where to find Mr Sholmes at the moment. He's in the middle of some big case, isn't he? Iris: Here, this is what you need! Ryunosuke: What's this? (Some kind of entrance ticket?) 'Madame Tusspells'? Is this supposed to mean something to me? Iris: You don't know it?! It's the most popular attraction in London at the moment! It's very close to Baker Street, actually. We could go now, if you like? Ryunosuke: No no, we don't have time for visiting attractions today, Iris. We have a big trial tomorrow! Iris: But that's where Hurley is. Ryunosuke: What? At, at this popular London attraction? Iris: Yes! Ryunosuke: How is it that you know where he is? Iris: Hurley told me. But he told me to keep it a secret from you, Runo. Ryunosuke: Madame Tusspells...? (I don't see how it could be related to the case we're investigating here, but then... ...stranger things have happened. And when they happen, Mr Sholmes is usually at the heart of them.) 22nd October The Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage Ryunosuke: So that's it, is it? The machine that blew up. Iris: Ooh, it must have been a magnificent explosion! And I've seen my fair share. Ryunosuke: You've seen things like this before, you mean? Iris: Of course! Hurley's always doing experiments that end in a bang. In fact, in his own words, 'Explosions are the very essence of chemistry!' Ryunosuke: Ah...that might explain the smell of burning that frequently comes wafting up the stairs. Iris: One time, he made something that exploded with such force, it took the roof off the building! I wish you'd been there to see it, Runo! Ryunosuke: ...It's hard to get too excited about that...given that I now live in the roof. Iris: Well anyway, that's enough about that. It's time to investigate! Ryunosuke: Ah look, Inspector Gregson is over there. He seems to be deep in thought about something... whilst eyeing up the machine carefully. Iris: Really? He just looks confused to me. Ryunosuke: It ripped itself apart magnificently, didn't it? Iris: Magnificently...and mercilessly. Ryunosuke: So someone stands in the middle of the machine to be disassembled and then 'beamed' through the air... Iris: Yes, 'beamed' not 'blasted'. That's the point. Ryunosuke: (Yes, that part's crucial, really.) Is something like that even possible, though, Iris? Iris: Oh, Runo. I'm just a child. How should I know? Ryunosuke: (A child when it suits you, you mean...) Iris: From what I can tell, I think if you were to pull this lever here- Gregson: STOOOOOOOOOOOOP! Don't touch that! Iris: Ah ha ha! That was practically instantaneous kinesis the way you flew over just now, Gregsy! Gregson: Please, Your Ladyship... I didn't mean to startle you, but I can't let you touch anything up here. Iris: So sorry. You can have some of my latest special blend to make up for it. Gregson: *Glug* *Glug glug glug* Aaah! Wonderful! This stuff really is wonderful! Ryunosuke: (It's just like old times, this is...) We're representing Professor Harebrayne in court tomorrow, Inspector. So we should be allowed to examine the scene! Gregson: Hah! Listen, sunshine, even I'm not allowed to touch anythin' up here! It's that blasted Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act to blame. It's drivin' me potty! Ryunosuke: Oh yes, that special dispensation... (The professor mentioned that, too.) Gregson: More red tape's all we need. I dunno what the government thinks it's playin' at sometimes. Iris: But...we're allowed to just look, aren't we? Gregson: Eh? Iris: Surely that's alright...isn't it, Gregsy? Gregson: ......... 'Course, Your Ladyship! Anythin' you say, Your Ladyship! But please don't get your dainty hands dirty, will you? Iris: Don't worry. We wouldn't dream of touching anything, would we, Runo? Ryunosuke: (She really knows how to get what she wants...) After clearing all Converse options and examining green cloth on ground, device on ground, and large hole in glass in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower and clearing all Converse options and examining large machine in Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage: Gregson: Right, are you done here, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Sorry? Gregson: Isn't it about time you were leavin'? Or rather...it IS about time you were leavin'! That lot are here now. Iris: That lot? Gregson: The Forensic Investigation Team. They'll be givin' me the heave-ho in a minute, too. Iris: Oh dear. Poor Gregsy. Here! Have another cup of my special blend to cheer you up! Gregson: *Glug* *Glug glug glug* Aaah! That hit the spot! Yup, hits it every time! Ryunosuke: (Well, at least I've seen the scene with my own eyes. It looks like this is as far as we're going to get with our investigations here at least...) Iris: I've been thinking... Hurley might know something, mightn't he? Ryunosuke: About what? Iris: About Mr Reaper! Ryunosuke: ...! About what happened to Lord van Zieks, you mean? (Because it sounds like something very significant occurred after he graduated from university. Something that completely changed his life.) Maybe, but I have no idea where to find Mr Sholmes at the moment. He's in the middle of some big case, isn't he? Iris: Here, this is what you need! Ryunosuke: What's this?

(I don't see how it could be related to the case we're investigating here, but then... ...stranger things have happened. And when they happen, Mr Sholmes is usually at the heart of them.) Prosecutor's Office Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy 22nd October Madame Tusspells Museum of Waxworks Ryunosuke: Wh-What is this place? L-Look at all these t-terrifying scenes! But why are all the p-people so still? (Guillotines... Ruthless murderers... I know what I'll be dreaming about tonight.) Iris: They're all wax models. They're amazingly realistic, aren't they? What do you think, Runo? Shocked? Ryunosuke: W-W-WAX MODELS?! .........AAAAAAAAAGH! I, I read about d-dead bodies and wax once...in a m-magazine about strange phenomena. Depending on how c-c-corpses are kept after death, p-parts of them can turn to wax, apparently. It's c-called a...adi...adip... Adipocere! Iris: ...Stop talking about creepy things like that, Runo. You're scaring me. Anyway, adipocere doesn't form readily, you know. It's only in very specif- Ryunosuke: AAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Iris: What now? Ryunosuke: I've, I've just remembered something else I read, in another m-magazine about strange phenomena. There was an old lady - maybe a w-witch - who used to pour molten wax over c-corpses and put them on display. Iris: None of the exhibits in here are real. They're all entirely man-made replicas. Ryunosuke: They can't be! Do you really expect me to believe that? Just look at them! Iris: Oh! Ryunosuke: There's no way anybody could make models of people that are this realistic! And...they're all such gruesome scenes... .........Wait. Iris: What is it? Ryunosuke: Oh...no... (I must be seeing things...) Ryunosuke: It's...it's... ...the great detective, Mr Herlock Sholmes! (Mr Sholmes has his own wax statue in here? Really?) Iris: Well he is world-famous, after all! Ryunosuke: It's an uncanny resemblance, isn't it? It makes my skin crawl to look at it... Iris: I know! But look, Runo. You can kick this Hurley, and he doesn't move a muscle! Ryunosuke: You can't go around kicking the exhibits, Iris! .........Wait. It, it just moved, I'm sure. And not just a little bit, either! Iris: Hm? Really? Did it? Ryunosuke: And look closely... ...there are beads of sweat on the face...of this waxwork... model... ......... Ryunosuke: ......... Sh-Shall we move on, Iris? ...Over there, look! There's a great murder scene to enjoy! Much more appealing. Sholmes: Sholmes: My dear fellow! I take exception to your recoiling in such a manner, as if you've seen something truly abhorrent! Ryunosuke: Mr...Mr Sholmes! (I knew it!) Sholmes: Iris, what possessed you?! I strictly forbade you from divulging my temporary waxwork secret to Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: Temporary waxwork? What do you mean? Sholmes: And that kick! Could you not have exercised a little more restraint? You winded me! Iris: But Runo has something he needs to ask you. Sholmes: Ah...a question? Iris: And I thought you'd probably be getting bored, too. So here we are! Sholmes: Hm... Well, I can't deny that your timing was impeccable. A mere two minutes more being stationary like that... ...and my great brain, upon which all my success has been built, would have turned to wax! Ryunosuke: ...Thank goodness we arrived in time. Sholmes: Indeed. In many ways, the pair of you just saved the world from an unimaginable loss! Iris: Oh, Hurley! You do like to talk nonsense, don't you? Ryunosuke: (He could know something, it's true. About Lord van Zieks, and what happened in the past to change him.) Sholmes: Now that you're here, let's take our time. How can I be of assistance? For you're in luck. I'm suddenly quite taken with the idea of conversing! Ryunosuke: Oh...well, actually, I'm in quite a hurry. Sholmes: And if my eyes don't deceive me... ...I believe something is afoot within the walls of this very museum. A most fascinating case, if I'm not mistaken. Ryunosuke: Really? Sholmes: Moreover... ...I have a strong suspicion that it is related to the matter about which you've come to me now. Ryunosuke: (But...how could it be?) Sholmes: We shall speak again presently, my dear fellow. But for now, I must return to my work. Ryunosuke: (What, back to being a temporary waxwork exhibit?) Sholmes: ......... Well? What is it you'd like to ask me, then? Ryunosuke: Um. Actually, it's... It's about Lord van Zieks. Sholmes: Ah, our friend Mr Reaper. How did you find him? Well, I trust? And so I filled Mr Sholmes in about everything I'd learnt. About Lord van Zieks... About Professor Harebrayne... And about the strange coincidence that they had been at university together. Ryunosuke: So I'm wondering what it was that happened to make Lord van Zieks such a different person. Iris: I was sure that you'd know, Hurley. Sholmes: ......... Ryunosuke: You said there was something going on here in this exhibit hall before. That something was afoot. And that you believed it was related to what I wanted to ask you about. Sholmes: ......... Ryunosuke: Um, Mr Sholmes...? (He's suddenly clammed up.) Sholmes: Well, it seems we've reached the unavoida- ???: Greetings... Ryunosuke: Oh! Ah...hello. (Where did she appear from? And what's she wearing? Could she look any more mysterious?) ???: I hope...you are appreciating my museum? Ryunosuke: Sorry? Have we...? Mr Sholmes, do you know this- (Not again!) Tusspells: My apologies. I am Esmeralda Tusspells. This is my museum of waxwork. Ryunosuke: Wha... You... You're THE Madame Tusspells? Tusspells: Bien sûr. Though only twenty-six years young, I might add. Ryunosuke: ...Is that significant somehow? Tusspells: I'm a 'madame' in name only. It adds a certain...je ne sais quoi. Ryunosuke: Right... Tusspells: Firstly, I must apologise for my waxworks. Or rather, one waxwork in particular. Ryunosuke: (That'll be Mr Sholmes, then.) Tusspells: I was led to believe he was a great detective, but he seems...unable to settle. Next time you move from your designated exhibit...there WILL be toil and trouble. Iris: She sounds deadly serious. Ryunosuke: (That's a problem. How am I supposed to ask Mr Sholmes about Lord van Zieks now?) Iris: Let's not forget what Hurley said before. About something being afoot right here in the museum, I mean. Ryunosuke: Yes, I know, but... Iris: I'm so curious! I want to know what's happening here! Ryunosuke: (Haven't we got enough on our plate already?!) Ryunosuke: Um, I wonder...could I ask you something? Tusspells: Bien sûr... Ryunosuke: I'm just curious. Is anything going on in the museum at the moment. [sic] Some kind of incident, perhaps? Tusspells: ......... Whoever suggested such a thing to you? Ryunosuke: Oh, well, it was... ...your temporary waxwork over there who mentioned it to me a little- Oh! (He's disappeared!) ???: ...A wax model is a work of art. Not some tawdry object for trade. Ryunosuke: Ah! Th-There you are! Tusspells: Leaving the exhibit again when you should be working? ...Do you wish to be melted down? Sholmes: My dear Madame Tusspells, save your reprimands. There are more pressing concerns. The wax can wait. It's our ideas about your current problem we must throw into the melting pot instead! Tusspells: ...! Sholmes: Personally, I would advise you not to involve the police. Tusspells: Why ever not?! Ryunosuke: (She's turned as white as a sheet...) Sholmes: Because you have at your disposal a great detective, whose services you may employ for a mere fifty shillings. Though please be aware that I prefer- No, I insist upon payment in advance! Tusspells: ......... ...Very well. Let us see if the great detective is able to live up to his name, shall we? Sholmes: Before I engage my analytical processes, I must ask you to clarify something. What, pray, is behind the curtain? Tusspells: That is the Tusspells Special Exhibit. There is an extra charge to see it. Sholmes: Ah, the 'special' exhibit in the House of Horrors... It must depict a special killer then, I presume. Would you be so kind as to draw back the curtain, I wonder? Tusspells: Ah! Absolument non! There is nothing amiss behind there! Sholmes: Nothing amiss, madame? What about the arm protruding ominously from under the curtain? Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: I strongly encourage you to allow me to see what lies beyond, before the situation worsens. Tusspells: ......... Yes, very well. I will draw back the curtains. ...But only a soupçon. Sholmes: I must confess, I peeked behind the curtain earlier. The Tusspells Special Exhibit is a very bleak graveyard scene indeed. And yet somewhat surprisingly... ...the waxwork killer one would expect is nowhere to be seen. What does strike one, however... ...is the portly gentleman lying peacefully on his back on the floor. Ryunosuke: Well, well then perhaps, Mr Sholmes... ...that man on the floor is the ruthless killer himself! Sholmes: I'm afraid not, my dear fellow. He's a perfectly ordinary London gentleman. Not even a waxwork, in fact. Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: As skilfully made as these waxworks are, they are always distinguishable from real humans. So, allow me to present my two conclusions. The first... ...is that a sizeable business transaction has been taking place in this special exhibit. Tusspells: Why...? Why would you say that? Sholmes: And the second... ...is that the aforementioned transaction is linked to a serious crime! Tusspells: AAAAAAH! Ryunosuke: (She looks as pale as candle wax...) Tusspells: I, I don't understand... Sholmes: So, Madame Tusspells, as you've agreed to my fee... ...you shall now have the pleasure of seeing this famously great detective - and temporary exhibit - at work. The Great Deduction The game is afoot! Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Sholmes: To begin with, we must ask ourselves what exactly is afoot here in this museum? The answer is revealed by the bundle of banknotes protruding so helpfully from your bag. In my estimation, some...two hundred pounds. Tusspells: That, that is all my own money! Sholmes: So what does this large sum of money reveal? Ah, not as much as the involuntary glance you cast, it would seem, Madame Tusspells. Yes, the answer lies where your eyes now fall. The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice! 'Waxwork for sale'? Your business has hit hard times, it would seem. In short... ...you sold the infamous killer - the centrepiece of your special exhibit - for the sum of two hundred pounds! Tusspells: Nooooooooon! Sholmes: Now...let us explore the next curiosity with which we are presented. Who is the portly gentleman stretched out so peacefully on the floor? Tusspells: ......... Sholmes: It would appear the man has suffered a severe shock. The cause of which...is clearly known to you. Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: Unfortunately, madame, keeping secrets does not appear to be your forte. What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds! It would appear that you twisted this gentleman around your little finger most effectively. Tusspells: What are you suggesting?! Sholmes: He rashly agreed to purchase the waxwork for the sum of two hundred pounds. Only when he came to hand the money over, did it occur to him what an extortionate amount he was paying. But the money was no longer in his hands. And the result? The scene we see before us. He collapsed in shock. Yes, the killer in this special exhibit fetched a killer price! We can only pray that the gentleman's dreams are not plagued with regret... Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Conclusion Sold for cash Topic 2 Waxwork Location Sholmes: The question that arises then, is what has become of the waxwork that changed hands? Let us consider that problem for a moment. Tusspells: You, you cannot possibly... Sholmes: What immediately strikes me about this conundrum, is the young man standing over there. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief. Such as is worn by policemen as a secret sign to fellow members of the force that a crime is being perpetrated. Yes, this young man is an undercover policeman, currently investigating this museum. I know him well, in fact. It's Sergeant John Clay. Tusspells: What are you talking about? Sholmes: The man's quite a celebrity. He received triple accolades at last year's policing awards. Tusspells: But... Sholmes: Next we turn our attention to the old man sat before him with the particularly unsightly visage. I've been watching closely and he hasn't moved a muscle. Almost, in fact...as if he were a waxwork. Tusspells: Ah! But, but you... Sholmes: Your reaction only confirms my suspicions, madame. I noticed it at once, of course... Observe! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag! 'Thruppence'...? A tragically low price, you might say. Though perhaps the going rate for ageing waxworks riddled with cracks. And yet you sold it to the portly gentleman for an exorbitant two hundred pounds! The sort of plucky behaviour that's sure to attract the attention of Scotland Yard... Isn't that so, madame? Tusspells: I, I do not... Sholmes: Yes, the waxwork you sold has already been seized by the police and remains in their custody as we speak! The old man must be reunited with his grave in the special exhibit, and not a moment too soon! Topic 2 Waxwork Location Conclusion Discovered already Sholmes: Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this horrifying puzzle! Ryunosuke: ......... Iris: ......... Tusspells: ......... Sholmes: I see I've stunned you all into silence. Iris: You have, Hurley, you have. And you've obviously upset this young lady in the process. Her cauldron looks awfully hot... Ryunosuke: Um...if I could just bring up one point, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: Ah! The notorious Naruhodo 'one point'! I'm all ears, my dear fellow! Ryunosuke: According to your deduction, then, the special exhibit featured this old policeman. So...that would mean that he's the particularly ruthless murderer, wouldn't it? Sholmes: ......... The killer policeman, Ottermole. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: It was a mysterious series of murders that rattled the capital only last year. The police rushed to the scene every time, only to find the culprit had disappeared into the aether. Iris: And it turned out the culprit was a policeman himself! A senior officer by the name of Ottermole! Ryunosuke: So you mean that's who the sinister-looking old man there is supposed to be? Sholmes: Indeed. It is a particularly grim face, is it not? Unforgettable, in fact. Yes, I remember that odious countenance only too well. Ryunosuke: But is two hundred pounds a lot of money for a wax model? Sholmes: It would be enough to afford one of the latest steam carriages, if that puts things in perspective? Ryunosuke: S-So...it is quite a lot then. Tusspells: ......... Is there anything else you wish to add? Before I melt you down. Ryunosuke: (That bubbling wax is looking more and more ominous...) Iris: Ugh...the smell of all that molten wax is starting to worry me. Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes did more or less just accuse her to her face, so... I think I might have to call on your assistance here, Iris, if that's alright? To make some minor corrections to the great detective's great deductions... Iris: Of course it's alright! We'll soon set things straight! Ryunosuke: Well...let's get started then, shall we? Before Madame Tusspells vents her anger! Sholmes: Just what I was waiting to hear, my dear fellow! So, Madame Tusspells, in accordance with our agreement... ...you shall now have the pleasure of seeing this famously great detective - and temporary exhibit - at work. Course Correction Hold it, Mr Sholmes! Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Conclusion Sold for cash Sholmes: To begin with, we must ask ourselves what exactly is afoot here in this museum? The answer is revealed by the bundle of banknotes protruding so helpfully from your bag. In my estimation, some...two hundred pounds. Tusspells: That, that is all my own money! Sholmes: So what does this large sum of money reveal? Ah, not as much as the involuntary glance you cast, it would seem, Madame Tusspells. Yes, the answer lies where your eyes now fall. The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice! Ryunosuke: She definitely looked in this direction, it's true. Iris: But I'm not sure she'd sell any of her waxworks, even for two hundred pounds. Ryunosuke: Oh? Iris: She must pour her heart and soul into making them, don't you think? Over and above the wax. If it were me, I wouldn't sell them for anything. Ryunosuke: ......... (For that much money, I would! ...But it sounds like that makes me a bad person.) W-Well anyway... ...I wonder if the two hundred pounds could have some other significance. Iris: Let's follow that furtive glance again and see if there's anything else that could explain it! The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice! Iris: Judging by appearances... ...this man and the two hundred pounds are in no way related at all. Ryunosuke: (The poor man was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, it seems...) But there's no doubt that Madame Tusspells did react to what Mr Sholmes said. The way she automatically looked over this way must tell us something, I'm sure. Iris: ...Then let's have more of a look around! Ryunosuke: The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that ransom note! Sholmes: Quite so. And we must congratulate these criminals on their inventiveness, abducting a waxwork. Tusspells: Agh! Sholmes: Two hundred pounds is no small ransom fee. Yet you clearly intend to pay it. Tusspells: The model in question has...special importance. So I put together all the money I have... Sholmes: In summary, then! The two hundred pounds you have in your handbag...is ransom money! Now...let us explore the next curiosity with which we are presented. Who is the portly gentleman stretched out so peacefully on the floor? Tusspells: ......... Sholmes: It would appear the man has suffered a severe shock. The cause of which...is clearly known to you. Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: Unfortunately, madame, keeping secrets does not appear to be your forte. What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds! Ryunosuke: So if the waxwork was kidnapped, where does that leave us in terms of who this man is? Iris: We could just ask him when he comes around. Ryunosuke: ...I think the point of this exercise is to understand the beauty of the deduction process, Iris. Iris: Yes, you're right. Hurley's trying so hard, we mustn't let him down. Ryunosuke: Well, there's little doubt that he suffered a shock. That much seems clear. But in that case, what's Madame Tusspells trying to hide? Let's have a closer look around... What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds! Ryunosuke: It must have been a considerable blow to have knocked the man unconscious. Iris: Yes, he looks like a very sturdy man, doesn't he? Ooh! Perhaps he was struck on the back of the head with something hard?! Ryunosuke: ...Don't sound so excited about it, Iris. (Whatever did leave the man out cold like that, it must have been quite something...) Ryunosuke: What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the waxwork hand! Sholmes: Indeed. With a solid waxwork limb, one could deliver a very substantial blow. Tusspells: How, how could you...? Ryunosuke: The hand protruding from the bottom of your cape... It ought to be a right hand, but closer inspection reveals that in fact, it's a left hand. Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: And somewhat masculine as well. In other words, it does not belong to you, madame. It is the hand of a waxwork model! Tusspells: KYAAAAAAH! Some of the visitors to my museum can be...troublesome. They meddle with the exhibits and cause damage. Ryunosuke: So you mean, that arm...? Tusspells: Yes. This gentleman saw fit to try to remove it as a souvenir. Sholmes: Hm, no small keepsake. Ryunosuke: Like taking a whole branch of a cherry tree when you go to view the blossoms... Tusspells: I am afraid I had to teach the man a lesson. Ryunosuke: You confronted the man and tried to take the arm back. Sholmes: And the result? The scene we see before us. He was knocked unconscious. A point we may need to revisit later. But for the time being, we have our conclusion: Yes, the killer in this special exhibit has been kidnapped! Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Conclusion Sold for cash Kidnapped! Solved Topic 2 Waxwork Location Conclusion Discovered already Sholmes: The question that arises then, is what has become of the waxwork that changed hands? Let us consider that problem for a moment. Tusspells: You, you cannot possibly... Sholmes: What immediately strikes me about this conundrum, is the young man standing over there. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief. Ryunosuke: According to Mr Sholmes... ...the yellow neckerchief is a sign to other policemen that some crime is underway. Iris: A way of communicating with his colleagues without revealing his identity, yes. It's a secret that's closely guarded by Scotland Yard. Ryunosuke: ...That Mr Sholmes didn't hesitate to give away. Iris: Well, uncovering secrets is in any true detective's nature, of course. Ryunosuke: Right... Anyway, judging from Madame Tusspells's reaction to Mr Sholmes's deduction... ...I think perhaps we might not have identified the man quite correctly. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief. Ryunosuke: According to Mr Sholmes, this young gentleman is actually a policeman in plain clothes. And the secret scarf sign appears to back that idea up. It does seem plausible. Iris: But Madame Tusspells's reaction was strange. Which must mean... Ryunosuke: ...That we haven't got to the bottom of who or what this man really is yet. Ryunosuke: Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his shoulder stub. Sholmes: No such boneless human walks this earth. Of that, I can assure you. In other words, the man standing here - the young Sergeant John Clay... ...is in fact, defying all odds, a waxwork model! Ryunosuke: I seem to remember it was you who concluded he was a real person in the first place, Mr Sholmes. Tusspells: He has become quite a celebrity in London, being the winner of no less than three policing awards last year. I simply had to make a model of the man. Sholmes: Naturally! What other explanation could there be? Ryunosuke: And it was this detective's arm that was pulled off by the man on the floor in the special exhibit, wasn't it? Sholmes: Next we turn our attention to the old man sat before him with the particularly unsightly visage. I've been watching closely and he hasn't moved a muscle. Almost, in fact...as if he were a waxwork. Tusspells: Ah! But, but you... Sholmes: Your reaction only confirms my suspicions, madame. I noticed it at once, of course... Observe! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag! Ryunosuke: A killer policeman...called Ottermole, was it? Was he well known? Iris: It was all over the papers last year. But I can't say I know what he looks like. It's a very low price, though. Thruppence isn't much money. Ryunosuke: (Only enough for a few measly hours of gas in Mr Garrideb's delightful lodgings, in fact...) So this is the special killer taken from the special exhibit...is it? The waxwork that somebody stole from the museum and tried to ransom for two hundred pounds... ...is this crusty old killer policeman Ottermole? Really? Iris: Perhaps we should have a good look around again and see if another idea crops up! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag! Iris: If we just poured a little bit of molten wax on him, we'd soon find out if he was real or not. Ryunosuke: Yes...you never know, there may be another way. We've already come this far, so maybe we should stick to logical deductions, don't you think? Iris: Alright, if that's the way you want to do it, then we should examine him in more detail. Ryunosuke: (If anyone saw, they'd think we were obsessed with the elderly...) Ryunosuke: The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious twitch! Sholmes: Even the most realistic waxworks do not exhibit a twitch. In other words, this splendid old man is in fact a genuine member of Scotland Yard! Ryunosuke: ...Slight shift in your choice of adjectives, then... Sholmes: And there you have it! Well, Madame Tusspells? Tusspells: Well what? It was me who contacted the police and demanded that someone come in the first place. He is clearly fatigued. He is sound asleep. Ryunosuke: But then, what's this tag about showing a price of three pence? Sholmes: No doubt the price tag of the muffler, which the old bobby purchased recently at a local market. And I presume you've observed the scarf tied around his arm? Does that not strike you, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Yes! The secret sign used by detectives to show that some criminal activity is currently underway. Tusspells: Of course. Because, as you know, there has been just such criminal activity happening here. As you deduced from the very beginning, detective. Sholmes: So, it would seem that we finally arrive at the truth. Ryunosuke: The waxwork of the especially ruthless killer from the special exhibit has been kidnapped. Sholmes: And Scotland Yard are already investigating. But the model's whereabouts remain a mystery. Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this horrifying puzzle! Topic 2 Waxwork Location Conclusion Discovered already Still a mystery! Solved Deduction CompleteElementary! Tusspells: All sorts of people visit my museum here. Men and women, young and old. Sometimes they drop in just for a short time on their way back from the pub. I welcome them all. But if anyone tries to damage my exhibits... I do not take it lightly. Anyway... ...your great deduction was even more enchanting than I had been led to believe. Sholmes: It was a pleasure, my dear madame. I'm gratified that you enjoyed the spectacle. And as for your 'rough customer', I've no doubt he'll regain consciousness shortly and return home. What concerns me more... ...is the waxwork from the special display...if it was indeed genuinely abducted? Tusspells: ......... Yes. Tragically, it was... Sholmes: Then I would ask you to recount to us the events surrounding the stolen waxwork. In as much detail as possible, if you please. Tusspells: ...Very well. But after I have told you what I know, I must insist that you return to your work. Sholmes: ......... The talents of a great detective could be put to better use, I feel, but as you wish... Tusspells: It was a series of gruesome murders that had all of London gripped in terror a decade ago. After five victims were killed, the man was arrested, and put to death. Sholmes: And now he's immortalised here in wax for all Londoners to admire and enjoy! Though of course, he happens to be absent at present, on account of the abduction. Ryunosuke: But I don't understand. How is all this related to Lord van Zieks? Sholmes: ......... You must first understand, my dear fellow, why it is that the Professor earnt such infamy. It was due to the victims he chose. Some of Whitehall's finest. Iris: What do you mean, Hurley? Sholmes: Those murdered by the Professor were some of the highest members of the British aristocracy. Members of the nobility. Even royalty. It sent shockwaves through the country's administration. Ryunosuke: Members of the... Ah! Wait! Of course! What Professor Harebrayne said! Lord van Zieks is from a family with noble blood! Iris: Oh gosh! Sholmes: It was the fifth victim that led to the Professor's arrest. The last of the killer's prey was a young noble by the name of... ...Klint van Zieks. Ryunosuke: No! I don't believe it! Van Zieks?! Sholmes: I'm sure you can piece together the rest for yourself. In the wake of his older brother's murder, the young Barok pursued a career as a prosecutor. And eventually...became the Reaper we know today. Ryunosuke: ......... I had no idea Lord van Zieks had such a tragic past... Sholmes: Well, I'm afraid that's all I can say on the matter. For the time being at least. After all, I have work to do... ...as a waxwork exhibit. Tusspells: I am afraid I shall have to excuse myself as well. Ryunosuke: Oh, yes, of course. It's, it's been a pleasure. Thank you. ???: ...Well, none of the predicted scenarios I've been analysing involved you coming to visit me here. Harebrayne: It's been too long, it really has. I'm delighted to see you, Barok. Van Zieks: It's been ten years. And here we are, meeting in a prison of all places. Harebrayne: I can't forgive myself for what happened to Mr Asman! I just can't! I, I still can't believe it could happen... Van Zieks: ......... Tomorrow the court will decide. Harebrayne: Yes! I have a young Eastern man acting for my defence. He seems reliable enough, though. It, it was an accident. A terrible accident. He, he, he assures me he can prove it! Van Zieks: I must warn you... Harebrayne: Oh, I know, I know! I've heard already. You're going to be prosecuting, aren't you? Van Zieks: ...Yes. Harebrayne: ......... Since I returned to England, I've heard lots of stories. Barok, are you really...? Van Zieks: What? Harebrayne: ......... Never mind. I know that you have my best interests at heart. Van Zieks: My friend is on trial. ...I wouldn't entrust it to anybody else. Harebrayne: Of course. I fully understand. Thank you, Barok. Van Zieks: Until tomorrow, then. I'll see you in court. To be continued...23rd October, 8:52 a.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber Ryunosuke: (I can't believe it's been six months since I was last allowed to work in court. And now here I am, back at the Old Bailey...) Harebrayne: Ah! M-Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: Good morning, Professor Harebrayne. Harebrayne: I, I don't understand! It doesn't make any sense! The atmospheric pressure in here is off the charts! I've never felt anything like it! It's, it's crushing me! Ryunosuke: I feel it every time I'm here. That...gravity. Harebrayne: Well, this is Britain's highest court... But are you telling me it's filled with some kind of device that can actually control air pressure?! Ryunosuke: ......... I think it's probably all in the mind. Harebrayne: Ah. Yes, well...you won't let me down, will you, Mr Naruhodo? I'm counting on you in today's trial...to save my life! To save the secret of my super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine from being made public! Ryunosuke: Yes, I understand. (I know what I have to do. I have to establish that the explosion two days ago was nothing more than an unfortunate accident.) Harebrayne: Well, I'm sure there's nothing to worry about, really. Justice will prevail! ???: My commiserations, Mr Naruhodo. You appear to have been lumbered with a most tiresome case here. Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes! I didn't expect to see you here. Iris: That was very mean, Runo, leaving me alone at home with Hurley. It took me at least an hour to wake him! Harebrayne: Ah... Oh... Ah... Is it...? Are you...? HEEEEEERLOCK SHOOOOOOLMES?! Sholmes: Indeed, sir. I am he. Heeeeeerlock Shoooooolmes. Harebrayne: Oh, I've heard all about your exploits, even whilst living in Germany. Iris: Ah yes. Randst Magazine is on sale in Germany, too. Harebrayne: This month's instalment was sublime! Your deduction in 'The Adventure of Silver Blaze' was wonderful! Sholmes: Ah yes, a memorable case indeed. It concerned a snake, I seem to recall. Iris: No, that was 'The Speckled Band.' Ryunosuke: Well, thank you for coming. I do appreciate your support. Sholmes: I'm sorry to disappoint you, my dear fellow, but I'm afraid I can't stay. Ryunosuke: Oh. Sholmes: I have urgent business at Madame Tusspells. Ryunosuke: You mean...your waxwork job? Sholmes: No no, the waxwork abduction, of course. Madame has engaged my services. Ryunosuke: Ah, so you're trying to get to the bottom of that ransom note, are you? Sholmes: The week's wages depend on it! ...As does the safe return of the waxwork, naturally. As such, I intend to give it my undivided attention. Ryunosuke: Oh, well, never mind then. I understand. Sholmes: Of course, with my skills of observation and reasoning, resolving the matter will be as easy as proverbial pie. I shall return forthwith. For until I solve the case, I shall have no money to afford a pie of any description. Iris: Ooh, then you must absolutely give it your full attention, Hurley! Sholmes: Quite, Iris, quite. But life is riddled with irony, you know. Whenever I give something my full attention, I have a quite insatiable desire for a pie. One of the universe's intractable mysteries, you might say. Harebrayne: Oh yes! Quite! Definitely! Absolutely! I totally understand! Ryunosuke: (...Is someone a little starstruck?) Sholmes: I wish you the very best of luck, Professor Harebrayne. Harebrayne: Oh! Ah! Ooh! Why, thank you! Sholmes: Before I depart, Mr Naruhodo...a word in your ear, if you please? Ryunosuke: ...? What's this about? Sholmes: As you have remarkably little grounding in science, I feel I ought to inform you... As compelling as this 'super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis' hypothesis may be... ...a practical implementation, such as was attempted by the professor at the Great Exhibition, is quite impossible. Ryunosuke: But, but the professor said the demonstration was a success! Sholmes: Yes, it would appear that he fervently believes it was. Iris: I've read Professor Bunnybrain's paper about it, too, Runo. And I have to say... ...I'm sure it can't be done. It could barely be done theoretically, let alone practically. Ryunosuke: (So he's completely barking up the wrong tree?) But how could an experiment that had no possibility of succeeding in fact succeed? That's contradictory. Sholmes: And it's that contradiction that will be at the heart of the trial, I've no doubt. Ryunosuke: (What's that supposed to mean?) Sholmes: Now, I must hurry along. I wish you the best of luck, my dear fellow. Iris: See you later, Hurley! Well, it looks like you're on your own today, Runo. But chin up! You can do it! Ryunosuke: Oh! What about you, Iris? Iris: Ah, no, I'm afraid I can't help. I have something I need to do. Ryunosuke: ...I see. Iris: Hehe! It's going to be a big surprise for you when you find out what it is! Ryunosuke: Haah... (That sounds ominous...) Bailiff: Counsel for the Defence! And the defendant! Court is about to be in session. Make your way into the courtroom at once! Ryunosuke: We're on our way! (An experiment that the laws of science say can't possibly succeed... ...and a scientist who's convinced that it did. That's the riddle you have to unlock here, Ryunosuke! That's the key to this case!) 23rd October, 9:10 a.m. The Old Bailey Courtroom Judge: In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session. We are sitting today for the public trial of Professor Albert Harebrayne. I now call upon the counsels for the prosecution and defence to declare their willingness to proceed. Van Zieks: The prosecution is ready. Ryunosuke: The defence is... The defence is ready, My Lord! ......... (I'm six months out of practice. And what's more... ...I'm without Susato-san today.) ......... (Ugh... Is it just my imagination, or does the air in here feel even more oppressive than usual?) Judge: So... ...I must say I recollect the victim of this case all too well. Mr Odie Asman. Van Zieks: Mr Asman was well known as a financier...though that was merely a front for his diverse criminal activities. Judge: It was only a month ago that the man appeared in court prosecuted by you, Lord van Zieks. But the jury unanimously found him not guilty. Ryunosuke: (Because every member of the jury had been bribed, by the sound of it. These powerful London criminals are prepared to go to extreme lengths to keep their freedom.) Judge: But two days ago, on 21st October, Mr Asman met his end. The work of the Reaper, was it? Van Zieks: ......... If that is how Your Lordship would describe divine retribution... But the fact remains that Mr Asman's death... ...was a direct result of the actions of the accused, Professor Harebrayne. Judge: Very well, then. Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... You have been selected at random to represent the will of the people. Are the six of you ready to fulfil your societal duty? Juror No. 1: I'm most gratified to have been selected to carry out this important civic duty, My Lord. Juror No. 2: To have a man's fate in the palm of one's hand... Oh gosh! Oh golly! It sends shivers down my spine. Juror No. 3: Science experiments, magic, conjuring tricks, courtroom trials... All are nothing more than performances. Juror No. 4: Any spurious scholar that defiles the reputation of science deserves to hang! Juror No. 5: Um, we 'ave to listen to what's said on both sides 'the fence, and um...then settle on one... That's it, isn't it? Juror No. 6: ......... Wasn't like this in my day! Wasn't like this at all! Ryunosuke: ......... (That's...that's... ...the police killer Ottermole look-alike...again. And he's as exhausted as ever, it seems.) Judge: Now, as I'm sure you are all aware... ...the incident we are here to judge today tragically took place at the Great Exhibition, shortly after its opening. Van Zieks: Though the death toll could have been far worse. With the exception of the victim, no one was killed. Nevertheless, the dream of the science being exhibited rapidly turned into a nightmare for the spectators. Judge: A tragic turn of events. And as such, the eyes of all London- No, of the whole world will be on this trial. It is our duty to reach a swift and just conclusion, I feel. So...your opening statement please, Lord van Zieks. Van Zieks: At the heart of this incident... ...is technology never before demonstrated anywhere in the world. Judge: One of science's latest developments, I take it? The government is keen to capitalise on the Great Exhibition to improve Britain's technological advantage. Van Zieks: The technology being demonstrated by the accused was described as 'super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis'. Judge: Good Lord! Ryunosuke: It's designed to 'disassemble' human subjects using extremely high-voltage electricity... ...and 'beam' them instantly to another location where they are subsequently reassembled. Judge: Is...is such a thing even within the realms of possibility? Juror No. 1: Well I don't believe it, that's for sure. Juror No. 2: Disassembling people with electricity? My goodness! How shocking! Juror No. 4: Hah! The whole idea is absurd! The hypothesis would never stand up to scrutiny! Judge: Sir, I believe you are a fellow of the Royal Society, are you not? An expert in your field? Juror No. 4: I am, and my word on the matter can be considered final. Instantaneous kinesis is poppycock! Ryunosuke: (So this expert and Mr Sholmes are in agreement. It's impossible...) Judge: What is the prosecution's view on the matter? Van Zieks: ......... The prosecution would assert... ...that the accused's instantaneous kinesis demonstration was a success. Ryunosuke: What?! Juror No. 4: What rot! Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Van Zieks: The professor's hypothesis is currently under investigation by the British government. If it is deemed to have merit, a substantial research grant would be made available. The accused made use of the invention built on his new hypothesis to take Mr Asman's life... ...in order to be the sole benefactor of the grant. Ryunosuke: But, but... Van Zieks: This disastrous demonstration was no accident. It was carefully designed from the outset to end the life of the victim. Judge: Thank you, Lord van Zieks. The prosecution's stance is clear. But you will now bring forth witnesses to substantiate your claims. Van Zieks: ...Gladly, My Lord. Bailiff! Show the first witnesses to the stand! Van Zieks: Witnesses, state your names and occupations for the court. Gregson: Yes, sir! Tobias Gregson, Detective Inspector at Scotland Yard's homicide division. I was on duty at the demonstration on the day in question and in charge of the followin' investigation. Harebrayne: ......... Albert Harebrayne! S-S-Scientist! Van Zieks: You were born in England, but have been carrying out research in Germany in recent years. Correct? Harebrayne: Yes. Yes, that's right. After graduating from university here in Britain, I went to work in Germany...and made an amazing discovery! Which is what brought me back! I had to demonstrate my incredible hypothesis at the Great Exhibition! Gregson: What you demonstrated was incredible alright. An incredible explosion! Harebrayne: But the science! The science was a success! The instantaneous kinesis worked! E-Everyone saw it! They must have done! Yes, there was the terrible accident, but... ...the demonstration of my hypothesis was a success! Gregson: Well, that much is undeniable. As shown in this photograph taken by the Forensic Investigation Team. Judge: This was taken inside the Crystal Tower, I take it? The centrepiece of the exhibition, no less. Gregson: That's right, My Lord. Seems the victim rammed straight into it. Judge: Hm, I see... Very well, submit the photograph as evidence. The photograph of the victim has been entered into the Court Record. Gregson: As the court's heard, the victim of the incident was Mr Odie Asman. There have been a number of allegations made against the man, but puttin' them aside for the time bein'... ...he was the man who financed the research for the experiment and the demonstration itself. Judge: I see. So to summarise the situation... ...the defendant is accused of taking the life of the man who funded his work. Would that be correct? Gregson: Exactly. Ryunosuke: But couldn't it be... ...that the explosion was caused by some malfunction in the apparatus used for the demonstration? Harebrayne: That's right! That must be it! My splendid machine... My poor, splendid machine... Gregson: You saw it yesterday, didn't you? We can't even examine the wreckage thanks to the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act. Harebrayne: WHAAAAAAAAAT?! The wreckage?! THE WRECKAGE?! Judge: But that being the case, how can the facts be established? How can it possibly be determined whether this was an accident or a deliberate and malicious act? Van Zieks: Extremely simply, My Lord. Judge: I beg your pardon? Van Zieks: Isn't that right, witness? Harebrayne: Wha...? Sorry? ME?! Van Zieks: No. Your neighbour. Gregson: Yes, sir! It was murder, plain and simple. Anyone could state that with complete certainty. Ryunosuke: What?! (How can he possibly think that?) Judge: Thank you, Inspector. I think we had better proceed to formal testimony. You will explain to the court on what grounds you claim this experiment to have been a front for murder! Witness Testimony - A Front for Murder - Gregson: The corpse that went crashin' through the Crystal Tower had a broken neck. Harebrayne: I, I made a minor miscalculation in the angle of the beam projection, that's all! That was my mistake! Gregson: But the post-mortem examination revealed another injury. A fatal wound. There was a lesion in his chest where he'd clearly been stabbed by somethin' sharp right in the heart! So the victim was killed before he went anywhere. And this fella's the only one who could have done it! Judge: ......... An extraordinary business... In addition to suffering a broken neck, the victim was stabbed in the heart? Ryunosuke: (Information I would really like to have heard from someone other than the judge...) Gregson: The coroner says death would have been all but instant from a wound like that. Van Zieks: You could say, in fact... ...that the victim was killed twice by the accused. Harebrayne: No, no and no! That couldn't be further from the truth! Gregson: I have here the experiment plan document that was submitted to the security team. The victim stood himself inside somethin' called 'the birdcage', ready to be 'beamed' instantly... ...to the second level of the Crystal Tower, about twenty-five yards away. Van Zieks: The experiment did not go according to plan, however. As the machine was put into operation, there was a large explosion. The blast caused the beam transmitter to point higher than intended. Accordingly, the kinesis resulted in the birdcage materialising in mid-air... ...from where it subsequently fell, crashing through the glass of the Crystal Tower's large round window. Judge: My word... One assumes the victim's neck was broken upon impact with the tower, then? Harebrayne: I'm, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean for this to happen! The machine was just too powerful! But honestly! Really! I swear! It was just an accident! A terrible accident! Van Zieks: Unfortunately, that excuse can't save you. Gregson: No, not considerin' the sharp murder weapon that pierced the victim's heart. Harebrayne: M-Murder weapon?! What are you saying?! Van Zieks: This is the autopsy report submitted by the coroner. The prosecution would like it entered into the Court Record. Judge: Your request is granted, Counsel. The autopsy report has been entered into the Court Record. Juror No. 4: I was there in person, you know. I saw the whole ludicrous performance. And the only other person on the stage with Mr Asman was that disgraceful excuse for a scientist! Juror No. 2: Then really, by all accounts it must have been him. Juror No. 1: Hmph. Hard to think otherwise, really. Judge: Very well. Counsel for the Defence...proceed with the cross-examination, please. Ryunosuke: Oh, yes, My Lord! (I need to focus here... It's been a while!) Cross-Examination - A Front for Murder - Gregson: The corpse that went crashin' through the Crystal Tower had a broken neck. Harebrayne: I, I made a minor miscalculation in the angle of the beam projection, that's all! That was my mistake! Gregson: But the post-mortem examination revealed another injury. A fatal wound. Gregson: There was a lesion in his chest where he'd clearly been stabbed by somethin' sharp right in the heart! Gregson: So the victim was killed before he went anywhere. And this fella's the only one who could have done it! Gregson: The weapon the victim was stabbed with must have been left in his body whilst he was beamed through the air! Ryunosuke: (So that's all the testimony I have to work with... I had no idea the victim had been stabbed. That changes everything... Did van Zieks keep that to himself until now on purpose, to gain the advantage? Oh well...I suppose all I can do is press these witnesses for as much new information as possible.) Ryunosuke: You say that while the weapon remains in the body, there's very little bleeding... Is that unequivocal? Gregson: Look, there was no blood on the experimentation stage, even though that's where the fellow was stabbed. The only explanation for that is if the screwdriver was still in his body, stoppin' any heavy bleedin'. Van Zieks: It's common medical knowledge, my learned friend. Even on your side of the world. Ryunosuke: ......... Yes, but about this screwdriver... The thing is, we actually saw it at the scene ourselves. On the experimentation stage. Van Zieks: What? Ryunosuke: It was on the floor by the wreckage of the machine, poking through a metal grille. I went to pick it up, but the detective here stopped me. Isn't that right, Inspector Gregson? Gregson: Ah, well, um... Now you come to mention it, yes... Van Zieks: Inspector, are we to understand that you permitted the defence counsel to investigate? That you contravened the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act? Gregson: Eh? No! Not at all! I, I wouldn't do that! I just let him look, nothin' more! I was very clear he wasn't to touch a thing! Ryunosuke: Yes, that's true. This screwdriver was in plain sight on the stage. But it shouldn't have been, should it? Gregson: Wh-What are you gettin' at? Ryunosuke: If this tool had still been in the victim's body when the victim was beamed away by the machine... ...then it shouldn't have still been on the stage. Gregson: Ah! Ryunosuke: That's right! It should have been beamed across to the Crystal Tower along with Mr Asman... ...and been found still lodged in the victim's chest! Gregson: Ugh... UWAAAAAAAAAGH! Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! ...How do you explain this, Inspector? Gregson: I...well...um... I don't... Ryunosuke: It looks as though everything that the victim had on his person moved with him when he was 'beamed'. If the screwdriver was still in his chest when the instantaneous kinesis occurred... ...obviously that should have been beamed to the destination as well! Gregson: You... Ryunosuke: (This is a strange situation... Even though people are saying that this instantaneous kinesis is a scientific impossibility... ...we're still basing arguments on the assumption that it did actually take place. Alright. Time to tighten the screws here...) My Lord! If the prosecution is unable to explain this inconsistency in its argument... ...we can only conclude that the testimony given in support cannot be relied upon! Van Zieks: ......... Ryunosuke: (Lord van Zieks is stumped!) ???: Judge: ...Do you have something to say, witness? Harebrayne: Yes...I knew it... It bears out... The equations hold... Mr Naruhodo! ...DON'T WORRY! Ryunosuke: ...About what?! Harebrayne: Without delving into the details, there is no inconsistency! Ryunosuke: What? Harebrayne: Even if Andrew had been lodged in Mr Asman's chest... ...my trusty tool wouldn't have moved. Andrew remaining on the stage is consistent with my calculations! Ryunosuke: Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAT?! Van Zieks: It would seem your illusions have been...shattered. Clearly we should hear the accused's explanation. ...Or should I say, this brilliant scientist's explanation? Judge: Hmmm... Ryunosuke: (Just when I'd found an inconsistency in the prosecution's argument... Scientists...) Judge: Very well! The defendant will testify again. Provide us with the scientific explanation as to why the inconsistency asserted by the defence fails to hold! Harebrayne: In the name of Apollo, I will, My Lord! Witness Testimony - The inconsistency Explained - Harebrayne: To be clear, I'm still at the stage of gathering data in my research. My hypothesis states the kinesis cannot transport metal, though. Hence the metal weapon would have stayed put. In other words, the point just raised by Mr Naruhodo isn't an inconsistency at all. Mr Asman was the patron of my research. Without him, my work wouldn't have been possible. Now I have a duty to protect the incredible machine that we built together! Ryunosuke: ......... Van Zieks: ......... Judge: ......... So, the thrust of your testimony, Professor, is...? Van Zieks: ...That based upon his hypothesis, metal objects cannot be moved by this method of instantaneous kinesis. Judge: In other words...? Van Zieks: In other words, since the screwdriver is made of metal, even if it remained lodged in the victim's chest... ...its subsequent discovery on the stage despite the victim being found elsewhere is not an inconsistency. Judge: And therefore...? Van Zieks: And therefore Professor Albert Harebrayne could still have been the killer. Harebrayne: My great hypothesis holds, you see! We, we had to make the cage used to contain the subject from wood for that very reason. Judge: I was not addressing you, witness! Ryunosuke: Um...Professor Harebrayne... Harebrayne: Yes? Ryunosuke: Whose side are you on here? Harebrayne: I don't take sides, Mr Naruhodo! No no no! My only interest lies in upholding my hypothesis! I'm a scientist, after all! Ryunosuke: ......... (Is he working for us or against us? It's very hard to tell...) Van Zieks: Let's see how you cross-examine this testimony, my Nipponese friend. Harebrayne: Yes, fire away, Mr Naruhodo! Cross-Examination - The Inconsistency Explained - Harebrayne: To be clear, I'm still at the stage of gathering data in my research. Harebrayne: My hypothesis states the kinesis cannot transport metal, though. Hence the metal weapon would have stayed put. Harebrayne: In other words, the point just raised by Mr Naruhodo isn't an inconsistency at all. Harebrayne: Mr Asman was the patron of my research. Without him, my work wouldn't have been possible. Harebrayne: Now I have a duty to protect the incredible machine that we built together! Ryunosuke: (That's the extent of the testimony then... Thank goodness for that. I don't want him doing any more damage. He's already basically proven that he could have been the culprit. But it seems as though all he really cares about is defending his hypothesis. Still, I wonder... What if his hypothesis is just fundamentally flawed?) Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne, you say that according to your hypothesis... ...nothing made of metal can be beamed by instantaneous kinesis using the machine you made. Is that right? Harebrayne: Yes, that's right. Spot on! Exactly correct! Ryunosuke: In that case...I'd ask you to have a look at this photograph that was taken at the scene. In particular, I'd like you to pay attention to the victim's face. You can clearly see that Mr Asman is wearing a pair of spectacles...with a metal rim. Harebrayne: What? Metal? No... Metal can't... That's not... M-Metal? NOOOOOOOOOOOO! Ryunosuke: We've already established that the proposed murder weapon, the screwdriver, was found on the stage. However, if your hypothesis correctly predicted that outcome... ...it should also have predicted...that the metal-rimmed spectacles would be found in the same place! Harebrayne: AAAAAAAAAAAAH! My hypothesis! MY HYPOTHESIIIIIIIIIS! Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne, this isn't easy for me to say... ...but your hypothesis...is clearly flawed! Harebrayne: UWAAAAAAAAAGH!!! Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Counsel, what is the implication of this? Ryunosuke: If, on the day in question, the alleged instantaneous kinesis never actually took place... ...then it's entirely possible that the victim was killed somewhere other than on the stage. And in that case...someone other than the defendant could have been the culprit! Harebrayne: But, but my hypothesis! My hypothesis is sound! I proved it that day! The experiment was a success! The experiment was proof of all my work! ???: Juror No. 4: If I could say something here, in my capacity as a fellow of the Royal Society... Judge: Yes, juror number four? Go ahead. Juror No. 4: As a man of science, there's one thing I simply cannot abide... And that's a fraud who PRETENDS to be a fellow man of science! Harebrayne: What? Wait! Great Scott! Are you suggesting my science is suspect?! Juror No. 4: It's just been disproved, hasn't it? In front of all of us. In other words, the whole demonstration was a complete nonsense from start to finish! Believe me, my fellow jurors, when I tell you that this man is a heel, a bounder and a fraud! Juror No. 1: I say the wreckage of that machine should be stripped down and thoroughly examined! Harebrayne: Nooo! Never! That machine is the essence of my entire hypothesis! It's protected by the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act! Juror No. 6: What the devil is that blasted act all about, eh? Who made up such a daft rule?! Ryunosuke: (I don't like the way this seems to be going... What's the best way for me to help the professor?) Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne has yet to perfect his invention! That would seem to be the case, yes. But even so... Van Zieks: Even so, what? Ryunosuke: Going to such trouble and expense to create a fake machine to display in public... He would have absolutely no reason to do such a thing! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: He had an obvious reason to do exactly that. For the research grant money. Ryunosuke: Ah! Juror No. 4: If the government was foolish enough to have deemed the man's ridiculous notion plausible... ...he and his conspirators would have received a handsome sum indeed. Harebrayne: C-Conspirators? Juror No. 2: What would be the value of such a grant? Ten pounds? Juror No. 4: You're an order of magnitude out, madam. Five hundred pounds a YEAR! Juror No. 5: Ooh arrrrrr! Ya could live 'andsome on that much for years! Juror No. 4: The Society's noticed an increase in bogus public demonstrations in the field of science recently. And plenty of scientists arguing with each other to get the largest slice of the funding cake. People's greed is plenty motive enough for murder, I assure you! Harebrayne: No no no! I haven't deceived anyone! Least of all the government! My hypothesis is sound! The science is sound! Please, you must believe me! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: No matter how unbelievable this hypothesis may seem to you, ladies and gentlemen... ...the fact remains that the victim was transported instantly to the Crystal Tower. Which means that the experiment...was a success. Harebrayne: Ah, Barok! Van Zieks: And therefore... ...the only person who could possibly have committed this murder...is the accused! Harebrayne: Ah. Barok... Ryunosuke: (Where is this heading? I have no idea...) Van Zieks: My Lord, if I may...? Judge: Yes, Lord van Zieks? Van Zieks: The prosecution would like to summon new witnesses to the stand. Judge: New witnesses? What would be the nature of their involvement? Van Zieks: They were spectators of the demonstration at the exhibition. Who were occupying special seats. Ryunosuke: Eyewitnesses? Judge: Very well, the court grants the prosecution's request. I should very much like to hear from eyewitnesses to the incident. Van Zieks: The prosecution's stance is clear. This experiment was no postiche. The accused killed the financier victim there on the public stage, before the very eyes of the spectators. Now, my learned friend... Ryunosuke: Oh! ...Yes? Van Zieks: It's time for you to make your own stance clear. Ryunosuke: (There's clearly a flaw in the professor's hypothesis. I can definitely see that. But where does that leave me...?) Judge: We shall take a short recess now. During which time, the prosecution will prepare its new witnesses to take the stand. Van Zieks: ...As you wish, My Lord. Judge: Good. In that case, court is adjourned for twenty minutes. To be continued... 23rd October, 10:44 a.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber Harebrayne: M-Mr Naruhodo... ...what on earth were you playing at just now? Or rather... ...WHAT ON EARTH WERE YOU PLAYING AT ALL ALONG?! MY HYPOTHESIS! MY AMAZING HYPOTHESIS! You've been picking holes in it from the start! Ryunosuke: Ah, sorry about that. Harebrayne: But you promised me! You, you said you'd prove that dratted explosion was an accident, not murder. You said you'd keep my precious invention from falling into anyone else's hands! But all you've done so far is try to undermine me! Ryunosuke: ......... Yes, I did make you a promise, you're right. I said that I'd believe in you and fight for your freedom to the very end. But I also told you I was no scientist. I don't understand your hypothesis. The fact is, there's an undeniable flaw in your logic, isn't there? Harebrayne: Ah! But! If I just run through some equations... Yes, you see! It's because my work is incomplete! Ryunosuke: Perhaps it is. Nevertheless...a man died as a consequence, didn't he? Harebrayne: Oh. OOOOOOOOOH NOOOOOOOOO! ......... You're right. You're so right. It's all my fault... And I have no right to blame you for my failures. I'm a disaster! Not just as a scientist...but as a human being! Ryunosuke: Well...that might be a little over the top. Harebrayne: And while we're on the subject... ...wh-what about Barok? He's being awful! Ryunosuke: Claiming his old university friend to be a murderer, you mean? Harebrayne: He's a disaster! Not just as a prosecutor...but as a human being! Oh! But no! Wait! He's the Reaper, isn't he? Perhaps he's not classified as Homo sapiens any more...? Ryunosuke: (...Glad that's cleared up...) ......... Can I double-check something with you? Harebrayne: Ah. Yes? What? Ryunosuke: The machine and demonstration you prepared... They were based entirely on your hypothesis, I presume? There was no...trickery involved? Harebrayne: ......... I drew the plans for the machine with my very own hands. Every line was painstakingly drawn with the firm belief that science is the only future. So yes, it's true that my hypothesis hasn't reach [sic] maturity yet, but please, Mr Naruhodo...you must believe in it. Ryunosuke: ......... Alright, Professor, I understand. Bailiff: Counsel! Defendant! The prosecution's witnesses are ready to take the stand. Court is about to be in session again. Make your way into the courtroom, please! Ryunosuke: (It all hinges on that demonstration. If the professor's hypothesis is sound as he claims... ...it leaves him as the only person who could possibly have killed the victim. But on the other hand, Mr Sholmes was adamant...) Sholmes: A practical implementation, such as was attempted by the professor at the Great Exhibition, is quite impossible. Ryunosuke: (So really, what should I be trying to prove here?) 23rd October, 11:00 a.m. The Old Bailey Courtroom Judge: In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby reconvene the proceedings of this court. Counsels for the defence and prosecution, are you ready for the new witnesses to testify? Van Zieks: The prosecution is ready, My Lord. Ryunosuke: As is the defence, My Lord. Judge: So, Lord van Zieks... ...I believe these next witnesses saw the demonstration on the day in question with their own eyes? Van Zieks: Indeed they did. And as luck would have it, one of them is a police detective. ...So the testimony we are about to hear can be considered highly reliable. Ryunosuke: (Perfect. A detective of all people...) Van Zieks: The prosecution's stance remains unchanged. Though it ended in tragedy, the demonstration on the day in question was scientifically sound. And consequently... ...the sole person with the opportunity to have committed this act of murder... ...is the only other individual to have been present on the stage at the time: the accused. Judge: Thank you, Counsel. The prosecution's position is clear. So, bring forth your witnesses now. Van Zieks: Bailiff, show the witnesses in. The witnesses whose proximity to the incident on the day in question will clarify the truth unequivocally. Van Zieks: Witnesses, state your names and occupations for the court to hear. Lune: My name is Balthazar Lune. I am...the impresario of all the hot-air balloons in vicinity of the esperimento stage. Gotts: Mein name ist Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond Ormstein. I have come to see ze Great Exhibition all ze vay from my home in Bohemia. ...I'm very rich. Gina: Inspector Gina Lestrade, Scotland Yard. I'm a great detective. Even 'Erlock Sholmes agrees. I was on security duty at the exhibition...and I got to go up in one o' them balloons! It was amazin'! Ryunosuke: (Gina...again. But she did mention that she'd seen the disaster from up in a balloon actually, didn't she? And she clearly loved every minute of it.) Van Zieks: There were three balloons flying near the public experimentation stage when the incident occurred. Two of these witnesses were in one such balloon at the time, and saw events unfold from the skies above. Lune: You make it sound like they were in the clouds. It was only an altitude of circa sixty feet. Very low. Gina: Well ya can't see nuffin' if ya fly too 'igh, can ya? Ryunosuke: (Sixty feet... About eighteen metres, then.) Judge: Thank you for your introductions. Now, you will give your formal testimony for the court. Kindly describe exactly what you witnessed...especially those of you who had a vantage point above the stage! Witness Testimony - The View From Sixty Feet Up - Lune: It was an incidente terribile. I am only grateful that my balloons were not damaged. Gina: There's this huge bang from the stage, and then the next second, another bang in the sky beside us. Gotts: And from amid ze smoke...a cage appeared out of nowhere! Lune: The cage, it fell from the sky like a stone. And crashed into the Crystal Tower! Gina: I didn't get a good look inside the cage, but no one went near it after it crashed into the tower. Judge: ...A most extraordinary collective account, I must say. Ryunosuke: Could I just clarify something? There's a detail in the witnesses' testimony that I've not heard any mention of until now. Specifically, that there were two explosions? Van Zieks: ...More precisely, two explosions in two separate places, yes. When the demonstration began, the balloon carrying the two witnesses was around...here. There were other balloons in the air nearby at the time carrying other passengers as well, to be clear. Then, as power was supplied to the machine for the demonstration, the first explosion occurred. The so-called 'birdcage' that contained the victim disappeared from the stage, and a moment later... ...the second explosion occurred, directly adjacent to the balloon carrying the witnesses. The birdcage appeared at the site of the explosion, subsequently to plummet down into the Crystal Tower. Gotts: I voz very surprised. Suddenly a cage appeared before my eyes viz a person inside. Ze blast voz so hot, but I didn't vant to miss a sing, so I kept my eyes vide! ...I still have lots of money. Judge: ......... Precisely who is this curious infant? Van Zieks: I'm told he is a young noble of Bohemian royalty. Apparently he disguised himself in order to steal unnoticed into the Great Exhibition. Gotts: Ja, I am here in London on a sightseeing trip viz my elementary school. Van Zieks: We will have the benefit of a child's point of view in the testimony. Ryunosuke: (Do we really need that?) Gotts: Ven I remove my mask, zis is vot I look like. Judge: Ah yes, I see. A delightful face, I'm sure. Gotts: Ja, everybody says so. Ryunosuke: (Great disguise, then...) Van Zieks: ...The point is, the testimony of these witnesses further substantiates the facts for the court. Namely, that despite ending in an explosion, instantaneous kinesis was successfully demonstrated. And furthermore, that until the arrival of the police, no one approached the Crystal Tower where the victim fell. Therefore, only the accused, who was with Mr Asman on the stage, could possibly have committed the murder. Judge: Yes, thank you, Counsel. The prosecution's views on the matter are quite clear. So, the defence's cross-examination now, please. Ryunosuke: Y-Yes, My Lord! Cross-Examination - The View From Sixty Feet Up - Lune: It was an incidente terribile. I am only grateful that my balloons were not damaged. Gina: There's this huge bang from the stage, and then the next second, another bang in the sky beside us. Gotts: And from amid ze smoke...a cage appeared out of nowhere! Gotts: It voz not ze sky zat exploded. It voz a green balloon zat woz next to ours at ze time. Lune: The cage, it fell from the sky like a stone. And crashed into the Crystal Tower! Gina: I didn't get a good look inside the cage, but no one went near it after it crashed into the tower. Ryunosuke: (The prosecution really is asserting that the demonstration was genuine... But what if it was actually some kind of switch-around trick instead? That would mean that the victim was never actually on the stage in the first place. The two explosions would have thrown everyone watching into a panic for sure. I think I need to find out more about what exactly people saw at the time...) Ryunosuke: Mr Lune, in your testimony... ...you said that all three of the balloons you had operating at the time were undamaged. Lune: Si. That is correct. If they had been caught in the esplosiones, it would have been terribile. Ryunosuke: I wonder...if you might know what this is? Lune: Ah...I think it may be... Si, part of a balloon. A burnt piece of the fabric of the envelope. Ryunosuke: Sorry? The envelope? Lune: Pardon. That is the large, round part of the balloon which becomes filled with hot air. It is made from very thick fabric lined with rubber. You do not want it to rip when you are in the sky. Ryunosuke: (Just as I thought...) This piece of cloth was found near the experimentation stage. In other words, as Master Gotts testified... ...a green balloon did indeed explode that day. Lune: Eh?! Ryunosuke: If all the balloons in the sky above the experimentation stage belonged to you, Mr Lune... ...then your statement that they were all undamaged clearly contradicts the evidence! Lune: NOOOOOOOOO! If a balloon exploded that day, why didn't the man say so? Maybe everyone on board was killed... Oh no! Having just spent ten whole pounds for the experience?! How awful! Seems to me like those things crash fifty percent of the time anyway... Van Zieks: Van Zieks: The instantaneous kinesis did occur! But after the explosion on the stage... ...the point of materialisation shifted to a location occupied by a balloon. Judge: Causing the balloon to explode? Yes, eminently plausible. Van Zieks: An unfortunate traffic accident, as it were. But it changes nothing about the pertinent facts. ???: Lune: This, I cannot accept! Ryunosuke: Why not, Mr Lune? Lune: You are suggesting that I am a liar! That persons died in a balloon incidente! Van Zieks: There's no need to get 'fired up', Mr Lune. The victim was the sole fatality that day. Lune: That's right! And I prove it! Balthazar Lune is not a liar! There was no such balloon in the sky! It is non possible! Ryunosuke: You're saying it's impossible? Why? Van Zieks: This court has more important matters to discuss than the number of balloons that were operating that day. Lune: AIIIIIIEEE! Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But we can't ignore the fact that nobody appears to have known anything about this other balloon until now! My Lord! The defence calls for further testimony from Mr Lune! Judge: I concur. There is clearly more to the truth here than meets the eye. It's imperative that we clear up the issue of this phantom balloon, I feel. Witness, you will give supplementary testimony about the balloons you were operating at the exhibition. Lune: Ah...grazie, My Lord! Witness Testimony - Mr Lune's Balloons - Lune: As I said, Balthazar Lune is no liar! Every balloon I had in the sky landed safely! All three of my balloons were carrying passengers. If they fell to the ground in an esplosione, what a catastrofe! Gina: But ya can't get away from the fact that a burnt-up bit o' cloth was found at the scene, can ya? The coppers at the Yard reckoned it was prob'ly some debris thrown from the explosion on the stage. Lune: This stupido ragazzo is mistaken! My balloons have the red and blue zigzag stripes anyway! Judge: Hmmm...so your assertion is that the balloon this child saw was not one belonging to you? Lune: Si! Exactamente! If he even saw a balloon in the first place. I do not like the sound of it. It is very bad for business! I have a good mind to sue the land of Bohemia! Gotts: If you attack us, ve vill fight back! It vill be vor! All out vor! Ryunosuke: (...What happened to 'all out war'? Mr Lune certainly doesn't appear to be lying. But that doesn't change the fact that the testimony and evidence are contradictory here...) Van Zieks: If the defence is unable to find fault with the witnesses' statements, the court must consider them the truth. ...Think long and hard on that, my learned friend. Ryunosuke: (The situation has clearly changed now. I have to get to the bottom of what happened here, no matter what it takes!) Judge: Counsel, you may now cross-examine the witnesses. Cross-Examination - Mr Lune's Balloons - Lune: As I said, Balthazar Lune is no liar! Every balloon I had in the sky landed safely! Lune: All three of my balloons were carrying passengers. If they fell to the ground in an esplosione, what a catastrofe! Gina: But ya can't get away from the fact that a burnt-up bit o' cloth was found at the scene, can ya? Gina: The coppers at the Yard reckoned it was prob'ly some debris thrown from the explosion on the stage. Lune: This stupido ragazzo is mistaken! My balloons have the red and blue zigzag stripes anyway! Ryunosuke: (As I thought, Mr Lune's testimony just doesn't quite add up... The young Bohemian boy claims to have seen another, fourth balloon. But Mr Lune vehemently denies the possibility. And it's hard to imagine the man in charge could be mistaken about the number that were in the air... Still, this inconsistency must tell us something, I'm sure.) Ryunosuke: Unfortunately, the photograph Master Gotts took can't tell us the colour of the balloon. But it can tell us something else. Something crucially important. Van Zieks: What? Ryunosuke: It shows that the pictured balloon...wasn't carrying any passengers. Judge: Ah! My goodness, you're right! But surely all the balloons would have been carrying passengers? There would be no sense in it otherwise. Lune: S-Si! They are for pleasure! For seeing the view! MY balloons only fly with passengers! Ryunosuke: Which tells us that the pictured balloon isn't one of them. So when the incident occurred that day... ...there WAS a fourth balloon in the skies above the experimentation stage! The mysterious green balloon! Lune: I, I know nothing! Niente! I, I can only tell you one thing... If this balloon was not carrying passengers, then it was not one of mine! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: There are illegal tradesmen everywhere you care to look. Clearly one such 'entrepreneur' decided to capitalise on the opportunity presented by the Great Exhibition. And managed to operate balloon flights on Mr Lune's patch without him realising. Lune: Si... Si! The competizione...trying to steal my profits! I did not notice because of the esperimento that went wrong on the stage! Ryunosuke: This fourth balloon exploded at the very same moment Mr Asman was 'beamed' from the stage below. Gina: Right...so them scraps that fell to the ground after, an' left them scorch marks... They didn't come from the stage at all! It was bits o' the balloon rainin' down! But cos no one was in it, it didn't get no attention. Ryunosuke: (A mysterious fourth balloon carrying no passengers, silently floating over the experimentation stage...) Van Zieks: Van Zieks: This photograph shows us nothing more! A stray balloon carrying no one and operated by some rogue trader. Clearly it has nothing to do with the case. Judge: Hmmm... Its relevance does elude me, I must say. Van Zieks: The court has seen sufficient evidence and heard ample testimony already. The prosecution calls for this trial to be concluded! Ryunosuke: (Really? Have we really got to the truth yet? No, I can't let this opportunity slip away. The jurors' minds are made up...and not in our favour! What else can this photograph tell us? Is there nothing more we can learn from it?) Ryunosuke: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, wait! Please don't give your decisions yet! The photograph from Master Gotts... ...may well be hiding one more vital clue! Juror No. 1: What's that?! Juror No. 3: A vital clue?! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: We're well past the point of mere possibilities. It's time for definitives now. So tell the court... What exactly does this alleged clue in the photograph prove? Ryunosuke: We can reasonably assume that the pictured balloon was destroyed in the searing heat of the explosion. Gotts: Ja! Zat's right! Ja! It voz not my fault! Van Zieks: Evidently. Because the birdcage from the kinesis machine materialised in the sky where it had been flying. And the balloon, being filled with flammable hydrogen, instantly and explosively ignited. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: ...No, that's not what happened. Van Zieks: What? Judge: It would appear that this photograph requires closer examination. Counsel for the Defence, you will highlight the location of this alleged 'clue' in the photograph for the court. Ryunosuke: Of course, My Lord. (If you look closely, it's plain enough to see. And what's shown is linked to another piece of evidence we have. In a way that leads to an unbelievable conclusion!) The clue that heavily suggests the real reason the balloon exploded is... Ryunosuke: The timing of this photograph can only be described as miraculous. If you look, you'll notice there's a bright white line that appears to point directly at the balloon. Van Zieks: Most likely a ray of light caught incidentally on the film. Judge: ...I'm afraid I can see nothing of the sort. Ryunosuke: If you look with a magnifying glass, My Lord, it becomes clear what the nature of this bright line really is. Goodness, what is that? Juror No. 4: Undeniably some flash of light, yes. Juror No. 2: Oh golly. Do, do you think it might be lightning? Juror No. 1: But it couldn't have been a finer day. Juror No. 3: I believe we may be looking...at fire! Juror No. 6: A bolt of fire, heading straight for the balloon...like an arrow! Judge: Indeed. Even to my ageing eyes, it would appear to be a flame of some sort. My word! Are, are you suggesting this flame struck the hydrogen gas that filled the balloon?! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: That's absurd! The balloon would have been sixty feet above the ground at the time. No flame could possibly have reached such a height. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Actually, it's my opinion... ...that a particular piece of evidence found at the scene reveals how that is exactly what did happen. Van Zieks: What evidence?! Judge: If such evidence exists, Counsel, then for goodness' sake present it, man! Which evidence explains this mysterious streak of flame that appears to be headed directly for the balloon? Ryunosuke: This was found hidden at the foot of a small ornamental tree near the scene. Judge: Good Lord! Is that a crossbow? Ryunosuke: An arrow dipped in oil and set alight could have been shot from this weapon... ...sending a flaming arrow straight into the hydrogen-filled balloon! Van Zieks: Are you suggesting...that crossbow was used to deliberately...? Gina: Blimey, yer right! That streak o' light in the photo looks just like an arrow, dunnit? Lune: Then...the esplosione of the balloon, it was... Ryunosuke: ...Very likely the result of a flaming arrow from this crossbow igniting the hydrogen gas inside it! Van Zieks: Nooo! Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Counsel, this is an extraordinary supposition! Ryunosuke: If the aim was to cause the balloon to explode, the shooter could have used a gun of course. However, there's an obvious reason why that would have been out of the question. Van Zieks: The noise of the discharge? Of course... Ryunosuke: That's right. By using a crossbow, the projectile could be fired at the balloon silently. Gina: Well yeah, if someone 'ad shot a gun off in the exhibition grounds, it would've caused a real panic. Lune: But with the big esplosione, there was a very big panic anyway, no? Ryunosuke: ......... (I don't like this. I should be pleased to have found a plausible new explanation for all this, but something feels wrong...) Van Zieks: Van Zieks: Do you understand the implications of what you're saying, my Nipponese friend? Ryunosuke: If a flaming arrow did indeed hit the balloon, then obviously it would have exploded. And if the birdcage appeared from the cloud of smoke that ensued... Gina: Wot? Wait a minute! Wot are ya really sayin' 'ere? I don't get it. Was, was the birdcage beamed up into the sky after all, or...wot? Judge: My goodness me! Ryunosuke: ......... (Ah, now I understand. That's what that sinking feeling is about...) I think there's a good chance... ...that the birdcage was actually concealed inside the balloon all along. Judge: What?! Did, did I just hear that correctly, Counsel? Ryunosuke: (There's no going back now. The horse has bolted...) Let's assume, as I said, that the birdcage was hidden inside the green balloon from the start. On stage, when the experiment was started... ...the birdcage in the instantaneous kinesis machine disappeared in a cloud of smoke. At that moment, the flaming arrow was fired from the ground... ...causing the green balloon to explode and drawing the attention of the spectators to the sky above their heads. From amid the smoke, the hidden birdcage then appeared, to fall down and crash into the Crystal Tower. I think you'll all agree it's entirely plausible... ...that what I've just described is the real truth behind the 'miraculous' experiment carried out that day! Judge: Th-This... I......... GOOOOOOOOOD GRIEF! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: This is ludicrous! What you've described is no science experiment. It's, it's child's play! A contemptible display of stage magic! Ryunosuke: (Both Mr Sholmes and Iris said that the experiment was a scientific impossibility. In which case, this is the only way to explain what happened that day.) Van Zieks: And in any case...the victim's body was found inside the birdcage in the Crystal Tower. If the instantaneous kinesis didn't take place, how do you explain that? Ryunosuke: Ah! Um... Juror No. 3: If I may put in a word...as a man of magic myself... Such apparent discrepancies can easily be explained by some simple deception. Ryunosuke: J-Juror number three! Juror No. 3: All that would be needed is a doppelgänger - someone who looked very similar to the victim, Mr Asman... ...and having this other man appear on stage to front the show...as a body double! Ryunosuke: Ah...yes! Of course, so in fact... ...Mr Asman must have been inside the birdcage that was concealed inside the balloon right from the start! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: That balloon would have been filled with hydrogen. Anything hidden inside it would have been scattered to the four winds when it exploded. No one would ever have embarked on such a risky venture. Juror No. 4: Not necessarily. The explosive force of the balloon gas would very much depend upon the mixture ratio. Ryunosuke: J-Juror number four! Juror No. 4: Flying balloons are rarely filled with pure hydrogen, but a mixture of other gases such as helium as well. Helium on its own doesn't explode, but by controlling the gas mixture ratio, the explosive force can be altered. Van Zieks: The mixture ratio...? Juror No. 4: Obviously, the victim's body would have suffered some burns. That would be unavoidable. But not to such an extent as to render this whole obscene charade impossible. Van Zieks: ......... Ryunosuke: So everything that happened can be explained. Logically and scientifically. The explosion that engulfed the stage at the start of the 'experiment' was no accident. It was all part of an elaborate deception...to make it appear that instantaneous kinesis had occurred! Judge: Well...goodness me... Ryunosuke: And if we accept that this is what happened... ...it means that the victim, Mr Asman, was never present on the public experimentation stage to begin with. Van Zieks: Nrgh... Ryunosuke: In short... ...he couldn't have been killed by the defendant, who was on stage in full view the entire time! Van Zieks: AAAAAARGH! Ryunosuke: (This will be very hard for the prosecution to counter. Lord van Zieks can't credibly maintain that Professor Harebrayne is a suspect now!) ???: Harebrayne: Mr Naruhodo...I appreciate your efforts. Thank you. Ryunosuke: P-Professor?! Harebrayne: But you can stop now. Just keep your mouth shut, please. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Van Zieks: What's all this about...Mr Harebrayne? Harebrayne: ......... I, Albert Harebrayne, hereby confess... ...that it... That it was... That it was me who stabbed Mr Odie Asman! Yes! It was me! With my faithful friend and partner... Andrew the Screwdriver! Ryunosuke: Wha......... WHAT ARE YOU DOIIIIIING?! Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Defendant! Explain this sudden confession! Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne! What are you talking about?! Harebrayne: It's...it's what I've said all along! I must protect my hypothesis! And my precious machine! Ryunosuke: ...! Harebrayne: You stand there and claim it was all a trick! All an elaborate prank! But where's your proof?! No, y-you'd have to examine the machine if you wanted to prove it. But then it would all be over! My beautiful hypothesis would be laid bare... I mean, the indignity of it! Ryunosuke: It's clear that you drew the plans for the experiment, but you didn't actually build it. It's quite conceivable that you were duped, Professor. If you'll just let me, I can prove- Harebrayne: Barok! Van Zieks: Yes? Harebrayne: I'll cooperate. I'll do whatever you say. I swear it. So, so please... ...ensure the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act is adhered to and protect my creation! ......... Van Zieks: ...Pray forgive the discourtesy of filling my hallowed chalice at this critical juncture... Here's to my learned Nipponese friend... Ryunosuke: Wha...?! Van Zieks: ...and his upcoming attempt to clarify the defence's position in the light of the accused's confession. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: Do you intend to formally assert that the experiment was nothing more than a conjuring trick? Because the moment you do... ...the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act that protects the professor's invention will cease to apply. The prosecution will then demand a rigorous examination of the machinery involved in order to establish the truth. Ryunosuke: ......... Van Zieks: However...if you acknowledge that the machine is genuine and instrumental in the victim's murder... ...any chance of investigating will be crushed...and the confidentiality of the professor's hypothesis preserved. Ryunosuke: ...! Judge: Well, Counsel...what is the defence's official position on this matter? Ryunosuke: (What Professor Harebrayne - my client - actually asked of me... ...was to prove that the explosion on stage was an accident and protect the secrecy of his hypothesis. But there's no way to do that without implying the professor's guilt! Do I protect my client's life by asserting his innocence, or do I uphold my client's request but see him condemned? Either way, I can't avoid betraying his trust...) Van Zieks: You've been silent long enough! Isn't talking your trade, my learned friend? Or has all knowledge of English escaped your confused Nipponese mind? Ryunosuke: ......... Harebrayne: Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: (There's no escape here! I have to make a choice! But it's an impossible one! I have to give up on something...but what?) The defence asserts...that the defendant's instantaneous kinesis machine was in fact... Ryunosuke: ......... .........Agh! (No! I can't say it! My client placed his faith in me... I can't just let him down!) 'What must I give up on?' is not the question you have to ask yourself here. It's 'What can I protect?' Susato: Hello again...Mr Naruhodo. It's been far too long. Ryunosuke: Su... Susato-san! But, but what are you- Susato: Haiiiiii-YA! Ryunosuke: AAAAAAAAGH! (My first Susato Takedown in six months!) Susato: There'll be time to talk later, Mr Naruhodo. For now...we must concentrate on the task at hand! Ryunosuke: (Which is working out not what I have to give up on, but what I can protect!) Professor Harebrayne! Harebrayne: Ah! ...Yes?! Ryunosuke: Yesterday you told me that science is the pursuit of truth. Well...my job is to pursue the truth too. Harebrayne: Yes, of course... Ryunosuke: And personally, I believe...that you didn't stab Mr Asman. I think you've come to realise something yourself too, haven't you? That your experiment and the machine you built with the victim are questionable! The truth behind that is what we must both pursue now! Harebrayne: UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Van Zieks: ...So...you've finally opened your eyes. Ryunosuke: What? Van Zieks: And as for you... ...Albert. You can't ignore this any longer. Harebrayne: Ah... Van Zieks: Having heard my learned friend's assertion... ...don't you have something to say? Harebrayne: ......... B-Barok... Ryunosuke: Lord van Zieks... Susato: Gosh, I've never heard him speak that way before. Harebrayne: ......... In truth...there is one thing. Something I've remembered that's of relevance. Ryunosuke: What? Harebrayne: On the day it happened...just before I began the experiment...I saw a man near the stage. A man holding that crossbow. Judge: I beg your pardon?! Ryunosuke: Professor! Did the man have any distinguishing features? What did he look like? Harebrayne: Uh...tall. Taller than me. And, and thin. Thinner than me. With straight hair. Straighter - and whiter - than mine. Let me see... One less lens than me, too. A monocle. A rather stylish, black monocle. But one thing in particular will help to positively identify the man. You see, I know him very well. After all...he's the engineer who built my invention! Van Zieks: What? Ryunosuke: He...built the machine? Harebrayne: That's right. Mr Asman introduced him to me a year ago. He's, he's a man by the name of... ...Enoch Drebber. Juror No. 3: Enoch?! Juror No. 4: Drebber?! Judge: Does this name mean something? Members of the jury seem flustered... Juror No. 4: Not a name any scientist wishes to hear. The man's an abomination! Juror No. 3: Not a name any conjuror wishes to hear, either! Ryunosuke: Who on earth is he? Juror No. 4: I'm afraid this isn't the first tale of this nature that I've heard in scientific circles in connection with that name. There's talk of other flamboyant experiments that turn out to be nothing but stage trickery in the end. Obviously the rascal is after the government's research grant money. Juror No. 3: When magicians are in need of money, I have heard of them resorting to these underhand tactics. Some acquaintances of mine with...experience of such things have mentioned Enoch Drebber's name before. Juror No. 4: The man is both an engineer and a magician. Yes, we're dealing with an unparalleled confidence trickster here! That's Enoch Drebber for you! Harebrayne: So it's true then... My invention... My great machine... It was just a grand illusion? Ryunosuke: Considering what we've just heard about Mr Drebber's character... ...I'm sorry to say that sounds increasingly likely. Harebrayne: Even though no one else believed it...I wanted to. I wanted to believe that machine would function exactly as my hypothesis predicted. Van Zieks: Which is why you were so opposed to it being investigated, I presume. Harebrayne: I knew that if the machine was examined in detail, its construction would give away my hypothesis. Obviously, I didn't want that to happen. But at the same time... ...I knew that if it was found to be nothing more than a trick... Than a work of deception... ...then everything I'd worked towards...all my research... all my dreams...my whole life would be over! I was terrified at the prospect. Ryunosuke: So you really had no idea, then, did you? About the true nature of the machine that was built. And the true nature of Mr Drebber. Harebrayne: I never questioned anything. I, I didn't want to question it. Ryunosuke: It's entirely possible that Mr Asman and Mr Drebber... ...were working together to use you as a means of fraudulently acquiring the research grant money. Harebrayne: ......... ...When I announced my invention to the crowds that day, it was the finest moment of my career. I pulled all the levers and turned all the dials in exactly the way Drebber had described... When the smoke suddenly started billowing out, I panicked. I didn't know what was happening. Harebrayne: But I really don't know how the whole illusion was made to work. I...don't know anything any more... Van Zieks: Let me confirm one final point with you, Professor. Do you now consent to the prosecution submitting the necessary paperwork... ...to release your invention from the protection afforded by the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act? Harebrayne: ......... Yes, please go ahead. I'm...very sorry. Judge: It would appear that we shall have to suspend proceedings for the remainder of the day now. Lord van Zieks... Van Zieks: My Lord? Judge: The court has newly been made aware of another party whose involvement in this matter is critical. Van Zieks: Yes, Mr Drebber... Judge: Gather information about the man. If possible, I should like him served with a subpoena. Van Zieks: With pleasure, My Lord. Judge: Now, Counsel for the Defence... Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord! Judge: ......... When we reconvene, I shall be looking for one thing and one thing alone from you. Evidence...that the defendant is innocent of the crime for which he presently stands accused. Ryunosuke: ...I understand. Judge: Good. In that case...this court is adjourned until tomorrow morning! 23rd October, 1:36 p.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber Harebrayne: ......... ...Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: Ah! Y-Yes? Harebrayne: I'm...I'm...I'm... I'm so sorry! I was wrong! You were right! I tricked you! You trusted me! I dragged you...into my mess! Oh h-how did it ever come to this...? I'M SOOO SOOO SOOO SOOORRY! Ryunosuke: Did you really have no idea, Professor? About what Mr Drebber was really up to, I mean? About what he was really constructing. Harebrayne: Naturally! That machine was the embodiment of my hypothesis! Of all my hopes and dreams! I had complete faith in it! Ryunosuke: Alright. In that case, I won't say any more. Now, sadly the murder accusation against you still stands. So we must do as much investigation as we can before the trial resumes tomorrow. Harebrayne: ......... Well, thank you for doing so much for me! Susato: I'm so sorry for arriving late this morning, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: A-Arriving late? Susato: Didn't you receive my postcard? I wanted to let you know when I'd arrive. Ryunosuke: Postcard? What postcard? Iris: I hid it from you, Runo! So it would be a surprise! ...Well? Did it work? Ryunosuke: I was surprised alright! Especially when she threw me to the ground! Susato: Oh dear! I'm so sorry! I, I was just so happy to see you again that...it sort of slipped out. Ryunosuke: (Maybe we could stick to more traditional displays of emotion in future...?) Iris: Susie's train was late into London Victoria this morning, you see. But we made the coachman really whip the horses hard so she didn't miss the whole trial! Susato: I was watching from the gallery for a while, but in the end...I'm afraid I couldn't contain myself... Ryunosuke: Well, I'm glad you didn't. Susato: Oh! Ryunosuke: Having you at my side in court gives me the strength I need to win. So...I'm, um, delighted to see you...back in London. Susato: Oh, you're too kind, Mr Naruhodo! I'm delighted to be here! I hope I can continue to be of service to you. Ryunosuke: Of course. So...what's brought you back? Did Professor Mikotoba not protest? Iris: Let's save all that conversation for when we're back at home, shall we? You know I've made one of my most special blends ever for this special occasion! Susato: Oh, Iris, how wonderful! I can't wait! Ryunosuke: Susato-san was back in London. It's hard to describe how happy that made me feel at the time. But despite my elation... ...our tale was about to take yet another extraordinary turn. To be continued...23rd October, 2:41 p.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy Susato: Oh, this room! It's been too long! It hasn't changed in the slightest, though. And it's been some six months, hasn't it? ...That's a long time for things to stay so...familiar. Ryunosuke: I didn't know when you might return, and I wanted everything to be as you'd left it. ...But it has been some six months, it's true. Iris: So is your father alright, Susie? What happened? Susato: My father? Ryunosuke: Yes! Professor Mikotoba! I mean, it was half a year ago, but that's why you went back to Japan! Because of the telegram you received saying he'd fallen ill with a very high fever for some unknown reason. Iris: That's right. So I was surprised to learn you'd be coming back so soon. Surprised but happy! Susato: ......... I think I wrote about it in my letter to you. That it was all a trick. My father is in fine health. And I'm obviously very relieved...about that. Ryunosuke: Well, we're all delighted to have you back. Susato: It was quite by accident that I've been able to return to Europe, actually. It's because of a very grand conference called the International Forensic Science Symposium. Ryunosuke: The International Forensic... (That's the same symposium Lord Stronghart mentioned.) Susato: Anyway, I've arrived safe and sound, and all that matters is that I'm here now! After all, I haven't yet fulfilled my promise to you, Iris. Iris: Oh! Ryunosuke: You must tell us everything that happened while you were back in Japan. Susato: Yes, of course, I shall. Ryunosuke: And...there's one other thing... Something you wrote in your letter that particularly grabbed my attention. About...you-know-who. (About Kazuma...) Susato: I know. I'll tell you all that I can. After clearing all Converse options with Susato Mikotoba and Iris Wilson: Susato: So, Mr Naruhodo, I'm ready to start investigating if you are! I've committed every detail about the case to memory! And Iris has told me about the disturbing happenings at the waxwork museum as well. Ryunosuke: So...you're fully abreast of the situation already, Miss Susato. I'd expected nothing less, to be honest. Susato: I would think our first port of call should be to investigate this Mr Drebber. The engineer responsible for building the elaborate machine that was used to effect this extraordinary trick. Ryunosuke: Yes, a conjuror of sorts, by the sound of it, well known in the fields of science and magic. Susato: Then we need to go and arrest him! Ryunosuke: Well, yes... ...he must know the truth behind this case, so I agree we really do need to find the man. Iris: Hm...it sounds like it's a case of tracking someone down. Which is a job for the police...or a great detective! Ryunosuke: (Are we supposed to guess who she might be thinking of?) We don't have much time, so we need to get started straight away, I think. Iris: Good idea. Well, best of luck, then! Ryunosuke: Oh, you're not coming today? Iris: I'm going to Brixton Road shortly for the herb market. But let me know later how you got on, won't you? Ryunosuke: (That was a little abrupt. The pull of the herb market must be strong...) 23rd October Sholmes's Suite 23rd October Local Prison, Cell 11 Ryunosuke: What's...he doing?! Susato: He's... Oh my! The whole wall of the cell is covered in mathematical equations! Ryunosuke: And he's still writing more now! Um...Professor! Sorry to interrupt... Harebrayne: Oh, ah... M-Mr Naruhodo... ...! And who is this young lady? Susato: My name is Susato Mikotoba. I'm Mr Naruhodo's judicial assistant. It's a pleasure to meet you, Professor. Harebrayne: ......... OH, IF ONLY! IF ONLY I'D MET A REFINED YOUNG WOMAN LIKE YOU SOONER! ...None of this would have happened. N-No, that's not logical... That makes no sense at all. Susato: Oh dear, I'm...I'm sorry if my presence here upsets you. Ryunosuke: I owe you an apology too, Professor. I didn't manage to deliver what I promised you I would in court this morning. Harebrayne: Oh no! No no no! No no no no no! The whole thing... The whole miserable affair... It all happened because I've been such a complete and utter clot! Susato: Um, Professor Harebrayne...what have you been working on in your cell? Harebrayne: Oh! Ha ha, you, um...you mean that? Oh dear, how embarrassing... I, I was suddenly struck by an idea, you see, and I simply had to write it down. The wall was all I had to hand. Ryunosuke: Oh! Is it some new hypothesis? Something to surpass super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis, maybe? Harebrayne: Ah...no, actually. This...is my autobiography. Susato: Your autobiography? Harebrayne: 'How I was Diddled and Fiddled'...by Albert Harebrayne! I've found I can represent my odd fortunes with only odd numbers in an ambitious set of simultaneous equations! Susato: ...Really? Harebrayne: I'm going to have to pay back all the loans I took for the kinesis machine, you see! So it's going to be a new serial publication from next month! 'Part 1: An Odd Birth; an Odd Upbringing'. Ryunosuke: (...You can't beat the man's optimism, that's for sure.) I see. Well...for now, would you mind if we talked a little more about the case? Harebrayne: Oh yes! YES! Of course! I've been working through the numbers! I WAS DIDDLED! I WAS FIDDLED! BY THE PAIR OF THEM! By Asman! And by that aloof engineer, Drebber! Ryunosuke: (We're not going to have to sit through an explanation of all these equations...are we?) 23rd October British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Ryunosuke: ...Oh, who's that standing beside Lord Stronghart? Susato: I wonder... I've never seen her before. Stronghart: Ah, the young champion of the court. You had some success this morning, I understand. And you've thrown the entire government into disarray as a result. Ryunosuke: Oh! You, you mean because of Professor Harebrayne's experiment? Stronghart: Sham science being demonstrated at London's Great Exhibition! The country's been made to look foolish, and now politicians are scrabbling to respond. Lord van Zieks is in Whitehall as we speak, giving an emergency briefing. Ryunosuke: Oh dear, I, um... I didn't mean to cause any trouble. Stronghart: None of this is your responsibility. The government is entirely to blame for having been taken in. The special dispensation that prevents investigation at the scene will be annulled later today. Once that happens, my Forensic Investigation Team will move in and deal with that scrap metal in no time. Ryunosuke: (It's scrap metal now, is it?) ???: Until later then, Lord Stronghart. Stronghart: Yes. Thank you. Ryunosuke: Um...who was that? Stronghart: That was Dr Courtney Sithe, Scotland Yard's esteemed chief coroner. She's leading the Forensic Investigation Team's handling of this case. She was just delivering her report about the victim, in fact. Ryunosuke: Oh, I see... (About Mr Asman.) Stronghart: Following the outcome of the trial earlier, I asked the coroner's office to re-evaluate its findings. I don't have time to tell you what she concluded. If you want to know, you'll have to ask her directly. You can find her in the forensics laboratory. Ryunosuke: Ah, right. Stronghart: Now, what were you here to see me about? I can give you...seven minutes and thirty-nine seconds of my time. Ryunosuke: (So he's not running quite so spectacularly late any more...) After clearing all Converse options: Ryunosuke: Oh yes! Lord Stronghart... Stronghart: Go ahead. Ryunosuke: It's about Professor Harebrayne's experimental machine. We'd like your permission to examine the remains, if possible! Stronghart: ......... Are you well versed in science, then? Ryunosuke: Not in the slightest! In fact, you could say I was barely aware of the subject at all until recently. Stronghart: ...Well the special dispensation legally preventing investigation of the machine is currently being annulled. Within a few hours, Dr Sithe's team of forensic experts will begin their own investigation. But I suppose until then, there's no harm in you looking at the wreckage, as long as you touch nothing. Ryunosuke: Thank you! (Being able to look at it is better than nothing!) Susato: And I'll be able to see it, too! Stronghart: ...Your time is up. You'll have to excuse me now, I'm afraid. My next engagement calls. Susato: We are extremely sorry to have troubled you when you are so busy, My Lord. Stronghart: I have important matters to attend to in preparation for the symposium, you understand. 23rd October Forensics Laboratory Ryunosuke: I believe this is it... Dr Sithe's laboratory. (That chemical smell really assaults the nose. And there's plenty to assault the eyes in here, too...) Susato: It looks as though the doctor isn't here. But we're here now, so we may as well do some... sightseeing, don't you think? Ryunosuke: What a seasoned tourist you've become, Miss Susato. (We could just have a little look around...being careful not to upset any restless souls...) After examining open book on desk: ???: What are you doing?! Ryunosuke: Ah! Sorry! We, um, had something we wanted to ask you, but you weren't here, so... Sithe: So you thought you'd snoop around? That's acceptable to you people from the East, is it? Well? What do you want? Ryunosuke: Ah, um... Lord Stronghart told us, you see... ...that it was you who examined the victim's body. Erm, Mr Asman's body, I mean. Sithe: ......... Susato: So we came to ask you about your findings. On Lord Stronghart's advice. Sithe: ......... Very well. If the Lord Chief Justice has given his consent, I'll tell you what our investigation revealed. But when we're done, you must leave immediately. After clearing Converse option: ???: Mama, what is this? Ryunosuke: ...Agh! (Wh-Where did SHE spring from? And...did she just call the doctor, 'Mama'?) Sithe: This is a 'lawyer', dear. ???: Oh... Ryunosuke: Um...hello. ...To meet you. P-Pleased to meet you. Yes, I'm a defence lawyer. Ryunosuke Naruho- ???: Mama... Sithe: Yes? ???: Can I cut this one up? Ryunosuke: What?! ???: I've never seen inside an Eastern person before. I want to know what it looks like. Sithe: Of course you can't. It's a live specimen, as you can very well see. ???: ......... Hmph. Boring. Ryunosuke: ......... (I, I think... ...I just had a near-death experience!) Susato: Oh dear! Mr Naruhodo, you're as pale as a corpse! Ryunosuke: Then let's leave before I'm mistaken for one! 23rd October The Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower Susato: I had no idea there were so many people in the world. Ryunosuke: I know what you mean. It's really packed here today. Susato: It feels as though it's taken us two hours just to make our way through the crowds to this point. Ryunosuke: Has it? I shut my brain down so I didn't really notice, to be honest. Susato: Gosh...I do wish I had your absence of mind sometimes, Mr Naruhodo. ???: ...There you are. I had a feelin' you lot would show your mugs before long. Ryunosuke: Oh! Inspector Gregson! I see you're hard at work as usual! Gregson: Warm greetings to you. I do hope you've been keepin' well since last we met. Ryunosuke: What's with all the ceremony? We just saw each other in court this morning. Gregson: Not you, sunshine. The gentlewoman so loyally at your side. Susato: Oh! Why, thank you, Inspector. How good of you to notice. Ryunosuke: (He might be a bit rough around the edges, but he's still a proper English gentleman at heart...I suppose.) As you've probably guessed, we were hoping to investigate the scene some more. Gregson: Right. Well, that's the young trainee's domain. Oi! Get over here, Gina! ......... Ryunosuke: ...She seems to be busy playing with a puppy. (Probably giving it a traditional 'East End' training...) Susato: G-Gina?! She's a police officer now? Ryunosuke: Amazing, isn't it? Gregson: She's a good kid, actually. Heart's in the right place, anyway. She's got the detection bug, if you ask me. Yup, I think she'll follow in my footsteps nicely. Ryunosuke: ...What do you mean? Gregson: I'm bein' transferred. It's time for me to say toodle-oo to London. Susato: Oh no! Really? Ryunosuke: That's, that's a bit sudden, isn't it? I had no idea. Where are you going to be posted, then? We'll come to see how you're getting along. Gregson: Haha, not likely. But you're welcome to try. If you don't mind a trip to France, that is. Ryunosuke: To France? Gregson: I'll be workin' in the Paris Police Prefecture. ...Should be right up my alley. Ryunosuke: But, but France! It's an entirely different country! I don't understand. Why would you be sent there? Gregson: That's the way the adult world works, sunshine! Now, don't go pokin' your nose in where it's not wanted. ......... I'm intendin' to take the kid with me when I go. Ryunosuke: What? You're taking Gina to Paris?! Gregson: Well I can't leave her here in London. Who knows what'd become of her. Ryunosuke: (...I suppose he's worried she'd slip back into slipping her hands into people's pockets and purses...) Susato: I don't think he's worried about her pickpocketing, Mr Naruhodo. I think he's worried about the Reaper. Ryunosuke: Oh! (Of course! So that's playing on Inspector Gregson's mind too, is it?) Gregson: Anyway, I haven't mentioned any o' this to Gina. So don't go blabbin', you hear me? Ryunosuke: N-No, of course not. Gregson: I've gotta keep that divin' diva safe an' sound. ...Until all this is over, at least. Gina: Oi! Did you just call me a bloomin' 'divin' diva' again?! Gregson: So you heard that, did ya? Right, well... Any questions about the scene, you can put 'em to my capable detective diva here. Gina: Alright, you 'eard the boss! Inspector Lestrade's in charge 'ere now! Ryunosuke: (...I suppose I'd better keep my word and not mention anything about Paris.) So, um, Gina... You've got a new dog, have you? Gina: Isn't 'e great? Toby's 'is name. Susato: Oh, how delightful! He's absolutely adorable! Ryunosuke: (Yes, the dog does seem lovely. But it's the not-so-lovely Inspector Gregson that's playing on my mind, to be honest...) After clearing all Converse options in British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office then clearing all Converse options in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower: Gina: Right then, 'Oddo! Leave it to me. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Gina: We're gonna get goin' after that dodgy engineer cove right this minute. Oh, but 'ang on... Someone's s'posed to be on guard duty 'ere all the time. Ryunosuke: I'm afraid we can't help. We need to get on with our investigation as well, Gina. Gina: Oh...right. Oh well, never mind. It ain't gonna be me wot gets it in the neck. It'll be the boss. Ryunosuke: (Poor, poor Gregson again...) Gina: Ready Toby? Got that oil scent, 'ave ya? Come on then, boy! See ya later! Susato: I do hope the scent of that oil leads them to that swindler's workshop. Ryunosuke: Yes, I hope so too. Ideally before the dog swims across the Channel to France. 23rd October The Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage Susato: Oh my! So this is the machine... ...that was used to deceive people into thinking instantaneous kinesis had taken place. Ryunosuke: Yes, that's right. Or rather it WAS the machine. It's a little worse for wear at the moment... Susato: What extraordinary lengths Professor Harebrayne went to in order to obtain the research grant. Ryunosuke: No no no! The professor was tricked as well. He didn't know anything about it. Susato: Yes, of course. ...It is amazing, though, isn't it? The scale of the whole affair is so very British. Ryunosuke: You're right about that. You'd never see such a grand deception in Japan, that's for sure. Susato: Oh look...is that... ...Lord van Zieks? Ryunosuke: ......... ...So, I think we're more or less done here, aren't we? Shall we, Miss Susato? Susato: Already? Ryunosuke: He IS the Reaper, remember. We'd do well to keep our distance, I think. Susato: But we have permission to be here! From the top! We're perfectly well allowed to investigate this machine... as long as we don't touch anything. Ryunosuke: From the top? Do you mean Lord Stronghart? Susato: Exactly. So we can stay here and stare at this wreckage for as long as we like! Ryunosuke: (She could have been at the centre of the explosion here and it wouldn't have bent her steel will...) After clearing all Converse options with Barok van Zieks: ???: ......... Van Zieks: ...Ah, the file I requested for the trial tomorrow. Thank you. Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: ...Are you alright? Susato: Who, who is this man, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Lord van Zieks's apprentice, apparently. (So I'm not the only one. Susato-san can see it too...) Susato: Um...Lord van Zieks... ...may we speak with your apprentice for a moment? Van Zieks: With him? ...Why? Apprentice: ......... Susato: Kazuma-sama! Apprentice: ......... ...Kazu...ma...? Ryunosuke: ...! (I don't believe it!) Susato: Your, your posture... Your presence... It can only be... It's you...isn't it, Kazuma-sama?! Apprentice: ......... Ryunosuke: (I felt something strange the very first time I encountered this cloaked figure. As if I knew him somehow... Can it...? Can it really be you, Kazuma?) W-W-Wait! (Too late...) Van Zieks: What's going on here? After examining large machine and large cage, and clearing all Converse options with Barok van Zieks: Susato: ......... You'd already met that masked man, hadn't you, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Yes. Yesterday, in fact. At Lord van Zieks's office. Susato: I see... ......... And if...if Kazuma-sama really is still alive... ...it means that Mr Sholmes lied to us. Ryunosuke: ...I know. (We're going to need to speak to him about that.) Van Zieks: You're going to have to leave now. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: The Forensic Investigation Team are due to arrive shortly. If they find you here, it will...cause problems. Ryunosuke: What sort of problems? Van Zieks: Foreign affairs problems. Ryunosuke: (...Well we could do without that.) Alright, we'll be on our way. Let's go, Miss Susato. Susato: Of course. The Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower After clearing Converse option in Forensics Laboratory, correctly presenting Drebber's Card in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower, and examining large machine, large cage and clearing all Converse options with Barok van Zieks in Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage: Ryunosuke: Well, I think we've done all the investigating we can here for now. If we could just determine the whereabouts of Mr Drebber... Susato: I'm sure Gina and little Toby won't let us down! Now then... ...do you think we ought to try to speak with Mr Sholmes at this point? We have things to discuss and I'm dying to meet him again after all these months. Ryunosuke: Yes, it's quite possible he might know something useful, you're right. We ought to find him at Madame Tusspells. He's supposed to be working there as a temporary waxwork exhibit. Susato: Yes! Iris told me all about his latest unusual venture! 23rd October Madame Tusspells Museum of Waxworks Susato: We really do need to speak with Mr Sholmes, and I am longing to say hello again... ...but where is he? Ryunosuke: ......... I think you might find...that he's quite nearby, actually. Susato: Oh! What, what do you...? Sholmes: Indeed, my dear fellows...it is I! The world-famous great detective and waxwork... Herlock Sholmes! Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: Susato-san! Susato-saaaaaan! Sholmes: My most humble apologies... Susato: I thought I'd died and gone to eternal paradise for a moment...via London. Sholmes: My dear madam...allow me to make amends by offering you a tasty free deduction at some point. Ryunosuke: ...As long as it's not of questionable street food quality. Susato: I don't understand. Why are you working as a waxwork here, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: Merely a secret identity, you understand. Though the case is largely solved now. Susato: Largely solved? Ryunosuke: We're talking about the waxwork abduction, I presume? Sholmes: Indeed we are, my good fellow. As I predicted, it was as easy as proverbial pie. Though I confess...I'm yet to partake of a pie, proverbial or otherwise. Or any food so far today for that matter. ......... *Rumble rumble rumble* Ryunosuke: (That stomach rumble echoed around the whole museum...) So how did you manage to solve it so quickly? Sholmes: Ah, well, do remember I said it was largely solved. Anyway, I simply negotiated with the culprit. Are you familiar with the so-called 'telephone'? Susato: Oh yes! It's a most modern invention, allowing you to hold a conversation with people far away. In Japan, only the imperial capital and a handful of other cities are connected as yet. Sholmes: This morning, a telephone call was received here from the perpetrator of the abduction. As such, I was able to negotiate terms, and in the end, the waxwork was returned. Ryunosuke: That's amazing! Sholmes: Just between you and I... ...it would appear the culprit had always intended to return the stolen waxwork in any event. Susato: Oh! But...I thought whoever was responsible had demanded a ransom, no? Sholmes: Yes. I think perhaps... ...the ransom demand was necessary to avoid unwanted suspicion regarding the true motive. Susato: But...does that not mean... ...your negotiating was entirely unnecessary? Sholmes: ......... A fact that I must ask you to keep from Madame Tusspells at all costs! A hungry young Iris awaits my return to Baker Street, after all. Ryunosuke: (Poor Iris...) Sholmes: Now then, do I sense that you have some business with this great waxwork? After clearing all Converse options and presenting Photograph of Drebber: Sholmes: I have a suggestion, Mr Naruhodo! Will you indulge me? Ryunosuke: Oh! Well...what is it? Sholmes: As I explained to you when you arrived, the missing waxwork has been returned. And I personally reinstalled it in the exhibit from which it was taken...behind those thick curtains. Ryunosuke: Oh, yes... The 'Professor' exhibit, isn't it? Sholmes: Would you like to see it? For a mere five shillings? ...That's a special, one-time-only price, you understand. Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: The opportunity won't come again, I might add. Wouldn't you like to see the fruits of my labour? Susato: Oh! Well, we do have a rather pressing investigation to carry out. Perhaps we could postpone...? Sholmes: The price is a very reasonable five shilling. I think you'll find it's well worth it. Susato: ...! Ryunosuke: Are you...? Are you being quite serious, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: Surely you need only look at my expression to ascertain if this is seriousness or silliness? Ryunosuke: (I can never tell with you, that's the point.) Susato: Very well, it couldn't hurt. Here's your five shillings. Sholmes: ...Gratefully received. So, the special exhibit awaits behind the curtain. I invite you to peruse it at your leisure. Susato: Well, the money's been spent, so... Let's go and see the special exhibit! Ryunosuke: (Hm, through those heavy curtains at last...) 23rd October Madame Tusspells Special Exhibit Susato: Oh dear... I, I felt a shiver run down my spine as soon as we walked in here. Ryunosuke: Miss Susato! I say we turn on our heels and go straight home...via a really big confectionery! Susato: We...we certainly can't do that. We've paid five shillings already! Ryunosuke: ...True. Actually, now I'm looking a little more closely... ...we've paid good money to see an exhibit that's clearly incomplete...! The nerve of the great diddling detective is far more terrifying than anything else in this place! Susato: This must be what Mr Sholmes meant when he said the case was 'largely solved'. Ryunosuke: (Be that as it may... ...Mr Sholmes heavily implied there'd be a clue about the engineer in here, didn't he? But where...?) Since we've paid five shillings, let's do five shillings' worth of investigation, shall we? Susato: Yes, we, we will get what we paid for! Ryunosuke: (Is that fear or frustration...that's making Susato-san's voice tremble?) Ryunosuke: Ah! Susato: Wh-What on earth...? How can...? Ryunosuke: (I, I don't believe it! A black monocle!) Susato: Mr Naruhodo! Is, is it possible that this man is... Ryunosuke: Yes... It's Enoch Drebber! Susato: The colour of his hair is different, but... Ryunosuke: ...It's unmistakably him! ???: Indeed it is. Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: This man is the subject of your present hunt, I believe? Ryunosuke: Yes, that's...that's right. Just who is this man? Why is he here in this exhibit? Sholmes: ......... Ryunosuke: And why does the convict behind him have no head? Sholmes: ...The head was missing when the model was returned by the thief who stole it. Ryunosuke: (What a surprise.) So then the case isn't yet solved, is it? Sholmes: Did I not say so myself? 'Largely solved' were my words, I believe. But I must locate the missing head 'tout de suite' as Madame would say, or I'll be in grave trouble. A very hungry Iris still awaits my return to Baker Street... preferably with rations! Ryunosuke: Aaargh! Susato: Do you know, though... Something about this room is strange! Ryunosuke: Strange? What do you mean? Susato: Well, the displays in the House of Horrors are supposed to depict real events, are they not? Sholmes: Indeed they are, Miss Susato. Do go on... Susato: And, as terrifying as they are, the scenes in the other exhibits are believable. But this one... This surely couldn't ever really have happened, could it? Sholmes: ......... I think it's time I educated you a little... ...about the nature of the incidents involving the Professor ten years ago. Ryunosuke: ...! After clearing all Converse options, examining camera on figure on left, and examining neck of headless figure: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Gina: W-W-Wot the bleedin' Nora, 'Oddo?! Wot 'ave you gone an' done?! Ryunosuke: Gina! What are you doing here? Gina: I, I asked Iris, and she said this is where ya'd be, so... SO! Susato: G-Gina! Not so loud in the museum! Sholmes: Madame Tusspells will have you take a position as a waxwork if you're not careful. Ryunosuke: I think there might be a more pressing concern! Gina: I, I still 'ad some flash powder left from six months ago, so... SO! Susato: Alright, Gina, we understand! But please...put down the gun! Gina: Sorry, I...I got scared. Ryunosuke: (You should try being the one on the other end of the barrel.) So...what brings you here, Gina? Gina: Wot brings me 'ere? Wot d'ya think?! We found it! We found that dodgy cove's workshop! Ryunosuke: What?! You found Drebber's workshop?! Gina: Yup! Toby's nose took me straight there! The boss an' the others are headin' over there now in a drag. So come on! Here's the address. I got the boss to write it out. Susato: Oh, thank you, Gina! We'll make our way there at once. Gina: Alright then! See ya there! Sholmes: ...You go. Don't mind me. I'll just stay here...being still. Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: I know my place...in the exhibit over there... Susato: Oh dear, someone is feeling sorry for himself. Ryunosuke: ......... Let's go, Mr Sholmes! You're coming! Sholmes: Your words hearten me, I must say. But if I were to shirk my duties here... ...Madame would have me pay monetary recompense and Iris's dinner plate would be empty once more. Ryunosuke: Forget that! I'll pay for everything! Sholmes: ......... Then there's not a moment to lose, my dear fellow! I shall hail a carriage at once! Ryunosuke: (No offer to share the cost from Mr Sholmes, then...) Susato: I shall gladly pay half, Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: Thank you, Miss Susato. Right, let's go! 23rd October Enoch Drebber's Workshop Ryunosuke: That looks like... Susato: Oh! It's another super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine! Sholmes: Indeed it would appear so. Though only a prototype, naturally. Gina: Ah, so ya got 'ere, then? Susato: Gina! Well done for finding this place! And in such little time... You've really worked miracles! Gina: It's Toby 'ere who's the miracle worker. Toby: Woof! Gregson: Ah...I thought you lot would show up before long. Ryunosuke: Hello, Inspector. (That's one knitted brow... He looks like he's eating a lemon, not a bag of fish and chips...) Susato: So, Inspector...is there any sign of the engineer? Gregson: Sadly not. We didn't find a soul in here. Susato: Oh...what a shame. Ryunosuke: Well, thank you for letting us know about this place and giving us the chance to investigate. Gregson: Accordin' to what Gina tells me, we only found it thanks to a clue that you lot turned up. I wouldn't wanna, say, go to Paris with a debt of gratitude unpaid now, would I? Ryunosuke: ...Thank you. Gregson: Anyway, if you're hopin' to snoop around in here, I'd get crackin'. Lord van Zieks and the Forensic Investigation Team are on their way here as we speak. Ryunosuke: Them again... Gregson: I imagine you've got the picture by now. They don't take too kindly to lawyer types. Ryunosuke: Right. Sholmes: So then, my dear fellow! Let's turn this place upside-down whilst we have the chance! Gregson: And you, Sholmes. Sholmes: Pardon? Gregson: They take even less kindly to 'great detectives' than they do to lawyers. Sholmes: Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha hah! Very droll, Gregson, very droll. But you may consider me nothing more than an inconspicuous waxwork model! Ryunosuke: (Right then...let's see what we can find in here!) After examining overturned trophy, large machine prototype, door, and quiver full of arrows: *Thud* Susato: Oh... Ryunosuke: Is something wrong, Miss Susato? Susato: Well...I thought I heard a noise. From the far side of that door. Well, Gina? Did you hear it too? Gina: Y-Yeah, I 'eard it an' all. Wot d'ya reckon, Toby? Toby: Woof, woof! Gregson: Right, mind the grease! *Thud!* *Thud!* *Thud!* Gregson: Whoever's in there, open up! This is Scotland Yard! .........*Clomp clomp clomp clomp**Squeak... Clunk!* Susato: Oh my... Someone IS in there! Gregson: Argh! This rotten, bleedin' lock! Sholmes: My dear Gregson, as I said only minutes ago... ...if only it were countenanced, I could unlock that door in less than a minute. Gregson: ...! ......... Fine. I'll take the rap for it. Just get us through that blasted door! *Click* Sholmes: There! You may enter at will. Ryunosuke: (You've confused minutes with seconds, I think...) Sholmes: Time is of the essence, I feel. What are we waiting for? Gregson: Nothin' for it, I suppose. This is an emergency. Sholmes: There's a strong possibility that beyond that door...is the engineer you all seek. Be prepared for action, my dear fellow! Ryunosuke: Yes! Mr Drebber's Back Room Ryunosuke: What...? What's happened in here? (Why is everything upside-down?) Gina: Rats! There ain't no one in 'ere after all! Susato: But, but there must be! It was only moments ago that we heard those noises. Ryunosuke: Maybe that was the sound of Drebber running away. Susato: But there's only one door into this room! Sholmes: And no windows that could afford an escape route. Those skylights are too high. Ryunosuke: (...? What's that up there? Are they footprints...on the ceiling?) Gregson: Blow me! What have we here, then? Looks like someone was tryin' to burn somethin' in a hurry. Susato: Oh, that looks like a set of blueprints! Ryunosuke: To what? Gregson: To that Professor Harebrayne's barmy machine, is it? Blimey! If we'd had these, there'd have been no need to muck about tryin' to investigate all that scrap metal! Sholmes: There is something of great interest here, too. This rope was lying on the floor at the foot of that pillar. Ryunosuke: A rope? What's significant about that? Sholmes: ...Never mind. You see, but you do not observe, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: ...! Susato: We must investigate the entire room thoroughly! And before the Forensic Investigation Team arrive, too! Ryunosuke: Um...Mr Sholmes? Have you found something? Sholmes: Ah, Mr Naruhodo. Yes, in point of fact, something rather fascinating. What do you make...of this? Ryunosuke: Hm, let's see... (I've never seen anything like it before.) It looks like a bundle of thick cigars wrapped up in a large watch to me, but- Aaaaaah! Ryunosuke: Miss Susato! What's the matter? Susato: That, that, that, that... That's a... Surely that's a time bomb...isn't it? Gregson: WHAAAAAAAAT?! Did you say...?! Gina: A...time bomb...? Ryunosuke: Um...sorry, but... ...what is a 'time bomb' exactly? Gregson: Eh? Sholmes: Ah ha ha ha ha hah! You truly are one of a kind, Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: (I won't take that as a compliment...) Gina: Hah! Ya don't know nuffin', do ya, 'Oddo! Ryunosuke: ...You haven't got a clue what it is, either, have you, Gina? Sholmes: I invite you to consult a dictionary later, Mr Naruhodo. But this particular specimen is no time bomb. Though I confess it has a very similar appearance. Susato: Oh! Oh, well, thank goodness! But then...what is it? Sholmes: ......... I see... So that's it... Ryunosuke: ...! Susato: Goodness! Mr Sholmes... Have you seen to the heart of the matter? Sholmes: There are times when I consider my lot most unfair. For I'm fated never to know how it feels to flounder as you do when a puzzle presents itself. But...I have learnt to accept the hardships that come with being a great detective, Miss Susato. Ryunosuke: (Here we go. I feel a great deduction coming...) Sholmes: Once again, I can draw two conclusions from the scene we see before us. The first... ...is that the inverted nature of the furniture in this room is the work of Drebber himself. Susato: Oh! But how could you...? Sholmes: And the second conclusion... ...is that the small device on the floor there is without question completely genuine. Susato: Please, Mr Sholmes! You must explain everything! Sholmes: ...It would be a pleasure. After all, it is a great detective's civic duty to teach Scotland Yard the finer points of the trade. Gregson: ......... Ryunosuke: (Well, Inspector Gregson seems delighted with the idea, anyway.) Sholmes: Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Susato: Oh, you deflected the inspector's glare with such fortitude there, Mr Sholmes! Well done! Sholmes: You're too kind, my dear madam. I hereby dedicate this great deduction to you. Kindly stand just there, Miss Susato. Susato: Oh...yes. I'd be delighted! Sholmes: So...shall we begin? Once again, Herlock Sholmes is proud to present...his 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'! The Great Deduction The game is afoot! Topic 1 Flipped Furniture Sholmes: It's plain to see that this room is in complete disarray. The bed, the table and chairs, the lamp... Everything is upside-down. Almost as if every item in the room had, until recently, been happily positioned on the ceiling... ...before falling straight down onto the floor. Susato: Every item in the room was on the ceiling... Are, are you suggesting that...? Sholmes: Indeed. The key here... ...is gravity. It would appear that technology has at last succeeded in freeing us from the great pull of the earth. For the gravity in this room was reversed, and then... suddenly restored to normality! Susato: Goodness! Sholmes: The inverted furniture clearly reveals the truth about the part gravity played in this whole business. I quite understand your scepticism, Miss Susato. I, too, was incredulous at first. However, my conviction in my analysis was cemented when I observed...this. An anti-gravity device...almost identical to one that featured in a dream of mine only the other day, in fact. Susato: But, but then why does it have a clock on it? Sholmes: A most relevant question, indeed. That is a timing device that controls when the gravity direction will switch. There was clearly a requirement for the engineer to be able to restore normal gravity automatically. And the commotion we heard earlier from the other side of the door was the moment that restoration occurred. Yes, the reason why everything in here has been turned upside-down is because of the anti-gravity device! So you see, we need look no further to explain the state in which we now find this room. The direction in which gravity acts in here was reversed by Mr Drebber... ...before being restored to normality in an automatic fashion some time later by the timer device! I have witnessed precisely this scene in a dream I once had when I fell out of bed. Topic 1 Flipped Furniture Conclusion Because gravity was reversed Topic 2 Missing Engineer Sholmes: Now, let us consider the next conundrum: What was our engineer friend's aim? Indubitably, the greatest clue we have to explain his actions...is above our heads. Susato: Yes, how is it possible that there are footprints all the way up there on the ceiling? Sholmes: A question whose answer will lead us neatly to the truth, my dear madam. The reason there are footprints on the ceiling...is because of the nearby skylight! Of course, Drebber's aim was singular: to escape. However, there is but one way into this room. ...Excepting the skylight, that is. Susato: Ah... Sholmes: By inverting the gravity in here, Drebber was able to 'fall' conveniently to the ceiling... ...and make his escape via the otherwise inaccessible skylight, leaving those footprints behind on the way. Susato: But the ceiling in here is very high, Mr Sholmes. If the gravity reversal was sudden, wouldn't Mr Drebber have fallen up to the ceiling rather violently? Sholmes: Hm, 'falling up' is both scientifically and philosophically a rather interesting concept, I feel. But the man was cornered with nowhere to run, so escape through the skylight was his only option. You may recall that I found this in the room earlier, which I believe offers a solution. Susato: Oh! The rope... Sholmes: To reach the intended destination, what better tool than this rope? By anchoring one end to the wall, the man was able to 'lower' himself safely to the ceiling. Which explains how Drebber was able to escape this room before our arrival. He reversed the pull of gravity and fled via the skylight! And personally, I should very much like to reverse the pull of gravity again now...just for fun. Topic 2 Missing Engineer Conclusion Escaped via the skylight Sholmes: Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this topsy-turvy puzzle! Gregson: ......... Gina: ......... Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: (She's completely spellbound...) Um, Mr Sholmes...there is just one thing that troubles me. Sholmes: I would expect nothing less. You're destined to be troubled by 'just one thing' for the rest of your life. Ryunosuke: The thing is... Is such a thing actually possible? An anti-gravity device, I mean. Sholmes: ...I would say that with man's current scientific knowledge at the turn of the twentieth century... ...it's no more possible than instantaneous kinesis! Ryunosuke: ......... But your whole deduction hinges on it! Sholmes: Ah, but my dear fellow... ...when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth... ...however improbable it may seem. Ryunosuke: Haah... Sholmes: It's a marvellous line, wouldn't you agree? One of my more enduring pearls of wisdom. I had Iris come up with the exact phrasing. My original was...clumsy. Ryunosuke: ...Yes, I have a feeling I've read it in something that Miss Susato lent me once. Susato: Susato: Actually...there IS one other thing, Mr Sholmes... Ryunosuke: (Ah, the spell's broken at last.) Susato: The rope you found was on the floor, wasn't it? Sholmes: Indeed it was. In lonely coils near the wall. Susato: But...if Mr Drebber had used it to escape in the way you described... ...wouldn't it still be tied to the wall? Sholmes: ......... Mysteries inevitably unravel in the end. As, I think you'll find, do ropes. And as evidence of such, you need only look at the mystery we faced in this room, now skilfully unravelled. Ryunosuke: (That argument is as circular as the coils of rope...) Susato: I think perhaps we might need to give Mr Sholmes the usual little helping hand. I'm sure with some minor corrections, the great detective's great deduction will lead us to the truth! Ryunosuke: Yes, you're right. And we must do it quickly, before Enoch Drebber gets too far away! Sholmes: If you're ready, then let us resume... ...Herlock Sholmes's 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'! Course Correction Hold it, Mr Sholmes! Topic 1 Flipped Furniture Conclusion Because gravity was reversed Sholmes: It's plain to see that this room is in complete disarray. The bed, the table and chairs, the lamp... Everything is upside-down. Almost as if every item in the room had, until recently, been happily positioned on the ceiling... ...before falling straight down onto the floor. Susato: Every item in the room was on the ceiling... Are, are you suggesting that...? Sholmes: Indeed. The key here... ...is gravity. It would appear that technology has at last succeeded in freeing us from the great pull of the earth. For the gravity in this room was reversed, and then... suddenly restored to normality! Susato: Goodness! Sholmes: The inverted furniture clearly reveals the truth about the part gravity played in this whole business. Susato: To think gravity could have been reversed in this very room! I find the whole idea utterly enthralling! Only Mr Sholmes could conceive of such an explanation! Ryunosuke: But the man himself admitted it was a scientific impossibility, so... Susato: Yes, you're quite right. We must completely discount the idea at once. Ryunosuke: Ooh, that's unusually merciless of you, Miss Susato. Susato: 'When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth.' The great detective himself said so, didn't he? Ryunosuke: While refusing to part with his dreams of anti-gravity devices... Susato: ...Yes, I suppose so. Ryunosuke: Well, let's see if examining this topsy-turvy scene a little more closely... ...reveals some proof that shows exactly what the gravity in this room was or wasn't doing! The inverted furniture clearly reveals the truth about the part gravity played in this whole business. Susato: If the reversal of gravity is scientifically impossible, perhaps we can prove it didn't occur? Ryunosuke: Well, to prove a hypothesis is wrong... Susato: ...The easiest way is just to find an obvious exception. Ryunosuke: (Let's have another good look around...) Ryunosuke: The upright vase clearly reveals the truth about the part gravity played in this whole business. Sholmes: Upon my word, Mr Naruhodo, you've surpassed yourself. By completely turning my argument on its head! Trying to impress your assistant here, perhaps? Ryunosuke: ...No one is trying to steal your spotlight here, Mr Sholmes. Trust me. Sholmes: As you rightly say, though it appears at first glance that all the furniture in the room is upside-down... ...this unassuming, slender vase is standing keenly to attention. And unlike the large safe, there is nothing affixing it to the floor. Ryunosuke: And it's the exception that breaks the rule. Sholmes: In short, much as it pains me... ...the gravity in this room was never inverted at all! Ryunosuke: ...My, my deepest sympathies for your loss. Susato: Oh, poor Mr Sholmes... Sholmes: But the show must go on! So...let us continue with our deductions. Now that we know this contrivance is not in fact an anti-gravity device, there remains but one other possibility. Ryunosuke: ...You don't say. Sholmes: Someone deliberately turned over every piece of furniture in here! Ryunosuke: Which might sound obvious, but leaves one mystery very much unsolved. Namely, why would anyone choose to do that? Sholmes: Quite! And naturally, there is an explanation. Yes, the reason why everything in here has been turned upside-down is because of the anti-gravity device! Ryunosuke: He's absolutely determined that this device must have something to do with it, isn't he? Susato: I'm afraid the lure of an exciting scientific explanation is too strong. Ryunosuke: Well...there's no doubt that somebody did this. Somebody turned all this furniture over. So whoever it was must have had a reason. Susato: I'm afraid nothing comes to mind at all, though. Ryunosuke: Well, let's look around and see if the answer presents itself. Yes, the reason why everything in here has been turned upside-down is because of the anti-gravity device! Ryunosuke: Now we've shown it was nothing to do with gravity, we know somebody must have done this to the furniture. But who? And why? Susato: Yes, those are the questions we really need to answer! Ryunosuke: Well we at least need to resolve one of them here! Ryunosuke: Yes, the reason why everything in here has been turned upside-down is because of the safe combination! Sholmes: Precisely! I believe, Mr Naruhodo... ...that you had a very similar experience once, did you not? Ryunosuke: Yes! Last year... ...when I bought a lottery ticket and noted the ticket number down on the inside cover of a book just in case! Sholmes: That's it! For people are forgetful souls at heart, and always make a written note of important information. Susato: ...Just keeping the ticket itself safe would be more sensible, I think. Sholmes: And what, pray, happened next, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: When the day of the draw came round... ...I'd forgotten which book I'd written the number in and had to turn my room upside-down to find it! Sholmes: That's it! For people are forgetful souls at heart, and always forget where they've noted things down! Susato: Not if you always note things in the same place... Ryunosuke: I actually won the second prize, you know. But I couldn't remember which magazine I'd slipped the ticket into, so I had to turn my room upside- Sholmes: Thank you, Mr Naruhodo, but I believe I've proved my point now. Which is that a very similar scenario has clearly unfolded in this room. Ryunosuke: Finding himself requiring access to the safe, the occupant of this room needed the combination code. He remembered that he'd written it on the underside of a piece of furniture, but forgot which one. Sholmes: ...Leading to the state in which we now find the room. Yes, Mr Drebber overturned all the furniture in here... ...in a desperate hurry to locate the combination code that would unlock the safe! Topic 1 Flipped Furniture Conclusion Because gravity was reversed To find the safe combination Solved Topic 2 Missing Engineer Conclusion Escaped via the skylight Sholmes: Now, let us consider the next conundrum: What was our engineer friend's aim? Indubitably, the greatest clue we have to explain his actions...is above our heads. Susato: Yes, how is it possible that there are footprints all the way up there on the ceiling? Sholmes: A question whose answer will lead us neatly to the truth, my dear madam. The reason there are footprints on the ceiling...is because of the nearby skylight! Susato: Well, if a change in the direction of gravity can't explain it, then how did those footprints get there? Ryunosuke: Yes, I feel as though that particular mystery has just become even harder to solve. Susato: I can't think of any other way to explain it at all. Ooh... Life was so much simpler in those halcyon days when gravity could be reversed. Ryunosuke: It was minutes ago. And those 'halcyon days' never existed in the first place. Susato: Well, I suppose we must simply put our faith in Mr Sholmes and observe the area in more detail. Ryunosuke: (...Putting our faith in Mr Sholmes is what gets us into these situations in the first place...) The reason there are footprints on the ceiling...is because of the nearby skylight! Ryunosuke: Those footprints up there on the ceiling really are a puzzle. Susato: And as they're so close to the skylight... ...it really is very hard to believe the two are unrelated. Ryunosuke: But perhaps we need to approach this from a different angle... Ryunosuke: The reason there are footprints on the ceiling...is because of the nearby shoe! Sholmes: And on closer inspection, there are clearly footprints all over the balloon as well. In other words, the aim was never the skylight at all, but the balloon. Susato: But...for what purpose? Sholmes: A green balloon... Hmmm, that seems somewhat familiar data. Ryunosuke: Ah! Susato: It was a piece of a green balloon's envelope that Mr Naruhodo and Iris found at the scene! Ryunosuke: And inside the green balloon that Master Gotts claims he saw above the stage when the incident occurred... ...was the second birdcage. The crux of the whole instantaneous kinesis deception... Susato: You, you mean to say...? Sholmes: If we assume the balloon in here is a model of the one used on the day... ...there is a strong possibility something may be concealed inside it. Something our absconder was desperate to retrieve before making a hasty getaway. Ryunosuke: But, but the balloon's out of reach! Sholmes: Hence why he resorted to a projectile. Namely...the shoe. Ryunosuke: Ah! Sholmes: Most probably, Drebber intended to tear a hole in the envelope by assailing it with the shoe. However, his efforts were thwarted when the shoe itself became a prisoner of those lofty heights. Susato: Oh, dear... We desperately need to examine that balloon. If only there were some way we could see inside... Sholmes: You may recall that I found this in the room earlier, which I believe offers a solution. Susato: Oh! The rope... Sholmes: To reach the intended destination, what better tool than this rope? Susato: ...Mr Sholmes has managed to bring the deduction back to the rope! Ryunosuke: Alright, I have to admit...that was clever. So we just throw the rope up to the balloon and then pull it down to us on the ground? Susato: ...Which is much easier said than done, I feel. And could take us a very long time as well. Ryunosuke: True. Perhaps we need a more surefire method. In fact, we already have one of course, don't we?! To reach the intended destination, what better tool than this rope? Ryunosuke: Oh, look! The hotheaded Mr Sholmes is trying to lasso the balloon! Susato: It would be wonderful if he succeeded. Then we could pull it down to us. But it would be even more wonderful if there were some better way. Ryunosuke: (And we need to think of it fast, before Mr Sholmes starts tiring of being a cowboy...) Ryunosuke: To reach the intended destination, what better tool than this crossbow? Susato: That was found at the scene, in fact! Ryunosuke: And in all likelihood, belongs to Mr Drebber. Sholmes: If the man had only brought it away with him that day... ...he could have avoided losing a shoe at such a critical time as this. Sholmes: So...shall we? Your curiosity is deeply stirred no doubt, my dear fellows. What is it that Enoch Drebber has hidden inside that balloon...? *BAM* Susato: Aaaaaah! Ryunosuke: W-What the...? A, a waxwork? Sholmes: Indeed it is. A waxwork head inside a metal mask. A mask that is shut tight and fastened with a strong and quite impenetrable lock. Ryunosuke: (So we can't see the face inside, that means.) Susato: Just a moment... This...this is the head of a waxwork model? Does that mean...? Oh goodness! Sholmes: I see you've joined the dots, Miss Susato. Excellent. Ryunosuke: Ah! (Of course! A headless waxwork model!) The case of the abducted Madame Tusspells model that you'd 'largely' solved... It was only the head of the killer that was still missing! Sholmes: Indeed it was. But I believe Madame Tusspells will now have to settle her sizeable account with me. This, as you have now surmised, is the head of the infamous Professor. Ryunosuke: Yes... Susato: But why is it here? Sholmes: ...This conclusively confirms my suspicions. The man responsible for stealing the Professor from Madame Tusspells... ...and returning it - sans tête - earlier today...was none other than Enoch Drebber! Ryunosuke: (This is incredible. Professor Harebrayne's case and the waxwork abduction are... They're inextricably linked! By Enoch Drebber's workshop!) The waxwork head has been entered into the Court Record. Sholmes: Well...it appears our logical pleasure cruise has come to an end, my dear fellows. All that remains is... Yes, to speak with the architect of this adventure. Susato: The architect? Ryunosuke: You mean...Mr Drebber? Sholmes: As it seems quite impossible that he escaped via one of the skylights... ...obviously the man must still be here in the room. Susato: WHAT?! Sholmes: And his location should be abundantly clear... ...if you simply reflect on the journey we've made together during this deduction. Ryunosuke: (Enoch Drebber is right here, somewhere in this room?) Sholmes: So, Mr Naruhodo, will you do the honours? Ryunosuke: ...Yes, of course. Mr Drebber's hiding place must be the... Mr Drebber's hiding place must be the... Susato: Where could Mr Drebber be hiding? I'm sure that we've already come across a clue that reveals the answer, you know. Ryunosuke: (Yes, it was when we deduced why all the furniture in here was upside-down, wasn't it? That gave us the answer, I'm sure.) Susato: We're very close now, Mr Naruhodo! I can sense it! Ryunosuke: Before we gained access to this back room, we heard noises from in here. Sholmes: Which tells us that the engineer was still in the building at that point in time. Ryunosuke: He was in fact searching for the combination to his safe. Sholmes: And pressed for time, made no attempt to right the furniture that he overturned in the process. From which we can deduce that his search for the combination happened very recently indeed. In summary...Mr Enoch Drebber... ...is, at this very moment, inside the safe! Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this topsy-turvy puzzle! Topic 2 Missing Engineer Conclusion Escaped via the skylight Inside the safe Solved Deduction CompleteElementary! Sholmes: So...Mr Naruhodo. I think perhaps it's time we ended this game of hide-and-seek, don't you? Ryunosuke: By opening the safe, you mean? Sholmes: What else? Ryunosuke: Let's see... The combination was one... Susato: Four three two five eight two. Ryunosuke: I knew that! (Alright then. Here goes...) You found me... Gregson: Right then, sir... Mr Enoch Drebber, I presume? Drebber: Correct. Ryunosuke: You'd better start talking! You tricked Professor Harebrayne with that bogus machine you built! Susato: And you shall have to explain the theft of the waxwork from Madame Tusspells as well! Drebber: Whilst I would be delighted to answer your many questions... ...personally, I would advise that you deactivate my little parcel first. Ryunosuke: Deactivate...? Susato: Your parcel...? Drebber: I refer of course... ...to the time bomb. I left it in a most prominent position. Susato: Ah! Drebber: Ha-ha-ha. I see. Stunned silence. You're all gearing up to die with me then? Susato: Nooooooo! Susato: Mr Sholmes! With only seven seconds to spare! Ryunosuke: That was too close for comfort! I've got one foot in the grave already! Gregson: Are you tryin' to help us get a killer, or get us killed?! Susato: Mr Sholmes's deductions can be...completely life-altering, can't they? Sholmes: Well, my dear fellows, that was a close shave. The resemblance to an anti-gravity device is really quite startling, I must say. Susato: Anti-gravity devices don't exist! Ryunosuke: (Whew, I wouldn't push it, Mr Sholmes...) After clearing all Converse options: Ryunosuke: I think we have a fairly good idea of what's been going on here now. But what about the two incidents you've evidently been involved in recently? Drebber: ......... Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne's instantaneous kinesis experiment at the Great Exhibition... ...and the waxwork model you stole, which this head belongs to. Drebber: That's no ordinary head, you know. That's the head...of the Professor. Clad in a mask with a lock so strong, I'm unable to open it safely to reveal the killer's identity. I've been considering carrying it around as...protection. After all- ???: That's enough! Sithe: What's going on here, Gregson? I'm sure you're aware that I have sole jurisdiction to investigate here. Gregson: Ah, um... Yes, well... Ryunosuke: (Dr Sithe again. So the Forensic Investigation Team are here...) Sithe: And you know full well this engineer is a key witness. Why are you allowing this lawyer access to him? If Lord Stronghart knew of this, you'd be finished. Gregson: ......... Sithe: You lot. Leave at once. Sholmes: My dear madam, there's no need for such a threatening tone, I assure you. After all, that's no way to greet an old acquaintance, is it, Dr Sithe? Sithe: Hello...Sholmes. Ryunosuke: (Mr Sholmes knows Dr Sithe?) Sholmes: If it's protecting the machine next door that's causing such a sour expression on your face, you are quite misguided. It's really nothing more than a shell, you- Sithe: Get out! Sholmes: But of course. We'll show ourselves the door. ...I see you haven't softened at all. Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: Yes? Sholmes: It would appear that our delightfully entertaining investigations have run their course for today. Ryunosuke: But, but Mr Sholmes...! Sholmes: Let us leave this place in the doctor's capable hands. Ryunosuke: ...! Sithe: I said get out! Now! All of you! Your presence here is not required either, Gregson. Gregson: ......... Understood. But I'll just say one thing before I head off: If it wasn't for this lawyer an' his companions... ...we'd never have found this place. And the whole workshop would've been blown to bits. There was a time bomb set in here that this lot disarmed. Ryunosuke: Inspector... Sithe: ......... Drebber: Kuh kuh kuh... Gregson: ...! Somethin' given you a chuckle, has it, Drebber? Drebber: Ah, so sorry. Didn't mean to offend. You're quite right of course. You did disarm the time bomb, didn't you? Yes... You did disarm that one. Gina: Eh? Wot are you...? 'That' one? Ya, ya mean...? Drebber: Kuh kuh kuh... It was an hour later that we heard the news. Of the enormous explosion that ripped through the experimentation stage at the Great Exhibition. Professor Harebrayne's invention and all its secrets...were blown away forever. To be continued... Enoch Drebber's Workshop (before examining Herlock Sholmes or timer device in Mr Drebber's Back Room)\nThe Return of the Great Departed Soul TranscriptPart 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 424th October, 9:11 a.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' AntechamberHarebrayne: Good morning to you, Mr Naruhodo!Ryunosuke: Ah, good morning, Professor. Ready for today's proceedings?Harebrayne: ......... I hope so... I should be... Even I, with nothing left to-Sholmes:Good morning, my dear fellows!Ryunosuke: Oh, Mr Sholmes! You're here!Sholmes: Why, naturally! A true gentleman stands shoulder to shoulder with his friends in battle at all times!Ryunosuke: Thank you. I really appreciate it. ...I'll...see you later, then. Now, Professor... We really need you to remain calm in the courtroom today.Susato: Yes. Do try your hardest not to enter the witness stand uninvited again.Harebrayne: Yes! I will! I, I realise it was a mistake, but I-Sholmes:My dear fellows, I must interject!Ryunosuke: Oh...you're still here, Mr Sholmes. What's the matter?Sholmes: Surely you've overlooked some praise, have you not? To be cast in my direction, hm?Ryunosuke: Sorry? I don't follow.Sholmes: Must I spell it out? I, the great Herlock Sholmes... The greatest detective, of worldwide acclamation... ...arose at some ungodly hour to be here now! First thing in the morning! A miracle, you must agree!Ryunosuke: Well...if I must agree, then...Sholmes: As you know, my sleep is quite impregnable. Iris had to employ her full gamut of tactics: She pulled the covers off, shook me, poked both cheeks, punched me and kicked me from the bed. Then she poured a boiling cup of her latest experimental blend on my face and at last I was bestirred!Susato: Oh my... Iris has been busy.Ryunosuke: Iris doesn't have it in her to go that far. She's too nice.Harebrayne: Ah, I sense the spirit of a fellow scientist! One who relishes the infinite possibilities of blending tea!Sholmes: I'm the one worthy of praise here! Not Iris! This is my victory!???:Sorry to cut in...Ryunosuke: Oh, Inspector Gregson! Good morning!Sholmes: Gregson, my dear fellow, why the grim expression at this delightfully early hour?Gregson: Oh, I don't know. Maybe because I've been confronted with a grimmer expression, eh?Sholmes: Dear me... Are you going to take that insult lying down, Professor?Harebrayne: Wha...? WHAT...? I DOOON'T KNOOOW!Ryunosuke: (Poor Professor...)Gregson: Anyway, here's the paperwork you asked for.Ryunosuke: What paperwork?Sholmes: Ah, I took the liberty of requesting it yesterday. I have a feeling it may prove useful.Gregson: You wouldn't believe the hoops I had to jump through to get this brought out of the archives. It's the Professor's autopsy report.Susato: That... That mass murderer's?!Ryunosuke: (Who killed five members of the aristocracy...)Gregson: He was found guilty in a closed trial ten years ago now. It was all done under wraps. And he was quickly executed soon after the trial. ...It's all in here.The killer's autopsy report has been entered into the Court Record.Ryunosuke: I, I don't know what to say! Thank you, Inspector!Sholmes: Yes, much obliged, Gregson.Gregson: Us lowly lot at the Yard are just doing what we can...in the shadow of the great detective Sholmes, of course.Ryunosuke: Well then, Professor Harebrayne...this is it! Today we're going to lay all this to rest at last.Susato: I wish you the best of luck, Professor!Harebrayne: ......... I suppose...he'll be in there today, will he? Drebber...Susato: Yes. We expect the prosecution to summon him as a witness.Harebrayne: I'm still amazed that you managed to find him in just one day... I really owe you both so much!Bailiff: Counsel! And the defendant! The trial is about to resume. Kindly make your way into the courtroom at once!Ryunosuke: (This is it then. The final chapter. Funny. My heart's racing a little... I've not felt this before, actually. This strange foreboding... As if...something's going to happen in this trial that I'm not ready for. But I can't let that distract me from the only thing that really matters... Finding the truth!)24th October, 9:30 a.m. The Old Bailey CourtroomJudge: In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session again. We resume the public hearing of Albert Harebrayne, here present, who stands accused of murder. Are the counsels for the prosecution and defence ready to proceed?Van Zieks: The prosecution is ready, My Lord.Ryunosuke: ......... The defence is ready, My Lord. (As promised, Lord van Zieks has his apprentice with him. His apprentice with memory loss...)Susato: .........Judge: If I may, Lord van Zieks...Van Zieks: Yes, My Lord?Judge: There appears to be someone standing at your side...Van Zieks: Ah, yes. My apprentice and assistant. The prosecution believes today's proceedings will see the complexity of this case rise considerably. I therefore instructed my assistant to attend to ensure the smooth running of the trial.Ryunosuke: (And the smooth running of liquid refreshments, by the look of it...)Susato: The way he holds himself... The way he moves... It couldn't be anyone else...Ryunosuke: But he's still suffering from amnesia...so there's really nothing we can do at the moment.Susato: I know, but... Oh, this is so very hard.Judge: It would appear the prosecution has done a fine job in responding to the demands of the court made yesterday. I understand you have successfully secured the engineer who disappeared from the scene on the day in question.Van Zieks: ...Yes, My Lord. I intend to call him as a witness shortly.Judge: Very good, very good. Now then, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...who have been chosen at random to represent the will of the people in this courtroom today... ...are you ready and willing to proceed?Juror No. 1: Of course, My Lord. I'm sure we all understand the importance of doing our civic duty.Juror No. 2: I do so despise deception and deceit. I find it so very wearing...Juror No. 3: To take a man's life with a conjuring trick... It is against the magician's code, not to mention the law.Juror No. 4: Any fake scientists should feel the wrath of God, if you ask me!Juror No. 5: Um, we 'ave to listen to what's said on both sides 'the fence, and um...then settle on one... That's it, isn't it?Juror No. 6: Wasn't like this in my day. Wasn't like this at all...Judge: If all parties are ready to proceed, you may begin, Lord van Zieks.Van Zieks: Before I do, My Lord, there is a report I must read to the court. Yesterday at the Great Exhibition grounds, the evidence of primary importance in this case... ...the super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine, which was installed on the experimentation stage... ...was deliberately destroyed in an explosion effected by an unknown person or persons.Juror No. 1: It was...WHAT?!Juror No. 6: An explosion?!Juror No. 4: This...is an outrage!Judge: Yes, I heard this grave news yesterday. Scotland Yard submitted a report to my office in the evening. I read that the machine was blasted to smithers, and the wreckage reduced to ashes in the flames.Van Zieks: I have here a photographic print of the scene, taken in the wake of the explosion. It shows what little remains of the machine.Judge: Hm, yes... A terrible business...Ryunosuke: (He did it to destroy the evidence, did he?)Susato: That Enoch Drebber...Judge: The court will take this print as evidence, Counsel.The post-explosion photograph has been entered into the Court Record.Van Zieks: Late yesterday afternoon... ...the protection afforded to the machine by the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act was revoked. However, before a thorough investigation could begin, the invention was obliterated from existence. As such...this will become a very different trial.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: As it stands now, with no evidence on which to draw meaningful conclusions... ...the authenticity of the kinesis machine will remain forever in obscurity.Judge: Hm, indeed... A most unfortunate state of affairs.Van Zieks: However, one thing remains clear: The victim's death was the result of the actions of the accused. Of that we can be certain. For it was the accused himself who was operating the machine and who ultimately caused its loss of control.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: As Lord van Zieks rightly says, this is a very different trial now.Van Zieks: ...!Ryunosuke: The accused accepts responsibility for his part in the events that transpired. He acknowledges that Mr Asman died as a result of the accident caused by his machine's malfunction. However, unbeknownst to the professor... ...he was being deliberately deceived by a pair of very clever fraudsters.Judge: Names, Counsel, if you please.Ryunosuke: The engineer, Mr Enoch Drebber, and the victim himself, Mr Odie Asman.Van Zieks: .........Ryunosuke: So what exactly were these two men up to behind the defendant's back?! The defence intends to expose that information, thus establishing the unequivocal innocence of the defendant!Judge: Thank you, Counsels. The positions of the prosecution and defence have been clearly stated. Lord van Zieks, summon your first witness, please.Van Zieks: At once, My Lord. The prosecution calls the engineer, Mr Enoch Drebber, to the stand!Van Zieks: State your name and occupation for the court.Drebber: Name...Enoch Drebber. Occupation... ...hard to pin down, I would say.See that black monocle?Yes, why do I feel as though I've seen it somewhere before...?Oh! You, too? I had exactly the same feeling myself.Hm...Drebber: .........Judge: Your file indicates that you are currently being investigated in connection with another case. The theft...of a waxwork model, is it? A most extraordinary-sounding business.Drebber: ...But that has no bearing on this trial, I assure you. Cleave it from your mind.Van Zieks: You're familiar with the public experiment carried out at the Great Exhibition some days ago? The accused's super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis demonstration.Drebber: Yes...you could say that. I am aware of it. There was a terrible accident, wasn't there?Van Zieks: It was you, Mr Drebber, who constructed the vast machine used in the experiment. Or so our investigations indicate. Can you confirm your involvement?Drebber: Yes, I constructed it. In precise accordance with the blueprints. But that's all.Van Zieks: Then the court would be very interested to hear your thoughts about the machine, I'm sure.Drebber: ......... An amazing device, if you ask me. The pinnacle of modern science, making instantaneous kinesis a reality at last.Ryunosuke: What?Judge: Good... Good gracious! Do you mean to say... ...that the experiment was bona fide? Is that your belief, sir?Drebber: Yes, that is very much my belief. Such a waste that it blew up.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: But we've already established the machine was nothing more than a prop for an elaborate conjuring trick!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: You've established nothing of the sort.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: All that was shown during yesterday's proceedings... ...is that the same outcome could have been produced by means of stage trickery. The defence merely proposed a method and demonstrated its feasibility, nothing more.Ryunosuke: But...but...Judge: We've procrastinated long enough, I feel. Witness, you will now give your formal testimony... ...about the machine that you constructed for the purpose of the demonstration at the Great Exhibition.Drebber: ...Understood.Witness Testimony - The Kinesis Machine -Drebber: I met the young professor approximately one year ago, through Mr Asman's introduction. He provided me with the blueprints and I constructed the machine to his precise specifications. It was no trick. If the whole show was a fraud, it would have required a body double. Tell me...did the victim have a twin? All the spectators saw the birdcage appear above their heads and then crash headfirst into the Crystal Tower. A terrible accident, I grant you. Perhaps the science on which the machine was built was flawed somehow?Ryunosuke: A, a body double?!Drebber: That goes without saying, surely? To give the impression that something has moved when in reality it hasn't. It's a basic conjuring principle. The deception cannot be achieved without substituting the original with a fake at some point in the performance. But would I be right in saying...you haven't managed to establish anything along those lines?Ryunosuke: Ugh...Van Zieks: Incidentally... ...the prosecution has already confirmed that Mr Asman had no twin siblings.Judge: Hmmm... It's my understanding that this witness is well-versed in conjuring artfulness. But such talents do not indicate that he was actually able to accomplish what he claims. Namely the construction of what, by all accounts, must have been an extremely complex scientific machine.Drebber: ...Whatever do you mean?Judge: Yesterday's proceedings brought the true nature of your past exploits to light, Mr Drebber.Ryunosuke: Indeed it did, My Lord! As a swindler who preys on innocent scientists to elicit government grant money through conjuring know-how.Drebber: ...Yes, it's true that I possess considerable knowledge of stage magic. But crucially, my scientific knowledge more than matches that of any academic in the field.Van Zieks: Investigation of the witness's workshop attests to that claim, My Lord. As evidence, the police found this Royal Society trophy for young talent in science there.Susato: Yes, that's true. We spotted it there ourselves!Drebber: If a hypothesis is sound, it can always be forged into a physical manifestation...with sufficient skill. Though I may have sold the secrets of some deceptive wiles to snivelling, talentless scientists in the past.Judge: Would, would you therefore assert...that the explosion of the machine was...Drebber: An unfortunate accident. ...Or, of course, a deliberate act of murder carried out by misuse of the science.Judge: Counsel for the Defence...your cross-examination, please!Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord!Cross-Examination - The Kinesis Machine -Drebber: I met the young professor approximately one year ago, through Mr Asman's introduction.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So you were already acquainted with Mr Asman himself? Drebber: Not really. By chance, I'd seen his name mentioned in the papers, that's all. But I had no interest in his private affairs. If he was an unscrupulous investor, it was no concern of mine. As long as people pay their bills, I take up my tools and construct what they ask for. Ryunosuke: So why did Mr Asman approach you in particular, then? Drebber: Who can say? I presume because my name is associated with excellence in engineering. Ryunosuke: ...Not to mention excellence in fraud. Drebber: Hard to gauge. But the point is, all I did was construct the machine according to the blueprints I was given. Van Zieks: In other words, the kinesis machine was built on solid scientific principles. Drebber: Yes, you might say that. Professor Harebrayne certainly has a mind like no other.Drebber: He provided me with the blueprints and I constructed the machine to his precise specifications. It was no trick.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: It's clear that you have both scientific knowledge and knowledge of conjuring magic, however. Drebber: The more knowledge you have, the better equipped you are to handle whatever comes along. But your implication is that I furnished the machine with some trickery, I think. Ryunosuke: It's a possibility that we have to explore. Drebber: Unfortunately though, the machine has been blown to kingdom come. So there's really nothing left to explore...is there? Van Zieks: It appears that the kinesis machine was fitted with a timed explosive device of some kind. Drebber: And there's nothing left of that device either. Not a single shred of evidence remaining...I hear. Ryunosuke: (He must have planned all this from the outset.) Drebber: But in any case, it's abundantly clear that the experiment couldn't have been a trick.Drebber: If the whole show was a fraud, it would have required a body double. Tell me...did the victim have a twin?Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Of course! That's it! Mr Asman was a twin! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: Perhaps my learned friend wasn't listening earlier. ...Mr Asman had no twin siblings. Ryunosuke: No, I heard you before. ...But the thread of hope hadn't quite left me. Susato: The demonstration could have been a trick, if there was somebody who looked sufficiently like the victim. But Dr Sithe absolutely ruled that out as a possibility. Van Zieks: It is beyond question that the victim himself, Mr Asman, did move from the stage to the Crystal Tower. The fingerprints found at the scene attest to the fact. Susato: So it can't have been orchestrated using someone who looked identical to Mr Asman then. Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: What are you thinking, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Oh! No...nothing. Just that the idea of someone who looked identical to the victim is playing on my mind...Drebber: All the spectators saw the birdcage appear above their heads and then crash headfirst into the Crystal Tower.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: It crashed 'headfirst', you say? Drebber: According to the many witness reports from those there at the time, yes. Ryunosuke: Were you not there at the exhibition grounds on the day? Drebber: Hm...unlikely. I rarely leave my workshop. Ryunosuke: Yet another of your unique inventions was found at the scene. Drebber: ......... Well...it was the unveiling of a machine I'd laboured over for many months. I saw it clearly with my own eyes. The birdcage plummeted headfirst into the tower. Ryunosuke: What a surprise... Drebber: I believe the victim's neck was broken from the headlong fall, wasn't it? Ryunosuke: How would you have come by that information? Drebber: Even an infernal recluse like me reads the newspapers, you know. According to the reports, two injuries were apparent on the victim's body. Ryunosuke: Yes, he'd been stabbed in the chest by a screwdriver believed to belong to the defendant... ...and he had broken vertebrae as a result of a fall from a considerable height. Van Zieks: ...Correct. My learned friend has been doing his research, it seems. Ryunosuke: Do we know which injury was the fatal one? Van Zieks: Sadly not. Forensic science is not yet at a level where such things can be determined. Judge: Hm... Van Zieks: What we do know is that the victim died having sustained both injuries at some point during the experiment. And since he was found in the birdcage with his neck broken... Drebber: ...It's obvious that he fell from a considerable height. Ryunosuke: (Hm... I suppose that's hard to deny...)Present Wooden 'Birdcage' (after examining hole in cage or cracked wood) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: We've examined the birdcage that crashed into the Crystal Tower ourselves. As you can see, the cage, which is a wooden construction, has sustained damage in one particular spot. Van Zieks: Following the explosion, it fell some thirty feet into the glass of the Crystal Tower. That level of damage is to be expected, surely. Ryunosuke: I agree. The damage itself is entirely understandable. What doesn't make sense... ...is the location of that damage. Drebber: ...! Ryunosuke: All the breakages in the wood are at the base of the birdcage, not the top! Drebber: What are you saying?! Judge: That's the opposite of where they should be! Ryunosuke: That's right, My Lord. The birdcage that was at the scene is damaged at its base. So we have reports of the birdcage falling headlong into the Crystal Tower, yet the damage is at the bottom. The only way to reconcile these two facts is to accept... ...that there were two birdcages in play that day, which were at some point switched! Switched during what wasn't a scientific experiment at all...but an elaborate piece of stage trickery! Drebber: Gaaaaaaa...gh! Judge: Good gracious! Explain yourself, witness! Drebber: I...well... Van Zieks: If we examine the facts, there's only one logical conclusion we can draw. The damage on the base of the birdcage clearly indicates that it crashed tailfirst into the tower. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But multiple witness reports claim it fell headfirst! Van Zieks: The birdcage materialised in the sky next to a balloon flying over the stage, following a spontaneous explosion. At an altitude of some sixty feet above ground level. Susato: Which is approximately eighteen metres. Van Zieks: It then proceeded to fall some thirty feet into the Crystal Tower in the ensuing deflagration. Witness reports amid such chaos...are notoriously unreliable. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But the victim's neck was broken! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: He plummeted thirty feet inside a heavy, wooden cage. However he fell, it would be unsurprising to find one or two of his vertebrae crushed. Drebber: ......... Kuh kuh kuh kuh kuh... A riveting scientific analysis of events from the prosecution there. Though to be even more rigorous, you would have to say it was only one vertebra, actually. Ryunosuke: ...! (He wasn't quiet for long...) Susato: I find it hard to see what's motivating Lord van Zieks. This witness is clearly a swindler, and one who deceived a personal friend of his. Ryunosuke: ......... 'If you're going to establish this deception, do it right.' Susato: Sorry? Ryunosuke: I feel like that's the undertone here. Drebber: Ah yes, and there's one more point the defence appears to have forgotten. It obviously wasn't a trick...as a certain truth very plainly demonstrates. Ryunosuke: What?! Judge: It seems to me that the cross-examination had better continue until we resolve this matter. Mr Drebber, you will amend your testimony with details of this 'truth'. Drebber: Of course. We must treat the matter scientifically, after all. Ryunosuke: (Agh, I nearly had him there...) Drebber: ......... Changes statement from \"All the spectators saw the birdcage appear above their heads and then crash headfirst into the Crystal Tower.\" to \"The kinesis clearly took place, because there's nowhere else thirty feet high for the birdcage to have fallen from.\"Drebber: The kinesis clearly took place, because there's nowhere else thirty feet high for the birdcage to have fallen from.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What do you mean? Drebber: Well, before the demonstration began, the victim was alive on stage in front of the audience. Ryunosuke: Yes...there are lots of witnesses who saw Mr Asman on the experimentation stage, that's true. Drebber: And the victim's neck broke as a result of an impact following a fall. Logically, therefore, the victim must have fallen from somewhere. Van Zieks: The balloon that exploded was at an altitude of sixty feet. The point of impact on the tower was thirty feet up. That difference of thirty feet is therefore the total distance the birdcage fell. Drebber: And there's no other location from which the cage could have fallen that distance if it didn't drop out of the sky. Ergo... ...the victim himself must have been beamed from the stage into the sky above the Crystal Tower. Judge: Hmmmmmm... A trenchant, scientific analysis. Dear me, every time I hear it explained, it sounds increasingly plausible. Drebber: Oh yes. It's all very well thought out. Susato: Certainly all the spectators on the day saw it. The birdcage plummeting thirty feet through the air, I mean. Ryunosuke: (Irritatingly, yes...)Present Experiment Sketch Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"This is a diagram of the experimentation stage and its surroundings.\"Drebber: A terrible accident, I grant you. Perhaps the science on which the machine was built was flawed somehow?Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So you understood the science, did you? Drebber: Not in the slightest. Ryunosuke: Oh! Right... Drebber: As I've said a number of times, I'm an engineer. My job is to manufacture according to the blueprints I'm given. I would be inviting manifold problems if I foolishly allowed my brain to digest the ideas behind them. I could be accused of stealing those ideas, for example. Ryunosuke: But how is it possible to construct a machine without really understanding the principles it relies on? Drebber: Well, you're practising law without really understanding the principles it relies on, aren't you? Ryunosuke: ......... A very good point. Susato: Stand up for yourself, Mr Naruhodo! Van Zieks: The point is, the experiment resulted in instantaneous kinesis taking place. As such, the science must be sound. Drebber: Yes. And really, experimental results are all that matters when it comes to proving a hypothesis.Ryunosuke: (He's certainly very sure of himself...)Susato: What do you think, Mr Naruhodo?Ryunosuke: Well, now that the machine has been completely destroyed by yesterday's explosion... ...it's going to be impossible to argue its authenticity one way or the other.Susato: But if we're unable to establish that it was a piece of stage trickery rather than genuine science... ...we will have no grounds on which to demonstrate Professor Harebrayne's innocence.Ryunosuke: Both Mr Asman and this man in the stand tricked the professor and used him. They took advantage of his naivety and his unbending belief in his work...and I won't let them get away with it! (And seeing as the professor is an old friend of Lord van Zieks... ...what on earth must he be feeling towards Drebber?)Ryunosuke: This is a diagram of the experimentation stage and its surroundings.Drebber: .........Ryunosuke: We know that somehow, the birdcage appeared in mid-air before falling down into the Crystal Tower. A fall of about thirty feet...or nine metres. However, if you examine the diagram carefully... ...you'll see that there is one other possible location from which the birdcage could have fallen... ...the same distance of thirty feet.Van Zieks: No!Drebber: .........Judge: Well, it appears the defence has a possible explanation to put forward. Go ahead, Counsel.Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord. Of course.Judge: You will indicate the place to which you are referring on this same diagram. The alternative location from which the birdcage could possibly have fallen the requisite thirty feet!Present experimentation stage Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The place I'm referring to...is here!\"Present anywhere else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: If it had fallen from here, the birdcage would have plummeted the same thirty-foot distance! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: If that's my learned friend's claim, I suggest he demonstrates for the court...personally. Ryunosuke: Huh? Judge: And you may consider this a parting gift, Counsel. Ryunosuke: (Ugh... I feel like I've just hit the deck from thirty feet up anyway now...) Judge: Don't give me recourse to make the next fall from sixty feet up, hm? Leads back to: \"You will indicate the place to which you are referring on this same diagram.\"Ryunosuke: The place I'm referring to...is here!Judge: But that's... ...where the birdcage would have been to begin with!Ryunosuke: Which is exactly the point, My Lord. Yes, the birdcage was in the machine on the stage. But what we must also consider, is the height of the stage itself.Judge: Go on, Counsel.Ryunosuke: It turns out that the experimentation stage was built at a considerable height above ground level. If you look at the diagram, in fact... ...you'll see it's at about the same height above the ground as the balloon was above the crash site.Van Zieks: ...!Ryunosuke: When the experiment got underway, the machine and the birdcage were engulfed in steam. At that moment, the floor of the stage gave way and, if we assume there to be a void underneath... ...this birdcage and the one seen by the audience would have fallen almost exactly the same distance! Once again, My Lord... ...this all points to the fact that there was not one birdcage, but two!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: My learned friend...has no evidence that the stage had such a contrivance in its design!Ryunosuke: Someone is responsible for the criminal destruction of the kinesis machine itself, it's true. However, the stage still stands. And take a moment to look at the photographic print of the scene following yesterday's explosion.Judge: Good Lord! The metal grille that formed the floor of the machine is undone!Ryunosuke: Yes, most likely blown open by the force of the explosion that destroyed the rest of the machine. The defence calls for the space below the stage to be investigated...immediately! Mr Drebber!Drebber: ...!Ryunosuke: It was you who built the kinesis machine. Which means that it was you who built the two birdcages that were used to carry out this deception.Drebber: Uh...ughhh...Ryunosuke: Whether Professor Harebrayne's hypothesis is sound or not makes no difference. Because it's the construction of this machine that matters. A machine designed to take Mr Asman's life... ...and lay the blame firmly at the professor's door. Something that could only have been carried out... ...by you, Mr Enoch Drebber!Drebber: Grrr... UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: If my learned friend has reached the end of his wild assertions... ...the prosecution would like to crush the defence's argument slowly...but surely.Ryunosuke: Wha...?Van Zieks: Your argument fails to hold water... ...on two counts.Ryunosuke: Two?!Van Zieks: Firstly... ...before and after the experiment, this witness went nowhere near the kinesis machine. Every relevant member of staff from the exhibition has attested to that.Judge: And I believe members of Scotland Yard have also been on watch duty at every public experiment.Van Zieks: In other words, Mr Drebber had no opportunity to switch the alleged pair of birdcages.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: But I've already explained why he wouldn't have needed to!Van Zieks: The nonsense with the crossbow? That doesn't bolster your case at all. The man who disappeared from the stage and the man who crashed into the tower are one and the same. The Forensic Investigation Team's report is unequivocal on that point!Ryunosuke: Agh!Van Zieks: And the second flaw in your assertion... ...is a distinct lack of motive. Why would this man have wanted to take the victim's life? He had no reason to do so.Ryunosuke: A...a motive...? (Do I have to think of everything myself?)Van Zieks: I have here a contract provided by the witness.Judge: What contract is this, Lord van Zieks?Van Zieks: The contract into which Mr Drebber entered with the victim, Mr Asman. It reads: 'Mr Drebber is to receive thirty percent of all remunerations from government grants or other income.'Judge: Thirty percent? Certainly very favourable contractual conditions.Drebber: But there was one very important provision bolted onto that clause.Ryunosuke: What provision?Van Zieks: 'Mr Drebber may only uphold this right on condition that both contracting parties are alive.'Drebber: In other words, if either of us were to die, the contract would become null and void. So you see, I had nothing to gain from Mr Asman's death. The diametric opposite, in fact.Ryunosuke: Ugh...Van Zieks: Need I say more? The witness had neither an opportunity nor a reason to commit the alleged crime. In short, the possibility of Mr Drebber having done as you suggest...is nil.Ryunosuke: Ugh... UWAAAAAAAAAH!Judge: Hm... It seems the defence's assertion was somewhat wide of the mark. Lord van Zieks...you will submit the contract as evidence, please.Drebber's contract has been entered into the Court Record.Ryunosuke: (It's true... If Drebber had no opportunity to switch the birdcage under the stage with the one in the Crystal Tower... ...he couldn't have done it. And in any case, I have no idea what his motive might have been!)Susato: There is one aspect of your argument... ...that still holds true, however.Ryunosuke: ...!Susato: There were two birdcages. The prosecution is unable to deny that.Ryunosuke: Ah...Susato: So I'm sure you're on the right lines, Mr Naruhodo. And I've no doubt there are other aspects of your assertion that are undeniable truths, too!Ryunosuke: ...!Judge: Well, it would seem... ...that the defence has no rejoinder to offer.Drebber: ......... Kuh kuh kuh... Well, I must say I'm a little surprised. I came here to testify about the machine I built, and instead my reputation is defiled. But the prosecution's counter has set the record straight, I think. It's impossible that I'm the culprit.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: At the beginning of this trial, we believed that there was only one birdcage. Yet now we know there must have been two. In other words, there was more to the demonstration than we realised at first.Drebber: .........Ryunosuke: I think it's abundantly clear that the same applies to the culprit.Van Zieks: Get to the point.Ryunosuke: The stage demonstration... ...was constructed and set up in its entirety by you, Mr Drebber. Therefore it's inconceivable that you had no hand in the events that transpired.Drebber: .........Ryunosuke: So if circumstances mean it's impossible that you could have carried out the crime yourself... ...it points to the fact that someone else was involved.Judge: Someone else? Counsel, are you suggesting...?Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord! Mr Drebber had an accomplice!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: An accomplice now? Well then, I presume... ...you're prepared for what's to come? Now that you're accusing not only this witness, but someone else...of the most serious of crimes.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: If these accusations turn out to be false... ...then make no mistake: The prosecution will demand an equally serious punishment for your slander!Ryunosuke: .........Judge: Well, Counsel? Do you intend to pursue this course, and formally accuse another party of involvement in this matter?Ryunosuke: ......... (What do I do here? At the moment, this is little more than a hunch on my part. I don't know for sure if Drebber had an accomplice, or even if he really is the culprit here...)Drebber: .........Ryunosuke: (One way or another, though, I have to make my position clear. ...As a lawyer. So what's my stance going to be? Did Drebber have an accomplice...or not?)Name the accomplice Leads to: \"The defence is ready to name Mr Drebber's accomplice!\"Back down Ryunosuke: (Let's face it, I have no idea who is accomplice might actually have been. Which isn't the strongest position to be in, is it, Ryunosuke?) Susato: Mr Naruhodo, think of the sword at your side. Karuma is crying out. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Susato: Crying out for you to show the strength of your conviction now as a lawyer. Ryunosuke: ...Yes, you're right. This sword that I inherited, which embodies the will of my best friend... ...is my own accomplice! Susato: I'm not sure that's quite the right word, but...that's the spirit, certainly! Leads to: \"The defence is ready to name Mr Drebber's accomplice!\"Ryunosuke: The defence is ready to name Mr Drebber's accomplice! (Somehow the two birdcages must have been switched. Everything points to that. Yet according to the coroner's report, that's not a possibility. But that inconsistency itself is a clue!)Judge: Counsel...Ryunosuke: Hm? ...My Lord?!Judge: You have received a stark warning already. If you are nevertheless determined... ...then I must now ask you to identify this alleged accomplice by name. So...your answer, please. Who do you claim to have been Mr Drebber's accomplice?Present Courtney Sithe profile Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The name of the person in question is...\"Present anyone else Ryunosuke: Judge: ......... Who is this person? Ryunosuke: Someone intimately related to the crime, My Lord...and someone you surely wouldn't say you don't know! Judge: Yes, thank you, I am aware of the person, obviously. But on what basis do you claim felonious involvement? Ryunosuke: ......... Van Zieks: You surely wouldn't say you don't know...would you? Ryunosuke: Uwaaaaaagh! Susato: I'm sure you simply slipped and pointed to the wrong person, didn't you? There's no other explanation! Judge: No 'slip-ups' this time, please, Counsel. Leads back to: \"Who do you claim to have been Mr Drebber's accomplice?\"Ryunosuke: The name of the person in question is...Van Zieks: What's wrong, my Nipponese friend? Surely fear doesn't bind your tongue now. It's a little late for that.Ryunosuke: (Of course I'm afraid. After all, naming her in this capacity is definitely going to make waves. ...A lot of waves. I could very well turn every single person in this courtroom against me.)Susato: I'm sure it will be alright, Mr Naruhodo.Ryunosuke: ...Thank you, Miss Susato.Susato: The enemy always appears larger than life. But you'll appear exactly the same to the enemy!Ryunosuke: ...Alright then, here goes...Van Zieks: You've kept us waiting long enough. Your answer, Counsel...now.Ryunosuke: The person who colluded with Mr Drebber in order to carry out this wicked crime... ...is Scotland Yard's coroner, Dr Courtney Sithe!Judge: What, what the blazes are you talking about? Dr Sithe?Van Zieks: The head of the Forensic Investigation Team, and the coroner who conducted the autopsy on the victim?!Ryunosuke: We know there were two birdcages. So who could have carried out the switch to complete the illusion? The 'accident' happened in front of a huge crowd of spectators, and the area was immediately sealed off. Then everyone, police officers included, were banished to make way for the Forensic Investigation Team. When else could the switch have occurred? It can only have been in that team's presence.Drebber: .........Ryunosuke: It's essential that the court determines exactly what happened following the incident. The defence demands that Dr Sithe be summoned to the witness stand at once to testify!Juror No. 6: You've got a nerve, lad! Standing up there, dragging the Yard's name through the mud!Ryunosuke: I, I didn't mean to...Juror No. 6: I know the woman veeery well. There's no better dead room worker out there! How dare you call her a criminal?!Van Zieks: My learned friend's imagination appears to be wilder than the East End at night.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: But the recklessness of your accusation aside, there's another grave problem with your argument. One which the prosecution demands you address at once.Ryunosuke: A grave problem?Susato: Oh my word...Van Zieks: Who do you claim acted as the victim's doppelgänger?Ryunosuke: W-What?Judge: Hmmm... Certainly, if the 'birdcage' containing the body of the victim was exchanged for another... ...that cage must also have contained a body.Van Zieks: And yet... ...no missing persons or accidental deaths of anyone even remotely resembling the victim have been reported. Which means there was no one, dead or alive, who could have fulfilled the role of a body double for Mr Asman.Ryunosuke: Ugh... (That's true! If my argument is that there were two birdcages, then there must also have been one person inside each! But I don't know if I've got an answer to this yet, have I? What can I do to reveal how this body double stunt was achieved?)Name someone Ryunosuke: Very well. The defence will address my learned friend's concerns... ...by revealing the identity of the person who acted as Mr Asman's body double! Van Zieks: Be my guest. Give us a name. Ryunosuke: (The body double and the birdcage were hiding inside the balloon that was floating above the stage. Which means that any witnesses would only have seen them from sixty feet away. ...So who was it that appeared out of that explosion some eighteen metres above the spectators...?) ......... Aha! In place of Mr Asman in the second birdcage was... Present anyone Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: This person is the most likely candidate I can think of... wouldn't you agree? Judge: ...I would not. Van Zieks: Would anyone? Susato: I'm sorry, Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: Even you're turning your back on me, Miss Susato? I must be really wide of the mark! Van Zieks: ...You have a head. Try using it. Judge: I must ask you to reconsider your answer, Counsel. Leads back to: \"But I don't know if I've got an answer to this yet, have I?\"Present evidence Ryunosuke: Very well. The defence will address my learned friend's concerns... ...by presenting evidence that reveals the true nature of Mr Asman's body double! Judge: Good gracious! Evidence? I do hope this isn't filibustering, Counsel. The court is expecting a name. Van Zieks: If you think you have relevant evidence, present it now. Ryunosuke: (The body double and the birdcage were hiding inside the balloon that was floating above the stage. Which means that any witnesses would only have seen them from sixty feet away. ...So who was it that appeared out of that explosion some eighteen metres above the spectators...?) ......... Aha! The body double inside the second birdcage was... Present Waxwork Head Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"We know that the victim, Mr Asman, was in the birdcage that was situated inside the kinesis machine on stage.\" Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Well...probably something along these lines, I think... Van Zieks: Van Zieks: Then let's see what happens to that piece of evidence when dropped from a great height... ...whilst within your grasp, of course. Susato: He's suggesting you and the evidence die together, Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: ...Yes, that came across. (It's hard to see how another person could have been inside the second birdcage. Which means the body double must have been something else...) Judge: I shall have to ask you to reconsider your answer, Counsel. Leads back to: \"But I don't know if I've got an answer to this yet, have I?\"Nothing at the moment Ryunosuke: I can't explain that at the moment. Van Zieks: Oh really. And when can the court expect an explanation? Ryunosuke: ......... Maybe tomorrow? Van Zieks: Then you can take your leave of us until then. Susato: People who procrastinate lose everything in the end, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: ...Isn't that slightly over-the-top? Susato: We can discuss that later. But for now, you ought to consider what you can do, not what you can't. Ryunosuke: Alright, yes. I'll think again... Leads back to: \"What can I do to reveal how this body double stunt was achieved?\"Ryunosuke: We know that the victim, Mr Asman, was in the birdcage that was situated inside the kinesis machine on stage. And therefore he couldn't have been inside the second birdcage. Instead, that contained something else... What's been described as a 'body double', which is what fell from the sky and crashed into the Crystal Tower.Judge: Yes, Counsel, according to your somewhat elaborate version of events.Ryunosuke: And that 'body double' inside the second birdcage was in fact... .........Susato: It's alright, Mr Naruhodo. You're ready for this. Just steel yourself...and come out with it!Ryunosuke: ...Thank you, Miss Susato! I needed that. As I was saying...the 'body double' inside the second birdcage was... ...as unbelievable as it may seem...that thing there!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: ......... Open your eyes and look into mine, my Nipponese friend. Now tell me......what are you playing at?Ryunosuke: (Stand firm now, Ryunosuke! This is the time to show your Japanese spirit!) As the court will observe...this is a waxwork model. A model, in fact, of an infamous London murderer from ten years ago: the Professor!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: You started by indicting the leader of the Forensic Investigation Team as an accomplice in this crime. And now you've moved on to indicting waxworks?Ryunosuke: ...Yes! That's about the size of it.Van Zieks: But why? And why THIS waxwork? It looks nothing like the victim. In fact, it could hardly resemble him less! What possible justification can you give?Ryunosuke: If you want to know why... ...ask Mr Drebber.Drebber: ...!Van Zieks: What?Ryunosuke: Just days before Professor Harebrayne performed his public demonstration... ...Mr Drebber abducted this model from Madame Tusspells.Judge: Did, did you say...abducted?!Ryunosuke: And two days after the incident at the Great Exhibition... ...he returned it to the museum.Van Zieks: Then the timing...Judge: Is this true, Mr Drebber?Drebber: Ugh... Urmm...Ryunosuke: At first, I couldn't see why Mr Drebber would have stolen the waxwork and then given it back again. But now, the reason is clear. He took it so that he could put it inside the second birdcage...as a body double for Mr Asman!Drebber: Guh...............!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: Are you hearing this, ladies and gentlemen of the jury? Are you hearing the defence's astonishing proposal?Juror No. 1: ...!Juror No. 2: ...!Van Zieks: That the witness fabricated this vast machine with the intention of deceiving some wretched scientist. That he did so in collusion with the country's finest coroner, on a public stage in front of a vast audience.Juror No. 3: ...!Juror No. 4: ...!Van Zieks: And that, to effect the deception, he used a waxwork model that in no way resembles the victim. Are we really to believe this far-fetched tale? What do you decide?Juror No. 5: ...!Juror No. 6: ...!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: Wait! Yes, if you put it like that, of course it sounds implausible!???:My Lord!Juror No. 1: I need to speak, if you please.Judge: Go ahead, Mr Foreman.Juror No. 1: Myself and my colleagues have reached an agreement.Judge: Very good. In that case... ...ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you will state your leanings for the court to hear now!Juror No. 1: Guilty!Juror No. 2: Guilty!Juror No. 3: Guilty!Juror No. 4: Guilty!Juror No. 5: Guilty!Juror No. 6: Guilty!Judge: So, as indicated by the foreman, the jury has reached a consensus.Ryunosuke: (I knew that was going to happen.)Susato: We shall get through this, Mr Naruhodo, as we always do. And uncover some new truths along the way, I'm quite sure.Ryunosuke: Yes, I agree. I'm going to have to appeal to the jurors as usual, and see if I can persuade them to change their minds!Judge: The defence will now embark on a summation examination. Are you and your fellows ready to proceed, Mr Foreman?Juror No. 1: We are, My Lord.Judge: Very well. In that case, I ask you now to state clearly for all present to hear... ...the grounds on which each of you has decided that the defendant is guilty of the crime of which he is charged.Judicial Findings - The Jurors' Contentions -Juror No. 6: I've known that woman for years! She'd never be an accomplice to anything!Juror No. 1: It's utter nonsense to think those two would ever be conniving with one another.Juror No. 2: Oh dear, this is most troubling... But surely the waxwork the man stole is nothing to do with the coroner, is it?Juror No. 3: I have had my own problems with members of the police. I do not trust them much...Juror No. 4: I've seen no rigorous proof that this waxwork was ever inside the birdcage. It's conjecture!Juror No. 5: Accusin' someone without right evidences? Ee's not a proper job, is ee? I won't 'ave it!Judge: Somewhat unsurprisingly... ...it seems the introduction of this waxwork model to the proceedings has polarised opinion.Van Zieks: Given that its face is obscured and its build in no way resembles that of the victim... ...I can only applaud my learned friend's temerity at suggesting it as Mr Asman's body double.Ryunosuke: (Yes, the applause is deafening. ...And yes, I know it seems extraordinary. But that's the point. That's why I have a strong feeling it's actually a greater clue than anyone yet realises...)Susato: What are you thinking, Mr Naruhodo?Ryunosuke: I can't explain why at the moment... ...but I feel as though there's a specific reason why it was used. Why it had to be this model.Susato: Really? A reason why nothing else would do, you mean?Ryunosuke: Yes. And I'm convinced... ...it's something far more significant than whether or not the model looked like the victim.Susato: Well...if that's the case... ...we must prevent the trial from ending prematurely at all costs!Ryunosuke: Yes, agreed. (I have to find a way out of this...!)Judge: If you are ready, Counsel, you may proceed with the summation examination.Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord!Jury Examination - The Defence's Rebuttal -Juror No. 6: I've known that woman for years! She'd never be an accomplice to anything!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Um...the order of things seems to have changed around here for some reason... Juror No. 6: I'm a copper, lad. It's a copper's discretion to bend the rules sometimes, when needs must. What's wrong with that?! Ryunosuke: (...Where do I start?) Juror No. 6: I've been working at the Yard for forty odd years! Ryunosuke: That's...even more than I thought. Juror No. 6: We've only had a metropolitan police service in town for seventy years, you know. 'Course, times have changed. The public didn't trust coppers back when I started. It was rough. We had to fight crime, and we had to fight to win the public's trust as well. And win we did. Forensic science was in its infancy too, even more than it is now. And she spearheaded the revolution! Ryunosuke: Dr Sithe, you mean? Juror No. 6: That's right. About ten years ago now, it was. When I was still a youngish bobby on the beat. That's when she started making a name for herself as a top-class coroner. And now look at her! Head of the Forensic Investigation Team. And a woman, no less. Well you won't hear me complain! It's what we all dreamt of back then, I tell you! Ryunosuke: ...Could you tell me without holding that gun in the air?! Juror No. 6: We were all out to uphold justice, lad! Full of vim, we were. Full of vim. Ryunosuke: ...That's coming across loud and clear.Juror No. 6: She was Courtney Stevens back when I knew her, of course. A legendary coroner, even then.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: She was legendary, was she? Juror No. 6: What did you say?! Ryunosuke: Agh! Juror No. 6: That woman is still the best coroner in the land! Head of the Forensics Investigation Team! Ryunosuke: Um...'legendary' was your description, sir, not mine. Juror No. 6: Rubbish! That word never passed my lips! I'd never describe anybody that way! Ever! Not if they were still in the game! Ryunosuke: ......... ...I think the point you're trying to make is that Dr Sithe is an extremely talented coroner. Would that be fair? Juror No. 6: It would! If it weren't for the fact that you're trying to drag that legendary woman's reputation through the mud! Ryunosuke: (I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that 'legendary'.)Pit against Juror No. 2's statement Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: Good gracious! To whose statements do you refer, Counsel? Ryunosuke: So...juror number two. Juror No. 2: Oh gosh! Me? W-What can I do for you? Ryunosuke: I presume that you heard what juror number six said in his statement? It's brought to light the maiden name of the coroner, Dr Sithe. Which in turn has revealed a connection that wasn't apparent before. Juror No. 2: Well naturally, as a woman of society, I find such connections and relationships irresistible. But oh golly... I'm afraid I fail to see what you mean. Ryunosuke: Dr Sithe's maiden name is Stevens. And through that name, the coroner is very definitely linked to the waxwork of the killer. The defence has evidence to prove it. Juror No. 2: My goodness! Evidence, you say? How, how utterly enthralling! Judge: Counsel, the court cannot overlook that last remark. I very much hope there is substance to your claim. Ryunosuke: Of course, My Lord. I would ask the court to look at this: The evidence that clearly links Dr Sithe to the mass murderer known as the Professor! Present Killer's Autopsy Report Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: I have here a certain autopsy report from ten years ago. Judge: A ten-year-old autopsy report? What relevance does that have? Ryunosuke: It is of course from the autopsy of the person portrayed in the waxwork: the killer known as the Professor. Van Zieks: ...! Judge: The Professor's...? But the man was a capital offender, so... Ryunosuke: That's right. This is the certification of death that was drawn up after the convict's execution. The identity of the killer was never made public, so the report gives few details. But what's important is the name of the coroner who wrote it: Courtney Stevens. Juror No. 2: Oh my! Courtney Stevens?! Juror No. 6: Strike a light! Ryunosuke: It appears that the Professor's autopsy was conducted by Dr Sithe ten years ago. And a few days ago, Mr Drebber very deliberately stole the waxwork of the Professor from Madame Tusspells. A waxwork that doesn't in fact resemble the victim, Mr Asman, at all. Juror No. 2: And do you suppose...there's some unsavoury relationship between those events? Ryunosuke: Absolutely! I'm sure of it! There's no doubt in my mind that the Professor case... ...is at the heart of a link that we have yet to uncover... ...between Dr Courtney Sithe and Mr Enoch Drebber! Juror No. 2: ......... Hidden links...mysterious connections...secret relationships... This is all most extraordinary. We're surely obliged now to explore this further. Juror No. 6: Quite right. We can't let this trial come to an end now. Not while there's this cloud of suspicion hanging over the Yard's best coroner. It wasn't like this in my day! But we're still here to uphold justice in the end! Changes Juror No. 6's statement to \"If a Yard coroner's under suspicion, then we're not done here yet, are we? Clearly!\" Changes Juror No. 2's statement to \"It's the Professor! That's what links that frightful swindler and the coroner!\" Present anything else Ryunosuke: Juror No. 2: Are you quite alright, sir? All colour has drained from your cheeks. You look just like a waxwork yourself. Ryunosuke: I think...my lack of colour must reflect my lack of confidence... Juror No. 6: Hmph. Wait till you hit my age, lad. You won't have any colour left to drain. Judge: I said before that the court could not overlook your claim of evidence. But it seems to me that overlooking it would have been the more preferable choice by some margin. Ryunosuke: (Ugh. I was sure I had something...) Juror No. 2: Oh gosh! There's, there's wax dripping from your brow! You're melting! Ryunosuke: Just a cold sweat. Nothing new. Judge: Let us return to the jurors' statements and put this debacle behind us. Leads back to summation examinationJuror No. 6: If a Yard coroner's under suspicion, then we're not done here yet, are we? Clearly!Juror No. 1: It's utter nonsense to think those two would ever be conniving with one another.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But we're only just starting to understand this case! Juror No. 1: ......... Ryunosuke: W-What are you reading there, sir?! Juror No. 1: The man behind those murders on Solar Pons Street was caught in two days flat. That's real policing for you. Ryunosuke: That's...really not relevant to this case, is it? Juror No. 1: You're wrong there. Because it was Dr Sithe in charge of examining the bodies. And it was evidence arising from her work that led to the arrest of the scoundrel responsible. Ryunosuke: Oh... Juror No. 1: That's right, 'Oh.' That woman is at the forefront of this country's fight against crime. The idea that she's somehow involved in this murky business is a load of old tosh. Ryunosuke: (I thought it was up to me to 'press' the jurors, not the other way around...)Juror No. 2: Oh dear, this is most troubling... But surely the waxwork the man stole is nothing to do with the coroner, is it?Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Why would you assume that? Juror No. 2: Well, quite simply because...that unsettling swindler has no relationship with the woman, does he? Ryunosuke: True. As it stands, we don't know of any connection. Juror No. 2: Oh gosh, but it would be delightfully romantic if they were somehow to have a mutual interest in the waxwork. Ryunosuke: Romantic? Juror No. 2: A woman of society such as myself views everything in terms of relationships, you know. Ryunosuke: Well, you learn something new every day! (Even if you don't want to.) Juror No. 2: One might wonder about a possible relationship between the defendant and this coroner woman. Or perhaps between the defendant and the handsome prosecutor just there. Ryunosuke: (This woman...may be more astute than I've been giving her credit for.) Susato: If that's the woman's stance... ...then perhaps demonstrating some connection between the waxwork and Dr Sithe would be enough... Ryunosuke: Yes, I agree. As soon as we have even a whiff of a connection, she'll be the first to know!Pit against Juror No. 6's statement (after Juror No. 6 changes his statement) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: Good gracious! To whose statements do you refer, Counsel? Ryunosuke: So...juror number two. Juror No. 2: Oh gosh! Me? W-What can I do for you? Ryunosuke: I presume that you heard what juror number six said in his statement? It's brought to light the maiden name of the coroner, Dr Sithe. Which in turn has revealed a connection that wasn't apparent before. Juror No. 2: Well naturally, as a woman of society, I find such connections and relationships irresistible. But oh golly... I'm afraid I fail to see what you mean. Ryunosuke: Dr Sithe's maiden name is Stevens. And through that name, the coroner is very definitely linked to the waxwork of the killer. The defence has evidence to prove it. Juror No. 2: My goodness! Evidence, you say? How, how utterly enthralling! Judge: Counsel, the court cannot overlook that last remark. I very much hope there is substance to your claim. Ryunosuke: Of course, My Lord. I would ask the court to look at this: The evidence that clearly links Dr Sithe to the mass murderer known as the Professor! Present Killer's Autopsy Report Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: I have here a certain autopsy report from ten years ago. Judge: A ten-year-old autopsy report? What relevance does that have? Ryunosuke: It is of course from the autopsy of the person portrayed in the waxwork: the killer known as the Professor. Van Zieks: ...! Judge: The Professor's...? But the man was a capital offender, so... Ryunosuke: That's right. This is the certification of death that was drawn up after the convict's execution. The identity of the killer was never made public, so the report gives few details. But what's important is the name of the coroner who wrote it: Courtney Stevens. Juror No. 2: Oh my! Courtney Stevens?! Juror No. 6: Strike a light! Ryunosuke: It appears that the Professor's autopsy was conducted by Dr Sithe ten years ago. And a few days ago, Mr Drebber very deliberately stole the waxwork of the Professor from Madame Tusspells. A waxwork that doesn't in fact resemble the victim, Mr Asman, at all. Juror No. 2: And do you suppose...there's some unsavoury relationship between those events? Ryunosuke: Absolutely! I'm sure of it! There's no doubt in my mind that the Professor case... ...is at the heart of a link that we have yet to uncover... ...between Dr Courtney Sithe and Mr Enoch Drebber! Juror No. 2: ......... Hidden links...mysterious connections...secret relationships... This is all most extraordinary. We're surely obliged now to explore this further. Juror No. 6: Quite right. We can't let this trial come to an end now. Not while there's this cloud of suspicion hanging over the Yard's best coroner. It wasn't like this in my day! But we're still here to uphold justice in the end! Changes Juror No. 6's statement to \"If a Yard coroner's under suspicion, then we're not done here yet, are we? Clearly!\" Changes Juror No. 2's statement to \"It's the Professor! That's what links that frightful swindler and the coroner!\" Present anything else Ryunosuke: Juror No. 2: Are you quite alright, sir? All colour has drained from your cheeks. You look just like a waxwork yourself. Ryunosuke: I think...my lack of colour must reflect my lack of confidence... Juror No. 6: Hmph. Wait till you hit my age, lad. You won't have any colour left to drain. Judge: I said before that the court could not overlook your claim of evidence. But it seems to me that overlooking it would have been the more preferable choice by some margin. Ryunosuke: (Ugh. I was sure I had something...) Juror No. 2: Oh gosh! There's, there's wax dripping from your brow! You're melting! Ryunosuke: Just a cold sweat. Nothing new. Judge: Let us return to the jurors' statements and put this debacle behind us. Leads back to summation examinationJuror No. 2: It's the Professor! That's what links that frightful swindler and the coroner!Juror No. 3: I have had my own problems with members of the police. I do not trust them much...Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What sort of problems? Juror No. 3: Let's just say we have run into each other on numerous occasions while I've been performing on the street. Ryunosuke: Right, I see. Juror No. 3: Obviously artists such as myself cannot appear on stage as we work in close proximity to our audiences. So we perform our great magic in parks...on street corners...and the like. But the police use any excuse to make our lives difficult. Sometimes they even cook up a story to extort monies from the poor. Pursue Juror No. 6 (before Juror No. 6 changes his statement) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Do you have something to say in response to that... Mr Ottermole?! Juror No. 6: Who are you calling a mass murderer?! Ryunosuke: Ah! Sorry, my mistake! I, I got confused because I heard you look like him... Juror No. 6: I don't look anything like the man! You wanna be locked up, sonny? Ryunosuke: (Thanks, Mr Sholmes...) Perhaps we could move on... I was really wondering if you had something you wanted to add in response to what juror number three just said. And clearly you do. Juror No. 6: ......... Back in my day... Back in the good old days... ...it wasn't like this! Ryunosuke: What was it like, sir? Juror No. 6: We worked our fingers to the bone to earn the public's trust, we did! And by Jove we earnt it! People respected us back then! Juror No. 3: Respected you? Hmph. Juror No. 6: No one would've called a coroner into question in them days! A coroner's report was the hallmark of an investigation done right! Especially when Dr Courtney Stevens put her name to it! She was the best of the best! And the apple of the force's eye! Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: H-Hold on a minute! What are you talking about? Who's Courtney Stevens? Juror No. 6: Ah... Sorry. Got a bit carried away there. Van Zieks: Stevens is Dr Sithe's maiden name. Ryunosuke: Her maiden name... (So that was before she was married...) Juror No. 6: O' course, yes. Silly me. It's Sithe now, isn't it? Ryunosuke: (Stevens... I'm sure I've seen that name somewhere recently...) Juror No. 6: Anyway! The point is, those were the great days of policing! Not like now... Ryunosuke: Sorry to interrupt, sir... ...but do you think you could change your statement to include that name? Juror No. 6: Well, yes...I don't see why not. Changes Juror No. 6's statement to \"She was Courtney Stevens back when I knew her, of course. A legendary coroner, even then.\" Ryunosuke: Well, that's definitely not right. Juror No. 3: Yes, and it is why I say that if you trust the police, you will have trouble. But here you are, claiming this waxwork model was stolen to star in an illusionary spectacular. The idea is so wild, I think I will take my chances and believe the authorities on this occasion. Ryunosuke: (This is how the public at large view Scotland Yard, is it?) Susato: Our own police force in Tokyo is not even twenty years old yet, is it? Perhaps we should view what's happened here in London as a measure of what may happen at home. Ryunosuke: Yes... Like a Scotland Yardstick. (I wonder how a policeman would feel listening to the way this juror speaks about the force... I'm sure he'd have a word or two to say in response.)Juror No. 4: I've seen no rigorous proof that this waxwork was ever inside the birdcage. It's conjecture!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But you claimed the whole instantaneous kinesis demonstration was a trick! Juror No. 4: That I did. But there's more than one way to pull a rabbit out of a hat, isn't there? Ryunosuke: Sorry? Juror No. 4: I grant you, given that this cage appeared from amidst an explosion, there'd have been no need to use a real person. But if a waxwork had been used, the culprit could at least have had the decency to make it look like the victim. Ryunosuke: I'm not sure exactly how much criminals are governed by decency... Juror No. 4: The point is, if you're going to make a claim about that waxwork being inside the birdcage... ...you need to give us some evidence. Without that, it's just not science! Susato: I suppose we should expect nothing less than a logical argument from a fellow of the Royal Society. But that perhaps means his mind could be changed if we managed to present suitable evidence... Ryunosuke: (Evidence that the Professor waxwork was inside that birdcage. Hm... Can I produce that or not?) I have evidence Ryunosuke: ...Actually, I have something I'd like you to see, sir. Juror No. 4: Oh? I must warn you that I firmly believe it's only wise to trust men in white coats. So given your jet-black outfit, I don't mind admitting to a sense of trepidation here. Ryunosuke: (So you don't trust anyone in black? Looking in the mirror must be very trying...) I do have some evidence that proves the waxwork was inside that birdcage. Namely... Present Piece of Broken Glass Ryunosuke: Juror No. 4: What's that? A piece of glass? Though it's unusually thick for glass... Ryunosuke: Yes, it's a piece of broken glass that we found inside the jacket on the waxwork. As you say, it's not ordinary glass, though. It's very thick, and clearly made for extra strength. Much like the special glass that was developed for the construction of the Crystal Tower. Juror No. 4: The Crystal To- Holy smoke! Ryunosuke: Exactly! The centrepiece of the Great Exhibition, where the very incident we're talking about took place! On the day in question, the birdcage fell from above and smashed through a window of that special glass. Juror No. 4: From whence this small piece originated...is that it? Ryunosuke: Precisely. So, what do you say... ...now that clear evidence in support of the assertion has been placed before you?! Juror No. 4: ......... Well, as I said, I only trust men in white coats as a rule. However... ...when the reasoning is sound, it's fair to say colour shouldn't come into it. In light of what you've shown me here, yes, I feel obliged to change my position on the matter. Judge: In that case, juror number four, you will amend your statement now, please. Changes Juror No. 4's statement to \"The presence of that piece of glass leaves me in little doubt that the waxwork was indeed inside that birdcage.\" Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Let me start by showing you...this! Juror No. 4: ......... It's an unimpressive opening, if I'm honest. Ryunosuke: Ah, well, um... What comes next is the real point! Judge: It's already apparent that what comes next is equally disappointing, Counsel. Ryunosuke: Ugh... (How about after that...?) Susato: If the waxwork of the Professor was inside the second birdcage... ...I would assume that means it must have crashed into the Crystal Tower. Ryunosuke: Yes, that's right. I'd managed to think it through to that point myself. Susato: Well, it's really only a tiny leap from there, I would think! Leads back to: \"Evidence that the Professor waxwork was inside that birdcage.\" I have nothing Ryunosuke: Well, I can state quite categorically, sir, that we have no such evidence at the present time! Juror No. 4: That much was abundantly clear before that brassy proclamation, I assure you! And why you can count on the fact that I shan't be changing my leaning! Susato: Oh dear... That proclamation was even brassier than yours, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: (If only we had some evidence, things might be different, though...) Leads back to summation examinationJuror No. 4: The presence of that piece of glass leaves me in little doubt that the waxwork was indeed inside that birdcage.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Thank you for reconsidering your position, sir. Juror No. 4: Your words are misplaced, boy. My opinion is governed by logic and science and nothing else. Yes, science is where you should direct your words of gratitude. Ryunosuke: Ah... Juror No. 4: ......... Ryunosuke: ......... Juror No. 4: What's the matter with you?! Too good to say some words of thanks to the mother of all academic subjects?! Ryunosuke: (...What is it about scientists? Honestly.)Pit against Juror No. 5's statement Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: Good gracious! To whose statements do you refer, Counsel? Ryunosuke: If you could put down your corn for a moment, juror number five...! Juror No. 5: ......... Ooh, you mean me? Ryunosuke: You've pointed out that it's wrong to make an accusation without evidence. But the accusation that the waxwork model was inside the second birdcage on the day in question... ...is not without supporting evidence. As the defence demonstrated to the juror sitting beside you. Juror No. 5: ......... Ooh, is that right? Ryunosuke: ......... Would it be fair to say... ...you didn't follow the argument? Juror No. 5: I don't understand much besides Colonel Cob, to be honest. Ryunosuke: ......... (Of course you don't...) Juror No. 4: If I could interject here... Ryunosuke: Please do, sir. Juror No. 4: Now that this assertion of yours about the waxwork has been backed up by some solid evidence... ...it would be wrong of me, as a man of science, not to pursue the matter further. Juror No. 5: Ar, well, me too, then! Ryunosuke: Sorry?! Juror No. 5: If this brainy gentleman says ee's right, then ee must be! See...I, um... ...I wouldn't dream of goin' against Colonel Cob or anyone who's got stuffin' between the ears! Ryunosuke: (Success! ...If you can call it that.) Changes Juror No. 4's statement to \"The possibility has been established reasonably and logically. It now warrants further research.\" Changes Juror No. 5's statement to \"Well, 'course if ee's got some evidences, that's a whole other cob o' corn, innit? Lovely job!\"Juror No. 4: The possibility has been established reasonably and logically. It now warrants further research.Juror No. 5: Accusin' someone without right evidences? Ee's not a proper job, is ee? I won't 'ave it!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: I've got to ask...why have you brought that corn into court with you? Juror No. 5: Colonel Cob? Ee's bin growin' back on the farm. Picked 'im off on me way into town. Ee's a proper nibbler, ee is. Ryunosuke: Yes, the nibbling seems to be taking quite a while. Maybe it could wait until after the trial? Juror No. 5: Ooh, I don't like the sound o' that. You need colonels at times like these. Whenever I've summat big to decide, the colonels always point me in the right direction, see. Ryunosuke: Y-You're talking about your cob of corn? Juror No. 5: Nibble nobble guilty bobble, nibble not guilty out. Nibble nobble guilty bobble, nibble not guilty out. Nibble nobble guilty bobble, nibble not guilty out. Nibble nobble guilty bobble, nibble not guilty out. Susato: ...Perhaps it's akin to fortune-telling with flower petals like people do back home? Ryunosuke: (So Professor Harebrayne's fate is to be decided by a cob of corn...) Could you not at least wait until we've had more time to find the truth before deciding on the defendant's guilt? Juror No. 5: Ooh, I don't know about that. Me tum's awfully full already. Ryunosuke: (A-maize-ing...)Pit against Juror No. 4's statement (after Juror No. 4 changes his statement) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: Good gracious! To whose statements do you refer, Counsel? Ryunosuke: If you could put down your corn for a moment, juror number five...! Juror No. 5: ......... Ooh, you mean me?

Lovely job!\"Juror No. 5: Well, 'course if ee's got some evidences, that's a whole other cob o' corn, innit? Lovely job!Ryunosuke: (I know it seems a little far-fetched to think that the waxwork model of the Professor was in that birdcage... ...but on the other hand, it explains a lot.)Susato: If there really is a reason why that particular waxwork had to be used as Mr Asman's double... ...we must do everything we can to make the jurors understand it.Ryunosuke: The truth is, I'm sure that's the key to this, but it's the most puzzling part of it, too.Susato: In that case, you should see what additional information you can glean whilst trying to change the jurors' minds. If you can read a book whilst eating a rice cracker, Mr Naruhodo, I'm sure you can do this!Ryunosuke: ...Right. Yes!After Jurors No. 2, 4, 5, and 6 vote innocent:Judge: Thank you, Counsel, that will do. As a result of the summation examination, the jury's overall leaning has changed. Two jurors now call guilty. Against four who call not guilty. Accordingly the court has failed to reach a consensus at this time... ...and the trial must continue!Ryunosuke: We, we did it!Susato: Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! Another wonderful victory!Judge: Hmmm, a waxwork of the despicable Professor... ...used as a 'body double' for the victim in this quite extraordinary case... I must say, it's extremely hard to believe the assertion could possibly be true. However, it would appear that it does at least warrant further investigation.Ryunosuke: It's the waxwork of the Professor that links Mr Drebber and Dr Sithe. And I'm convinced that there's a special significance to that link!Juror No. 6: I don't know what you're hoping to prove, lad, I really don't!Susato: The truth, sir. By using evidence and testimony.Juror No. 6: Hmph.Van Zieks: If the court is to delve deeper into the alleged involvement of the waxwork in this case... ...then the prosecution calls for the owner of the model to be summoned as a witness.Judge: The owner?Van Zieks: Madame Tusspells.Ryunosuke: ...! (I, I really thought... ...that Lord van Zieks would object to this whole line of enquiry...)Judge: Very well, I concur. Make arrangements for Madame Tusspells to appear as a witness with immediate effect.Van Zieks: ......... Listen carefully, my learned friend.Ryunosuke: Oh... Yes?Van Zieks: You should know... ...that you're on the brink of opening Pandora's box. .........Judge: The court shall now adjourn for forty-five minutes. During that time, the prosecution will summon the new witness and prepare her for taking the stand.Van Zieks: Madame Tusspells, yes. I shall see to it at once, My Lord.To be continued...24th October, 11:53 a.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' AntechamberSholmes: Ah, the knight-errant himself!Ryunosuke: Oh, have you been watching from the gallery, Mr Sholmes?Sholmes: I've been on the edge of my seat the entire time! Courtroom trials are fascinating affairs. As a spectator, at least.Ryunosuke: I'm glad you've been enjoying yourself...Harebrayne: I, I have to ask... ...what on earth is going on?! It makes no sense! What's this Professor business all about? He doesn't look like any professor I've ever met before! Who even is he?Ryunosuke: Ah, of course... ...you were in Germany already ten years ago.Sholmes: Yes, the Professor... When I discovered 'he' was the one who had been abducted, a sense of foreboding stirred within me. But who knew the monster would come knocking at your door? My heartfelt sympathies! Ah ha ha ha ha hah!Ryunosuke: As it turns out... ...Lord van Zieks is even more intimately tied to this case than any of us realised, isn't he?Susato: Yes, how true. His great friend from university in the dock...Sholmes: ...And now a waxwork of the killer who took his esteemed brother's life makes an appearance, too. I imagine even the shrewd Mr Reaper failed to foresee that kick in the teeth. An extraordinary move on your part, my dear fellow, to throw that in front of the man.Ryunosuke: You make it sound deliberate...Susato: I can't help feeling... ...that this Professor case is really very puzzling.Sholmes: Oh yes? In what particular manner?Susato: Well, there's Mr Drebber, Dr Sithe and Lord van Zieks... It seems that everybody in the trial has a link to the case somehow.Harebrayne: Yes, in fact I, alone, am not a member of the set! Though that leaves me as an empty set...all alone with no intersection to any other...???:Excuse me.Ryunosuke: D.........D.........Dr Sithe!Sholmes: Ah, Dr Courtney Sithe, née Stevens. Good day to you.Sithe: Hello, Sholmes. That was very shrewd of you.Sholmes: ...What in particular, pray?Sithe: You requested that ten-year-old autopsy report from Gregson, didn't you?Sholmes: Why would you assume such a thing?Sithe: Because Gregson told me.Sholmes: .........Sithe: To think it's been ten years... Ten years in the laboratory, wielding my scalpel. I smell of nothing but corpses and disinfectant.Ryunosuke: A policeman on the jury had a lot to say about you as it happens, Dr Sithe. And I've...accused you of being complicit in what happened. I'm hoping that you'll take the stand and tell the truth about what really happened.Sithe: That certainly won't be possible.Ryunosuke: ...!Sithe: Lord van Zieks won't be summoning me as a witness. Lord Stronghart has forbidden it.Ryunosuke: Lord Stronghart?Sithe: The Pandora's box you were warned about...is the Professor case. But please don't make the mistake of thinking you'll get any information about it out of me.Susato: But attempting to hide from the truth... That's cowardice!Sithe: I've always fought crime in the way that I see fit. I have no regrets. None at all. And that's all I came here to say. So...good day to you.Ryunosuke: ......... She mentioned it, too. This Pandora's box...Susato: Whatever does it all mean?Sholmes: There's really no cause for concern. I assure you, when the trial resumes... ...the meaning will become all too apparent, whether you'd like it to or not.Ryunosuke: Huh?Sholmes: Now then, I believe it's almost time. I must make my way back to the public gallery. The edge of my seat awaits!Ryunosuke: (I think maybe you're enjoying yourself a little too much...)Sholmes: Ah yes, one word of warning before I go: If, in the course of the trial this afternoon, you perceive even a shadow of doubt about the truth... ...don't let it out of your sight. Pursue it like a dog with a bone.Ryunosuke: ...!Sholmes: To the bitter end, you understand. Do not falter, whatever may come to pass.Ryunosuke: ......... Alright, I understand. ...Thank you.Sholmes: Good. I shall make myself scarce, then. I purchased a bar of caramel earlier, so I shall be gnawing on that as you gnaw away at the truth!Ryunosuke: (What did that warning from Mr Sholmes really mean, I wonder? Especially the bit about 'whatever may come to pass'... .........)It's time for the final chapter, then. I'm determined to find the truth... ...no matter what.24th October, 12:40 p.m. The Old Bailey CourtroomJudge: In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby reconvene the proceedings of this court. Counsels for the defence and prosecution, are you ready and able to continue?Van Zieks: The prosecution is ready, My Lord.Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord. The defence is also ready.Judge: As the court is aware, the case under our scrutiny began with a damaging incident at the Great Exhibition. Yet we now find ourselves embroiled in the details of a convicted felon who was sent to the gallows a decade ago. This trial has certainly defied all expectation.Van Zieks: As seems to be the fate of all trials in which this Nipponese is involved, My Lord.Judge: So then... ...let us begin our exploration of the defence's assertion that the waxwork was cardinally involved in this matter. Lord van Zieks...Van Zieks: My Lord?Judge: Are we still awaiting the arrival of Madame Tusspells?Van Zieks: Not at all. She is in the antechamber as we speak and ready to be summoned.Judge: Very well. Bring in the witness!Van Zieks: At once, My Lord. Bailiff! Show Madame Tusspells to the stand!Ryunosuke: (Things are about to become a lot more intense. If Drebber is responsible, as I'm sure he is, it means he must have had an accomplice...in Dr Sithe.)Susato: And what connects the pair of them...is the waxwork.Ryunosuke: (Yes, the model of the Professor... That's the key to the link between these otherwise unrelated individuals. It's a tenuous link, admittedly. But at present, it's all we have to go on.)Van Zieks: State your name and occupation for the court, please.Tusspells: My name is Madame Esmeralda Tusspells. I am a waxwork artisan. And the proprietress of the Madame Tusspells Museum of Waxwork. You will have to pardon me for working as I testify. My new exhibit must open very soon.Ryunosuke: ......... (Oh, so he finally gets a statue, does he? Now there are two of them in the world...)Susato: Oh my... What expression is she carving onto that face?Van Zieks: A number of days ago, a particular waxwork model was stolen from your museum. Can you confirm this?Tusspells: Oui. That is true. At first, we believed it had been kidnapped.Judge: A waxwork model? Kidnapped?!Tusspells: Yes, My Lord. There was a demand for ransom money left behind by the culprit. However, according to what I have just been told outside the courtroom, that was not the true reason. I understand it was utilised as a substitute for the body of a murder victim?Van Zieks: At present, that is no more than conjecture proposed by the defence. This is the victim of the case in question. Mr Odie Asman.Tusspells: But of course, I know him well. He is a part of my odious personages exhibit. ...I detest to say what is evident, but Mr Asman does not resemble the Professor at all.Ryunosuke: Yes, but...perhaps! Perhaps their faces are very similar!Tusspells: Are you suggesting that we should see now the demasked visage of the Professor? I have here the key, but it is strictly forbidden to open the lock.Van Zieks: This is absurd!Tusspells: Pardon?Van Zieks: I don't know what face you've carved onto your fancy figure beneath that mask... ...but clearly it won't be that of the actual killer.Judge: Indeed. The man's identity was never made public, after all.Van Zieks: The trial took place in a closed court. The proceedings were strictly confidential. The condemned man was summarily executed. His identity remains a closely guarded national secret. There is no possible way that a repository of tawdry exhibits could get its hands on that information.Tusspells: ......... Quel dommage. It would seem you are unaware of the Tusspells' principles.Ryunosuke: What principles?Tusspells: The family Tusspells has always prided itself on sculpting its models à la perfection. Every detail, including the visage, is fashioned with complete fidelity. ...Et voilà: our principles.Susato: There is a well known legend about the Tusspells waxworks from the time of the French Revolution. A member of the Tusspells family is said to have made a waxwork of the queen who was executed.Tusspells: Oui, that is true. It was a century ago now.Susato: I believe the queen's face was carved in the minutes following her death, actually at the guillotine site.Tusspells: You are correct. The model is on display still today in the House of Horrors. We Tusspells will stop at nothing to obtain a faithful replica of our subjects.Judge: Dear me... A somewhat disturbing tenacity of purpose.Tusspells: It is the only way to obtain a truly lifelike representation of the subject. And it has been my family's secret for generations.Ryunosuke: Do, do you mean to say...that beneath that mask...?Tusspells: Oui. The true visage of the killer is there.Van Zieks: ...This is ludicrous. It's out of the question!Tusspells: The Professor spread terror throughout Great Britain. As a result, the Madame Tusspells Special Exhibit remains extremely popular even today. The killer...emerging from his own grave... It is a sight to behold. You should come.Judge: I think, madame, it would be beneficial to hear your formal testimony on this matter. You will explain every detail of this macabre model. And your personal involvement in its creation.Tusspells: ...With pleasure.Witness Testimony - The Professor Waxwork -Tusspells: The special exhibit in the House of Horrors is based on a rumour that shocked society in London. An impression of the visage was taken directly from the corpse...in accordance with Tusspells family principles. I enlisted the aid of the gravedigger, and created a mould for the head in the cemetery just before the interment. I hid myself until he gave me a signal. ...I was there for a very long time that night. As dawn approached, I was very worried that I could be discovered.Judge: The gravedigger?! The man sanctioned this?Tusspells: Oui. I will do all that is necessary to achieve the true resemblance my family is celebrated for. Nobody else knew. Only the gravedigger. What harm did it do, uh?Van Zieks: So you truly saw it? The face of that monster!Tusspells: ......... Naturally, I was aware at the time that his identity was a secret. But Tusspells would not be Tusspells if we did not insist on absolute fidelity to our sculptures.Van Zieks: I don't believe this...Judge: I myself have seen the special exhibit at your museum, madame. A truly blood-curdling scene, in which the murderer is emerging from his own grave.Tusspells: The scene it depicts was the subject of many rumours in London ten years ago. I have here a newspaper from the time. The special exhibit was based upon the picture in this article. It was the most detailed account of what happened, as reported by the eyewitness who saw it.The ten-year-old article has been entered into the Court Record.Van Zieks: 'Man Rises from the Grave!'... It's too absurd for words.Tusspells: The public enjoy absurdity, monsieur. That is why I have reproduced the scene as carefully as possible in my museum.Ryunosuke: And it's a waxwork from that exhibit that was stolen some days before the incident at the Great Exhibition, wasn't it.Tusspells: That is correct. The Professor you see before you here.Judge: Hm... Most puzzling... Counsel for the Defence...proceed with the cross-examination!Ryunosuke: (This waxwork links Drebber to Dr Sithe... And there has to be some reason for that, which hasn't yet come to light. But I'll find it. I'll get to the bottom of what really happened. I'll prove that Dr Sithe and Drebber were in on this crime together!)Cross-Examination - The Professor Waxwork -Tusspells: The special exhibit in the House of Horrors is based on a rumour that shocked society in London.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: And that rumour would be...? Tusspells: A ten-year-old tale now...but one that no Londoner would ever forget. Juror No. 1: Ah, right. I know just what you're talking about, I think. Juror No. 2: Of course, it couldn't be anything else... Juror No. 3: Yes, that story will never disappear. Tusspells: The tale of the condemned killer rising from the dead... That is the central attraction of my House of Horrors. The rumour was whispered all over the city. And it was like this... It was in Lowgate Cemetery behind the prison, in the dead of night after the execution of the killer. The interred Professor slid back the stone slab covering his tomb, and emerged from his grave. A young man who witnessed this felt a scream welling up inside him... ...but an instant later, he heard an ear-splitting gunshot from over his shoulder. The bullet struck the emerging corpse... and he fell motionless once more. The scream finally found its way from the mouth of the young witness, who turned and ran for his life. Ryunosuke: The, the corpse climbed out...of his own grave...? Susato: And then somebody shot him? Who, who was it?! Tusspells: Nobody knows, even today. But remember, it was just a rumour. ...Perhaps nothing more than a ghost story. The good people of London, they love stories like this. That is why it was in every newspaper across the capital. Ryunosuke: But, but was it just a story? I mean, this is exactly the scene that can be seen today at your museum, isn't it? Tusspells: Oui. The special exhibit was modelled on that very illustration. For a while afterwards, the contents of that article were reproduced in every newspaper imaginable. Susato: Madame, might I say something? Tusspells: Please, go ahead, mademoiselle. Susato: When something is described as a rumour, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's entirely made up. I believe that often...rumours contain elements of the truth. Tusspells: Ah, I see that people from the East can be just as astute as the people of Europe. Susato: Can we be sure, for instance, that the Professor's execution was successful? Tusspells: ......... It is not possible for the dead to come back to life. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Tusspells: Ten years ago, I was there in Lowgate Cemetery. After the criminal known as the Professor was killed by hanging... ...I took a wax impression of his visage from the corpse just before it was interred. So I can assure you... ...the man was dead. Ryunosuke: ...I see. Judge: Hmmm... It would certainly appear that the condemned man suffered the intended fate. Van Zieks: .........Tusspells: An impression of the visage was taken directly from the corpse...in accordance with Tusspells family principles.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Is, is that true of every waxwork in your museum then? Tusspells: It is...assuming the subject is dead, of course. Live subjects have to cooperate in a similar way. I have letters from imprisoned criminals all the time, you know. Ryunosuke: What sort of letters? Tusspells: 'When my time comes, please make a waxwork of me.' ...Comme ça. Ryunosuke: No! Tusspells: My museum is famous, monsieur. To be made into a waxwork is an honour. And for some criminals, a symbol of status, even. Ryunosuke: (Because nothing says hardened criminal better than... wax.) Tusspells: And it is thanks to one killer in particular, that my museum has gained such popularity in London. I refer to the star of the special exhibit, of course. The Professor. Van Zieks: ...Whose form you claim to have captured by taking an impression from the actual corpse. Tusspells: ...There are no exceptions to the principles of Tusspells.Tusspells: I enlisted the aid of the gravedigger, and created a mould for the head in the cemetery just before the interment.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Surely that's illegal...isn't it? Tusspells: ......... Van Zieks: It would seem the proprietress of this repository of novelties was blinded by monetary good. Tusspells: It had nothing to do with money. The man is part of London's criminal history. That is why I had to sculpt him. To record this history. It is the raison d'être of the Tusspells museum. Ryunosuke: But if the man was convicted in a closed court and sent for immediate execution... ...then surely nobody but the members of the judiciary present know the killer's true identity. Tusspells: I can assure you, behind that mask is hidden the true face of the Professor. Van Zieks: Do you realise what you're saying?! The Professor's identity is a national secret! Tusspells: ...I understand. And now that the truth about the special exhibit has been revealed, it must perhaps close. Van Zieks: Of course it will. As will your entire museum, if you don't tread very carefully, madame. Tusspells: That could be another interesting chapter in the history of my family, I think, don't you? Ryunosuke: So ten years ago, on the night of the Professor's execution, you took a wax impression of his face from the corpse? Tusspells: Oui. Exactement.Tusspells: I hid myself until he gave me a signal. ...I was there for a very long time that night.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You were there longer than you expected to be? Tusspells: ...I had some...difficulties in capturing the subject's form correctly. As I removed the mask, the mouth of the cadaver fell open and I had some problems with the chin. Ryunosuke: Dare I ask...? Tusspells: The man had been dead for a short while already, you see. His muscles were relaxing and consequently his chin would not align itself correctly. Susato: Oh dear...what a horrible thought... Tusspells: Under normal circumstances, I would have an assistant with me. However, that night, I was alone. And as a consequence, I missed my preferred window of time. Ryunosuke: What do you mean? Tusspells: When I take the impression of the visage of a cadaver... ...I always wait until three hours after death. Ryunosuke: Why three hours? Is that amount of time significant? Tusspells: It is because of rigor mortis. Ryunosuke: A...wriggly mortice? Susato: It's the name given to a phenomenon that occurs in recently deceased bodies. As a rule, three hours post death, the muscles in the body begin to stiffen. By approximately ten hours post death, the entire body is completely rigid and inflexible. And then from that point on, the muscles slowly start to revert to their relaxed state. The effect is often used to estimate the time of death when a body is discovered! Ryunosuke: ......... Well, that was an education. If a slightly scary one. Tusspells: As the mademoiselle says, rigor mortis commences three hours after death...and it starts in the jaw. Van Zieks: I see. So that's why you wait. Tusspells: Before that time, the mouth falls open...and it is very difficult to do my work. Ryunosuke: Ugh...it's getting hard for me to do my work with all this talk of corpses... (Hm...I wonder about that information the court's just heard from Madame Tusspells...) It's significant Ryunosuke: Um...the information about rigor mortis that you just shared with us... Would you mind including it in your formal testimony? I believe it could be significant, you see. Tusspells: Of course. I do not mind at all. Susato: I can't help feeling that after this latest topic... ...the atmosphere in the courtroom has become extremely...grave. Ryunosuke: ...This is no time for jokes, Miss Susato. Judge: Madame, kindly amend your testimony as discussed. Tusspells: Bien sûr. Changes statement from \"I hid myself until he gave me a signal. ...I was there for a very long time that night.\" to \"It took me a very long time because it was before the onset of rigor mortis.\" Wait and see Ryunosuke: (I think I'd rather pretend I didn't hear any of those grim details and try to forget all about it.) Thank you, madame. Please continue. Tusspells: Certainly. So, you comprehend a little of the process now, and why it took me so long that night. Leads back to cross-examinationTusspells: It took me a very long time because it was before the onset of rigor mortis.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Rigor mortis being the phenomenon you described whereby the corpse becomes stiff after death? I think you said that it starts at the jaw, about three hours post death. Is that right? Tusspells: Oui, c'est ça. Of course the exact duration depends a little on the season. Ryunosuke: I didn't realise a waxwork artisan would be so well versed in the subject. Tusspells: Non non, that is only elementary knowledge in the field of legal medicine. Ryunosuke: (Well I had no idea about it. But maybe I won't admit to my ignorance about forensic science.) Susato: Hm... I could ask my father to give you a very simple primer, if you like! Ryunosuke: ......... I think corpses should be your domain. I'm...not good with them. Susato: Oh dear...I'll do my very best.Present Killer's Autopsy Report Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Madame Tusspells...\"Tusspells: As dawn approached, I was very worried that I could be discovered.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You say that dawn was approaching? What was the time of day, then? Approximately. Tusspells: Well...I could not say. But when I left the cemetery with my utensils and wax, the morning light was becoming visible. Van Zieks: The execution took place on 17th June...which had the earliest sunrise of that year. Judge: Indeed it did. First light would have been at around 4:40 in the morning. Ryunosuke: (That really is early.) Tusspells: The fact is, I had very little time. So I finished my work in a half hour. It was necessary to complete the impression and bury the body before daybreak, of course. If somebody had discovered me there, it would have been a catastrophe. So I had to hurry. Ryunosuke: (Is it me, or does Mr Sholmes seem to be taking shape more quickly now, too?) Judge: Hm... You certainly appear to go to extraordinary lengths for your work, madame. Ryunosuke: (I wonder... is what she just said particularly significant?) It's significant Ryunosuke: Madame, those details about how long it took you to complete the sculpture and the early sunrise... Could you include them in your testimony? I believe they may be significant. Tusspells: Of course, if you would like me to. Susato: You're quite right, Mr Naruhodo. It is intriguing. A sunrise at four in the morning would be absolutely unimaginable at home, wouldn't it? Ryunosuke: ...That's not quite what I meant by 'significant'. Judge: Kindly amend your formal testimony then, madame. Tusspells: With pleasure, My Lord. Changes statement from \"As dawn approached, I was very worried that I could be discovered.\" to \"I hurried to finish my work in the half hour before sunrise. Then I left as soon as the corpse was interred.\" Wait and see Ryunosuke: (All it really told us is that sunrise in Great Britain is extremely early at the height of summer, I suppose) Thank you, madame. That's all clear now. Tusspells: How frustrating, I was not concentrating on Mr Sholmes here and I have taken away too much wax. Leads back to cross-examinationTusspells: I hurried to finish my work in the half hour before sunrise. Then I left as soon as the corpse was interred.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Did you have reason to believe you might be discovered once the sun came up or something? Tusspells: I had paid the gravedigger money to keep my little secret, of course. But with the morning light, I knew that the warden from the prison would commence his patrol of the area. Ryunosuke: Couldn't you just have paid off the warden too, then? Tusspells: I had already paid the gravedigger, as I said. You cannot buy the silence of everyone, or the secret is no longer a secret, uh? Van Zieks: The sunrise was at 4:40 a.m. that day. Which means that it would have been around four when you began your sculpting work. Tusspells: Oui, that must be correct. That would be when the gravedigger gave me the signal to come out of hiding.Ryunosuke: (So that's all I have to go on...)Susato: What's your feeling, Mr Naruhodo?Ryunosuke: For some reason, Dr Sithe went along with Drebber's plan. Now, if that's really true... ...then the Professor is the only other thing we know of that links the pair of them. So I feel sure that waxwork must be a clue to this mystery somehow...Susato: In that case, we must use this cross-examination to uncover exactly what it means! Otherwise the jurors are sure to revert their leanings and the trial will be over!Ryunosuke: I agree. But interestingly... ...uncovering what the Professor has to do with all of this means more to Lord van Zieks than anyone. That's...the impression I'm getting, anyway.Susato: Yes, as do I...Ryunosuke: (After all, he has a profound connection to the Professor as well...)Ryunosuke: Madame Tusspells... I have here an autopsy report that was filed ten years ago now. It confirms the death of the Professor following his execution at the gallows.Tusspells: And...is that a problem?Ryunosuke: I believe it is. Because your testimony, and a particular detail in the report... ...completely contradict one another.Tusspells: Quoi?!Van Zieks: Are you going to explain yourself, my Nipponese friend?Ryunosuke: According to her testimony, Madame Tusspells was creating her wax impression just before dawn. And at that time, rigor mortis had not yet set in. Am I correct so far, madame?Tusspells: You are, yes. As I said, the stiffening of the jaw is the first sign of rigor mortis, two to three hours after death. But the man's chin was limp, so he cannot have been dead for a long time.Ryunosuke: But on the other hand, if you look at Dr Sithe's report... ...it quite clearly states the following: 'Death by hanging confirmed at midnight, 17th June.'Van Zieks: No...!Ryunosuke: If the Professor indeed died at midnight that day... ...then by the time you were sculpting his face, rigor mortis would already have set in.Tusspells: Oui! Yes, you are right. The chin, it would have been completely stiff.Ryunosuke: In other words, this report...is wrong!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: No coroner makes mistakes when recording the time of death! The very idea is absurd!Ryunosuke: In that case, there's only one possible conclusion: The execution didn't actually take place at the stated time!Van Zieks: Im...Impossible!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Counsel, this is beyond folly! Not only do you indict the author of the report, Dr Sithe... ...but you also implicate members of staff at Barclay Prison where the execution took place!Juror No. 1: By heck!Juror No. 3: Extraordinary!Juror No. 6: Not in my day!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: My learned friend appears to have overlooked one very crucial fact.Ryunosuke: What fact?Van Zieks: The Professor died that night. Without question!Tusspells: He did! Of course he did! I moved the man's limp jaw with my own hands! There was no-Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: Yes, the Professor died that night. But what if he didn't die at the gallows?Van Zieks: Didn't die at...? Are you insane?! What...what exactly are you suggesting did happen in that case?Ryunosuke: (It's almost impossible to believe, but it would explain the link... ...between Dr Sithe, the Professor...and that one other person of interest!) I have evidence that will explain exactly what I'm suggesting happened that night!Judge: Counsel, present the evidence at once! The evidence that allegedly explains what really happened on the night of the Professor's execution!Present Ten-Year-Old Article Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"What happened that night is written very plainly in this newspaper article!\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Judge: Erm...what have we here? Van Zieks: Van Zieks: Before considering the night of the execution... ...I would strongly advise the defence to concentrate on what is happening right now in this courtroom. Ryunosuke: What? Judge: Quite. The next time you present such a nonsensical article, Counsel... ...you may find that tonight is the night of your own execution! Ryunosuke: (Great. I'm so looking forward to trying again now...) Susato: I won't let anyone execute you, Mr Naruhodo! Not tonight! Leads back to: \"Counsel, present the evidence at once!\"Ryunosuke: What happened that night is written very plainly in this newspaper article! 'Executed criminal returns in the dead of night at local cemetery!'Van Zieks: You're suggesting it was a corpse, coming back from the dead now?!Ryunosuke: Well, if this article is to be believed, yes. The Professor, assumed dead following his execution, emerged from his grave...and was killed again!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: Don't be a fool! That's simply a rumour published by the gutter press!Ryunosuke: Can you be certain of that?Van Zieks: Are you serious?!Ryunosuke: The point is, as the article says, there was a witness to what happened.Judge: My word! Yes, indeed!Tusspells: Mais oui! The young man who stole into the cemetery by chance that night!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: Of course there was a witness. The story didn't write itself! But obviously the man made it all up!Judge: And in any case, this was ten years ago now. There would surely be no hope of finding him.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: On the contrary, My Lord. We all know this witness well!Van Zieks: What?Judge: Are you suggesting, Counsel, that you've identified the person in question? That you know who claims to have seen these utterly incredible events take place?Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord. (In fact, you could say that he's right here before my very eyes!)Judge: You will substantiate your latest claim now then, Counsel. Who is the alleged witness of this staggering scene from the cemetery ten years ago?Present Enoch Drebber profile Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The man in question...is Mr Enoch Drebber!\"Present anyone else Ryunosuke: Judge: ......... I must say, I\"m quite staggered by the scene I see before me now, Counsel. That of a young man with his eyes tightly shut, clearly pointing out a person at random. Van Zieks: At least have the decency to open your eyes and face the result of your blunder, for heaven's sake. Ryunosuke: Gyaaaaaagh! Susato: And perhaps you should keep your eyes open when you collapse on the bench like that, too. For safety's sake. Ryunosuke: ...I'll bear it in mind. Leads back to: \"You will substantiate your latest claim now then, Counsel.\"Ryunosuke: The man in question...is Mr Enoch Drebber!Van Zieks: Drebber?!Judge: The, the previous witness?Ryunosuke: The special exhibit in the House of Horrors at Madame Tusspells Museum of Waxwork... ...recreates that decade-old scene in great detail. The condemned criminal emerging from the grave... And beside the tomb... ...a young man with a lantern stumbling upon the terrifying sight. And that young man... ...is a ten-year-younger Mr Enoch Drebber!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Surely not, Counsel?Van Zieks: Drebber was there? In Lowgate Cemetery?Tusspells: Um... What is all this talk about Mr Drebber? Is the name significant?Ryunosuke: (Of course. Madam [sic] Tusspells doesn't know, does she?) Yes. It's extremely significant, madame. To your situation as well, in fact.Tusspells: What situation?Ryunosuke: The theft of the Professor waxwork from your museum some days ago... ...was perpetrated by the very same man.Tusspells: Non! But...but that would mean...Van Zieks: ......... Madame Tusspells... ...it would appear you know the name...Enoch Drebber.Tusspells: ......... Oui. yes, I know it. But from long ago in the past.Ryunosuke: What?!Susato: Oh my!Judge: Good gracious!Van Zieks: Explain yourself! Tell us everything you know!Tusspells: Yes... Yes, of course.The story of the young man and the terrible sight he witnessed in the cemetery ten years ago... ...was published in every single newspaper in London and throughout Great Britain. However... ...in all of the articles, the witness was simply described as 'a certain young man'. No details were published about his identity. His name was never revealed. That is, apart from in one newspaper.Tusspells: The Daily Circus. It is the paper from which comes the article I have already shown the court.Ryunosuke: You're saying that his full name was only publicised in that article?Judge: Goodness me! Yes, here it is! 'The university student who experienced this shocking event is Mr Enoch Drebber... ...a disciple of science at the University of London, and a resident of its student dorms.'Ryunosuke: Unbelievable!Tusspells:When I read the article, I went to meet with the man. His discovery of the condemned criminal coming back to life in the cemetery in the dead of night... ...would make a perfect exhibit for my House of Horrors, whether it was the truth or not.Judge: I see. So you went to meet Mr Drebber in order to sculpt a waxwork of the man, did you?Tusspells: Exactement. He was studying science at the University of London in those days. He was just a poor student. I paid him five pounds to model for the waxwork. And since that time, it has been in my museum to recreate the scene of terror from the cemetery.Ryunosuke: So, ten years ago, a young man appealed to the public about an extraordinary event he'd witnessed: A criminal who had been put to death, re-emerging from his grave in the middle of the night. But the public treated his claim as nothing more than an amusing anecdote...that was soon forgotten. Ten years later... ...the same man steals a waxwork model of the executed criminal... ...ostensibly to use as a body double for the victim in the case we're discussing here today. Even though the waxwork's build is a poor match for the victim, and its face is obscured by a mask. So the question is...why would the man do such a thing?Van Zieks: .........Ryunosuke: Which brings us to three days ago, when the birdcage crashed into the Crystal Tower. If the birdcage had in fact contained not the body of Mr Asman, but that same waxwork... ...the coroner from Scotland Yard who investigated, Dr Sithe, would have noticed immediately. And yet she submitted this autopsy report for the victim, which the court has seen earlier. Why?Van Zieks: Because the waxwork was that of the Professor, is that what you're saying?Ryunosuke: Dr Sithe put her name to a document confirming the death of a condemned criminal who was still alive. A criminal whose apparent 'resurrection' was witnessed by Mr Drebber. But that misconduct was a deadly secret the coroner would do anything to protect. Which is precisely why Mr Drebber used that particular waxwork as the body double!Van Zieks: Aaaaaargh...!Ryunosuke: My Lord! This court must summon Dr Sithe to the stand! The defence is determined...to find out exactly how the coroner and Mr Drebber are connected!Van Zieks: ...!Judge: But according to the missive I received this morning through the Prosecutor's Office... ...Dr Sithe is unable to participate in these proceedings. Is that not the case?Van Zieks: .........Susato: She told us so herself, didn't she?Sithe: Lord van Zieks won't be summoning me as a witness. Lord Stronghart has forbidden it.Ryunosuke: Lord Stronghart?Sithe: The Pandora's box you were warned about...is the Professor case. But please don't make the mistake of thinking you'll get any information about it out of me.Ryunosuke: (Something happened on the night of that killer's execution ten years ago. And surely nobody would want to get to the bottom of that more...than Lord van Zieks!)Van Zieks: ......... The prosecution calls...for the instructions in that missive to be scrapped!Ryunosuke: ...!Judge: But, but Lord van Zieks! The missive was issued from the Lord Chief Justice's office.Van Zieks:Van Zieks: The assigned prosecutor has the final say on policy in any particular trial. In other words...me.Ryunosuke: Yes...!Van Zieks: Let Enoch Drebber and Dr Sithe...both take the stand together.Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Very well, I will uphold your request. Bailiff! Send a subpoena with immediate effect, addressed to Dr Sithe of the Forensic Investigation Team. The woman is compelled to attend on Her Majesty's orders!Ryunosuke: (Alright then. Enoch Drebber and Dr Sithe... If they weren't colluding with one another, this crime could never have been committed. I'm just a stone's throw away, I can feel it. The truth behind all of this is about to come out!)Van Zieks: Thank you for your attendance at such short notice... Dr Sithe.Sithe: I'm disappointed in you, Lord van Zieks. You've completely betrayed the agreed policy of both Scotland Yard and the Prosecutor's Office.Van Zieks: Betrayal is not in my nature...as long as the truth isn't compromised. If it is... If there's even a hint of wrongdoing...then no matter whom it concerns or disgruntles... ...I will pursue the matter to the bitter end. As would any prosecutor worth his salt.Sithe: .........Ryunosuke: Mr Drebber... ...you took the victim's life by means of a machine that you constructed in your workshop.Drebber: .........Ryunosuke: And Dr Sithe... ...as the investigating coroner, you were the first on the scene to examine the victim's body. It is the belief of the defence... ...that you collaborated with each other and were both complicit in this crime.Sithe: And where's your evidence?Ryunosuke: At present, we have no definitive evidence. But we do have a very significant clue.Sithe: What are you talking about?Ryunosuke: I'm talking, of course, about the waxwork! This model of the killer known as the Professor...who was sentenced to death ten years ago.Sithe: You don't need to tell me. I witnessed the man's execution with my own eyes. And officially pronounced him dead.Ryunosuke: ...That remains to be seen.Sithe: Is that so?Ryunosuke: According to newspaper reports from the time, on the night following his execution... ...the killer came back to life.Sithe: Tsk! Don't waste my time!Ryunosuke: And the sole witness to that mysterious event... ...was you, Mr Drebber, wasn't it?Drebber: .........Ryunosuke: If what you saw in the graveyard that night ten years ago wasn't some chilling fiction, but reality... ...it would make you privy to a very great secret of Dr Sithe's. A secret so profound, it could compel the coroner to agree to collaborate in your evil scheme, in fact.Drebber: .........Ryunosuke: Mr Drebber, tell the court! Tell everyone the truth of what you saw that night in Lowgate Cemetery!Drebber: .........So he was the student who saw it... You can see the resemblance actually, can't you? With the man in Madame Tusspells, I mean. Surely he's not going to claim that's really what he saw. Especially not after all these years. He was a research student at the University of London, was he? And a bit too clever for his own good, if you ask me... Kuh kuh kuh...Drebber: What an interesting twist.Ryunosuke: ...?Drebber: When at the time, not one person would take me seriously. Yet now here we are, ten years later, and suddenly my story matters. And in a court of law, too. Very well, then. If everyone so wishes. Let's be frank. I'll tell you the truth of what happened that night...for what it's worth.Sithe: .........Drebber: .........Judge: So, Mr Drebber... ...your testimony, please. About the events of that night ten years ago. You will tell the court exactly what you stumbled across in Lowgate Cemetery!Drebber: Yes of course. As you wish.Witness Testimony - In The Cemetery Ten Years Earlier -Drebber: The reason I was in Lowgate Cemetery at all ten years ago was for...a spot of moonlighting, shall we say? Yes, the illustration in that newspaper article was based on what I witnessed that night. But thinking back now, I realise that I never actually saw the Professor. Soon afterwards, I was visited by a young woman who sculpted a model of me from wax. Then I gave up on my dream of becoming a scientist. And it was all because of that newspaper article.Ryunosuke: Wait a minute! You're, you're claiming you didn't actually see the Professor now?!Drebber: Of course. You'd have to have a screw loose if you believed a corpse could come back from the dead.Ryunosuke: But... So you're saying this article is...Drebber: ...Not worth the paper it's printed on? I think that would describe it perfectly, yes.Ryunosuke: Agh!Susato: If the details in the article aren't true... ...it nullifies your argument for why Mr Drebber and Dr Sithe would have been working together.Ryunosuke: (So he's discrediting himself to cripple my argument?!)Judge: Tell me, witness... ...you claim to have been in the cemetery on some... auxiliary business. Can you elaborate?Drebber: That's right. Graverobbing, to be precise. As you know, Lowgate Cemetery is at the rear of Barclay Prison. So among students at the university, it had a reputation for being haunted by the ghosts of condemned convicts.Judge: G-Graverobbing, you say?!Drebber: Yes. Exhuming fresh corpses to sell is reasonably lucrative. Of course, I never laid a finger on any valuables buried with the dead.Van Zieks: So you were one of the so-called Resurrectionists. A particularly unpleasant scourge on society.Drebber: Actually, my fellows and I went by another name: 'The Repurposers'.Judge: That, that is quite beyond the pale! You would invite divine retribution, sir!Drebber: Yes, well...I think I suffered retribution enough. The Daily Circus...eventually unearthed my name and put it in print. It caused me a great many headaches. In the end, I had to leave the university. ...That was the only paper with the bad grace to identify me unambiguously, I might add.Ryunosuke: I see...Van Zieks: Out of interest, who drew the illustration for this article?Drebber: Ah yes, that was the reporter who exposed me. He sketched that right in front of me as I described the scene. Obviously, as time ticked on, I bitterly regretted what I'd done. Claiming to have seen something I never truly saw... Foolish. Very foolish.Judge: Hmmm...

Wondrous new works of culture and industry from every corner of the globe had converged on Hyde Park. Welcoming over fifty million visitors, the last great hurrah of this century astonished and delighted people of all nations, and ended on a note of resounding success. But, as regards to the terrible catastrophe that occurred during the festivities, very few are aware my friend, Mr Herlock Sholmes, had a hand in unravelling the matter. For, from the shadows, it was he who earnestly unearthed the facts of the case. And like the centrepiece of the Great Exhibition, which rose high into the skies of Hyde Park, Sholmes's brilliant deductions - as clear and lofty as the Crystal Tower itself - brought the truth to light. Rendered dialogue We're here at the showground of the Great Exhibition, which is absolutely packed with people... The weather is unusually fine, and we're about to witness a most extraordinary scientific experiment! Ladies and gentlemen, the twentieth century will see steam engines and electrical power dominate the world! Horse-drawn carts will give way to the motor car! Ships will sprout wings and take to the skies! And today, we showcase even more advanced technology! A glimpse into the future! A world first! A demonstration of my super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine! A man will literally be disassembled by a pulse of high-voltage electricity, and beamed to another location... ...whereupon his body will be reassembled by a series of complex calculations exactly as it was before! In but a few moments from now... ...this gentleman will, in the blink of an eye, complete an incredible journey through the air... ...to arrive an instant later, on the Crystal Tower behind you! 22nd October, 9:36 a.m. Sholmes's Suite Ryunosuke: ......... Iris: ...Runo! Runo, are you listening? Ryunosuke: Oh! Sorry, um...what was that, Iris? Iris: Hmph. What's the matter with you? You've been miles away all morning. Didn't you like what I cooked for breakfast? Ryunosuke: No no, that's not it at all. Um...what were we talking about again? Iris: Today's paper! It's full of news about the Great Exhibition again! Ryunosuke: Ah yes...the Great Exhibition... I'd like to go sometime. ......... Iris: You're really not your usual self today. You seem very down. Don't you agree, Hurley? Sholmes: Hm...? Did you say something? Iris? Iris: Oh gosh! You're even more down! Sholmes: ......... UWAAAAAAAAAGH!!! Wh-When did you arrive, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: I've...been here for about half an hour already. We had breakfast together. Sholmes: What?! Why didn't you mention it before? Ryunosuke: I, um...thought you might have known I was here. You know, because...breakfast? Sholmes: Hm, Iris is quite right. You're clearly lacking in vim. So much so that I didn't notice your presence. Ryunosuke: (...Thanks.) Sholmes: Of course, I could deduce the reason perfectly well with some simple observations. Ryunosuke: What?! Sholmes: Let's see... Yes, for example, your tussled hair this morning, with all its unruly spikes. Clearly it can be deduced therefore, that- Ryunosuke: Um, let me stop you there, Mr Sholmes, because I think I can see where this is going. My hair always looks like this. It always has. Ever since we first met, in fact. Sholmes: Oh really? How interesting. It just doesn't look like a haircut as such, I suppose. Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Ryunosuke: (...Thanks again.) ......... It crossed my mind recently...that it's been six months now. Iris: Six months? Ryunosuke: Since I was forbidden from working in court. So I've been wondering how much longer I'm going to be banned. Iris: Oh... Well, that would explain why you seem rather glum. Don't you agree, Hurley? Sholmes: Hm...? Did you say something? Iris? Ryunosuke: (Ah...back to moping...) Ryunosuke: What's the matter with Mr Sholmes today? He seems even more down in the dumps than me. Iris: I know! And the Great Exhibition has opened! You'd think he'd be excited. Oh, why don't we all go to see it together? Sholmes: I want to! Of course I do! But I can't! ...Not for the time being. Ryunosuke: Why not? Sholmes: Why not? Why not?! Because! I'm a great detective, after all! Ryunosuke: (So you're embroiled in some tricky case that you can't be distracted from? Is that it?) Iris: I don't remember hearing that you're working on a case, Hurley. Sholmes: ......... Ryunosuke: (I suppose I should try to find out what's going on.) After clearing all Converse options: Sholmes: Well, I must be leaving now. Ryunosuke: Yes, understood. See you later, Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: Hah! You really are a shameless liar sometimes, my dear fellow! Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: You seek to put me off my guard and follow me, don't you? Well, you would be wasting your time. Ryunosuke: The thought hadn't crossed my mind! (But now I'm wondering where you're going...) Sholmes: Ah ha ha ha hah! Well then, 'see you later' indeed! Ryunosuke: (Listen to him. He's still laughing on his way out of the door...) Iris: Alright then, Runo! Let's get going! Ryunosuke: Oh! Um, Iris... What are you wearing? Iris: I've got changed to go to the Great Exhibition. You're going to take me! Ryunosuke: What? But, but I was just about to go to the Supreme Court... Iris: Oh! Well that sounds fun, too! You're going to take me there, then! Ryunosuke: Alright, fine. Just...lower that weapon, would you? Iris: Of course! And after the Supreme Court, then we'll go to see the Great Exhibition! 22nd October Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy 22nd October British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Ryunosuke: It's been about six months now since I was last here. But some things never change. Like the sense of foreboding I always seem to feel in this place. (It doesn't seem to be bothering Iris at all, though. She's happily reading over there...) Iris: Oh, I love this place! I always find so many interesting books here! Ryunosuke: Of course. I was forgetting that you've been here before. (The time we came here six months ago... ...when Susato-san was given the news that she was to return to Japan.) ???: Ah. I understand you wish to speak with me. Ryunosuke: Oh! L-Lord Stronghart! I trust you've been k-keeping well? Stronghart: Let's see... Since you've arrived and requested an audience, it's been four hours, thirty-two minutes and... ...twenty-six seconds. I've kept you waiting a while. My apologies. Ryunosuke: Oh no, not at all! I like nothing more than standing around, staring into space. Stronghart: ...Good to know. Ryunosuke: (...Good to know that doesn't appear to bother him at all.) Mael Stronghart, Lord Chief Justice of London. He's the man who allowed me to start practising as a defence lawyer when I arrived in Britain as a student. You need only savour the air for a moment in this grand office to understand his pre-eminent status. Stronghart: As you will be aware, the Great Exhibition of London is now underway at last. We're extremely busy as a result. Policing the grounds, guarding the new technologies, dealing with petty crime... And furthermore, as of next month, we shall open the International Forensic Science Symposium. Ryunosuke: Oh...I've not heard about that. Stronghart: Investigating authorities from forty countries around the globe will be taking part. Including from your own land. Forensic science is the future! The world must embrace it! As we're the hosting nation, I have much to do. And it is my highest priority. If others must wait for my attention as a result, so be it. Ryunosuke: (...Well, it's nice to know where I stand.) Stronghart: So...you wish to consult with me? Of course, I can very well imagine what this is about. Ryunosuke: Ah...well, um... Thank you for agreeing to this meeting, My Lord! (I want to be allowed to start working as a defence lawyer again in court. That's what brought me here today. But actually, there's something else playing on my mind, as it happens...) Iris: Runo, just take a deep breath and come out with it! After clearing all Converse options: Stronghart: Well, I must be leaving for my next engagement. I'm already...eleven hours and sixteen minutes late. ...My colleagues may be starting to fidget. Ryunosuke: E-Eleven hours late? That's...quite something. Stronghart: That meeting had already started when I arrived back here for this engagement with you. So lateness was inevitable. Time stops for no man. Ryunosuke: (I'm sure it stopped for me during those twelve solid arguments and two hundred and twenty-three reasons...) Oh, yes! Where would I find Lord van Zieks now? Stronghart: I would assume he's at his office. Ryunosuke: (Right, I'll go and ask him about the attack in person. I want to get this straight from the horse's mouth...) Stronghart: Away with you now. I'm leaving Professor Harebrayne's defence entirely in your hands. Ryunosuke: Of, of course, yes! Thank you very much, My Lord! 22nd October Prosecutor's Office Iris: Ooh! So this is the legendary Reaper's office? Ryunosuke: Yes, it appears so. Iris: Brrr, it sends a chill down your spine, doesn't it? What an amazingly deathly atmosphere! Ryunosuke: ...Oh, is that...? (That hooded figure was so still, I hadn't noticed his or her presence. I wonder who it is...?) ???: What are you doing here? Ryunosuke: Agh! Van Zieks: ......... Ryunosuke: (He's as unwelcoming as I thought he'd be. Actually, maybe even more so...) Oh, I, um... I'm glad to see you're well. Van Zieks: ...I am. Ryunosuke: ......... So...who's the person over by the wall being...punished for something or other? Van Zieks: No punishment is taking place here. Ryunosuke: Oh. Van Zieks: That's my apprentice. And he's sitting there of his own free will. Ryunosuke: I didn't know you had an apprentice. (It must be the same person who was pictured in the newspaper...) Van Zieks: He's very able in combat. ...A requisite skill for anyone under my tutelage. Ryunosuke: Are you referring to the attack on the Reaper that was reported in the papers? Van Zieks: The Reaper? I'd be interested to know the Reaper's true identity myself. Assuming, that is, such a fabled fiend genuinely inhabits our great courtrooms... After clearing all Converse options: Van Zieks: Ah yes, there's something I've been meaning to ask you... Ryunosuke: Oh! What's that? Van Zieks: That Nipponese man. Is he faring well? Ryunosuke: Sorry? Van Zieks: The one arrested twice in succession six months ago. With the stoop. And the moustache. And the jitters. Ryunosuke: Ah! Mr Natsume, you mean? Iris: ...I'm not sure he'd be very pleased to find out you identified him from that list, Runo. Ryunosuke: He's fine, thank you. In fact, I received a letter from him by international post only the other day. Van Zieks: I see. ......... Well, I think we can end our discussion there, don't you? There's little time left before tomorrow's trial. I advise you to spend it investigating the case. Ryunosuke: Yes, thank you for the advice. And for the conversation. (I can't believe he's asking after Soseki-san. After a 'Nipponese'! I'm not sure whether to feel happy about that or worried.) Iris: I never imagined that Mr Reaper would be friends with a mad scientist, did you? That's a turn-up for the books! Ryunosuke: A mad scientist? Ah, you mean Professor Harebrayne? (Yes, it might be worth quizzing the professor about his relationship with Lord van Zieks, I think.) 22nd October Local Prison, Cell 11 Ryunosuke: The warden said cell eleven. That's this one... Iris: Oh! There's someone curled up in a ball in the back corner, look! Ryunosuke: What's his name again? Professor Albert Harebrayne, wasn't it? ...Um, excuse me! Professor Harebrayne! Harebrayne: ...! Who are you? Ryunosuke: I'm Ryunosuke Naruhodo. I'm a defence lawyer. Harebrayne: A LAWYER! Ryunosuke: Agh! (Was it something I said?!) Harebrayne: A, a lawyer, you say? W-W-W-Would you be here... a-a-a-about the experiment? ARE YOU GOING TO DEFEND MY HYPOTHESIS?! Ryunosuke: Your...hypothesis? Sorry, I don't- Harebrayne: Yesterday's demonstration! That demonstration was... That magnificent demonstration was... It was an out-and-out success! By anyone's calculations! B-B-B-But despite that... ...no one listens! No lawyer believes in the science! When it's explained, they all leave...at high velocity! Haah... Ryunosuke: ......... (Now's probably not a good time to mention that your zeal made my concentration leave for a while, too...) After clearing all Converse options: Ryunosuke: So, Professor, let me just make absolutely sure I've understood you properly. The huge explosion that occurred yesterday... That was an accident, you're saying? You had no intent to harm the victim, who was in fact the sole investor in your work. Is that correct? Harebrayne: As correct as two squared is four! I swear it! Yes, it's true that the man perished in a machine of my invention. So I know that I'm far from blameless in all this. But still! I would never use my discoveries, my inventions, to take a person's life! Not in a centillion years! I'm a man of science! It's all I know! You have to believe me! Please! Do you believe me? Do you believe in my hypothesis? Science is the pursuit of truth, you know. I've always believed that. All my life! Ryunosuke: ......... I'm afraid I don't know much about science. Or your theories. But I do believe you. And I will fight to prove your innocence with all my might. I'm a man of the law! It's all I know! You have to believe me! Please! Harebrayne: ......... When I went to live in Germany after I graduated, I learnt something very important. Nationality, class, lineage...none of that matters. As long as you try your hardest, you can achieve anything. Ryunosuke: Thank you for that, Professor. Harebrayne: And thank you in advance for defending me tomorrow in court! Iris: Alright, Runo, it's time! Time to visit the Great Exhibition! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Iris: Well, that's where the incident happened, isn't it? Ryunosuke: Yes, I suppose that's true. (Time to investigate at last!) 22nd October The Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower Ryunosuke: Ugh... The showgrounds are a little too big for my liking... We've been walking around in dense crowds for two hours now, and I've felt myself swooning three times. Iris: There are a lot of people, aren't there? I've almost been trodden on three times, too! Ryunosuke: ...Be careful, won't you, Iris? Don't let go of my hand. (We've finally made it through the throngs though, by the look of it. Here we are underneath the public experimentation stage where the explosion happened yesterday.) ???: .........! ???: .........! Ryunosuke: (What's that...? I can hear voices from up on the stage. It sounds like an argument...) ???: Right, I've had it with you this time! I'm warnin' you, I'll arrest you in a minute! ???: Oh yeah? Go on then, 'Spector, give it a shot! You ain't got no evidence, an' you know it! Ryunosuke: (Wait... I know those voices.) ???: You've got a cheeky little mouth on you, young lady! But a night in the cells will teach you some manners! ???: Just try it, I dare ya! If ya want that bag o' chips rammed down yer throat! Iris: Yoo-hoo! Gregsy! What are you doing up there? Gregson: ......... Ah! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! It's you! Here! You're here! Here you are! You! Here! Your Ladyshiiip! How are you, Your Ladyship? I do hope you're well, Your Ladyship? Ryunosuke: (...Does that make her three times a lady?) Iris: I'm not well at all. It's far too busy everywhere. I wanted to ride in a balloon, but there was a three-hour queue. Gregson: Unbelievable! I'll go an' have a word for you at once, Your Ladyship! You'll be flyin' as high as a kite in no time once I pull some strings for you! Ryunosuke: Tobias Gregson, an inspector at Scotland Yard. Until recently, he was suspended from duty, but it would appear he's back in action now. He's actually quite well known, appearing as he does in 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes'. And for that reason, he can't say a word wrong to the stories' author, Iris. (But there are limits, surely... Or there should be!) Gregson: Watch it, sunshine! Ryunosuke: S-Sorry... Gregson: What gives, then? Don't tell me you're on this case? Ryunosuke: Yes, I'm acting for the defence. Iris: So we're here to investigate! Gregson: Hmmm... Dear me, that's the situation, is it? Ryunosuke: (Is it really that troubling?) ???: Tsk. A measly five bob? Is that all ya got? Yer a lawyer, ain't ya? Ya could stand to carry a bit more copper around in yer pockets, Mr Narra-'Oddo! Ryunosuke: Wha...? Hey! That's my last bit of spending money, that is! ???: Ya can 'ave it back, but I'll 'ave to charge ya for all the bother. Three bob. Ryunosuke: This is Gina Lestrade, a pickpocket, or 'diver', born and bred in the East End of London. In the case that led to my own suspension six months ago... ...this is the young girl I was defending in court. Gina: Wot's yer problem, eh, 'Oddo?! 'Diver'? Pickpocket? Wot's wiv all the name-callin'? You wanna bag o' chips rammed down yer throat an' all, do ya? Ryunosuke: I, I thought you were proud to be a diver, Gina? You were just arguing with Inspector Gregson about it, weren't you? I assumed you'd been up to your usual tricks here at the showground. Gina: That ain't no way to talk to a lady, 'Oddo. 'Alf a year's a long time. People can change. I'm an apprentice now. Learnin' to be a Scotland Yard detective. So you'll 'ave to call me wot everyone else does: It's Inspector Lestrade now! Ryunosuke: In... Inspector?! (That badge is homemade, surely...) Gregson: The 'inspector' part isn't entirely accurate. No one calls her that. For what it's worth, anyway. Investigatin' is off the cards for all of us. Iris: What's that supposed to mean? Gregson: Right, well, I'll be back up top. You hold the fort down here, alright? Gina: Right...sir. Ryunosuke: (This... This raises a LOT of questions!) After clearing all Converse options and examining green cloth on ground, device on ground, and large hole in glass in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower and clearing all Converse options and examining large machine in Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage: Iris: Runo, Runo, listen! Ryunosuke: What? What is it? Iris: I've been thinking... Hurley might know something, mightn't he? Ryunosuke: About what? Iris: About Mr Reaper! Ryunosuke: ...! About what happened to Lord van Zieks, you mean? (Because it sounds like something very significant occurred after he graduated from university. Something that completely changed his life.) Maybe, but I have no idea where to find Mr Sholmes at the moment. He's in the middle of some big case, isn't he? Iris: Here, this is what you need! Ryunosuke: What's this? (Some kind of entrance ticket?) 'Madame Tusspells'? Is this supposed to mean something to me? Iris: You don't know it?! It's the most popular attraction in London at the moment! It's very close to Baker Street, actually. We could go now, if you like? Ryunosuke: No no, we don't have time for visiting attractions today, Iris. We have a big trial tomorrow! Iris: But that's where Hurley is. Ryunosuke: What? At, at this popular London attraction? Iris: Yes! Ryunosuke: How is it that you know where he is? Iris: Hurley told me. But he told me to keep it a secret from you, Runo. Ryunosuke: Madame Tusspells...? (I don't see how it could be related to the case we're investigating here, but then... ...stranger things have happened. And when they happen, Mr Sholmes is usually at the heart of them.) 22nd October The Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage Ryunosuke: So that's it, is it? The machine that blew up. Iris: Ooh, it must have been a magnificent explosion! And I've seen my fair share. Ryunosuke: You've seen things like this before, you mean? Iris: Of course! Hurley's always doing experiments that end in a bang. In fact, in his own words, 'Explosions are the very essence of chemistry!' Ryunosuke: Ah...that might explain the smell of burning that frequently comes wafting up the stairs. Iris: One time, he made something that exploded with such force, it took the roof off the building! I wish you'd been there to see it, Runo! Ryunosuke: ...It's hard to get too excited about that...given that I now live in the roof. Iris: Well anyway, that's enough about that. It's time to investigate! Ryunosuke: Ah look, Inspector Gregson is over there. He seems to be deep in thought about something... whilst eyeing up the machine carefully. Iris: Really? He just looks confused to me. Ryunosuke: It ripped itself apart magnificently, didn't it? Iris: Magnificently...and mercilessly. Ryunosuke: So someone stands in the middle of the machine to be disassembled and then 'beamed' through the air... Iris: Yes, 'beamed' not 'blasted'. That's the point. Ryunosuke: (Yes, that part's crucial, really.) Is something like that even possible, though, Iris? Iris: Oh, Runo. I'm just a child. How should I know? Ryunosuke: (A child when it suits you, you mean...) Iris: From what I can tell, I think if you were to pull this lever here- Gregson: STOOOOOOOOOOOOP! Don't touch that! Iris: Ah ha ha! That was practically instantaneous kinesis the way you flew over just now, Gregsy! Gregson: Please, Your Ladyship... I didn't mean to startle you, but I can't let you touch anything up here. Iris: So sorry. You can have some of my latest special blend to make up for it. Gregson: *Glug* *Glug glug glug* Aaah! Wonderful! This stuff really is wonderful! Ryunosuke: (It's just like old times, this is...) We're representing Professor Harebrayne in court tomorrow, Inspector. So we should be allowed to examine the scene! Gregson: Hah! Listen, sunshine, even I'm not allowed to touch anythin' up here! It's that blasted Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act to blame. It's drivin' me potty! Ryunosuke: Oh yes, that special dispensation... (The professor mentioned that, too.) Gregson: More red tape's all we need. I dunno what the government thinks it's playin' at sometimes. Iris: But...we're allowed to just look, aren't we? Gregson: Eh? Iris: Surely that's alright...isn't it, Gregsy? Gregson: ......... 'Course, Your Ladyship! Anythin' you say, Your Ladyship! But please don't get your dainty hands dirty, will you? Iris: Don't worry. We wouldn't dream of touching anything, would we, Runo? Ryunosuke: (She really knows how to get what she wants...) After clearing all Converse options and examining green cloth on ground, device on ground, and large hole in glass in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower and clearing all Converse options and examining large machine in Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage: Gregson: Right, are you done here, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Sorry? Gregson: Isn't it about time you were leavin'? Or rather...it IS about time you were leavin'! That lot are here now. Iris: That lot? Gregson: The Forensic Investigation Team. They'll be givin' me the heave-ho in a minute, too. Iris: Oh dear. Poor Gregsy. Here! Have another cup of my special blend to cheer you up! Gregson: *Glug* *Glug glug glug* Aaah! That hit the spot! Yup, hits it every time! Ryunosuke: (Well, at least I've seen the scene with my own eyes. It looks like this is as far as we're going to get with our investigations here at least...) Iris: I've been thinking... Hurley might know something, mightn't he? Ryunosuke: About what? Iris: About Mr Reaper! Ryunosuke: ...! About what happened to Lord van Zieks, you mean? (Because it sounds like something very significant occurred after he graduated from university. Something that completely changed his life.) Maybe, but I have no idea where to find Mr Sholmes at the moment. He's in the middle of some big case, isn't he? Iris: Here, this is what you need! Ryunosuke: What's this? (Some kind of entrance ticket?) 'Madame Tusspells'? Is this supposed to mean something to me? Iris: You don't know it?! It's the most popular attraction in London at the moment! It's very close to Baker Street, actually. We could go now, if you like? Ryunosuke: No no, we don't have time for visiting attractions today, Iris. We have a big trial tomorrow! Iris: But that's where Hurley is. Ryunosuke: What? At, at this popular London attraction? Iris: Yes! Ryunosuke: How is it that you know where he is? Iris: Hurley told me. But he told me to keep it a secret from you, Runo. Ryunosuke: Madame Tusspells...? (I don't see how it could be related to the case we're investigating here, but then... ...stranger things have happened. And when they happen, Mr Sholmes is usually at the heart of them.) Prosecutor's Office Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy 22nd October Madame Tusspells Museum of Waxworks Ryunosuke: Wh-What is this place? L-Look at all these t-terrifying scenes! But why are all the p-people so still? (Guillotines... Ruthless murderers... I know what I'll be dreaming about tonight.) Iris: They're all wax models. They're amazingly realistic, aren't they? What do you think, Runo? Shocked? Ryunosuke: W-W-WAX MODELS?! .........AAAAAAAAAGH! I, I read about d-dead bodies and wax once...in a m-magazine about strange phenomena. Depending on how c-c-corpses are kept after death, p-parts of them can turn to wax, apparently. It's c-called a...adi...adip... Adipocere! Iris: ...Stop talking about creepy things like that, Runo. You're scaring me. Anyway, adipocere doesn't form readily, you know. It's only in very specif- Ryunosuke: AAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Iris: What now? Ryunosuke: I've, I've just remembered something else I read, in another m-magazine about strange phenomena. There was an old lady - maybe a w-witch - who used to pour molten wax over c-corpses and put them on display. Iris: None of the exhibits in here are real. They're all entirely man-made replicas. Ryunosuke: They can't be! Do you really expect me to believe that? Just look at them! Iris: Oh! Ryunosuke: There's no way anybody could make models of people that are this realistic! And...they're all such gruesome scenes... .........Wait. Iris: What is it? Ryunosuke: Oh...no... (I must be seeing things...) Ryunosuke: It's...it's... ...the great detective, Mr Herlock Sholmes! (Mr Sholmes has his own wax statue in here? Really?) Iris: Well he is world-famous, after all! Ryunosuke: It's an uncanny resemblance, isn't it? It makes my skin crawl to look at it... Iris: I know! But look, Runo. You can kick this Hurley, and he doesn't move a muscle! Ryunosuke: You can't go around kicking the exhibits, Iris! .........Wait. It, it just moved, I'm sure. And not just a little bit, either! Iris: Hm? Really? Did it? Ryunosuke: And look closely... ...there are beads of sweat on the face...of this waxwork... model... ......... Ryunosuke: ......... Sh-Shall we move on, Iris? ...Over there, look! There's a great murder scene to enjoy! Much more appealing. Sholmes: Sholmes: My dear fellow! I take exception to your recoiling in such a manner, as if you've seen something truly abhorrent! Ryunosuke: Mr...Mr Sholmes! (I knew it!) Sholmes: Iris, what possessed you?! I strictly forbade you from divulging my temporary waxwork secret to Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: Temporary waxwork? What do you mean? Sholmes: And that kick! Could you not have exercised a little more restraint? You winded me! Iris: But Runo has something he needs to ask you. Sholmes: Ah...a question? Iris: And I thought you'd probably be getting bored, too. So here we are! Sholmes: Hm... Well, I can't deny that your timing was impeccable. A mere two minutes more being stationary like that... ...and my great brain, upon which all my success has been built, would have turned to wax! Ryunosuke: ...Thank goodness we arrived in time. Sholmes: Indeed. In many ways, the pair of you just saved the world from an unimaginable loss! Iris: Oh, Hurley! You do like to talk nonsense, don't you? Ryunosuke: (He could know something, it's true. About Lord van Zieks, and what happened in the past to change him.) Sholmes: Now that you're here, let's take our time. How can I be of assistance? For you're in luck. I'm suddenly quite taken with the idea of conversing! Ryunosuke: Oh...well, actually, I'm in quite a hurry. Sholmes: And if my eyes don't deceive me... ...I believe something is afoot within the walls of this very museum. A most fascinating case, if I'm not mistaken. Ryunosuke: Really? Sholmes: Moreover... ...I have a strong suspicion that it is related to the matter about which you've come to me now. Ryunosuke: (But...how could it be?) Sholmes: We shall speak again presently, my dear fellow. But for now, I must return to my work. Ryunosuke: (What, back to being a temporary waxwork exhibit?) Sholmes: ......... Well? What is it you'd like to ask me, then? Ryunosuke: Um. Actually, it's... It's about Lord van Zieks. Sholmes: Ah, our friend Mr Reaper. How did you find him? Well, I trust? And so I filled Mr Sholmes in about everything I'd learnt. About Lord van Zieks... About Professor Harebrayne... And about the strange coincidence that they had been at university together. Ryunosuke: So I'm wondering what it was that happened to make Lord van Zieks such a different person. Iris: I was sure that you'd know, Hurley. Sholmes: ......... Ryunosuke: You said there was something going on here in this exhibit hall before. That something was afoot. And that you believed it was related to what I wanted to ask you about. Sholmes: ......... Ryunosuke: Um, Mr Sholmes...? (He's suddenly clammed up.) Sholmes: Well, it seems we've reached the unavoida- ???: Greetings... Ryunosuke: Oh! Ah...hello. (Where did she appear from? And what's she wearing? Could she look any more mysterious?) ???: I hope...you are appreciating my museum? Ryunosuke: Sorry? Have we...? Mr Sholmes, do you know this- (Not again!) Tusspells: My apologies. I am Esmeralda Tusspells. This is my museum of waxwork. Ryunosuke: Wha... You... You're THE Madame Tusspells? Tusspells: Bien sûr. Though only twenty-six years young, I might add. Ryunosuke: ...Is that significant somehow? Tusspells: I'm a 'madame' in name only. It adds a certain...je ne sais quoi. Ryunosuke: Right... Tusspells: Firstly, I must apologise for my waxworks. Or rather, one waxwork in particular. Ryunosuke: (That'll be Mr Sholmes, then.) Tusspells: I was led to believe he was a great detective, but he seems...unable to settle. Next time you move from your designated exhibit...there WILL be toil and trouble. Iris: She sounds deadly serious. Ryunosuke: (That's a problem. How am I supposed to ask Mr Sholmes about Lord van Zieks now?) Iris: Let's not forget what Hurley said before. About something being afoot right here in the museum, I mean. Ryunosuke: Yes, I know, but... Iris: I'm so curious! I want to know what's happening here! Ryunosuke: (Haven't we got enough on our plate already?!) Ryunosuke: Um, I wonder...could I ask you something? Tusspells: Bien sûr... Ryunosuke: I'm just curious. Is anything going on in the museum at the moment. [sic] Some kind of incident, perhaps? Tusspells: ......... Whoever suggested such a thing to you? Ryunosuke: Oh, well, it was... ...your temporary waxwork over there who mentioned it to me a little- Oh! (He's disappeared!) ???: ...A wax model is a work of art. Not some tawdry object for trade. Ryunosuke: Ah! Th-There you are! Tusspells: Leaving the exhibit again when you should be working? ...Do you wish to be melted down? Sholmes: My dear Madame Tusspells, save your reprimands. There are more pressing concerns. The wax can wait. It's our ideas about your current problem we must throw into the melting pot instead! Tusspells: ...! Sholmes: Personally, I would advise you not to involve the police. Tusspells: Why ever not?! Ryunosuke: (She's turned as white as a sheet...) Sholmes: Because you have at your disposal a great detective, whose services you may employ for a mere fifty shillings. Though please be aware that I prefer- No, I insist upon payment in advance! Tusspells: ......... ...Very well. Let us see if the great detective is able to live up to his name, shall we? Sholmes: Before I engage my analytical processes, I must ask you to clarify something. What, pray, is behind the curtain? Tusspells: That is the Tusspells Special Exhibit. There is an extra charge to see it. Sholmes: Ah, the 'special' exhibit in the House of Horrors... It must depict a special killer then, I presume. Would you be so kind as to draw back the curtain, I wonder? Tusspells: Ah! Absolument non! There is nothing amiss behind there! Sholmes: Nothing amiss, madame? What about the arm protruding ominously from under the curtain? Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: I strongly encourage you to allow me to see what lies beyond, before the situation worsens. Tusspells: ......... Yes, very well. I will draw back the curtains. ...But only a soupçon. Sholmes: I must confess, I peeked behind the curtain earlier. The Tusspells Special Exhibit is a very bleak graveyard scene indeed. And yet somewhat surprisingly... ...the waxwork killer one would expect is nowhere to be seen. What does strike one, however... ...is the portly gentleman lying peacefully on his back on the floor. Ryunosuke: Well, well then perhaps, Mr Sholmes... ...that man on the floor is the ruthless killer himself! Sholmes: I'm afraid not, my dear fellow. He's a perfectly ordinary London gentleman. Not even a waxwork, in fact. Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: As skilfully made as these waxworks are, they are always distinguishable from real humans. So, allow me to present my two conclusions. The first... ...is that a sizeable business transaction has been taking place in this special exhibit. Tusspells: Why...? Why would you say that? Sholmes: And the second... ...is that the aforementioned transaction is linked to a serious crime! Tusspells: AAAAAAH! Ryunosuke: (She looks as pale as candle wax...) Tusspells: I, I don't understand... Sholmes: So, Madame Tusspells, as you've agreed to my fee... ...you shall now have the pleasure of seeing this famously great detective - and temporary exhibit - at work. The Great Deduction The game is afoot! Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Sholmes: To begin with, we must ask ourselves what exactly is afoot here in this museum? The answer is revealed by the bundle of banknotes protruding so helpfully from your bag. In my estimation, some...two hundred pounds. Tusspells: That, that is all my own money! Sholmes: So what does this large sum of money reveal? Ah, not as much as the involuntary glance you cast, it would seem, Madame Tusspells. Yes, the answer lies where your eyes now fall. The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice! 'Waxwork for sale'? Your business has hit hard times, it would seem. In short... ...you sold the infamous killer - the centrepiece of your special exhibit - for the sum of two hundred pounds! Tusspells: Nooooooooon! Sholmes: Now...let us explore the next curiosity with which we are presented. Who is the portly gentleman stretched out so peacefully on the floor? Tusspells: ......... Sholmes: It would appear the man has suffered a severe shock. The cause of which...is clearly known to you. Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: Unfortunately, madame, keeping secrets does not appear to be your forte. What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds! It would appear that you twisted this gentleman around your little finger most effectively. Tusspells: What are you suggesting?! Sholmes: He rashly agreed to purchase the waxwork for the sum of two hundred pounds. Only when he came to hand the money over, did it occur to him what an extortionate amount he was paying. But the money was no longer in his hands. And the result? The scene we see before us. He collapsed in shock. Yes, the killer in this special exhibit fetched a killer price! We can only pray that the gentleman's dreams are not plagued with regret... Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Conclusion Sold for cash Topic 2 Waxwork Location Sholmes: The question that arises then, is what has become of the waxwork that changed hands? Let us consider that problem for a moment. Tusspells: You, you cannot possibly... Sholmes: What immediately strikes me about this conundrum, is the young man standing over there. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief. Such as is worn by policemen as a secret sign to fellow members of the force that a crime is being perpetrated. Yes, this young man is an undercover policeman, currently investigating this museum. I know him well, in fact. It's Sergeant John Clay. Tusspells: What are you talking about? Sholmes: The man's quite a celebrity. He received triple accolades at last year's policing awards. Tusspells: But... Sholmes: Next we turn our attention to the old man sat before him with the particularly unsightly visage. I've been watching closely and he hasn't moved a muscle. Almost, in fact...as if he were a waxwork. Tusspells: Ah! But, but you... Sholmes: Your reaction only confirms my suspicions, madame. I noticed it at once, of course... Observe! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag! 'Thruppence'...? A tragically low price, you might say. Though perhaps the going rate for ageing waxworks riddled with cracks. And yet you sold it to the portly gentleman for an exorbitant two hundred pounds! The sort of plucky behaviour that's sure to attract the attention of Scotland Yard... Isn't that so, madame? Tusspells: I, I do not... Sholmes: Yes, the waxwork you sold has already been seized by the police and remains in their custody as we speak! The old man must be reunited with his grave in the special exhibit, and not a moment too soon! Topic 2 Waxwork Location Conclusion Discovered already Sholmes: Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this horrifying puzzle! Ryunosuke: ......... Iris: ......... Tusspells: ......... Sholmes: I see I've stunned you all into silence. Iris: You have, Hurley, you have. And you've obviously upset this young lady in the process. Her cauldron looks awfully hot... Ryunosuke: Um...if I could just bring up one point, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: Ah! The notorious Naruhodo 'one point'! I'm all ears, my dear fellow! Ryunosuke: According to your deduction, then, the special exhibit featured this old policeman. So...that would mean that he's the particularly ruthless murderer, wouldn't it? Sholmes: ......... The killer policeman, Ottermole. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: It was a mysterious series of murders that rattled the capital only last year. The police rushed to the scene every time, only to find the culprit had disappeared into the aether. Iris: And it turned out the culprit was a policeman himself! A senior officer by the name of Ottermole! Ryunosuke: So you mean that's who the sinister-looking old man there is supposed to be? Sholmes: Indeed. It is a particularly grim face, is it not? Unforgettable, in fact. Yes, I remember that odious countenance only too well. Ryunosuke: But is two hundred pounds a lot of money for a wax model? Sholmes: It would be enough to afford one of the latest steam carriages, if that puts things in perspective? Ryunosuke: S-So...it is quite a lot then. Tusspells: ......... Is there anything else you wish to add? Before I melt you down. Ryunosuke: (That bubbling wax is looking more and more ominous...) Iris: Ugh...the smell of all that molten wax is starting to worry me. Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes did more or less just accuse her to her face, so... I think I might have to call on your assistance here, Iris, if that's alright? To make some minor corrections to the great detective's great deductions... Iris: Of course it's alright! We'll soon set things straight! Ryunosuke: Well...let's get started then, shall we? Before Madame Tusspells vents her anger! Sholmes: Just what I was waiting to hear, my dear fellow! So, Madame Tusspells, in accordance with our agreement... ...you shall now have the pleasure of seeing this famously great detective - and temporary exhibit - at work. Course Correction Hold it, Mr Sholmes! Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Conclusion Sold for cash Sholmes: To begin with, we must ask ourselves what exactly is afoot here in this museum? The answer is revealed by the bundle of banknotes protruding so helpfully from your bag. In my estimation, some...two hundred pounds. Tusspells: That, that is all my own money! Sholmes: So what does this large sum of money reveal? Ah, not as much as the involuntary glance you cast, it would seem, Madame Tusspells. Yes, the answer lies where your eyes now fall. The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice! Ryunosuke: She definitely looked in this direction, it's true. Iris: But I'm not sure she'd sell any of her waxworks, even for two hundred pounds. Ryunosuke: Oh? Iris: She must pour her heart and soul into making them, don't you think? Over and above the wax. If it were me, I wouldn't sell them for anything. Ryunosuke: ......... (For that much money, I would! ...But it sounds like that makes me a bad person.) W-Well anyway... ...I wonder if the two hundred pounds could have some other significance. Iris: Let's follow that furtive glance again and see if there's anything else that could explain it! The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that public notice! Iris: Judging by appearances... ...this man and the two hundred pounds are in no way related at all. Ryunosuke: (The poor man was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, it seems...) But there's no doubt that Madame Tusspells did react to what Mr Sholmes said. The way she automatically looked over this way must tell us something, I'm sure. Iris: ...Then let's have more of a look around! Ryunosuke: The significance of the two hundred pounds is revealed by that ransom note! Sholmes: Quite so. And we must congratulate these criminals on their inventiveness, abducting a waxwork. Tusspells: Agh! Sholmes: Two hundred pounds is no small ransom fee. Yet you clearly intend to pay it. Tusspells: The model in question has...special importance. So I put together all the money I have... Sholmes: In summary, then! The two hundred pounds you have in your handbag...is ransom money! Now...let us explore the next curiosity with which we are presented. Who is the portly gentleman stretched out so peacefully on the floor? Tusspells: ......... Sholmes: It would appear the man has suffered a severe shock. The cause of which...is clearly known to you. Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: Unfortunately, madame, keeping secrets does not appear to be your forte. What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds! Ryunosuke: So if the waxwork was kidnapped, where does that leave us in terms of who this man is? Iris: We could just ask him when he comes around. Ryunosuke: ...I think the point of this exercise is to understand the beauty of the deduction process, Iris. Iris: Yes, you're right. Hurley's trying so hard, we mustn't let him down. Ryunosuke: Well, there's little doubt that he suffered a shock. That much seems clear. But in that case, what's Madame Tusspells trying to hide? Let's have a closer look around... What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the two hundred pounds! Ryunosuke: It must have been a considerable blow to have knocked the man unconscious. Iris: Yes, he looks like a very sturdy man, doesn't he? Ooh! Perhaps he was struck on the back of the head with something hard?! Ryunosuke: ...Don't sound so excited about it, Iris. (Whatever did leave the man out cold like that, it must have been quite something...) Ryunosuke: What dealt the man such a shocking blow was of course... the waxwork hand! Sholmes: Indeed. With a solid waxwork limb, one could deliver a very substantial blow. Tusspells: How, how could you...? Ryunosuke: The hand protruding from the bottom of your cape... It ought to be a right hand, but closer inspection reveals that in fact, it's a left hand. Tusspells: Ah! Sholmes: And somewhat masculine as well. In other words, it does not belong to you, madame. It is the hand of a waxwork model! Tusspells: KYAAAAAAH! Some of the visitors to my museum can be...troublesome. They meddle with the exhibits and cause damage. Ryunosuke: So you mean, that arm...? Tusspells: Yes. This gentleman saw fit to try to remove it as a souvenir. Sholmes: Hm, no small keepsake. Ryunosuke: Like taking a whole branch of a cherry tree when you go to view the blossoms... Tusspells: I am afraid I had to teach the man a lesson. Ryunosuke: You confronted the man and tried to take the arm back. Sholmes: And the result? The scene we see before us. He was knocked unconscious. A point we may need to revisit later. But for the time being, we have our conclusion: Yes, the killer in this special exhibit has been kidnapped! Topic 1 Waxwork's Fate Conclusion Sold for cash Kidnapped! Solved Topic 2 Waxwork Location Conclusion Discovered already Sholmes: The question that arises then, is what has become of the waxwork that changed hands? Let us consider that problem for a moment. Tusspells: You, you cannot possibly... Sholmes: What immediately strikes me about this conundrum, is the young man standing over there. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief. Ryunosuke: According to Mr Sholmes... ...the yellow neckerchief is a sign to other policemen that some crime is underway. Iris: A way of communicating with his colleagues without revealing his identity, yes. It's a secret that's closely guarded by Scotland Yard. Ryunosuke: ...That Mr Sholmes didn't hesitate to give away. Iris: Well, uncovering secrets is in any true detective's nature, of course. Ryunosuke: Right... Anyway, judging from Madame Tusspells's reaction to Mr Sholmes's deduction... ...I think perhaps we might not have identified the man quite correctly. Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his neckerchief. Ryunosuke: According to Mr Sholmes, this young gentleman is actually a policeman in plain clothes. And the secret scarf sign appears to back that idea up. It does seem plausible. Iris: But Madame Tusspells's reaction was strange. Which must mean... Ryunosuke: ...That we haven't got to the bottom of who or what this man really is yet. Ryunosuke: Who is this fellow? To find the answer, we need only observe...his shoulder stub. Sholmes: No such boneless human walks this earth. Of that, I can assure you. In other words, the man standing here - the young Sergeant John Clay... ...is in fact, defying all odds, a waxwork model! Ryunosuke: I seem to remember it was you who concluded he was a real person in the first place, Mr Sholmes. Tusspells: He has become quite a celebrity in London, being the winner of no less than three policing awards last year. I simply had to make a model of the man. Sholmes: Naturally! What other explanation could there be? Ryunosuke: And it was this detective's arm that was pulled off by the man on the floor in the special exhibit, wasn't it? Sholmes: Next we turn our attention to the old man sat before him with the particularly unsightly visage. I've been watching closely and he hasn't moved a muscle. Almost, in fact...as if he were a waxwork. Tusspells: Ah! But, but you... Sholmes: Your reaction only confirms my suspicions, madame. I noticed it at once, of course... Observe! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag! Ryunosuke: A killer policeman...called Ottermole, was it? Was he well known? Iris: It was all over the papers last year. But I can't say I know what he looks like. It's a very low price, though. Thruppence isn't much money. Ryunosuke: (Only enough for a few measly hours of gas in Mr Garrideb's delightful lodgings, in fact...) So this is the special killer taken from the special exhibit...is it? The waxwork that somebody stole from the museum and tried to ransom for two hundred pounds... ...is this crusty old killer policeman Ottermole? Really? Iris: Perhaps we should have a good look around again and see if another idea crops up! The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious price tag! Iris: If we just poured a little bit of molten wax on him, we'd soon find out if he was real or not. Ryunosuke: Yes...you never know, there may be another way. We've already come this far, so maybe we should stick to logical deductions, don't you think? Iris: Alright, if that's the way you want to do it, then we should examine him in more detail. Ryunosuke: (If anyone saw, they'd think we were obsessed with the elderly...) Ryunosuke: The telltale sign that instantly proves whether or not this old man is a waxwork is the obvious twitch! Sholmes: Even the most realistic waxworks do not exhibit a twitch. In other words, this splendid old man is in fact a genuine member of Scotland Yard! Ryunosuke: ...Slight shift in your choice of adjectives, then... Sholmes: And there you have it! Well, Madame Tusspells? Tusspells: Well what? It was me who contacted the police and demanded that someone come in the first place. He is clearly fatigued. He is sound asleep. Ryunosuke: But then, what's this tag about showing a price of three pence? Sholmes: No doubt the price tag of the muffler, which the old bobby purchased recently at a local market. And I presume you've observed the scarf tied around his arm? Does that not strike you, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Yes! The secret sign used by detectives to show that some criminal activity is currently underway. Tusspells: Of course. Because, as you know, there has been just such criminal activity happening here. As you deduced from the very beginning, detective. Sholmes: So, it would seem that we finally arrive at the truth. Ryunosuke: The waxwork of the especially ruthless killer from the special exhibit has been kidnapped. Sholmes: And Scotland Yard are already investigating. But the model's whereabouts remain a mystery. Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this horrifying puzzle! Topic 2 Waxwork Location Conclusion Discovered already Still a mystery! Solved Deduction CompleteElementary! Tusspells: All sorts of people visit my museum here. Men and women, young and old. Sometimes they drop in just for a short time on their way back from the pub. I welcome them all. But if anyone tries to damage my exhibits... I do not take it lightly. Anyway... ...your great deduction was even more enchanting than I had been led to believe. Sholmes: It was a pleasure, my dear madame. I'm gratified that you enjoyed the spectacle. And as for your 'rough customer', I've no doubt he'll regain consciousness shortly and return home. What concerns me more... ...is the waxwork from the special display...if it was indeed genuinely abducted? Tusspells: ......... Yes. Tragically, it was... Sholmes: Then I would ask you to recount to us the events surrounding the stolen waxwork. In as much detail as possible, if you please. Tusspells: ...Very well. But after I have told you what I know, I must insist that you return to your work. Sholmes: ......... The talents of a great detective could be put to better use, I feel, but as you wish... Tusspells: It was a series of gruesome murders that had all of London gripped in terror a decade ago. After five victims were killed, the man was arrested, and put to death. Sholmes: And now he's immortalised here in wax for all Londoners to admire and enjoy! Though of course, he happens to be absent at present, on account of the abduction. Ryunosuke: But I don't understand. How is all this related to Lord van Zieks? Sholmes: ......... You must first understand, my dear fellow, why it is that the Professor earnt such infamy. It was due to the victims he chose. Some of Whitehall's finest. Iris: What do you mean, Hurley? Sholmes: Those murdered by the Professor were some of the highest members of the British aristocracy. Members of the nobility. Even royalty. It sent shockwaves through the country's administration. Ryunosuke: Members of the... Ah! Wait! Of course! What Professor Harebrayne said! Lord van Zieks is from a family with noble blood! Iris: Oh gosh! Sholmes: It was the fifth victim that led to the Professor's arrest. The last of the killer's prey was a young noble by the name of... ...Klint van Zieks. Ryunosuke: No! I don't believe it! Van Zieks?! Sholmes: I'm sure you can piece together the rest for yourself. In the wake of his older brother's murder, the young Barok pursued a career as a prosecutor. And eventually...became the Reaper we know today. Ryunosuke: ......... I had no idea Lord van Zieks had such a tragic past... Sholmes: Well, I'm afraid that's all I can say on the matter. For the time being at least. After all, I have work to do... ...as a waxwork exhibit. Tusspells: I am afraid I shall have to excuse myself as well. Ryunosuke: Oh, yes, of course. It's, it's been a pleasure. Thank you. ???: ...Well, none of the predicted scenarios I've been analysing involved you coming to visit me here. Harebrayne: It's been too long, it really has. I'm delighted to see you, Barok. Van Zieks: It's been ten years. And here we are, meeting in a prison of all places. Harebrayne: I can't forgive myself for what happened to Mr Asman! I just can't! I, I still can't believe it could happen... Van Zieks: ......... Tomorrow the court will decide. Harebrayne: Yes! I have a young Eastern man acting for my defence. He seems reliable enough, though. It, it was an accident. A terrible accident. He, he, he assures me he can prove it! Van Zieks: I must warn you... Harebrayne: Oh, I know, I know! I've heard already. You're going to be prosecuting, aren't you? Van Zieks: ...Yes. Harebrayne: ......... Since I returned to England, I've heard lots of stories. Barok, are you really...? Van Zieks: What? Harebrayne: ......... Never mind. I know that you have my best interests at heart. Van Zieks: My friend is on trial. ...I wouldn't entrust it to anybody else. Harebrayne: Of course. I fully understand. Thank you, Barok. Van Zieks: Until tomorrow, then. I'll see you in court. To be continued...23rd October, 8:52 a.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber Ryunosuke: (I can't believe it's been six months since I was last allowed to work in court. And now here I am, back at the Old Bailey...) Harebrayne: Ah! M-Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: Good morning, Professor Harebrayne. Harebrayne: I, I don't understand! It doesn't make any sense! The atmospheric pressure in here is off the charts! I've never felt anything like it! It's, it's crushing me! Ryunosuke: I feel it every time I'm here. That...gravity. Harebrayne: Well, this is Britain's highest court... But are you telling me it's filled with some kind of device that can actually control air pressure?! Ryunosuke: ......... I think it's probably all in the mind. Harebrayne: Ah. Yes, well...you won't let me down, will you, Mr Naruhodo? I'm counting on you in today's trial...to save my life! To save the secret of my super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine from being made public! Ryunosuke: Yes, I understand. (I know what I have to do. I have to establish that the explosion two days ago was nothing more than an unfortunate accident.) Harebrayne: Well, I'm sure there's nothing to worry about, really. Justice will prevail! ???: My commiserations, Mr Naruhodo. You appear to have been lumbered with a most tiresome case here. Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes! I didn't expect to see you here. Iris: That was very mean, Runo, leaving me alone at home with Hurley. It took me at least an hour to wake him! Harebrayne: Ah... Oh... Ah... Is it...? Are you...? HEEEEEERLOCK SHOOOOOOLMES?! Sholmes: Indeed, sir. I am he. Heeeeeerlock Shoooooolmes. Harebrayne: Oh, I've heard all about your exploits, even whilst living in Germany. Iris: Ah yes. Randst Magazine is on sale in Germany, too. Harebrayne: This month's instalment was sublime! Your deduction in 'The Adventure of Silver Blaze' was wonderful! Sholmes: Ah yes, a memorable case indeed. It concerned a snake, I seem to recall. Iris: No, that was 'The Speckled Band.' Ryunosuke: Well, thank you for coming. I do appreciate your support. Sholmes: I'm sorry to disappoint you, my dear fellow, but I'm afraid I can't stay. Ryunosuke: Oh. Sholmes: I have urgent business at Madame Tusspells. Ryunosuke: You mean...your waxwork job? Sholmes: No no, the waxwork abduction, of course. Madame has engaged my services. Ryunosuke: Ah, so you're trying to get to the bottom of that ransom note, are you? Sholmes: The week's wages depend on it! ...As does the safe return of the waxwork, naturally. As such, I intend to give it my undivided attention. Ryunosuke: Oh, well, never mind then. I understand. Sholmes: Of course, with my skills of observation and reasoning, resolving the matter will be as easy as proverbial pie. I shall return forthwith. For until I solve the case, I shall have no money to afford a pie of any description. Iris: Ooh, then you must absolutely give it your full attention, Hurley! Sholmes: Quite, Iris, quite. But life is riddled with irony, you know. Whenever I give something my full attention, I have a quite insatiable desire for a pie. One of the universe's intractable mysteries, you might say. Harebrayne: Oh yes! Quite! Definitely! Absolutely! I totally understand! Ryunosuke: (...Is someone a little starstruck?) Sholmes: I wish you the very best of luck, Professor Harebrayne. Harebrayne: Oh! Ah! Ooh! Why, thank you! Sholmes: Before I depart, Mr Naruhodo...a word in your ear, if you please? Ryunosuke: ...? What's this about? Sholmes: As you have remarkably little grounding in science, I feel I ought to inform you... As compelling as this 'super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis' hypothesis may be... ...a practical implementation, such as was attempted by the professor at the Great Exhibition, is quite impossible. Ryunosuke: But, but the professor said the demonstration was a success! Sholmes: Yes, it would appear that he fervently believes it was. Iris: I've read Professor Bunnybrain's paper about it, too, Runo. And I have to say... ...I'm sure it can't be done. It could barely be done theoretically, let alone practically. Ryunosuke: (So he's completely barking up the wrong tree?) But how could an experiment that had no possibility of succeeding in fact succeed? That's contradictory. Sholmes: And it's that contradiction that will be at the heart of the trial, I've no doubt. Ryunosuke: (What's that supposed to mean?) Sholmes: Now, I must hurry along. I wish you the best of luck, my dear fellow. Iris: See you later, Hurley! Well, it looks like you're on your own today, Runo. But chin up! You can do it! Ryunosuke: Oh! What about you, Iris? Iris: Ah, no, I'm afraid I can't help. I have something I need to do. Ryunosuke: ...I see. Iris: Hehe! It's going to be a big surprise for you when you find out what it is! Ryunosuke: Haah... (That sounds ominous...) Bailiff: Counsel for the Defence! And the defendant! Court is about to be in session. Make your way into the courtroom at once! Ryunosuke: We're on our way! (An experiment that the laws of science say can't possibly succeed... ...and a scientist who's convinced that it did. That's the riddle you have to unlock here, Ryunosuke! That's the key to this case!) 23rd October, 9:10 a.m. The Old Bailey Courtroom Judge: In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session. We are sitting today for the public trial of Professor Albert Harebrayne. I now call upon the counsels for the prosecution and defence to declare their willingness to proceed. Van Zieks: The prosecution is ready. Ryunosuke: The defence is... The defence is ready, My Lord! ......... (I'm six months out of practice. And what's more... ...I'm without Susato-san today.) ......... (Ugh... Is it just my imagination, or does the air in here feel even more oppressive than usual?) Judge: So... ...I must say I recollect the victim of this case all too well. Mr Odie Asman. Van Zieks: Mr Asman was well known as a financier...though that was merely a front for his diverse criminal activities. Judge: It was only a month ago that the man appeared in court prosecuted by you, Lord van Zieks. But the jury unanimously found him not guilty. Ryunosuke: (Because every member of the jury had been bribed, by the sound of it. These powerful London criminals are prepared to go to extreme lengths to keep their freedom.) Judge: But two days ago, on 21st October, Mr Asman met his end. The work of the Reaper, was it? Van Zieks: ......... If that is how Your Lordship would describe divine retribution... But the fact remains that Mr Asman's death... ...was a direct result of the actions of the accused, Professor Harebrayne. Judge: Very well, then. Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... You have been selected at random to represent the will of the people. Are the six of you ready to fulfil your societal duty? Juror No. 1: I'm most gratified to have been selected to carry out this important civic duty, My Lord. Juror No. 2: To have a man's fate in the palm of one's hand... Oh gosh! Oh golly! It sends shivers down my spine. Juror No. 3: Science experiments, magic, conjuring tricks, courtroom trials... All are nothing more than performances. Juror No. 4: Any spurious scholar that defiles the reputation of science deserves to hang! Juror No. 5: Um, we 'ave to listen to what's said on both sides 'the fence, and um...then settle on one... That's it, isn't it? Juror No. 6: ......... Wasn't like this in my day! Wasn't like this at all! Ryunosuke: ......... (That's...that's... ...the police killer Ottermole look-alike...again. And he's as exhausted as ever, it seems.) Judge: Now, as I'm sure you are all aware... ...the incident we are here to judge today tragically took place at the Great Exhibition, shortly after its opening. Van Zieks: Though the death toll could have been far worse. With the exception of the victim, no one was killed. Nevertheless, the dream of the science being exhibited rapidly turned into a nightmare for the spectators. Judge: A tragic turn of events. And as such, the eyes of all London- No, of the whole world will be on this trial. It is our duty to reach a swift and just conclusion, I feel. So...your opening statement please, Lord van Zieks. Van Zieks: At the heart of this incident... ...is technology never before demonstrated anywhere in the world. Judge: One of science's latest developments, I take it? The government is keen to capitalise on the Great Exhibition to improve Britain's technological advantage. Van Zieks: The technology being demonstrated by the accused was described as 'super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis'. Judge: Good Lord! Ryunosuke: It's designed to 'disassemble' human subjects using extremely high-voltage electricity... ...and 'beam' them instantly to another location where they are subsequently reassembled. Judge: Is...is such a thing even within the realms of possibility? Juror No. 1: Well I don't believe it, that's for sure. Juror No. 2: Disassembling people with electricity? My goodness! How shocking! Juror No. 4: Hah! The whole idea is absurd! The hypothesis would never stand up to scrutiny! Judge: Sir, I believe you are a fellow of the Royal Society, are you not? An expert in your field? Juror No. 4: I am, and my word on the matter can be considered final. Instantaneous kinesis is poppycock! Ryunosuke: (So this expert and Mr Sholmes are in agreement. It's impossible...) Judge: What is the prosecution's view on the matter? Van Zieks: ......... The prosecution would assert... ...that the accused's instantaneous kinesis demonstration was a success. Ryunosuke: What?! Juror No. 4: What rot! Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Van Zieks: The professor's hypothesis is currently under investigation by the British government. If it is deemed to have merit, a substantial research grant would be made available. The accused made use of the invention built on his new hypothesis to take Mr Asman's life... ...in order to be the sole benefactor of the grant. Ryunosuke: But, but... Van Zieks: This disastrous demonstration was no accident. It was carefully designed from the outset to end the life of the victim. Judge: Thank you, Lord van Zieks. The prosecution's stance is clear. But you will now bring forth witnesses to substantiate your claims. Van Zieks: ...Gladly, My Lord. Bailiff! Show the first witnesses to the stand! Van Zieks: Witnesses, state your names and occupations for the court. Gregson: Yes, sir! Tobias Gregson, Detective Inspector at Scotland Yard's homicide division. I was on duty at the demonstration on the day in question and in charge of the followin' investigation. Harebrayne: ......... Albert Harebrayne! S-S-Scientist! Van Zieks: You were born in England, but have been carrying out research in Germany in recent years. Correct? Harebrayne: Yes. Yes, that's right. After graduating from university here in Britain, I went to work in Germany...and made an amazing discovery! Which is what brought me back! I had to demonstrate my incredible hypothesis at the Great Exhibition! Gregson: What you demonstrated was incredible alright. An incredible explosion! Harebrayne: But the science! The science was a success! The instantaneous kinesis worked! E-Everyone saw it! They must have done! Yes, there was the terrible accident, but... ...the demonstration of my hypothesis was a success! Gregson: Well, that much is undeniable. As shown in this photograph taken by the Forensic Investigation Team. Judge: This was taken inside the Crystal Tower, I take it? The centrepiece of the exhibition, no less. Gregson: That's right, My Lord. Seems the victim rammed straight into it. Judge: Hm, I see... Very well, submit the photograph as evidence. The photograph of the victim has been entered into the Court Record. Gregson: As the court's heard, the victim of the incident was Mr Odie Asman. There have been a number of allegations made against the man, but puttin' them aside for the time bein'... ...he was the man who financed the research for the experiment and the demonstration itself. Judge: I see. So to summarise the situation... ...the defendant is accused of taking the life of the man who funded his work. Would that be correct? Gregson: Exactly. Ryunosuke: But couldn't it be... ...that the explosion was caused by some malfunction in the apparatus used for the demonstration? Harebrayne: That's right! That must be it! My splendid machine... My poor, splendid machine... Gregson: You saw it yesterday, didn't you? We can't even examine the wreckage thanks to the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act. Harebrayne: WHAAAAAAAAAT?! The wreckage?! THE WRECKAGE?! Judge: But that being the case, how can the facts be established? How can it possibly be determined whether this was an accident or a deliberate and malicious act? Van Zieks: Extremely simply, My Lord. Judge: I beg your pardon? Van Zieks: Isn't that right, witness? Harebrayne: Wha...? Sorry? ME?! Van Zieks: No. Your neighbour. Gregson: Yes, sir! It was murder, plain and simple. Anyone could state that with complete certainty. Ryunosuke: What?! (How can he possibly think that?) Judge: Thank you, Inspector. I think we had better proceed to formal testimony. You will explain to the court on what grounds you claim this experiment to have been a front for murder! Witness Testimony - A Front for Murder - Gregson: The corpse that went crashin' through the Crystal Tower had a broken neck. Harebrayne: I, I made a minor miscalculation in the angle of the beam projection, that's all! That was my mistake! Gregson: But the post-mortem examination revealed another injury. A fatal wound. There was a lesion in his chest where he'd clearly been stabbed by somethin' sharp right in the heart! So the victim was killed before he went anywhere. And this fella's the only one who could have done it! Judge: ......... An extraordinary business... In addition to suffering a broken neck, the victim was stabbed in the heart? Ryunosuke: (Information I would really like to have heard from someone other than the judge...) Gregson: The coroner says death would have been all but instant from a wound like that. Van Zieks: You could say, in fact... ...that the victim was killed twice by the accused. Harebrayne: No, no and no! That couldn't be further from the truth! Gregson: I have here the experiment plan document that was submitted to the security team. The victim stood himself inside somethin' called 'the birdcage', ready to be 'beamed' instantly... ...to the second level of the Crystal Tower, about twenty-five yards away. Van Zieks: The experiment did not go according to plan, however. As the machine was put into operation, there was a large explosion. The blast caused the beam transmitter to point higher than intended. Accordingly, the kinesis resulted in the birdcage materialising in mid-air... ...from where it subsequently fell, crashing through the glass of the Crystal Tower's large round window. Judge: My word... One assumes the victim's neck was broken upon impact with the tower, then? Harebrayne: I'm, I'm so sorry! I didn't mean for this to happen! The machine was just too powerful! But honestly! Really! I swear! It was just an accident! A terrible accident! Van Zieks: Unfortunately, that excuse can't save you. Gregson: No, not considerin' the sharp murder weapon that pierced the victim's heart. Harebrayne: M-Murder weapon?! What are you saying?! Van Zieks: This is the autopsy report submitted by the coroner. The prosecution would like it entered into the Court Record. Judge: Your request is granted, Counsel. The autopsy report has been entered into the Court Record. Juror No. 4: I was there in person, you know. I saw the whole ludicrous performance. And the only other person on the stage with Mr Asman was that disgraceful excuse for a scientist! Juror No. 2: Then really, by all accounts it must have been him. Juror No. 1: Hmph. Hard to think otherwise, really. Judge: Very well. Counsel for the Defence...proceed with the cross-examination, please. Ryunosuke: Oh, yes, My Lord! (I need to focus here... It's been a while!) Cross-Examination - A Front for Murder - Gregson: The corpse that went crashin' through the Crystal Tower had a broken neck. Harebrayne: I, I made a minor miscalculation in the angle of the beam projection, that's all! That was my mistake! Gregson: But the post-mortem examination revealed another injury. A fatal wound. Gregson: There was a lesion in his chest where he'd clearly been stabbed by somethin' sharp right in the heart! Gregson: So the victim was killed before he went anywhere. And this fella's the only one who could have done it! Gregson: The weapon the victim was stabbed with must have been left in his body whilst he was beamed through the air! Ryunosuke: (So that's all the testimony I have to work with... I had no idea the victim had been stabbed. That changes everything... Did van Zieks keep that to himself until now on purpose, to gain the advantage? Oh well...I suppose all I can do is press these witnesses for as much new information as possible.) Ryunosuke: You say that while the weapon remains in the body, there's very little bleeding... Is that unequivocal? Gregson: Look, there was no blood on the experimentation stage, even though that's where the fellow was stabbed. The only explanation for that is if the screwdriver was still in his body, stoppin' any heavy bleedin'. Van Zieks: It's common medical knowledge, my learned friend. Even on your side of the world. Ryunosuke: ......... Yes, but about this screwdriver... The thing is, we actually saw it at the scene ourselves. On the experimentation stage. Van Zieks: What? Ryunosuke: It was on the floor by the wreckage of the machine, poking through a metal grille. I went to pick it up, but the detective here stopped me. Isn't that right, Inspector Gregson? Gregson: Ah, well, um... Now you come to mention it, yes... Van Zieks: Inspector, are we to understand that you permitted the defence counsel to investigate? That you contravened the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act? Gregson: Eh? No! Not at all! I, I wouldn't do that! I just let him look, nothin' more! I was very clear he wasn't to touch a thing! Ryunosuke: Yes, that's true. This screwdriver was in plain sight on the stage. But it shouldn't have been, should it? Gregson: Wh-What are you gettin' at? Ryunosuke: If this tool had still been in the victim's body when the victim was beamed away by the machine... ...then it shouldn't have still been on the stage. Gregson: Ah! Ryunosuke: That's right! It should have been beamed across to the Crystal Tower along with Mr Asman... ...and been found still lodged in the victim's chest! Gregson: Ugh... UWAAAAAAAAAGH! Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! ...How do you explain this, Inspector? Gregson: I...well...um... I don't... Ryunosuke: It looks as though everything that the victim had on his person moved with him when he was 'beamed'. If the screwdriver was still in his chest when the instantaneous kinesis occurred... ...obviously that should have been beamed to the destination as well! Gregson: You... Ryunosuke: (This is a strange situation... Even though people are saying that this instantaneous kinesis is a scientific impossibility... ...we're still basing arguments on the assumption that it did actually take place. Alright. Time to tighten the screws here...) My Lord! If the prosecution is unable to explain this inconsistency in its argument... ...we can only conclude that the testimony given in support cannot be relied upon! Van Zieks: ......... Ryunosuke: (Lord van Zieks is stumped!) ???: Judge: ...Do you have something to say, witness? Harebrayne: Yes...I knew it... It bears out... The equations hold... Mr Naruhodo! ...DON'T WORRY! Ryunosuke: ...About what?! Harebrayne: Without delving into the details, there is no inconsistency! Ryunosuke: What? Harebrayne: Even if Andrew had been lodged in Mr Asman's chest... ...my trusty tool wouldn't have moved. Andrew remaining on the stage is consistent with my calculations! Ryunosuke: Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAT?! Van Zieks: It would seem your illusions have been...shattered. Clearly we should hear the accused's explanation. ...Or should I say, this brilliant scientist's explanation? Judge: Hmmm... Ryunosuke: (Just when I'd found an inconsistency in the prosecution's argument... Scientists...) Judge: Very well! The defendant will testify again. Provide us with the scientific explanation as to why the inconsistency asserted by the defence fails to hold! Harebrayne: In the name of Apollo, I will, My Lord! Witness Testimony - The inconsistency Explained - Harebrayne: To be clear, I'm still at the stage of gathering data in my research. My hypothesis states the kinesis cannot transport metal, though. Hence the metal weapon would have stayed put. In other words, the point just raised by Mr Naruhodo isn't an inconsistency at all. Mr Asman was the patron of my research. Without him, my work wouldn't have been possible. Now I have a duty to protect the incredible machine that we built together! Ryunosuke: ......... Van Zieks: ......... Judge: ......... So, the thrust of your testimony, Professor, is...? Van Zieks: ...That based upon his hypothesis, metal objects cannot be moved by this method of instantaneous kinesis. Judge: In other words...? Van Zieks: In other words, since the screwdriver is made of metal, even if it remained lodged in the victim's chest... ...its subsequent discovery on the stage despite the victim being found elsewhere is not an inconsistency. Judge: And therefore...? Van Zieks: And therefore Professor Albert Harebrayne could still have been the killer. Harebrayne: My great hypothesis holds, you see! We, we had to make the cage used to contain the subject from wood for that very reason. Judge: I was not addressing you, witness! Ryunosuke: Um...Professor Harebrayne... Harebrayne: Yes? Ryunosuke: Whose side are you on here? Harebrayne: I don't take sides, Mr Naruhodo! No no no! My only interest lies in upholding my hypothesis! I'm a scientist, after all! Ryunosuke: ......... (Is he working for us or against us? It's very hard to tell...) Van Zieks: Let's see how you cross-examine this testimony, my Nipponese friend. Harebrayne: Yes, fire away, Mr Naruhodo! Cross-Examination - The Inconsistency Explained - Harebrayne: To be clear, I'm still at the stage of gathering data in my research. Harebrayne: My hypothesis states the kinesis cannot transport metal, though. Hence the metal weapon would have stayed put. Harebrayne: In other words, the point just raised by Mr Naruhodo isn't an inconsistency at all. Harebrayne: Mr Asman was the patron of my research. Without him, my work wouldn't have been possible. Harebrayne: Now I have a duty to protect the incredible machine that we built together! Ryunosuke: (That's the extent of the testimony then... Thank goodness for that. I don't want him doing any more damage. He's already basically proven that he could have been the culprit. But it seems as though all he really cares about is defending his hypothesis. Still, I wonder... What if his hypothesis is just fundamentally flawed?) Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne, you say that according to your hypothesis... ...nothing made of metal can be beamed by instantaneous kinesis using the machine you made. Is that right? Harebrayne: Yes, that's right. Spot on! Exactly correct! Ryunosuke: In that case...I'd ask you to have a look at this photograph that was taken at the scene. In particular, I'd like you to pay attention to the victim's face. You can clearly see that Mr Asman is wearing a pair of spectacles...with a metal rim. Harebrayne: What? Metal? No... Metal can't... That's not... M-Metal? NOOOOOOOOOOOO! Ryunosuke: We've already established that the proposed murder weapon, the screwdriver, was found on the stage. However, if your hypothesis correctly predicted that outcome... ...it should also have predicted...that the metal-rimmed spectacles would be found in the same place! Harebrayne: AAAAAAAAAAAAH! My hypothesis! MY HYPOTHESIIIIIIIIIS! Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne, this isn't easy for me to say... ...but your hypothesis...is clearly flawed! Harebrayne: UWAAAAAAAAAGH!!! Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Counsel, what is the implication of this? Ryunosuke: If, on the day in question, the alleged instantaneous kinesis never actually took place... ...then it's entirely possible that the victim was killed somewhere other than on the stage. And in that case...someone other than the defendant could have been the culprit! Harebrayne: But, but my hypothesis! My hypothesis is sound! I proved it that day! The experiment was a success! The experiment was proof of all my work! ???: Juror No. 4: If I could say something here, in my capacity as a fellow of the Royal Society... Judge: Yes, juror number four? Go ahead. Juror No. 4: As a man of science, there's one thing I simply cannot abide... And that's a fraud who PRETENDS to be a fellow man of science! Harebrayne: What? Wait! Great Scott! Are you suggesting my science is suspect?! Juror No. 4: It's just been disproved, hasn't it? In front of all of us. In other words, the whole demonstration was a complete nonsense from start to finish! Believe me, my fellow jurors, when I tell you that this man is a heel, a bounder and a fraud! Juror No. 1: I say the wreckage of that machine should be stripped down and thoroughly examined! Harebrayne: Nooo! Never! That machine is the essence of my entire hypothesis! It's protected by the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act! Juror No. 6: What the devil is that blasted act all about, eh? Who made up such a daft rule?! Ryunosuke: (I don't like the way this seems to be going... What's the best way for me to help the professor?) Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne has yet to perfect his invention! That would seem to be the case, yes. But even so... Van Zieks: Even so, what? Ryunosuke: Going to such trouble and expense to create a fake machine to display in public... He would have absolutely no reason to do such a thing! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: He had an obvious reason to do exactly that. For the research grant money. Ryunosuke: Ah! Juror No. 4: If the government was foolish enough to have deemed the man's ridiculous notion plausible... ...he and his conspirators would have received a handsome sum indeed. Harebrayne: C-Conspirators? Juror No. 2: What would be the value of such a grant? Ten pounds? Juror No. 4: You're an order of magnitude out, madam. Five hundred pounds a YEAR! Juror No. 5: Ooh arrrrrr! Ya could live 'andsome on that much for years! Juror No. 4: The Society's noticed an increase in bogus public demonstrations in the field of science recently. And plenty of scientists arguing with each other to get the largest slice of the funding cake. People's greed is plenty motive enough for murder, I assure you! Harebrayne: No no no! I haven't deceived anyone! Least of all the government! My hypothesis is sound! The science is sound! Please, you must believe me! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: No matter how unbelievable this hypothesis may seem to you, ladies and gentlemen... ...the fact remains that the victim was transported instantly to the Crystal Tower. Which means that the experiment...was a success. Harebrayne: Ah, Barok! Van Zieks: And therefore... ...the only person who could possibly have committed this murder...is the accused! Harebrayne: Ah. Barok... Ryunosuke: (Where is this heading? I have no idea...) Van Zieks: My Lord, if I may...? Judge: Yes, Lord van Zieks? Van Zieks: The prosecution would like to summon new witnesses to the stand. Judge: New witnesses? What would be the nature of their involvement? Van Zieks: They were spectators of the demonstration at the exhibition. Who were occupying special seats. Ryunosuke: Eyewitnesses? Judge: Very well, the court grants the prosecution's request. I should very much like to hear from eyewitnesses to the incident. Van Zieks: The prosecution's stance is clear. This experiment was no postiche. The accused killed the financier victim there on the public stage, before the very eyes of the spectators. Now, my learned friend... Ryunosuke: Oh! ...Yes? Van Zieks: It's time for you to make your own stance clear. Ryunosuke: (There's clearly a flaw in the professor's hypothesis. I can definitely see that. But where does that leave me...?) Judge: We shall take a short recess now. During which time, the prosecution will prepare its new witnesses to take the stand. Van Zieks: ...As you wish, My Lord. Judge: Good. In that case, court is adjourned for twenty minutes. To be continued... 23rd October, 10:44 a.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber Harebrayne: M-Mr Naruhodo... ...what on earth were you playing at just now? Or rather... ...WHAT ON EARTH WERE YOU PLAYING AT ALL ALONG?! MY HYPOTHESIS! MY AMAZING HYPOTHESIS! You've been picking holes in it from the start! Ryunosuke: Ah, sorry about that. Harebrayne: But you promised me! You, you said you'd prove that dratted explosion was an accident, not murder. You said you'd keep my precious invention from falling into anyone else's hands! But all you've done so far is try to undermine me! Ryunosuke: ......... Yes, I did make you a promise, you're right. I said that I'd believe in you and fight for your freedom to the very end. But I also told you I was no scientist. I don't understand your hypothesis. The fact is, there's an undeniable flaw in your logic, isn't there? Harebrayne: Ah! But! If I just run through some equations... Yes, you see! It's because my work is incomplete! Ryunosuke: Perhaps it is. Nevertheless...a man died as a consequence, didn't he? Harebrayne: Oh. OOOOOOOOOH NOOOOOOOOO! ......... You're right. You're so right. It's all my fault... And I have no right to blame you for my failures. I'm a disaster! Not just as a scientist...but as a human being! Ryunosuke: Well...that might be a little over the top. Harebrayne: And while we're on the subject... ...wh-what about Barok? He's being awful! Ryunosuke: Claiming his old university friend to be a murderer, you mean? Harebrayne: He's a disaster! Not just as a prosecutor...but as a human being! Oh! But no! Wait! He's the Reaper, isn't he? Perhaps he's not classified as Homo sapiens any more...? Ryunosuke: (...Glad that's cleared up...) ......... Can I double-check something with you? Harebrayne: Ah. Yes? What? Ryunosuke: The machine and demonstration you prepared... They were based entirely on your hypothesis, I presume? There was no...trickery involved? Harebrayne: ......... I drew the plans for the machine with my very own hands. Every line was painstakingly drawn with the firm belief that science is the only future. So yes, it's true that my hypothesis hasn't reach [sic] maturity yet, but please, Mr Naruhodo...you must believe in it. Ryunosuke: ......... Alright, Professor, I understand. Bailiff: Counsel! Defendant! The prosecution's witnesses are ready to take the stand. Court is about to be in session again. Make your way into the courtroom, please! Ryunosuke: (It all hinges on that demonstration. If the professor's hypothesis is sound as he claims... ...it leaves him as the only person who could possibly have killed the victim. But on the other hand, Mr Sholmes was adamant...) Sholmes: A practical implementation, such as was attempted by the professor at the Great Exhibition, is quite impossible. Ryunosuke: (So really, what should I be trying to prove here?) 23rd October, 11:00 a.m. The Old Bailey Courtroom Judge: In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby reconvene the proceedings of this court. Counsels for the defence and prosecution, are you ready for the new witnesses to testify? Van Zieks: The prosecution is ready, My Lord. Ryunosuke: As is the defence, My Lord. Judge: So, Lord van Zieks... ...I believe these next witnesses saw the demonstration on the day in question with their own eyes? Van Zieks: Indeed they did. And as luck would have it, one of them is a police detective. ...So the testimony we are about to hear can be considered highly reliable. Ryunosuke: (Perfect. A detective of all people...) Van Zieks: The prosecution's stance remains unchanged. Though it ended in tragedy, the demonstration on the day in question was scientifically sound. And consequently... ...the sole person with the opportunity to have committed this act of murder... ...is the only other individual to have been present on the stage at the time: the accused. Judge: Thank you, Counsel. The prosecution's position is clear. So, bring forth your witnesses now. Van Zieks: Bailiff, show the witnesses in. The witnesses whose proximity to the incident on the day in question will clarify the truth unequivocally. Van Zieks: Witnesses, state your names and occupations for the court to hear. Lune: My name is Balthazar Lune. I am...the impresario of all the hot-air balloons in vicinity of the esperimento stage. Gotts: Mein name ist Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond Ormstein. I have come to see ze Great Exhibition all ze vay from my home in Bohemia. ...I'm very rich. Gina: Inspector Gina Lestrade, Scotland Yard. I'm a great detective. Even 'Erlock Sholmes agrees. I was on security duty at the exhibition...and I got to go up in one o' them balloons! It was amazin'! Ryunosuke: (Gina...again. But she did mention that she'd seen the disaster from up in a balloon actually, didn't she? And she clearly loved every minute of it.) Van Zieks: There were three balloons flying near the public experimentation stage when the incident occurred. Two of these witnesses were in one such balloon at the time, and saw events unfold from the skies above. Lune: You make it sound like they were in the clouds. It was only an altitude of circa sixty feet. Very low. Gina: Well ya can't see nuffin' if ya fly too 'igh, can ya? Ryunosuke: (Sixty feet... About eighteen metres, then.) Judge: Thank you for your introductions. Now, you will give your formal testimony for the court. Kindly describe exactly what you witnessed...especially those of you who had a vantage point above the stage! Witness Testimony - The View From Sixty Feet Up - Lune: It was an incidente terribile. I am only grateful that my balloons were not damaged. Gina: There's this huge bang from the stage, and then the next second, another bang in the sky beside us. Gotts: And from amid ze smoke...a cage appeared out of nowhere! Lune: The cage, it fell from the sky like a stone. And crashed into the Crystal Tower! Gina: I didn't get a good look inside the cage, but no one went near it after it crashed into the tower. Judge: ...A most extraordinary collective account, I must say. Ryunosuke: Could I just clarify something? There's a detail in the witnesses' testimony that I've not heard any mention of until now. Specifically, that there were two explosions? Van Zieks: ...More precisely, two explosions in two separate places, yes. When the demonstration began, the balloon carrying the two witnesses was around...here. There were other balloons in the air nearby at the time carrying other passengers as well, to be clear. Then, as power was supplied to the machine for the demonstration, the first explosion occurred. The so-called 'birdcage' that contained the victim disappeared from the stage, and a moment later... ...the second explosion occurred, directly adjacent to the balloon carrying the witnesses. The birdcage appeared at the site of the explosion, subsequently to plummet down into the Crystal Tower. Gotts: I voz very surprised. Suddenly a cage appeared before my eyes viz a person inside. Ze blast voz so hot, but I didn't vant to miss a sing, so I kept my eyes vide! ...I still have lots of money. Judge: ......... Precisely who is this curious infant? Van Zieks: I'm told he is a young noble of Bohemian royalty. Apparently he disguised himself in order to steal unnoticed into the Great Exhibition. Gotts: Ja, I am here in London on a sightseeing trip viz my elementary school. Van Zieks: We will have the benefit of a child's point of view in the testimony. Ryunosuke: (Do we really need that?) Gotts: Ven I remove my mask, zis is vot I look like. Judge: Ah yes, I see. A delightful face, I'm sure. Gotts: Ja, everybody says so. Ryunosuke: (Great disguise, then...) Van Zieks: ...The point is, the testimony of these witnesses further substantiates the facts for the court. Namely, that despite ending in an explosion, instantaneous kinesis was successfully demonstrated. And furthermore, that until the arrival of the police, no one approached the Crystal Tower where the victim fell. Therefore, only the accused, who was with Mr Asman on the stage, could possibly have committed the murder. Judge: Yes, thank you, Counsel. The prosecution's views on the matter are quite clear. So, the defence's cross-examination now, please. Ryunosuke: Y-Yes, My Lord! Cross-Examination - The View From Sixty Feet Up - Lune: It was an incidente terribile. I am only grateful that my balloons were not damaged. Gina: There's this huge bang from the stage, and then the next second, another bang in the sky beside us. Gotts: And from amid ze smoke...a cage appeared out of nowhere! Gotts: It voz not ze sky zat exploded. It voz a green balloon zat woz next to ours at ze time. Lune: The cage, it fell from the sky like a stone. And crashed into the Crystal Tower! Gina: I didn't get a good look inside the cage, but no one went near it after it crashed into the tower. Ryunosuke: (The prosecution really is asserting that the demonstration was genuine... But what if it was actually some kind of switch-around trick instead? That would mean that the victim was never actually on the stage in the first place. The two explosions would have thrown everyone watching into a panic for sure. I think I need to find out more about what exactly people saw at the time...) Ryunosuke: Mr Lune, in your testimony... ...you said that all three of the balloons you had operating at the time were undamaged. Lune: Si. That is correct. If they had been caught in the esplosiones, it would have been terribile. Ryunosuke: I wonder...if you might know what this is? Lune: Ah...I think it may be... Si, part of a balloon. A burnt piece of the fabric of the envelope. Ryunosuke: Sorry? The envelope? Lune: Pardon. That is the large, round part of the balloon which becomes filled with hot air. It is made from very thick fabric lined with rubber. You do not want it to rip when you are in the sky. Ryunosuke: (Just as I thought...) This piece of cloth was found near the experimentation stage. In other words, as Master Gotts testified... ...a green balloon did indeed explode that day. Lune: Eh?! Ryunosuke: If all the balloons in the sky above the experimentation stage belonged to you, Mr Lune... ...then your statement that they were all undamaged clearly contradicts the evidence! Lune: NOOOOOOOOO! If a balloon exploded that day, why didn't the man say so? Maybe everyone on board was killed... Oh no! Having just spent ten whole pounds for the experience?! How awful! Seems to me like those things crash fifty percent of the time anyway... Van Zieks: Van Zieks: The instantaneous kinesis did occur! But after the explosion on the stage... ...the point of materialisation shifted to a location occupied by a balloon. Judge: Causing the balloon to explode? Yes, eminently plausible. Van Zieks: An unfortunate traffic accident, as it were. But it changes nothing about the pertinent facts. ???: Lune: This, I cannot accept! Ryunosuke: Why not, Mr Lune? Lune: You are suggesting that I am a liar! That persons died in a balloon incidente! Van Zieks: There's no need to get 'fired up', Mr Lune. The victim was the sole fatality that day. Lune: That's right! And I prove it! Balthazar Lune is not a liar! There was no such balloon in the sky! It is non possible! Ryunosuke: You're saying it's impossible? Why? Van Zieks: This court has more important matters to discuss than the number of balloons that were operating that day. Lune: AIIIIIIEEE! Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But we can't ignore the fact that nobody appears to have known anything about this other balloon until now! My Lord! The defence calls for further testimony from Mr Lune! Judge: I concur. There is clearly more to the truth here than meets the eye. It's imperative that we clear up the issue of this phantom balloon, I feel. Witness, you will give supplementary testimony about the balloons you were operating at the exhibition. Lune: Ah...grazie, My Lord! Witness Testimony - Mr Lune's Balloons - Lune: As I said, Balthazar Lune is no liar! Every balloon I had in the sky landed safely! All three of my balloons were carrying passengers. If they fell to the ground in an esplosione, what a catastrofe! Gina: But ya can't get away from the fact that a burnt-up bit o' cloth was found at the scene, can ya? The coppers at the Yard reckoned it was prob'ly some debris thrown from the explosion on the stage. Lune: This stupido ragazzo is mistaken! My balloons have the red and blue zigzag stripes anyway! Judge: Hmmm...so your assertion is that the balloon this child saw was not one belonging to you? Lune: Si! Exactamente! If he even saw a balloon in the first place. I do not like the sound of it. It is very bad for business! I have a good mind to sue the land of Bohemia! Gotts: If you attack us, ve vill fight back! It vill be vor! All out vor! Ryunosuke: (...What happened to 'all out war'? Mr Lune certainly doesn't appear to be lying. But that doesn't change the fact that the testimony and evidence are contradictory here...) Van Zieks: If the defence is unable to find fault with the witnesses' statements, the court must consider them the truth. ...Think long and hard on that, my learned friend. Ryunosuke: (The situation has clearly changed now. I have to get to the bottom of what happened here, no matter what it takes!) Judge: Counsel, you may now cross-examine the witnesses. Cross-Examination - Mr Lune's Balloons - Lune: As I said, Balthazar Lune is no liar! Every balloon I had in the sky landed safely! Lune: All three of my balloons were carrying passengers. If they fell to the ground in an esplosione, what a catastrofe! Gina: But ya can't get away from the fact that a burnt-up bit o' cloth was found at the scene, can ya? Gina: The coppers at the Yard reckoned it was prob'ly some debris thrown from the explosion on the stage. Lune: This stupido ragazzo is mistaken! My balloons have the red and blue zigzag stripes anyway! Ryunosuke: (As I thought, Mr Lune's testimony just doesn't quite add up... The young Bohemian boy claims to have seen another, fourth balloon. But Mr Lune vehemently denies the possibility. And it's hard to imagine the man in charge could be mistaken about the number that were in the air... Still, this inconsistency must tell us something, I'm sure.) Ryunosuke: Unfortunately, the photograph Master Gotts took can't tell us the colour of the balloon. But it can tell us something else. Something crucially important. Van Zieks: What? Ryunosuke: It shows that the pictured balloon...wasn't carrying any passengers. Judge: Ah! My goodness, you're right! But surely all the balloons would have been carrying passengers? There would be no sense in it otherwise. Lune: S-Si! They are for pleasure! For seeing the view! MY balloons only fly with passengers! Ryunosuke: Which tells us that the pictured balloon isn't one of them. So when the incident occurred that day... ...there WAS a fourth balloon in the skies above the experimentation stage! The mysterious green balloon! Lune: I, I know nothing! Niente! I, I can only tell you one thing... If this balloon was not carrying passengers, then it was not one of mine! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: There are illegal tradesmen everywhere you care to look. Clearly one such 'entrepreneur' decided to capitalise on the opportunity presented by the Great Exhibition. And managed to operate balloon flights on Mr Lune's patch without him realising. Lune: Si... Si! The competizione...trying to steal my profits! I did not notice because of the esperimento that went wrong on the stage! Ryunosuke: This fourth balloon exploded at the very same moment Mr Asman was 'beamed' from the stage below. Gina: Right...so them scraps that fell to the ground after, an' left them scorch marks... They didn't come from the stage at all! It was bits o' the balloon rainin' down! But cos no one was in it, it didn't get no attention. Ryunosuke: (A mysterious fourth balloon carrying no passengers, silently floating over the experimentation stage...) Van Zieks: Van Zieks: This photograph shows us nothing more! A stray balloon carrying no one and operated by some rogue trader. Clearly it has nothing to do with the case. Judge: Hmmm... Its relevance does elude me, I must say. Van Zieks: The court has seen sufficient evidence and heard ample testimony already. The prosecution calls for this trial to be concluded! Ryunosuke: (Really? Have we really got to the truth yet? No, I can't let this opportunity slip away. The jurors' minds are made up...and not in our favour! What else can this photograph tell us? Is there nothing more we can learn from it?) Ryunosuke: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, wait! Please don't give your decisions yet! The photograph from Master Gotts... ...may well be hiding one more vital clue! Juror No. 1: What's that?! Juror No. 3: A vital clue?! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: We're well past the point of mere possibilities. It's time for definitives now. So tell the court... What exactly does this alleged clue in the photograph prove? Ryunosuke: We can reasonably assume that the pictured balloon was destroyed in the searing heat of the explosion. Gotts: Ja! Zat's right! Ja! It voz not my fault! Van Zieks: Evidently. Because the birdcage from the kinesis machine materialised in the sky where it had been flying. And the balloon, being filled with flammable hydrogen, instantly and explosively ignited. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: ...No, that's not what happened. Van Zieks: What? Judge: It would appear that this photograph requires closer examination. Counsel for the Defence, you will highlight the location of this alleged 'clue' in the photograph for the court. Ryunosuke: Of course, My Lord. (If you look closely, it's plain enough to see. And what's shown is linked to another piece of evidence we have. In a way that leads to an unbelievable conclusion!) The clue that heavily suggests the real reason the balloon exploded is... Ryunosuke: The timing of this photograph can only be described as miraculous. If you look, you'll notice there's a bright white line that appears to point directly at the balloon. Van Zieks: Most likely a ray of light caught incidentally on the film. Judge: ...I'm afraid I can see nothing of the sort. Ryunosuke: If you look with a magnifying glass, My Lord, it becomes clear what the nature of this bright line really is. Goodness, what is that? Juror No. 4: Undeniably some flash of light, yes. Juror No. 2: Oh golly. Do, do you think it might be lightning? Juror No. 1: But it couldn't have been a finer day. Juror No. 3: I believe we may be looking...at fire! Juror No. 6: A bolt of fire, heading straight for the balloon...like an arrow! Judge: Indeed. Even to my ageing eyes, it would appear to be a flame of some sort. My word! Are, are you suggesting this flame struck the hydrogen gas that filled the balloon?! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: That's absurd! The balloon would have been sixty feet above the ground at the time. No flame could possibly have reached such a height. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Actually, it's my opinion... ...that a particular piece of evidence found at the scene reveals how that is exactly what did happen. Van Zieks: What evidence?! Judge: If such evidence exists, Counsel, then for goodness' sake present it, man! Which evidence explains this mysterious streak of flame that appears to be headed directly for the balloon? Ryunosuke: This was found hidden at the foot of a small ornamental tree near the scene. Judge: Good Lord! Is that a crossbow? Ryunosuke: An arrow dipped in oil and set alight could have been shot from this weapon... ...sending a flaming arrow straight into the hydrogen-filled balloon! Van Zieks: Are you suggesting...that crossbow was used to deliberately...? Gina: Blimey, yer right! That streak o' light in the photo looks just like an arrow, dunnit? Lune: Then...the esplosione of the balloon, it was... Ryunosuke: ...Very likely the result of a flaming arrow from this crossbow igniting the hydrogen gas inside it! Van Zieks: Nooo! Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Counsel, this is an extraordinary supposition! Ryunosuke: If the aim was to cause the balloon to explode, the shooter could have used a gun of course. However, there's an obvious reason why that would have been out of the question. Van Zieks: The noise of the discharge? Of course... Ryunosuke: That's right. By using a crossbow, the projectile could be fired at the balloon silently. Gina: Well yeah, if someone 'ad shot a gun off in the exhibition grounds, it would've caused a real panic. Lune: But with the big esplosione, there was a very big panic anyway, no? Ryunosuke: ......... (I don't like this. I should be pleased to have found a plausible new explanation for all this, but something feels wrong...) Van Zieks: Van Zieks: Do you understand the implications of what you're saying, my Nipponese friend? Ryunosuke: If a flaming arrow did indeed hit the balloon, then obviously it would have exploded. And if the birdcage appeared from the cloud of smoke that ensued... Gina: Wot? Wait a minute! Wot are ya really sayin' 'ere? I don't get it. Was, was the birdcage beamed up into the sky after all, or...wot? Judge: My goodness me! Ryunosuke: ......... (Ah, now I understand. That's what that sinking feeling is about...) I think there's a good chance... ...that the birdcage was actually concealed inside the balloon all along. Judge: What?! Did, did I just hear that correctly, Counsel? Ryunosuke: (There's no going back now. The horse has bolted...) Let's assume, as I said, that the birdcage was hidden inside the green balloon from the start. On stage, when the experiment was started... ...the birdcage in the instantaneous kinesis machine disappeared in a cloud of smoke. At that moment, the flaming arrow was fired from the ground... ...causing the green balloon to explode and drawing the attention of the spectators to the sky above their heads. From amid the smoke, the hidden birdcage then appeared, to fall down and crash into the Crystal Tower. I think you'll all agree it's entirely plausible... ...that what I've just described is the real truth behind the 'miraculous' experiment carried out that day! Judge: Th-This... I......... GOOOOOOOOOD GRIEF! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: This is ludicrous! What you've described is no science experiment. It's, it's child's play! A contemptible display of stage magic! Ryunosuke: (Both Mr Sholmes and Iris said that the experiment was a scientific impossibility. In which case, this is the only way to explain what happened that day.) Van Zieks: And in any case...the victim's body was found inside the birdcage in the Crystal Tower. If the instantaneous kinesis didn't take place, how do you explain that? Ryunosuke: Ah! Um... Juror No. 3: If I may put in a word...as a man of magic myself... Such apparent discrepancies can easily be explained by some simple deception. Ryunosuke: J-Juror number three! Juror No. 3: All that would be needed is a doppelgänger - someone who looked very similar to the victim, Mr Asman... ...and having this other man appear on stage to front the show...as a body double! Ryunosuke: Ah...yes! Of course, so in fact... ...Mr Asman must have been inside the birdcage that was concealed inside the balloon right from the start! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: That balloon would have been filled with hydrogen. Anything hidden inside it would have been scattered to the four winds when it exploded. No one would ever have embarked on such a risky venture. Juror No. 4: Not necessarily. The explosive force of the balloon gas would very much depend upon the mixture ratio. Ryunosuke: J-Juror number four! Juror No. 4: Flying balloons are rarely filled with pure hydrogen, but a mixture of other gases such as helium as well. Helium on its own doesn't explode, but by controlling the gas mixture ratio, the explosive force can be altered. Van Zieks: The mixture ratio...? Juror No. 4: Obviously, the victim's body would have suffered some burns. That would be unavoidable. But not to such an extent as to render this whole obscene charade impossible. Van Zieks: ......... Ryunosuke: So everything that happened can be explained. Logically and scientifically. The explosion that engulfed the stage at the start of the 'experiment' was no accident. It was all part of an elaborate deception...to make it appear that instantaneous kinesis had occurred! Judge: Well...goodness me... Ryunosuke: And if we accept that this is what happened... ...it means that the victim, Mr Asman, was never present on the public experimentation stage to begin with. Van Zieks: Nrgh... Ryunosuke: In short... ...he couldn't have been killed by the defendant, who was on stage in full view the entire time! Van Zieks: AAAAAARGH! Ryunosuke: (This will be very hard for the prosecution to counter. Lord van Zieks can't credibly maintain that Professor Harebrayne is a suspect now!) ???: Harebrayne: Mr Naruhodo...I appreciate your efforts. Thank you. Ryunosuke: P-Professor?! Harebrayne: But you can stop now. Just keep your mouth shut, please. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Van Zieks: What's all this about...Mr Harebrayne? Harebrayne: ......... I, Albert Harebrayne, hereby confess... ...that it... That it was... That it was me who stabbed Mr Odie Asman! Yes! It was me! With my faithful friend and partner... Andrew the Screwdriver! Ryunosuke: Wha......... WHAT ARE YOU DOIIIIIING?! Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Defendant! Explain this sudden confession! Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne! What are you talking about?! Harebrayne: It's...it's what I've said all along! I must protect my hypothesis! And my precious machine! Ryunosuke: ...! Harebrayne: You stand there and claim it was all a trick! All an elaborate prank! But where's your proof?! No, y-you'd have to examine the machine if you wanted to prove it. But then it would all be over! My beautiful hypothesis would be laid bare... I mean, the indignity of it! Ryunosuke: It's clear that you drew the plans for the experiment, but you didn't actually build it. It's quite conceivable that you were duped, Professor. If you'll just let me, I can prove- Harebrayne: Barok! Van Zieks: Yes? Harebrayne: I'll cooperate. I'll do whatever you say. I swear it. So, so please... ...ensure the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act is adhered to and protect my creation! ......... Van Zieks: ...Pray forgive the discourtesy of filling my hallowed chalice at this critical juncture... Here's to my learned Nipponese friend... Ryunosuke: Wha...?! Van Zieks: ...and his upcoming attempt to clarify the defence's position in the light of the accused's confession. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: Do you intend to formally assert that the experiment was nothing more than a conjuring trick? Because the moment you do... ...the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act that protects the professor's invention will cease to apply. The prosecution will then demand a rigorous examination of the machinery involved in order to establish the truth. Ryunosuke: ......... Van Zieks: However...if you acknowledge that the machine is genuine and instrumental in the victim's murder... ...any chance of investigating will be crushed...and the confidentiality of the professor's hypothesis preserved. Ryunosuke: ...! Judge: Well, Counsel...what is the defence's official position on this matter? Ryunosuke: (What Professor Harebrayne - my client - actually asked of me... ...was to prove that the explosion on stage was an accident and protect the secrecy of his hypothesis. But there's no way to do that without implying the professor's guilt! Do I protect my client's life by asserting his innocence, or do I uphold my client's request but see him condemned? Either way, I can't avoid betraying his trust...) Van Zieks: You've been silent long enough! Isn't talking your trade, my learned friend? Or has all knowledge of English escaped your confused Nipponese mind? Ryunosuke: ......... Harebrayne: Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: (There's no escape here! I have to make a choice! But it's an impossible one! I have to give up on something...but what?) The defence asserts...that the defendant's instantaneous kinesis machine was in fact... Ryunosuke: ......... .........Agh! (No! I can't say it! My client placed his faith in me... I can't just let him down!) 'What must I give up on?' is not the question you have to ask yourself here. It's 'What can I protect?' Susato: Hello again...Mr Naruhodo. It's been far too long. Ryunosuke: Su... Susato-san! But, but what are you- Susato: Haiiiiii-YA! Ryunosuke: AAAAAAAAGH! (My first Susato Takedown in six months!) Susato: There'll be time to talk later, Mr Naruhodo. For now...we must concentrate on the task at hand! Ryunosuke: (Which is working out not what I have to give up on, but what I can protect!) Professor Harebrayne! Harebrayne: Ah! ...Yes?! Ryunosuke: Yesterday you told me that science is the pursuit of truth. Well...my job is to pursue the truth too. Harebrayne: Yes, of course... Ryunosuke: And personally, I believe...that you didn't stab Mr Asman. I think you've come to realise something yourself too, haven't you? That your experiment and the machine you built with the victim are questionable! The truth behind that is what we must both pursue now! Harebrayne: UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH! Van Zieks: ...So...you've finally opened your eyes. Ryunosuke: What? Van Zieks: And as for you... ...Albert. You can't ignore this any longer. Harebrayne: Ah... Van Zieks: Having heard my learned friend's assertion... ...don't you have something to say? Harebrayne: ......... B-Barok... Ryunosuke: Lord van Zieks... Susato: Gosh, I've never heard him speak that way before. Harebrayne: ......... In truth...there is one thing. Something I've remembered that's of relevance. Ryunosuke: What? Harebrayne: On the day it happened...just before I began the experiment...I saw a man near the stage. A man holding that crossbow. Judge: I beg your pardon?! Ryunosuke: Professor! Did the man have any distinguishing features? What did he look like? Harebrayne: Uh...tall. Taller than me. And, and thin. Thinner than me. With straight hair. Straighter - and whiter - than mine. Let me see... One less lens than me, too. A monocle. A rather stylish, black monocle. But one thing in particular will help to positively identify the man. You see, I know him very well. After all...he's the engineer who built my invention! Van Zieks: What? Ryunosuke: He...built the machine? Harebrayne: That's right. Mr Asman introduced him to me a year ago. He's, he's a man by the name of... ...Enoch Drebber. Juror No. 3: Enoch?! Juror No. 4: Drebber?! Judge: Does this name mean something? Members of the jury seem flustered... Juror No. 4: Not a name any scientist wishes to hear. The man's an abomination! Juror No. 3: Not a name any conjuror wishes to hear, either! Ryunosuke: Who on earth is he? Juror No. 4: I'm afraid this isn't the first tale of this nature that I've heard in scientific circles in connection with that name. There's talk of other flamboyant experiments that turn out to be nothing but stage trickery in the end. Obviously the rascal is after the government's research grant money. Juror No. 3: When magicians are in need of money, I have heard of them resorting to these underhand tactics. Some acquaintances of mine with...experience of such things have mentioned Enoch Drebber's name before. Juror No. 4: The man is both an engineer and a magician. Yes, we're dealing with an unparalleled confidence trickster here! That's Enoch Drebber for you! Harebrayne: So it's true then... My invention... My great machine... It was just a grand illusion? Ryunosuke: Considering what we've just heard about Mr Drebber's character... ...I'm sorry to say that sounds increasingly likely. Harebrayne: Even though no one else believed it...I wanted to. I wanted to believe that machine would function exactly as my hypothesis predicted. Van Zieks: Which is why you were so opposed to it being investigated, I presume. Harebrayne: I knew that if the machine was examined in detail, its construction would give away my hypothesis. Obviously, I didn't want that to happen. But at the same time... ...I knew that if it was found to be nothing more than a trick... Than a work of deception... ...then everything I'd worked towards...all my research... all my dreams...my whole life would be over! I was terrified at the prospect. Ryunosuke: So you really had no idea, then, did you? About the true nature of the machine that was built. And the true nature of Mr Drebber. Harebrayne: I never questioned anything. I, I didn't want to question it. Ryunosuke: It's entirely possible that Mr Asman and Mr Drebber... ...were working together to use you as a means of fraudulently acquiring the research grant money. Harebrayne: ......... ...When I announced my invention to the crowds that day, it was the finest moment of my career. I pulled all the levers and turned all the dials in exactly the way Drebber had described... When the smoke suddenly started billowing out, I panicked. I didn't know what was happening. Harebrayne: But I really don't know how the whole illusion was made to work. I...don't know anything any more... Van Zieks: Let me confirm one final point with you, Professor. Do you now consent to the prosecution submitting the necessary paperwork... ...to release your invention from the protection afforded by the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act? Harebrayne: ......... Yes, please go ahead. I'm...very sorry. Judge: It would appear that we shall have to suspend proceedings for the remainder of the day now. Lord van Zieks... Van Zieks: My Lord? Judge: The court has newly been made aware of another party whose involvement in this matter is critical. Van Zieks: Yes, Mr Drebber... Judge: Gather information about the man. If possible, I should like him served with a subpoena. Van Zieks: With pleasure, My Lord. Judge: Now, Counsel for the Defence... Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord! Judge: ......... When we reconvene, I shall be looking for one thing and one thing alone from you. Evidence...that the defendant is innocent of the crime for which he presently stands accused. Ryunosuke: ...I understand. Judge: Good. In that case...this court is adjourned until tomorrow morning! 23rd October, 1:36 p.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' Antechamber Harebrayne: ......... ...Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: Ah! Y-Yes? Harebrayne: I'm...I'm...I'm... I'm so sorry! I was wrong! You were right! I tricked you! You trusted me! I dragged you...into my mess! Oh h-how did it ever come to this...? I'M SOOO SOOO SOOO SOOORRY! Ryunosuke: Did you really have no idea, Professor? About what Mr Drebber was really up to, I mean? About what he was really constructing. Harebrayne: Naturally! That machine was the embodiment of my hypothesis! Of all my hopes and dreams! I had complete faith in it! Ryunosuke: Alright. In that case, I won't say any more. Now, sadly the murder accusation against you still stands. So we must do as much investigation as we can before the trial resumes tomorrow. Harebrayne: ......... Well, thank you for doing so much for me! Susato: I'm so sorry for arriving late this morning, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: A-Arriving late? Susato: Didn't you receive my postcard? I wanted to let you know when I'd arrive. Ryunosuke: Postcard? What postcard? Iris: I hid it from you, Runo! So it would be a surprise! ...Well? Did it work? Ryunosuke: I was surprised alright! Especially when she threw me to the ground! Susato: Oh dear! I'm so sorry! I, I was just so happy to see you again that...it sort of slipped out. Ryunosuke: (Maybe we could stick to more traditional displays of emotion in future...?) Iris: Susie's train was late into London Victoria this morning, you see. But we made the coachman really whip the horses hard so she didn't miss the whole trial! Susato: I was watching from the gallery for a while, but in the end...I'm afraid I couldn't contain myself... Ryunosuke: Well, I'm glad you didn't. Susato: Oh! Ryunosuke: Having you at my side in court gives me the strength I need to win. So...I'm, um, delighted to see you...back in London. Susato: Oh, you're too kind, Mr Naruhodo! I'm delighted to be here! I hope I can continue to be of service to you. Ryunosuke: Of course. So...what's brought you back? Did Professor Mikotoba not protest? Iris: Let's save all that conversation for when we're back at home, shall we? You know I've made one of my most special blends ever for this special occasion! Susato: Oh, Iris, how wonderful! I can't wait! Ryunosuke: Susato-san was back in London. It's hard to describe how happy that made me feel at the time. But despite my elation... ...our tale was about to take yet another extraordinary turn. To be continued...23rd October, 2:41 p.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy Susato: Oh, this room! It's been too long! It hasn't changed in the slightest, though. And it's been some six months, hasn't it? ...That's a long time for things to stay so...familiar. Ryunosuke: I didn't know when you might return, and I wanted everything to be as you'd left it. ...But it has been some six months, it's true. Iris: So is your father alright, Susie? What happened? Susato: My father? Ryunosuke: Yes! Professor Mikotoba! I mean, it was half a year ago, but that's why you went back to Japan! Because of the telegram you received saying he'd fallen ill with a very high fever for some unknown reason. Iris: That's right. So I was surprised to learn you'd be coming back so soon. Surprised but happy! Susato: ......... I think I wrote about it in my letter to you. That it was all a trick. My father is in fine health. And I'm obviously very relieved...about that. Ryunosuke: Well, we're all delighted to have you back. Susato: It was quite by accident that I've been able to return to Europe, actually. It's because of a very grand conference called the International Forensic Science Symposium. Ryunosuke: The International Forensic... (That's the same symposium Lord Stronghart mentioned.) Susato: Anyway, I've arrived safe and sound, and all that matters is that I'm here now! After all, I haven't yet fulfilled my promise to you, Iris. Iris: Oh! Ryunosuke: You must tell us everything that happened while you were back in Japan. Susato: Yes, of course, I shall. Ryunosuke: And...there's one other thing... Something you wrote in your letter that particularly grabbed my attention. About...you-know-who. (About Kazuma...) Susato: I know. I'll tell you all that I can. After clearing all Converse options with Susato Mikotoba and Iris Wilson: Susato: So, Mr Naruhodo, I'm ready to start investigating if you are! I've committed every detail about the case to memory! And Iris has told me about the disturbing happenings at the waxwork museum as well. Ryunosuke: So...you're fully abreast of the situation already, Miss Susato. I'd expected nothing less, to be honest. Susato: I would think our first port of call should be to investigate this Mr Drebber. The engineer responsible for building the elaborate machine that was used to effect this extraordinary trick. Ryunosuke: Yes, a conjuror of sorts, by the sound of it, well known in the fields of science and magic. Susato: Then we need to go and arrest him! Ryunosuke: Well, yes... ...he must know the truth behind this case, so I agree we really do need to find the man. Iris: Hm...it sounds like it's a case of tracking someone down. Which is a job for the police...or a great detective! Ryunosuke: (Are we supposed to guess who she might be thinking of?) We don't have much time, so we need to get started straight away, I think. Iris: Good idea. Well, best of luck, then! Ryunosuke: Oh, you're not coming today? Iris: I'm going to Brixton Road shortly for the herb market. But let me know later how you got on, won't you? Ryunosuke: (That was a little abrupt. The pull of the herb market must be strong...) 23rd October Sholmes's Suite 23rd October Local Prison, Cell 11 Ryunosuke: What's...he doing?! Susato: He's... Oh my! The whole wall of the cell is covered in mathematical equations! Ryunosuke: And he's still writing more now! Um...Professor! Sorry to interrupt... Harebrayne: Oh, ah... M-Mr Naruhodo... ...! And who is this young lady? Susato: My name is Susato Mikotoba. I'm Mr Naruhodo's judicial assistant. It's a pleasure to meet you, Professor. Harebrayne: ......... OH, IF ONLY! IF ONLY I'D MET A REFINED YOUNG WOMAN LIKE YOU SOONER! ...None of this would have happened. N-No, that's not logical... That makes no sense at all. Susato: Oh dear, I'm...I'm sorry if my presence here upsets you. Ryunosuke: I owe you an apology too, Professor. I didn't manage to deliver what I promised you I would in court this morning. Harebrayne: Oh no! No no no! No no no no no! The whole thing... The whole miserable affair... It all happened because I've been such a complete and utter clot! Susato: Um, Professor Harebrayne...what have you been working on in your cell? Harebrayne: Oh! Ha ha, you, um...you mean that? Oh dear, how embarrassing... I, I was suddenly struck by an idea, you see, and I simply had to write it down. The wall was all I had to hand. Ryunosuke: Oh! Is it some new hypothesis? Something to surpass super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis, maybe? Harebrayne: Ah...no, actually. This...is my autobiography. Susato: Your autobiography? Harebrayne: 'How I was Diddled and Fiddled'...by Albert Harebrayne! I've found I can represent my odd fortunes with only odd numbers in an ambitious set of simultaneous equations! Susato: ...Really? Harebrayne: I'm going to have to pay back all the loans I took for the kinesis machine, you see! So it's going to be a new serial publication from next month! 'Part 1: An Odd Birth; an Odd Upbringing'. Ryunosuke: (...You can't beat the man's optimism, that's for sure.) I see. Well...for now, would you mind if we talked a little more about the case? Harebrayne: Oh yes! YES! Of course! I've been working through the numbers! I WAS DIDDLED! I WAS FIDDLED! BY THE PAIR OF THEM! By Asman! And by that aloof engineer, Drebber! Ryunosuke: (We're not going to have to sit through an explanation of all these equations...are we?) 23rd October British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Ryunosuke: ...Oh, who's that standing beside Lord Stronghart? Susato: I wonder... I've never seen her before. Stronghart: Ah, the young champion of the court. You had some success this morning, I understand. And you've thrown the entire government into disarray as a result. Ryunosuke: Oh! You, you mean because of Professor Harebrayne's experiment? Stronghart: Sham science being demonstrated at London's Great Exhibition! The country's been made to look foolish, and now politicians are scrabbling to respond. Lord van Zieks is in Whitehall as we speak, giving an emergency briefing. Ryunosuke: Oh dear, I, um... I didn't mean to cause any trouble. Stronghart: None of this is your responsibility. The government is entirely to blame for having been taken in. The special dispensation that prevents investigation at the scene will be annulled later today. Once that happens, my Forensic Investigation Team will move in and deal with that scrap metal in no time. Ryunosuke: (It's scrap metal now, is it?) ???: Until later then, Lord Stronghart. Stronghart: Yes. Thank you. Ryunosuke: Um...who was that? Stronghart: That was Dr Courtney Sithe, Scotland Yard's esteemed chief coroner. She's leading the Forensic Investigation Team's handling of this case. She was just delivering her report about the victim, in fact. Ryunosuke: Oh, I see... (About Mr Asman.) Stronghart: Following the outcome of the trial earlier, I asked the coroner's office to re-evaluate its findings. I don't have time to tell you what she concluded. If you want to know, you'll have to ask her directly. You can find her in the forensics laboratory. Ryunosuke: Ah, right. Stronghart: Now, what were you here to see me about? I can give you...seven minutes and thirty-nine seconds of my time. Ryunosuke: (So he's not running quite so spectacularly late any more...) After clearing all Converse options: Ryunosuke: Oh yes! Lord Stronghart... Stronghart: Go ahead. Ryunosuke: It's about Professor Harebrayne's experimental machine. We'd like your permission to examine the remains, if possible! Stronghart: ......... Are you well versed in science, then? Ryunosuke: Not in the slightest! In fact, you could say I was barely aware of the subject at all until recently. Stronghart: ...Well the special dispensation legally preventing investigation of the machine is currently being annulled. Within a few hours, Dr Sithe's team of forensic experts will begin their own investigation. But I suppose until then, there's no harm in you looking at the wreckage, as long as you touch nothing. Ryunosuke: Thank you! (Being able to look at it is better than nothing!) Susato: And I'll be able to see it, too! Stronghart: ...Your time is up. You'll have to excuse me now, I'm afraid. My next engagement calls. Susato: We are extremely sorry to have troubled you when you are so busy, My Lord. Stronghart: I have important matters to attend to in preparation for the symposium, you understand. 23rd October Forensics Laboratory Ryunosuke: I believe this is it... Dr Sithe's laboratory. (That chemical smell really assaults the nose. And there's plenty to assault the eyes in here, too...) Susato: It looks as though the doctor isn't here. But we're here now, so we may as well do some... sightseeing, don't you think? Ryunosuke: What a seasoned tourist you've become, Miss Susato. (We could just have a little look around...being careful not to upset any restless souls...) After examining open book on desk: ???: What are you doing?! Ryunosuke: Ah! Sorry! We, um, had something we wanted to ask you, but you weren't here, so... Sithe: So you thought you'd snoop around? That's acceptable to you people from the East, is it? Well? What do you want? Ryunosuke: Ah, um... Lord Stronghart told us, you see... ...that it was you who examined the victim's body. Erm, Mr Asman's body, I mean. Sithe: ......... Susato: So we came to ask you about your findings. On Lord Stronghart's advice. Sithe: ......... Very well. If the Lord Chief Justice has given his consent, I'll tell you what our investigation revealed. But when we're done, you must leave immediately. After clearing Converse option: ???: Mama, what is this? Ryunosuke: ...Agh! (Wh-Where did SHE spring from? And...did she just call the doctor, 'Mama'?) Sithe: This is a 'lawyer', dear. ???: Oh... Ryunosuke: Um...hello. ...To meet you. P-Pleased to meet you. Yes, I'm a defence lawyer. Ryunosuke Naruho- ???: Mama... Sithe: Yes? ???: Can I cut this one up? Ryunosuke: What?! ???: I've never seen inside an Eastern person before. I want to know what it looks like. Sithe: Of course you can't. It's a live specimen, as you can very well see. ???: ......... Hmph. Boring. Ryunosuke: ......... (I, I think... ...I just had a near-death experience!) Susato: Oh dear! Mr Naruhodo, you're as pale as a corpse! Ryunosuke: Then let's leave before I'm mistaken for one! 23rd October The Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower Susato: I had no idea there were so many people in the world. Ryunosuke: I know what you mean. It's really packed here today. Susato: It feels as though it's taken us two hours just to make our way through the crowds to this point. Ryunosuke: Has it? I shut my brain down so I didn't really notice, to be honest. Susato: Gosh...I do wish I had your absence of mind sometimes, Mr Naruhodo. ???: ...There you are. I had a feelin' you lot would show your mugs before long. Ryunosuke: Oh! Inspector Gregson! I see you're hard at work as usual! Gregson: Warm greetings to you. I do hope you've been keepin' well since last we met. Ryunosuke: What's with all the ceremony? We just saw each other in court this morning. Gregson: Not you, sunshine. The gentlewoman so loyally at your side. Susato: Oh! Why, thank you, Inspector. How good of you to notice. Ryunosuke: (He might be a bit rough around the edges, but he's still a proper English gentleman at heart...I suppose.) As you've probably guessed, we were hoping to investigate the scene some more. Gregson: Right. Well, that's the young trainee's domain. Oi! Get over here, Gina! ......... Ryunosuke: ...She seems to be busy playing with a puppy. (Probably giving it a traditional 'East End' training...) Susato: G-Gina?! She's a police officer now? Ryunosuke: Amazing, isn't it? Gregson: She's a good kid, actually. Heart's in the right place, anyway. She's got the detection bug, if you ask me. Yup, I think she'll follow in my footsteps nicely. Ryunosuke: ...What do you mean? Gregson: I'm bein' transferred. It's time for me to say toodle-oo to London. Susato: Oh no! Really? Ryunosuke: That's, that's a bit sudden, isn't it? I had no idea. Where are you going to be posted, then? We'll come to see how you're getting along. Gregson: Haha, not likely. But you're welcome to try. If you don't mind a trip to France, that is. Ryunosuke: To France? Gregson: I'll be workin' in the Paris Police Prefecture. ...Should be right up my alley. Ryunosuke: But, but France! It's an entirely different country! I don't understand. Why would you be sent there? Gregson: That's the way the adult world works, sunshine! Now, don't go pokin' your nose in where it's not wanted. ......... I'm intendin' to take the kid with me when I go. Ryunosuke: What? You're taking Gina to Paris?! Gregson: Well I can't leave her here in London. Who knows what'd become of her. Ryunosuke: (...I suppose he's worried she'd slip back into slipping her hands into people's pockets and purses...) Susato: I don't think he's worried about her pickpocketing, Mr Naruhodo. I think he's worried about the Reaper. Ryunosuke: Oh! (Of course! So that's playing on Inspector Gregson's mind too, is it?) Gregson: Anyway, I haven't mentioned any o' this to Gina. So don't go blabbin', you hear me? Ryunosuke: N-No, of course not. Gregson: I've gotta keep that divin' diva safe an' sound. ...Until all this is over, at least. Gina: Oi! Did you just call me a bloomin' 'divin' diva' again?! Gregson: So you heard that, did ya? Right, well... Any questions about the scene, you can put 'em to my capable detective diva here. Gina: Alright, you 'eard the boss! Inspector Lestrade's in charge 'ere now! Ryunosuke: (...I suppose I'd better keep my word and not mention anything about Paris.) So, um, Gina... You've got a new dog, have you? Gina: Isn't 'e great? Toby's 'is name. Susato: Oh, how delightful! He's absolutely adorable! Ryunosuke: (Yes, the dog does seem lovely. But it's the not-so-lovely Inspector Gregson that's playing on my mind, to be honest...) After clearing all Converse options in British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office then clearing all Converse options in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower: Gina: Right then, 'Oddo! Leave it to me. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Gina: We're gonna get goin' after that dodgy engineer cove right this minute. Oh, but 'ang on... Someone's s'posed to be on guard duty 'ere all the time. Ryunosuke: I'm afraid we can't help. We need to get on with our investigation as well, Gina. Gina: Oh...right. Oh well, never mind. It ain't gonna be me wot gets it in the neck. It'll be the boss. Ryunosuke: (Poor, poor Gregson again...) Gina: Ready Toby? Got that oil scent, 'ave ya? Come on then, boy! See ya later! Susato: I do hope the scent of that oil leads them to that swindler's workshop. Ryunosuke: Yes, I hope so too. Ideally before the dog swims across the Channel to France. 23rd October The Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage Susato: Oh my! So this is the machine... ...that was used to deceive people into thinking instantaneous kinesis had taken place. Ryunosuke: Yes, that's right. Or rather it WAS the machine. It's a little worse for wear at the moment... Susato: What extraordinary lengths Professor Harebrayne went to in order to obtain the research grant. Ryunosuke: No no no! The professor was tricked as well. He didn't know anything about it. Susato: Yes, of course. ...It is amazing, though, isn't it? The scale of the whole affair is so very British. Ryunosuke: You're right about that. You'd never see such a grand deception in Japan, that's for sure. Susato: Oh look...is that... ...Lord van Zieks? Ryunosuke: ......... ...So, I think we're more or less done here, aren't we? Shall we, Miss Susato? Susato: Already? Ryunosuke: He IS the Reaper, remember. We'd do well to keep our distance, I think. Susato: But we have permission to be here! From the top! We're perfectly well allowed to investigate this machine... as long as we don't touch anything. Ryunosuke: From the top? Do you mean Lord Stronghart? Susato: Exactly. So we can stay here and stare at this wreckage for as long as we like! Ryunosuke: (She could have been at the centre of the explosion here and it wouldn't have bent her steel will...) After clearing all Converse options with Barok van Zieks: ???: ......... Van Zieks: ...Ah, the file I requested for the trial tomorrow. Thank you. Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: ...Are you alright? Susato: Who, who is this man, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Lord van Zieks's apprentice, apparently. (So I'm not the only one. Susato-san can see it too...) Susato: Um...Lord van Zieks... ...may we speak with your apprentice for a moment? Van Zieks: With him? ...Why? Apprentice: ......... Susato: Kazuma-sama! Apprentice: ......... ...Kazu...ma...? Ryunosuke: ...! (I don't believe it!) Susato: Your, your posture... Your presence... It can only be... It's you...isn't it, Kazuma-sama?! Apprentice: ......... Ryunosuke: (I felt something strange the very first time I encountered this cloaked figure. As if I knew him somehow... Can it...? Can it really be you, Kazuma?) W-W-Wait! (Too late...) Van Zieks: What's going on here? After examining large machine and large cage, and clearing all Converse options with Barok van Zieks: Susato: ......... You'd already met that masked man, hadn't you, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Yes. Yesterday, in fact. At Lord van Zieks's office. Susato: I see... ......... And if...if Kazuma-sama really is still alive... ...it means that Mr Sholmes lied to us. Ryunosuke: ...I know. (We're going to need to speak to him about that.) Van Zieks: You're going to have to leave now. Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: The Forensic Investigation Team are due to arrive shortly. If they find you here, it will...cause problems. Ryunosuke: What sort of problems? Van Zieks: Foreign affairs problems. Ryunosuke: (...Well we could do without that.) Alright, we'll be on our way. Let's go, Miss Susato. Susato: Of course. The Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower After clearing Converse option in Forensics Laboratory, correctly presenting Drebber's Card in Great Exhibition Grounds, Foot of the Crystal Tower, and examining large machine, large cage and clearing all Converse options with Barok van Zieks in Great Exhibition Grounds, Experimentation Stage: Ryunosuke: Well, I think we've done all the investigating we can here for now. If we could just determine the whereabouts of Mr Drebber... Susato: I'm sure Gina and little Toby won't let us down! Now then... ...do you think we ought to try to speak with Mr Sholmes at this point? We have things to discuss and I'm dying to meet him again after all these months. Ryunosuke: Yes, it's quite possible he might know something useful, you're right. We ought to find him at Madame Tusspells. He's supposed to be working there as a temporary waxwork exhibit. Susato: Yes! Iris told me all about his latest unusual venture! 23rd October Madame Tusspells Museum of Waxworks Susato: We really do need to speak with Mr Sholmes, and I am longing to say hello again... ...but where is he? Ryunosuke: ......... I think you might find...that he's quite nearby, actually. Susato: Oh! What, what do you...? Sholmes: Indeed, my dear fellows...it is I! The world-famous great detective and waxwork... Herlock Sholmes! Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: Susato-san! Susato-saaaaaan! Sholmes: My most humble apologies... Susato: I thought I'd died and gone to eternal paradise for a moment...via London. Sholmes: My dear madam...allow me to make amends by offering you a tasty free deduction at some point. Ryunosuke: ...As long as it's not of questionable street food quality. Susato: I don't understand. Why are you working as a waxwork here, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: Merely a secret identity, you understand. Though the case is largely solved now. Susato: Largely solved? Ryunosuke: We're talking about the waxwork abduction, I presume? Sholmes: Indeed we are, my good fellow. As I predicted, it was as easy as proverbial pie. Though I confess...I'm yet to partake of a pie, proverbial or otherwise. Or any food so far today for that matter. ......... *Rumble rumble rumble* Ryunosuke: (That stomach rumble echoed around the whole museum...) So how did you manage to solve it so quickly? Sholmes: Ah, well, do remember I said it was largely solved. Anyway, I simply negotiated with the culprit. Are you familiar with the so-called 'telephone'? Susato: Oh yes! It's a most modern invention, allowing you to hold a conversation with people far away. In Japan, only the imperial capital and a handful of other cities are connected as yet. Sholmes: This morning, a telephone call was received here from the perpetrator of the abduction. As such, I was able to negotiate terms, and in the end, the waxwork was returned. Ryunosuke: That's amazing! Sholmes: Just between you and I... ...it would appear the culprit had always intended to return the stolen waxwork in any event. Susato: Oh! But...I thought whoever was responsible had demanded a ransom, no? Sholmes: Yes. I think perhaps... ...the ransom demand was necessary to avoid unwanted suspicion regarding the true motive. Susato: But...does that not mean... ...your negotiating was entirely unnecessary? Sholmes: ......... A fact that I must ask you to keep from Madame Tusspells at all costs! A hungry young Iris awaits my return to Baker Street, after all. Ryunosuke: (Poor Iris...) Sholmes: Now then, do I sense that you have some business with this great waxwork? After clearing all Converse options and presenting Photograph of Drebber: Sholmes: I have a suggestion, Mr Naruhodo! Will you indulge me? Ryunosuke: Oh! Well...what is it? Sholmes: As I explained to you when you arrived, the missing waxwork has been returned. And I personally reinstalled it in the exhibit from which it was taken...behind those thick curtains. Ryunosuke: Oh, yes... The 'Professor' exhibit, isn't it? Sholmes: Would you like to see it? For a mere five shillings? ...That's a special, one-time-only price, you understand. Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: The opportunity won't come again, I might add. Wouldn't you like to see the fruits of my labour? Susato: Oh! Well, we do have a rather pressing investigation to carry out. Perhaps we could postpone...? Sholmes: The price is a very reasonable five shilling. I think you'll find it's well worth it. Susato: ...! Ryunosuke: Are you...? Are you being quite serious, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: Surely you need only look at my expression to ascertain if this is seriousness or silliness? Ryunosuke: (I can never tell with you, that's the point.) Susato: Very well, it couldn't hurt. Here's your five shillings. Sholmes: ...Gratefully received. So, the special exhibit awaits behind the curtain. I invite you to peruse it at your leisure. Susato: Well, the money's been spent, so... Let's go and see the special exhibit! Ryunosuke: (Hm, through those heavy curtains at last...) 23rd October Madame Tusspells Special Exhibit Susato: Oh dear... I, I felt a shiver run down my spine as soon as we walked in here. Ryunosuke: Miss Susato! I say we turn on our heels and go straight home...via a really big confectionery! Susato: We...we certainly can't do that. We've paid five shillings already! Ryunosuke: ...True. Actually, now I'm looking a little more closely... ...we've paid good money to see an exhibit that's clearly incomplete...! The nerve of the great diddling detective is far more terrifying than anything else in this place! Susato: This must be what Mr Sholmes meant when he said the case was 'largely solved'. Ryunosuke: (Be that as it may... ...Mr Sholmes heavily implied there'd be a clue about the engineer in here, didn't he? But where...?) Since we've paid five shillings, let's do five shillings' worth of investigation, shall we? Susato: Yes, we, we will get what we paid for! Ryunosuke: (Is that fear or frustration...that's making Susato-san's voice tremble?) Ryunosuke: Ah! Susato: Wh-What on earth...? How can...? Ryunosuke: (I, I don't believe it! A black monocle!) Susato: Mr Naruhodo! Is, is it possible that this man is... Ryunosuke: Yes... It's Enoch Drebber! Susato: The colour of his hair is different, but... Ryunosuke: ...It's unmistakably him! ???: Indeed it is. Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: This man is the subject of your present hunt, I believe? Ryunosuke: Yes, that's...that's right. Just who is this man? Why is he here in this exhibit? Sholmes: ......... Ryunosuke: And why does the convict behind him have no head? Sholmes: ...The head was missing when the model was returned by the thief who stole it. Ryunosuke: (What a surprise.) So then the case isn't yet solved, is it? Sholmes: Did I not say so myself? 'Largely solved' were my words, I believe. But I must locate the missing head 'tout de suite' as Madame would say, or I'll be in grave trouble. A very hungry Iris still awaits my return to Baker Street... preferably with rations! Ryunosuke: Aaargh! Susato: Do you know, though... Something about this room is strange! Ryunosuke: Strange? What do you mean? Susato: Well, the displays in the House of Horrors are supposed to depict real events, are they not? Sholmes: Indeed they are, Miss Susato. Do go on... Susato: And, as terrifying as they are, the scenes in the other exhibits are believable. But this one... This surely couldn't ever really have happened, could it? Sholmes: ......... I think it's time I educated you a little... ...about the nature of the incidents involving the Professor ten years ago. Ryunosuke: ...! After clearing all Converse options, examining camera on figure on left, and examining neck of headless figure: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! Gina: W-W-Wot the bleedin' Nora, 'Oddo?! Wot 'ave you gone an' done?! Ryunosuke: Gina! What are you doing here? Gina: I, I asked Iris, and she said this is where ya'd be, so... SO! Susato: G-Gina! Not so loud in the museum! Sholmes: Madame Tusspells will have you take a position as a waxwork if you're not careful. Ryunosuke: I think there might be a more pressing concern! Gina: I, I still 'ad some flash powder left from six months ago, so... SO! Susato: Alright, Gina, we understand! But please...put down the gun! Gina: Sorry, I...I got scared. Ryunosuke: (You should try being the one on the other end of the barrel.) So...what brings you here, Gina? Gina: Wot brings me 'ere? Wot d'ya think?! We found it! We found that dodgy cove's workshop! Ryunosuke: What?! You found Drebber's workshop?! Gina: Yup! Toby's nose took me straight there! The boss an' the others are headin' over there now in a drag. So come on! Here's the address. I got the boss to write it out. Susato: Oh, thank you, Gina! We'll make our way there at once. Gina: Alright then! See ya there! Sholmes: ...You go. Don't mind me. I'll just stay here...being still. Ryunosuke: What? Sholmes: I know my place...in the exhibit over there... Susato: Oh dear, someone is feeling sorry for himself. Ryunosuke: ......... Let's go, Mr Sholmes! You're coming! Sholmes: Your words hearten me, I must say. But if I were to shirk my duties here... ...Madame would have me pay monetary recompense and Iris's dinner plate would be empty once more. Ryunosuke: Forget that! I'll pay for everything! Sholmes: ......... Then there's not a moment to lose, my dear fellow! I shall hail a carriage at once! Ryunosuke: (No offer to share the cost from Mr Sholmes, then...) Susato: I shall gladly pay half, Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: Thank you, Miss Susato. Right, let's go! 23rd October Enoch Drebber's Workshop Ryunosuke: That looks like... Susato: Oh! It's another super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine! Sholmes: Indeed it would appear so. Though only a prototype, naturally. Gina: Ah, so ya got 'ere, then? Susato: Gina! Well done for finding this place! And in such little time... You've really worked miracles! Gina: It's Toby 'ere who's the miracle worker. Toby: Woof! Gregson: Ah...I thought you lot would show up before long. Ryunosuke: Hello, Inspector. (That's one knitted brow... He looks like he's eating a lemon, not a bag of fish and chips...) Susato: So, Inspector...is there any sign of the engineer? Gregson: Sadly not. We didn't find a soul in here. Susato: Oh...what a shame. Ryunosuke: Well, thank you for letting us know about this place and giving us the chance to investigate. Gregson: Accordin' to what Gina tells me, we only found it thanks to a clue that you lot turned up. I wouldn't wanna, say, go to Paris with a debt of gratitude unpaid now, would I? Ryunosuke: ...Thank you. Gregson: Anyway, if you're hopin' to snoop around in here, I'd get crackin'. Lord van Zieks and the Forensic Investigation Team are on their way here as we speak. Ryunosuke: Them again... Gregson: I imagine you've got the picture by now. They don't take too kindly to lawyer types. Ryunosuke: Right. Sholmes: So then, my dear fellow! Let's turn this place upside-down whilst we have the chance! Gregson: And you, Sholmes. Sholmes: Pardon? Gregson: They take even less kindly to 'great detectives' than they do to lawyers. Sholmes: Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha ha hah! Very droll, Gregson, very droll. But you may consider me nothing more than an inconspicuous waxwork model! Ryunosuke: (Right then...let's see what we can find in here!) After examining overturned trophy, large machine prototype, door, and quiver full of arrows: *Thud* Susato: Oh... Ryunosuke: Is something wrong, Miss Susato? Susato: Well...I thought I heard a noise. From the far side of that door. Well, Gina? Did you hear it too? Gina: Y-Yeah, I 'eard it an' all. Wot d'ya reckon, Toby? Toby: Woof, woof! Gregson: Right, mind the grease! *Thud!* *Thud!* *Thud!* Gregson: Whoever's in there, open up! This is Scotland Yard! .........*Clomp clomp clomp clomp**Squeak... Clunk!* Susato: Oh my... Someone IS in there! Gregson: Argh! This rotten, bleedin' lock! Sholmes: My dear Gregson, as I said only minutes ago... ...if only it were countenanced, I could unlock that door in less than a minute. Gregson: ...! ......... Fine. I'll take the rap for it. Just get us through that blasted door! *Click* Sholmes: There! You may enter at will. Ryunosuke: (You've confused minutes with seconds, I think...) Sholmes: Time is of the essence, I feel. What are we waiting for? Gregson: Nothin' for it, I suppose. This is an emergency. Sholmes: There's a strong possibility that beyond that door...is the engineer you all seek. Be prepared for action, my dear fellow! Ryunosuke: Yes! Mr Drebber's Back Room Ryunosuke: What...? What's happened in here? (Why is everything upside-down?) Gina: Rats! There ain't no one in 'ere after all! Susato: But, but there must be! It was only moments ago that we heard those noises. Ryunosuke: Maybe that was the sound of Drebber running away. Susato: But there's only one door into this room! Sholmes: And no windows that could afford an escape route. Those skylights are too high. Ryunosuke: (...? What's that up there? Are they footprints...on the ceiling?) Gregson: Blow me! What have we here, then? Looks like someone was tryin' to burn somethin' in a hurry. Susato: Oh, that looks like a set of blueprints! Ryunosuke: To what? Gregson: To that Professor Harebrayne's barmy machine, is it? Blimey! If we'd had these, there'd have been no need to muck about tryin' to investigate all that scrap metal! Sholmes: There is something of great interest here, too. This rope was lying on the floor at the foot of that pillar. Ryunosuke: A rope? What's significant about that? Sholmes: ...Never mind. You see, but you do not observe, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: ...! Susato: We must investigate the entire room thoroughly! And before the Forensic Investigation Team arrive, too! Ryunosuke: Um...Mr Sholmes? Have you found something? Sholmes: Ah, Mr Naruhodo. Yes, in point of fact, something rather fascinating. What do you make...of this? Ryunosuke: Hm, let's see... (I've never seen anything like it before.) It looks like a bundle of thick cigars wrapped up in a large watch to me, but- Aaaaaah! Ryunosuke: Miss Susato! What's the matter? Susato: That, that, that, that... That's a... Surely that's a time bomb...isn't it? Gregson: WHAAAAAAAAT?! Did you say...?! Gina: A...time bomb...? Ryunosuke: Um...sorry, but... ...what is a 'time bomb' exactly? Gregson: Eh? Sholmes: Ah ha ha ha ha hah! You truly are one of a kind, Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: (I won't take that as a compliment...) Gina: Hah! Ya don't know nuffin', do ya, 'Oddo! Ryunosuke: ...You haven't got a clue what it is, either, have you, Gina? Sholmes: I invite you to consult a dictionary later, Mr Naruhodo. But this particular specimen is no time bomb. Though I confess it has a very similar appearance. Susato: Oh! Oh, well, thank goodness! But then...what is it? Sholmes: ......... I see... So that's it... Ryunosuke: ...! Susato: Goodness! Mr Sholmes... Have you seen to the heart of the matter? Sholmes: There are times when I consider my lot most unfair. For I'm fated never to know how it feels to flounder as you do when a puzzle presents itself. But...I have learnt to accept the hardships that come with being a great detective, Miss Susato. Ryunosuke: (Here we go. I feel a great deduction coming...) Sholmes: Once again, I can draw two conclusions from the scene we see before us. The first... ...is that the inverted nature of the furniture in this room is the work of Drebber himself. Susato: Oh! But how could you...? Sholmes: And the second conclusion... ...is that the small device on the floor there is without question completely genuine. Susato: Please, Mr Sholmes! You must explain everything! Sholmes: ...It would be a pleasure. After all, it is a great detective's civic duty to teach Scotland Yard the finer points of the trade. Gregson: ......... Ryunosuke: (Well, Inspector Gregson seems delighted with the idea, anyway.) Sholmes: Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Susato: Oh, you deflected the inspector's glare with such fortitude there, Mr Sholmes! Well done! Sholmes: You're too kind, my dear madam. I hereby dedicate this great deduction to you. Kindly stand just there, Miss Susato. Susato: Oh...yes. I'd be delighted! Sholmes: So...shall we begin? Once again, Herlock Sholmes is proud to present...his 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'! The Great Deduction The game is afoot! Topic 1 Flipped Furniture Sholmes: It's plain to see that this room is in complete disarray. The bed, the table and chairs, the lamp... Everything is upside-down. Almost as if every item in the room had, until recently, been happily positioned on the ceiling... ...before falling straight down onto the floor. Susato: Every item in the room was on the ceiling... Are, are you suggesting that...? Sholmes: Indeed. The key here... ...is gravity. It would appear that technology has at last succeeded in freeing us from the great pull of the earth. For the gravity in this room was reversed, and then... suddenly restored to normality! Susato: Goodness! Sholmes: The inverted furniture clearly reveals the truth about the part gravity played in this whole business. I quite understand your scepticism, Miss Susato. I, too, was incredulous at first. However, my conviction in my analysis was cemented when I observed...this. An anti-gravity device...almost identical to one that featured in a dream of mine only the other day, in fact. Susato: But, but then why does it have a clock on it? Sholmes: A most relevant question, indeed. That is a timing device that controls when the gravity direction will switch. There was clearly a requirement for the engineer to be able to restore normal gravity automatically. And the commotion we heard earlier from the other side of the door was the moment that restoration occurred. Yes, the reason why everything in here has been turned upside-down is because of the anti-gravity device! So you see, we need look no further to explain the state in which we now find this room. The direction in which gravity acts in here was reversed by Mr Drebber... ...before being restored to normality in an automatic fashion some time later by the timer device! I have witnessed precisely this scene in a dream I once had when I fell out of bed. Topic 1 Flipped Furniture Conclusion Because gravity was reversed Topic 2 Missing Engineer Sholmes: Now, let us consider the next conundrum: What was our engineer friend's aim? Indubitably, the greatest clue we have to explain his actions...is above our heads. Susato: Yes, how is it possible that there are footprints all the way up there on the ceiling? Sholmes: A question whose answer will lead us neatly to the truth, my dear madam. The reason there are footprints on the ceiling...is because of the nearby skylight! Of course, Drebber's aim was singular: to escape. However, there is but one way into this room. ...Excepting the skylight, that is. Susato: Ah... Sholmes: By inverting the gravity in here, Drebber was able to 'fall' conveniently to the ceiling... ...and make his escape via the otherwise inaccessible skylight, leaving those footprints behind on the way. Susato: But the ceiling in here is very high, Mr Sholmes. If the gravity reversal was sudden, wouldn't Mr Drebber have fallen up to the ceiling rather violently? Sholmes: Hm, 'falling up' is both scientifically and philosophically a rather interesting concept, I feel. But the man was cornered with nowhere to run, so escape through the skylight was his only option. You may recall that I found this in the room earlier, which I believe offers a solution. Susato: Oh! The rope... Sholmes: To reach the intended destination, what better tool than this rope? By anchoring one end to the wall, the man was able to 'lower' himself safely to the ceiling. Which explains how Drebber was able to escape this room before our arrival. He reversed the pull of gravity and fled via the skylight! And personally, I should very much like to reverse the pull of gravity again now...just for fun. Topic 2 Missing Engineer Conclusion Escaped via the skylight Sholmes: Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this topsy-turvy puzzle! Gregson: ......... Gina: ......... Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: (She's completely spellbound...) Um, Mr Sholmes...there is just one thing that troubles me. Sholmes: I would expect nothing less. You're destined to be troubled by 'just one thing' for the rest of your life. Ryunosuke: The thing is... Is such a thing actually possible? An anti-gravity device, I mean. Sholmes: ...I would say that with man's current scientific knowledge at the turn of the twentieth century... ...it's no more possible than instantaneous kinesis! Ryunosuke: ......... But your whole deduction hinges on it! Sholmes: Ah, but my dear fellow... ...when you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth... ...however improbable it may seem. Ryunosuke: Haah... Sholmes: It's a marvellous line, wouldn't you agree? One of my more enduring pearls of wisdom. I had Iris come up with the exact phrasing. My original was...clumsy. Ryunosuke: ...Yes, I have a feeling I've read it in something that Miss Susato lent me once. Susato: Susato: Actually...there IS one other thing, Mr Sholmes... Ryunosuke: (Ah, the spell's broken at last.) Susato: The rope you found was on the floor, wasn't it? Sholmes: Indeed it was. In lonely coils near the wall. Susato: But...if Mr Drebber had used it to escape in the way you described... ...wouldn't it still be tied to the wall? Sholmes: ......... Mysteries inevitably unravel in the end. As, I think you'll find, do ropes. And as evidence of such, you need only look at the mystery we faced in this room, now skilfully unravelled. Ryunosuke: (That argument is as circular as the coils of rope...) Susato: I think perhaps we might need to give Mr Sholmes the usual little helping hand. I'm sure with some minor corrections, the great detective's great deduction will lead us to the truth! Ryunosuke: Yes, you're right. And we must do it quickly, before Enoch Drebber gets too far away! Sholmes: If you're ready, then let us resume... ...Herlock Sholmes's 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular'! Course Correction Hold it, Mr Sholmes! Topic 1 Flipped Furniture Conclusion Because gravity was reversed Sholmes: It's plain to see that this room is in complete disarray. The bed, the table and chairs, the lamp... Everything is upside-down. Almost as if every item in the room had, until recently, been happily positioned on the ceiling... ...before falling straight down onto the floor. Susato: Every item in the room was on the ceiling... Are, are you suggesting that...? Sholmes: Indeed. The key here... ...is gravity. It would appear that technology has at last succeeded in freeing us from the great pull of the earth. For the gravity in this room was reversed, and then... suddenly restored to normality! Susato: Goodness! Sholmes: The inverted furniture clearly reveals the truth about the part gravity played in this whole business. Susato: To think gravity could have been reversed in this very room! I find the whole idea utterly enthralling! Only Mr Sholmes could conceive of such an explanation! Ryunosuke: But the man himself admitted it was a scientific impossibility, so... Susato: Yes, you're quite right. We must completely discount the idea at once. Ryunosuke: Ooh, that's unusually merciless of you, Miss Susato. Susato: 'When you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth.' The great detective himself said so, didn't he? Ryunosuke: While refusing to part with his dreams of anti-gravity devices... Susato: ...Yes, I suppose so. Ryunosuke: Well, let's see if examining this topsy-turvy scene a little more closely... ...reveals some proof that shows exactly what the gravity in this room was or wasn't doing! The inverted furniture clearly reveals the truth about the part gravity played in this whole business. Susato: If the reversal of gravity is scientifically impossible, perhaps we can prove it didn't occur? Ryunosuke: Well, to prove a hypothesis is wrong... Susato: ...The easiest way is just to find an obvious exception. Ryunosuke: (Let's have another good look around...) Ryunosuke: The upright vase clearly reveals the truth about the part gravity played in this whole business. Sholmes: Upon my word, Mr Naruhodo, you've surpassed yourself. By completely turning my argument on its head! Trying to impress your assistant here, perhaps? Ryunosuke: ...No one is trying to steal your spotlight here, Mr Sholmes. Trust me. Sholmes: As you rightly say, though it appears at first glance that all the furniture in the room is upside-down... ...this unassuming, slender vase is standing keenly to attention. And unlike the large safe, there is nothing affixing it to the floor. Ryunosuke: And it's the exception that breaks the rule. Sholmes: In short, much as it pains me... ...the gravity in this room was never inverted at all! Ryunosuke: ...My, my deepest sympathies for your loss. Susato: Oh, poor Mr Sholmes... Sholmes: But the show must go on! So...let us continue with our deductions. Now that we know this contrivance is not in fact an anti-gravity device, there remains but one other possibility. Ryunosuke: ...You don't say. Sholmes: Someone deliberately turned over every piece of furniture in here! Ryunosuke: Which might sound obvious, but leaves one mystery very much unsolved. Namely, why would anyone choose to do that? Sholmes: Quite! And naturally, there is an explanation. Yes, the reason why everything in here has been turned upside-down is because of the anti-gravity device! Ryunosuke: He's absolutely determined that this device must have something to do with it, isn't he? Susato: I'm afraid the lure of an exciting scientific explanation is too strong. Ryunosuke: Well...there's no doubt that somebody did this. Somebody turned all this furniture over. So whoever it was must have had a reason. Susato: I'm afraid nothing comes to mind at all, though. Ryunosuke: Well, let's look around and see if the answer presents itself. Yes, the reason why everything in here has been turned upside-down is because of the anti-gravity device! Ryunosuke: Now we've shown it was nothing to do with gravity, we know somebody must have done this to the furniture. But who? And why? Susato: Yes, those are the questions we really need to answer! Ryunosuke: Well we at least need to resolve one of them here! Ryunosuke: Yes, the reason why everything in here has been turned upside-down is because of the safe combination! Sholmes: Precisely! I believe, Mr Naruhodo... ...that you had a very similar experience once, did you not? Ryunosuke: Yes! Last year... ...when I bought a lottery ticket and noted the ticket number down on the inside cover of a book just in case! Sholmes: That's it! For people are forgetful souls at heart, and always make a written note of important information. Susato: ...Just keeping the ticket itself safe would be more sensible, I think. Sholmes: And what, pray, happened next, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: When the day of the draw came round... ...I'd forgotten which book I'd written the number in and had to turn my room upside-down to find it! Sholmes: That's it! For people are forgetful souls at heart, and always forget where they've noted things down! Susato: Not if you always note things in the same place... Ryunosuke: I actually won the second prize, you know. But I couldn't remember which magazine I'd slipped the ticket into, so I had to turn my room upside- Sholmes: Thank you, Mr Naruhodo, but I believe I've proved my point now. Which is that a very similar scenario has clearly unfolded in this room. Ryunosuke: Finding himself requiring access to the safe, the occupant of this room needed the combination code. He remembered that he'd written it on the underside of a piece of furniture, but forgot which one. Sholmes: ...Leading to the state in which we now find the room. Yes, Mr Drebber overturned all the furniture in here... ...in a desperate hurry to locate the combination code that would unlock the safe! Topic 1 Flipped Furniture Conclusion Because gravity was reversed To find the safe combination Solved Topic 2 Missing Engineer Conclusion Escaped via the skylight Sholmes: Now, let us consider the next conundrum: What was our engineer friend's aim? Indubitably, the greatest clue we have to explain his actions...is above our heads. Susato: Yes, how is it possible that there are footprints all the way up there on the ceiling? Sholmes: A question whose answer will lead us neatly to the truth, my dear madam. The reason there are footprints on the ceiling...is because of the nearby skylight! Susato: Well, if a change in the direction of gravity can't explain it, then how did those footprints get there? Ryunosuke: Yes, I feel as though that particular mystery has just become even harder to solve. Susato: I can't think of any other way to explain it at all. Ooh... Life was so much simpler in those halcyon days when gravity could be reversed. Ryunosuke: It was minutes ago. And those 'halcyon days' never existed in the first place. Susato: Well, I suppose we must simply put our faith in Mr Sholmes and observe the area in more detail. Ryunosuke: (...Putting our faith in Mr Sholmes is what gets us into these situations in the first place...) The reason there are footprints on the ceiling...is because of the nearby skylight! Ryunosuke: Those footprints up there on the ceiling really are a puzzle. Susato: And as they're so close to the skylight... ...it really is very hard to believe the two are unrelated. Ryunosuke: But perhaps we need to approach this from a different angle... Ryunosuke: The reason there are footprints on the ceiling...is because of the nearby shoe! Sholmes: And on closer inspection, there are clearly footprints all over the balloon as well. In other words, the aim was never the skylight at all, but the balloon. Susato: But...for what purpose? Sholmes: A green balloon... Hmmm, that seems somewhat familiar data. Ryunosuke: Ah! Susato: It was a piece of a green balloon's envelope that Mr Naruhodo and Iris found at the scene! Ryunosuke: And inside the green balloon that Master Gotts claims he saw above the stage when the incident occurred... ...was the second birdcage. The crux of the whole instantaneous kinesis deception... Susato: You, you mean to say...? Sholmes: If we assume the balloon in here is a model of the one used on the day... ...there is a strong possibility something may be concealed inside it. Something our absconder was desperate to retrieve before making a hasty getaway. Ryunosuke: But, but the balloon's out of reach! Sholmes: Hence why he resorted to a projectile. Namely...the shoe. Ryunosuke: Ah! Sholmes: Most probably, Drebber intended to tear a hole in the envelope by assailing it with the shoe. However, his efforts were thwarted when the shoe itself became a prisoner of those lofty heights. Susato: Oh, dear... We desperately need to examine that balloon. If only there were some way we could see inside... Sholmes: You may recall that I found this in the room earlier, which I believe offers a solution. Susato: Oh! The rope... Sholmes: To reach the intended destination, what better tool than this rope? Susato: ...Mr Sholmes has managed to bring the deduction back to the rope! Ryunosuke: Alright, I have to admit...that was clever. So we just throw the rope up to the balloon and then pull it down to us on the ground? Susato: ...Which is much easier said than done, I feel. And could take us a very long time as well. Ryunosuke: True. Perhaps we need a more surefire method. In fact, we already have one of course, don't we?! To reach the intended destination, what better tool than this rope? Ryunosuke: Oh, look! The hotheaded Mr Sholmes is trying to lasso the balloon! Susato: It would be wonderful if he succeeded. Then we could pull it down to us. But it would be even more wonderful if there were some better way. Ryunosuke: (And we need to think of it fast, before Mr Sholmes starts tiring of being a cowboy...) Ryunosuke: To reach the intended destination, what better tool than this crossbow? Susato: That was found at the scene, in fact! Ryunosuke: And in all likelihood, belongs to Mr Drebber. Sholmes: If the man had only brought it away with him that day... ...he could have avoided losing a shoe at such a critical time as this. Sholmes: So...shall we? Your curiosity is deeply stirred no doubt, my dear fellows. What is it that Enoch Drebber has hidden inside that balloon...? *BAM* Susato: Aaaaaah! Ryunosuke: W-What the...? A, a waxwork? Sholmes: Indeed it is. A waxwork head inside a metal mask. A mask that is shut tight and fastened with a strong and quite impenetrable lock. Ryunosuke: (So we can't see the face inside, that means.) Susato: Just a moment... This...this is the head of a waxwork model? Does that mean...? Oh goodness! Sholmes: I see you've joined the dots, Miss Susato. Excellent. Ryunosuke: Ah! (Of course! A headless waxwork model!) The case of the abducted Madame Tusspells model that you'd 'largely' solved... It was only the head of the killer that was still missing! Sholmes: Indeed it was. But I believe Madame Tusspells will now have to settle her sizeable account with me. This, as you have now surmised, is the head of the infamous Professor. Ryunosuke: Yes... Susato: But why is it here? Sholmes: ...This conclusively confirms my suspicions. The man responsible for stealing the Professor from Madame Tusspells... ...and returning it - sans tête - earlier today...was none other than Enoch Drebber! Ryunosuke: (This is incredible. Professor Harebrayne's case and the waxwork abduction are... They're inextricably linked! By Enoch Drebber's workshop!) The waxwork head has been entered into the Court Record. Sholmes: Well...it appears our logical pleasure cruise has come to an end, my dear fellows. All that remains is... Yes, to speak with the architect of this adventure. Susato: The architect? Ryunosuke: You mean...Mr Drebber? Sholmes: As it seems quite impossible that he escaped via one of the skylights... ...obviously the man must still be here in the room. Susato: WHAT?! Sholmes: And his location should be abundantly clear... ...if you simply reflect on the journey we've made together during this deduction. Ryunosuke: (Enoch Drebber is right here, somewhere in this room?) Sholmes: So, Mr Naruhodo, will you do the honours? Ryunosuke: ...Yes, of course. Mr Drebber's hiding place must be the... Mr Drebber's hiding place must be the... Susato: Where could Mr Drebber be hiding? I'm sure that we've already come across a clue that reveals the answer, you know. Ryunosuke: (Yes, it was when we deduced why all the furniture in here was upside-down, wasn't it? That gave us the answer, I'm sure.) Susato: We're very close now, Mr Naruhodo! I can sense it! Ryunosuke: Before we gained access to this back room, we heard noises from in here. Sholmes: Which tells us that the engineer was still in the building at that point in time. Ryunosuke: He was in fact searching for the combination to his safe. Sholmes: And pressed for time, made no attempt to right the furniture that he overturned in the process. From which we can deduce that his search for the combination happened very recently indeed. In summary...Mr Enoch Drebber... ...is, at this very moment, inside the safe! Thus concludes Herlock Sholmes's great deduction...of this topsy-turvy puzzle! Topic 2 Missing Engineer Conclusion Escaped via the skylight Inside the safe Solved Deduction CompleteElementary! Sholmes: So...Mr Naruhodo. I think perhaps it's time we ended this game of hide-and-seek, don't you? Ryunosuke: By opening the safe, you mean? Sholmes: What else? Ryunosuke: Let's see... The combination was one... Susato: Four three two five eight two. Ryunosuke: I knew that! (Alright then. Here goes...) You found me... Gregson: Right then, sir... Mr Enoch Drebber, I presume? Drebber: Correct. Ryunosuke: You'd better start talking! You tricked Professor Harebrayne with that bogus machine you built! Susato: And you shall have to explain the theft of the waxwork from Madame Tusspells as well! Drebber: Whilst I would be delighted to answer your many questions... ...personally, I would advise that you deactivate my little parcel first. Ryunosuke: Deactivate...? Susato: Your parcel...? Drebber: I refer of course... ...to the time bomb. I left it in a most prominent position. Susato: Ah! Drebber: Ha-ha-ha. I see. Stunned silence. You're all gearing up to die with me then? Susato: Nooooooo! Susato: Mr Sholmes! With only seven seconds to spare! Ryunosuke: That was too close for comfort! I've got one foot in the grave already! Gregson: Are you tryin' to help us get a killer, or get us killed?! Susato: Mr Sholmes's deductions can be...completely life-altering, can't they? Sholmes: Well, my dear fellows, that was a close shave. The resemblance to an anti-gravity device is really quite startling, I must say. Susato: Anti-gravity devices don't exist! Ryunosuke: (Whew, I wouldn't push it, Mr Sholmes...) After clearing all Converse options: Ryunosuke: I think we have a fairly good idea of what's been going on here now. But what about the two incidents you've evidently been involved in recently? Drebber: ......... Ryunosuke: Professor Harebrayne's instantaneous kinesis experiment at the Great Exhibition... ...and the waxwork model you stole, which this head belongs to. Drebber: That's no ordinary head, you know. That's the head...of the Professor. Clad in a mask with a lock so strong, I'm unable to open it safely to reveal the killer's identity. I've been considering carrying it around as...protection. After all- ???: That's enough! Sithe: What's going on here, Gregson? I'm sure you're aware that I have sole jurisdiction to investigate here. Gregson: Ah, um... Yes, well... Ryunosuke: (Dr Sithe again. So the Forensic Investigation Team are here...) Sithe: And you know full well this engineer is a key witness. Why are you allowing this lawyer access to him? If Lord Stronghart knew of this, you'd be finished. Gregson: ......... Sithe: You lot. Leave at once. Sholmes: My dear madam, there's no need for such a threatening tone, I assure you. After all, that's no way to greet an old acquaintance, is it, Dr Sithe? Sithe: Hello...Sholmes. Ryunosuke: (Mr Sholmes knows Dr Sithe?) Sholmes: If it's protecting the machine next door that's causing such a sour expression on your face, you are quite misguided. It's really nothing more than a shell, you- Sithe: Get out! Sholmes: But of course. We'll show ourselves the door. ...I see you haven't softened at all. Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: Yes? Sholmes: It would appear that our delightfully entertaining investigations have run their course for today. Ryunosuke: But, but Mr Sholmes...! Sholmes: Let us leave this place in the doctor's capable hands. Ryunosuke: ...! Sithe: I said get out! Now! All of you! Your presence here is not required either, Gregson. Gregson: ......... Understood. But I'll just say one thing before I head off: If it wasn't for this lawyer an' his companions... ...we'd never have found this place. And the whole workshop would've been blown to bits. There was a time bomb set in here that this lot disarmed. Ryunosuke: Inspector... Sithe: ......... Drebber: Kuh kuh kuh... Gregson: ...! Somethin' given you a chuckle, has it, Drebber? Drebber: Ah, so sorry. Didn't mean to offend. You're quite right of course. You did disarm the time bomb, didn't you? Yes... You did disarm that one. Gina: Eh? Wot are you...? 'That' one? Ya, ya mean...? Drebber: Kuh kuh kuh... It was an hour later that we heard the news. Of the enormous explosion that ripped through the experimentation stage at the Great Exhibition. Professor Harebrayne's invention and all its secrets...were blown away forever. To be continued... Enoch Drebber's Workshop (before examining Herlock Sholmes or timer device in Mr Drebber's Back Room)\nThe Return of the Great Departed Soul TranscriptPart 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 424th October, 9:11 a.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' AntechamberHarebrayne: Good morning to you, Mr Naruhodo!Ryunosuke: Ah, good morning, Professor. Ready for today's proceedings?Harebrayne: ......... I hope so... I should be... Even I, with nothing left to-Sholmes:Good morning, my dear fellows!Ryunosuke: Oh, Mr Sholmes! You're here!Sholmes: Why, naturally! A true gentleman stands shoulder to shoulder with his friends in battle at all times!Ryunosuke: Thank you. I really appreciate it. ...I'll...see you later, then. Now, Professor... We really need you to remain calm in the courtroom today.Susato: Yes. Do try your hardest not to enter the witness stand uninvited again.Harebrayne: Yes! I will! I, I realise it was a mistake, but I-Sholmes:My dear fellows, I must interject!Ryunosuke: Oh...you're still here, Mr Sholmes. What's the matter?Sholmes: Surely you've overlooked some praise, have you not? To be cast in my direction, hm?Ryunosuke: Sorry? I don't follow.Sholmes: Must I spell it out? I, the great Herlock Sholmes... The greatest detective, of worldwide acclamation... ...arose at some ungodly hour to be here now! First thing in the morning! A miracle, you must agree!Ryunosuke: Well...if I must agree, then...Sholmes: As you know, my sleep is quite impregnable. Iris had to employ her full gamut of tactics: She pulled the covers off, shook me, poked both cheeks, punched me and kicked me from the bed. Then she poured a boiling cup of her latest experimental blend on my face and at last I was bestirred!Susato: Oh my... Iris has been busy.Ryunosuke: Iris doesn't have it in her to go that far. She's too nice.Harebrayne: Ah, I sense the spirit of a fellow scientist! One who relishes the infinite possibilities of blending tea!Sholmes: I'm the one worthy of praise here! Not Iris! This is my victory!???:Sorry to cut in...Ryunosuke: Oh, Inspector Gregson! Good morning!Sholmes: Gregson, my dear fellow, why the grim expression at this delightfully early hour?Gregson: Oh, I don't know. Maybe because I've been confronted with a grimmer expression, eh?Sholmes: Dear me... Are you going to take that insult lying down, Professor?Harebrayne: Wha...? WHAT...? I DOOON'T KNOOOW!Ryunosuke: (Poor Professor...)Gregson: Anyway, here's the paperwork you asked for.Ryunosuke: What paperwork?Sholmes: Ah, I took the liberty of requesting it yesterday. I have a feeling it may prove useful.Gregson: You wouldn't believe the hoops I had to jump through to get this brought out of the archives. It's the Professor's autopsy report.Susato: That... That mass murderer's?!Ryunosuke: (Who killed five members of the aristocracy...)Gregson: He was found guilty in a closed trial ten years ago now. It was all done under wraps. And he was quickly executed soon after the trial. ...It's all in here.The killer's autopsy report has been entered into the Court Record.Ryunosuke: I, I don't know what to say! Thank you, Inspector!Sholmes: Yes, much obliged, Gregson.Gregson: Us lowly lot at the Yard are just doing what we can...in the shadow of the great detective Sholmes, of course.Ryunosuke: Well then, Professor Harebrayne...this is it! Today we're going to lay all this to rest at last.Susato: I wish you the best of luck, Professor!Harebrayne: ......... I suppose...he'll be in there today, will he? Drebber...Susato: Yes. We expect the prosecution to summon him as a witness.Harebrayne: I'm still amazed that you managed to find him in just one day... I really owe you both so much!Bailiff: Counsel! And the defendant! The trial is about to resume. Kindly make your way into the courtroom at once!Ryunosuke: (This is it then. The final chapter. Funny. My heart's racing a little... I've not felt this before, actually. This strange foreboding... As if...something's going to happen in this trial that I'm not ready for. But I can't let that distract me from the only thing that really matters... Finding the truth!)24th October, 9:30 a.m. The Old Bailey CourtroomJudge: In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session again. We resume the public hearing of Albert Harebrayne, here present, who stands accused of murder. Are the counsels for the prosecution and defence ready to proceed?Van Zieks: The prosecution is ready, My Lord.Ryunosuke: ......... The defence is ready, My Lord. (As promised, Lord van Zieks has his apprentice with him. His apprentice with memory loss...)Susato: .........Judge: If I may, Lord van Zieks...Van Zieks: Yes, My Lord?Judge: There appears to be someone standing at your side...Van Zieks: Ah, yes. My apprentice and assistant. The prosecution believes today's proceedings will see the complexity of this case rise considerably. I therefore instructed my assistant to attend to ensure the smooth running of the trial.Ryunosuke: (And the smooth running of liquid refreshments, by the look of it...)Susato: The way he holds himself... The way he moves... It couldn't be anyone else...Ryunosuke: But he's still suffering from amnesia...so there's really nothing we can do at the moment.Susato: I know, but... Oh, this is so very hard.Judge: It would appear the prosecution has done a fine job in responding to the demands of the court made yesterday. I understand you have successfully secured the engineer who disappeared from the scene on the day in question.Van Zieks: ...Yes, My Lord. I intend to call him as a witness shortly.Judge: Very good, very good. Now then, ladies and gentlemen of the jury... ...who have been chosen at random to represent the will of the people in this courtroom today... ...are you ready and willing to proceed?Juror No. 1: Of course, My Lord. I'm sure we all understand the importance of doing our civic duty.Juror No. 2: I do so despise deception and deceit. I find it so very wearing...Juror No. 3: To take a man's life with a conjuring trick... It is against the magician's code, not to mention the law.Juror No. 4: Any fake scientists should feel the wrath of God, if you ask me!Juror No. 5: Um, we 'ave to listen to what's said on both sides 'the fence, and um...then settle on one... That's it, isn't it?Juror No. 6: Wasn't like this in my day. Wasn't like this at all...Judge: If all parties are ready to proceed, you may begin, Lord van Zieks.Van Zieks: Before I do, My Lord, there is a report I must read to the court. Yesterday at the Great Exhibition grounds, the evidence of primary importance in this case... ...the super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis machine, which was installed on the experimentation stage... ...was deliberately destroyed in an explosion effected by an unknown person or persons.Juror No. 1: It was...WHAT?!Juror No. 6: An explosion?!Juror No. 4: This...is an outrage!Judge: Yes, I heard this grave news yesterday. Scotland Yard submitted a report to my office in the evening. I read that the machine was blasted to smithers, and the wreckage reduced to ashes in the flames.Van Zieks: I have here a photographic print of the scene, taken in the wake of the explosion. It shows what little remains of the machine.Judge: Hm, yes... A terrible business...Ryunosuke: (He did it to destroy the evidence, did he?)Susato: That Enoch Drebber...Judge: The court will take this print as evidence, Counsel.The post-explosion photograph has been entered into the Court Record.Van Zieks: Late yesterday afternoon... ...the protection afforded to the machine by the Special Dispensation for Scientific Equipment Act was revoked. However, before a thorough investigation could begin, the invention was obliterated from existence. As such...this will become a very different trial.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: As it stands now, with no evidence on which to draw meaningful conclusions... ...the authenticity of the kinesis machine will remain forever in obscurity.Judge: Hm, indeed... A most unfortunate state of affairs.Van Zieks: However, one thing remains clear: The victim's death was the result of the actions of the accused. Of that we can be certain. For it was the accused himself who was operating the machine and who ultimately caused its loss of control.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: As Lord van Zieks rightly says, this is a very different trial now.Van Zieks: ...!Ryunosuke: The accused accepts responsibility for his part in the events that transpired. He acknowledges that Mr Asman died as a result of the accident caused by his machine's malfunction. However, unbeknownst to the professor... ...he was being deliberately deceived by a pair of very clever fraudsters.Judge: Names, Counsel, if you please.Ryunosuke: The engineer, Mr Enoch Drebber, and the victim himself, Mr Odie Asman.Van Zieks: .........Ryunosuke: So what exactly were these two men up to behind the defendant's back?! The defence intends to expose that information, thus establishing the unequivocal innocence of the defendant!Judge: Thank you, Counsels. The positions of the prosecution and defence have been clearly stated. Lord van Zieks, summon your first witness, please.Van Zieks: At once, My Lord. The prosecution calls the engineer, Mr Enoch Drebber, to the stand!Van Zieks: State your name and occupation for the court.Drebber: Name...Enoch Drebber. Occupation... ...hard to pin down, I would say.See that black monocle?Yes, why do I feel as though I've seen it somewhere before...?Oh! You, too? I had exactly the same feeling myself.Hm...Drebber: .........Judge: Your file indicates that you are currently being investigated in connection with another case. The theft...of a waxwork model, is it? A most extraordinary-sounding business.Drebber: ...But that has no bearing on this trial, I assure you. Cleave it from your mind.Van Zieks: You're familiar with the public experiment carried out at the Great Exhibition some days ago? The accused's super-high-voltage instantaneous kinesis demonstration.Drebber: Yes...you could say that. I am aware of it. There was a terrible accident, wasn't there?Van Zieks: It was you, Mr Drebber, who constructed the vast machine used in the experiment. Or so our investigations indicate. Can you confirm your involvement?Drebber: Yes, I constructed it. In precise accordance with the blueprints. But that's all.Van Zieks: Then the court would be very interested to hear your thoughts about the machine, I'm sure.Drebber: ......... An amazing device, if you ask me. The pinnacle of modern science, making instantaneous kinesis a reality at last.Ryunosuke: What?Judge: Good... Good gracious! Do you mean to say... ...that the experiment was bona fide? Is that your belief, sir?Drebber: Yes, that is very much my belief. Such a waste that it blew up.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: But we've already established the machine was nothing more than a prop for an elaborate conjuring trick!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: You've established nothing of the sort.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: All that was shown during yesterday's proceedings... ...is that the same outcome could have been produced by means of stage trickery. The defence merely proposed a method and demonstrated its feasibility, nothing more.Ryunosuke: But...but...Judge: We've procrastinated long enough, I feel. Witness, you will now give your formal testimony... ...about the machine that you constructed for the purpose of the demonstration at the Great Exhibition.Drebber: ...Understood.Witness Testimony - The Kinesis Machine -Drebber: I met the young professor approximately one year ago, through Mr Asman's introduction. He provided me with the blueprints and I constructed the machine to his precise specifications. It was no trick. If the whole show was a fraud, it would have required a body double. Tell me...did the victim have a twin? All the spectators saw the birdcage appear above their heads and then crash headfirst into the Crystal Tower. A terrible accident, I grant you. Perhaps the science on which the machine was built was flawed somehow?Ryunosuke: A, a body double?!Drebber: That goes without saying, surely? To give the impression that something has moved when in reality it hasn't. It's a basic conjuring principle. The deception cannot be achieved without substituting the original with a fake at some point in the performance. But would I be right in saying...you haven't managed to establish anything along those lines?Ryunosuke: Ugh...Van Zieks: Incidentally... ...the prosecution has already confirmed that Mr Asman had no twin siblings.Judge: Hmmm... It's my understanding that this witness is well-versed in conjuring artfulness. But such talents do not indicate that he was actually able to accomplish what he claims. Namely the construction of what, by all accounts, must have been an extremely complex scientific machine.Drebber: ...Whatever do you mean?Judge: Yesterday's proceedings brought the true nature of your past exploits to light, Mr Drebber.Ryunosuke: Indeed it did, My Lord! As a swindler who preys on innocent scientists to elicit government grant money through conjuring know-how.Drebber: ...Yes, it's true that I possess considerable knowledge of stage magic. But crucially, my scientific knowledge more than matches that of any academic in the field.Van Zieks: Investigation of the witness's workshop attests to that claim, My Lord. As evidence, the police found this Royal Society trophy for young talent in science there.Susato: Yes, that's true. We spotted it there ourselves!Drebber: If a hypothesis is sound, it can always be forged into a physical manifestation...with sufficient skill. Though I may have sold the secrets of some deceptive wiles to snivelling, talentless scientists in the past.Judge: Would, would you therefore assert...that the explosion of the machine was...Drebber: An unfortunate accident. ...Or, of course, a deliberate act of murder carried out by misuse of the science.Judge: Counsel for the Defence...your cross-examination, please!Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord!Cross-Examination - The Kinesis Machine -Drebber: I met the young professor approximately one year ago, through Mr Asman's introduction.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So you were already acquainted with Mr Asman himself? Drebber: Not really. By chance, I'd seen his name mentioned in the papers, that's all. But I had no interest in his private affairs. If he was an unscrupulous investor, it was no concern of mine. As long as people pay their bills, I take up my tools and construct what they ask for. Ryunosuke: So why did Mr Asman approach you in particular, then? Drebber: Who can say? I presume because my name is associated with excellence in engineering. Ryunosuke: ...Not to mention excellence in fraud. Drebber: Hard to gauge. But the point is, all I did was construct the machine according to the blueprints I was given. Van Zieks: In other words, the kinesis machine was built on solid scientific principles. Drebber: Yes, you might say that. Professor Harebrayne certainly has a mind like no other.Drebber: He provided me with the blueprints and I constructed the machine to his precise specifications. It was no trick.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: It's clear that you have both scientific knowledge and knowledge of conjuring magic, however. Drebber: The more knowledge you have, the better equipped you are to handle whatever comes along. But your implication is that I furnished the machine with some trickery, I think. Ryunosuke: It's a possibility that we have to explore. Drebber: Unfortunately though, the machine has been blown to kingdom come. So there's really nothing left to explore...is there? Van Zieks: It appears that the kinesis machine was fitted with a timed explosive device of some kind. Drebber: And there's nothing left of that device either. Not a single shred of evidence remaining...I hear. Ryunosuke: (He must have planned all this from the outset.) Drebber: But in any case, it's abundantly clear that the experiment couldn't have been a trick.Drebber: If the whole show was a fraud, it would have required a body double. Tell me...did the victim have a twin?Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Of course! That's it! Mr Asman was a twin! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: Perhaps my learned friend wasn't listening earlier. ...Mr Asman had no twin siblings. Ryunosuke: No, I heard you before. ...But the thread of hope hadn't quite left me. Susato: The demonstration could have been a trick, if there was somebody who looked sufficiently like the victim. But Dr Sithe absolutely ruled that out as a possibility. Van Zieks: It is beyond question that the victim himself, Mr Asman, did move from the stage to the Crystal Tower. The fingerprints found at the scene attest to the fact. Susato: So it can't have been orchestrated using someone who looked identical to Mr Asman then. Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: What are you thinking, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Oh! No...nothing. Just that the idea of someone who looked identical to the victim is playing on my mind...Drebber: All the spectators saw the birdcage appear above their heads and then crash headfirst into the Crystal Tower.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: It crashed 'headfirst', you say? Drebber: According to the many witness reports from those there at the time, yes. Ryunosuke: Were you not there at the exhibition grounds on the day? Drebber: Hm...unlikely. I rarely leave my workshop. Ryunosuke: Yet another of your unique inventions was found at the scene. Drebber: ......... Well...it was the unveiling of a machine I'd laboured over for many months. I saw it clearly with my own eyes. The birdcage plummeted headfirst into the tower. Ryunosuke: What a surprise... Drebber: I believe the victim's neck was broken from the headlong fall, wasn't it? Ryunosuke: How would you have come by that information? Drebber: Even an infernal recluse like me reads the newspapers, you know. According to the reports, two injuries were apparent on the victim's body. Ryunosuke: Yes, he'd been stabbed in the chest by a screwdriver believed to belong to the defendant... ...and he had broken vertebrae as a result of a fall from a considerable height. Van Zieks: ...Correct. My learned friend has been doing his research, it seems. Ryunosuke: Do we know which injury was the fatal one? Van Zieks: Sadly not. Forensic science is not yet at a level where such things can be determined. Judge: Hm... Van Zieks: What we do know is that the victim died having sustained both injuries at some point during the experiment. And since he was found in the birdcage with his neck broken... Drebber: ...It's obvious that he fell from a considerable height. Ryunosuke: (Hm... I suppose that's hard to deny...)Present Wooden 'Birdcage' (after examining hole in cage or cracked wood) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: We've examined the birdcage that crashed into the Crystal Tower ourselves. As you can see, the cage, which is a wooden construction, has sustained damage in one particular spot. Van Zieks: Following the explosion, it fell some thirty feet into the glass of the Crystal Tower. That level of damage is to be expected, surely. Ryunosuke: I agree. The damage itself is entirely understandable. What doesn't make sense... ...is the location of that damage. Drebber: ...! Ryunosuke: All the breakages in the wood are at the base of the birdcage, not the top! Drebber: What are you saying?! Judge: That's the opposite of where they should be! Ryunosuke: That's right, My Lord. The birdcage that was at the scene is damaged at its base. So we have reports of the birdcage falling headlong into the Crystal Tower, yet the damage is at the bottom. The only way to reconcile these two facts is to accept... ...that there were two birdcages in play that day, which were at some point switched! Switched during what wasn't a scientific experiment at all...but an elaborate piece of stage trickery! Drebber: Gaaaaaaa...gh! Judge: Good gracious! Explain yourself, witness! Drebber: I...well... Van Zieks: If we examine the facts, there's only one logical conclusion we can draw. The damage on the base of the birdcage clearly indicates that it crashed tailfirst into the tower. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But multiple witness reports claim it fell headfirst! Van Zieks: The birdcage materialised in the sky next to a balloon flying over the stage, following a spontaneous explosion. At an altitude of some sixty feet above ground level. Susato: Which is approximately eighteen metres. Van Zieks: It then proceeded to fall some thirty feet into the Crystal Tower in the ensuing deflagration. Witness reports amid such chaos...are notoriously unreliable. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But the victim's neck was broken! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: He plummeted thirty feet inside a heavy, wooden cage. However he fell, it would be unsurprising to find one or two of his vertebrae crushed. Drebber: ......... Kuh kuh kuh kuh kuh... A riveting scientific analysis of events from the prosecution there. Though to be even more rigorous, you would have to say it was only one vertebra, actually. Ryunosuke: ...! (He wasn't quiet for long...) Susato: I find it hard to see what's motivating Lord van Zieks. This witness is clearly a swindler, and one who deceived a personal friend of his. Ryunosuke: ......... 'If you're going to establish this deception, do it right.' Susato: Sorry? Ryunosuke: I feel like that's the undertone here. Drebber: Ah yes, and there's one more point the defence appears to have forgotten. It obviously wasn't a trick...as a certain truth very plainly demonstrates. Ryunosuke: What?! Judge: It seems to me that the cross-examination had better continue until we resolve this matter. Mr Drebber, you will amend your testimony with details of this 'truth'. Drebber: Of course. We must treat the matter scientifically, after all. Ryunosuke: (Agh, I nearly had him there...) Drebber: ......... Changes statement from \"All the spectators saw the birdcage appear above their heads and then crash headfirst into the Crystal Tower.\" to \"The kinesis clearly took place, because there's nowhere else thirty feet high for the birdcage to have fallen from.\"Drebber: The kinesis clearly took place, because there's nowhere else thirty feet high for the birdcage to have fallen from.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What do you mean? Drebber: Well, before the demonstration began, the victim was alive on stage in front of the audience. Ryunosuke: Yes...there are lots of witnesses who saw Mr Asman on the experimentation stage, that's true. Drebber: And the victim's neck broke as a result of an impact following a fall. Logically, therefore, the victim must have fallen from somewhere. Van Zieks: The balloon that exploded was at an altitude of sixty feet. The point of impact on the tower was thirty feet up. That difference of thirty feet is therefore the total distance the birdcage fell. Drebber: And there's no other location from which the cage could have fallen that distance if it didn't drop out of the sky. Ergo... ...the victim himself must have been beamed from the stage into the sky above the Crystal Tower. Judge: Hmmmmmm... A trenchant, scientific analysis. Dear me, every time I hear it explained, it sounds increasingly plausible. Drebber: Oh yes. It's all very well thought out. Susato: Certainly all the spectators on the day saw it. The birdcage plummeting thirty feet through the air, I mean. Ryunosuke: (Irritatingly, yes...)Present Experiment Sketch Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"This is a diagram of the experimentation stage and its surroundings.\"Drebber: A terrible accident, I grant you. Perhaps the science on which the machine was built was flawed somehow?Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So you understood the science, did you? Drebber: Not in the slightest. Ryunosuke: Oh! Right... Drebber: As I've said a number of times, I'm an engineer. My job is to manufacture according to the blueprints I'm given. I would be inviting manifold problems if I foolishly allowed my brain to digest the ideas behind them. I could be accused of stealing those ideas, for example. Ryunosuke: But how is it possible to construct a machine without really understanding the principles it relies on? Drebber: Well, you're practising law without really understanding the principles it relies on, aren't you? Ryunosuke: ......... A very good point. Susato: Stand up for yourself, Mr Naruhodo! Van Zieks: The point is, the experiment resulted in instantaneous kinesis taking place. As such, the science must be sound. Drebber: Yes. And really, experimental results are all that matters when it comes to proving a hypothesis.Ryunosuke: (He's certainly very sure of himself...)Susato: What do you think, Mr Naruhodo?Ryunosuke: Well, now that the machine has been completely destroyed by yesterday's explosion... ...it's going to be impossible to argue its authenticity one way or the other.Susato: But if we're unable to establish that it was a piece of stage trickery rather than genuine science... ...we will have no grounds on which to demonstrate Professor Harebrayne's innocence.Ryunosuke: Both Mr Asman and this man in the stand tricked the professor and used him. They took advantage of his naivety and his unbending belief in his work...and I won't let them get away with it! (And seeing as the professor is an old friend of Lord van Zieks... ...what on earth must he be feeling towards Drebber?)Ryunosuke: This is a diagram of the experimentation stage and its surroundings.Drebber: .........Ryunosuke: We know that somehow, the birdcage appeared in mid-air before falling down into the Crystal Tower. A fall of about thirty feet...or nine metres. However, if you examine the diagram carefully... ...you'll see that there is one other possible location from which the birdcage could have fallen... ...the same distance of thirty feet.Van Zieks: No!Drebber: .........Judge: Well, it appears the defence has a possible explanation to put forward. Go ahead, Counsel.Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord. Of course.Judge: You will indicate the place to which you are referring on this same diagram. The alternative location from which the birdcage could possibly have fallen the requisite thirty feet!Present experimentation stage Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The place I'm referring to...is here!\"Present anywhere else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: If it had fallen from here, the birdcage would have plummeted the same thirty-foot distance! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: If that's my learned friend's claim, I suggest he demonstrates for the court...personally. Ryunosuke: Huh? Judge: And you may consider this a parting gift, Counsel. Ryunosuke: (Ugh... I feel like I've just hit the deck from thirty feet up anyway now...) Judge: Don't give me recourse to make the next fall from sixty feet up, hm? Leads back to: \"You will indicate the place to which you are referring on this same diagram.\"Ryunosuke: The place I'm referring to...is here!Judge: But that's... ...where the birdcage would have been to begin with!Ryunosuke: Which is exactly the point, My Lord. Yes, the birdcage was in the machine on the stage. But what we must also consider, is the height of the stage itself.Judge: Go on, Counsel.Ryunosuke: It turns out that the experimentation stage was built at a considerable height above ground level. If you look at the diagram, in fact... ...you'll see it's at about the same height above the ground as the balloon was above the crash site.Van Zieks: ...!Ryunosuke: When the experiment got underway, the machine and the birdcage were engulfed in steam. At that moment, the floor of the stage gave way and, if we assume there to be a void underneath... ...this birdcage and the one seen by the audience would have fallen almost exactly the same distance! Once again, My Lord... ...this all points to the fact that there was not one birdcage, but two!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: My learned friend...has no evidence that the stage had such a contrivance in its design!Ryunosuke: Someone is responsible for the criminal destruction of the kinesis machine itself, it's true. However, the stage still stands. And take a moment to look at the photographic print of the scene following yesterday's explosion.Judge: Good Lord! The metal grille that formed the floor of the machine is undone!Ryunosuke: Yes, most likely blown open by the force of the explosion that destroyed the rest of the machine. The defence calls for the space below the stage to be investigated...immediately! Mr Drebber!Drebber: ...!Ryunosuke: It was you who built the kinesis machine. Which means that it was you who built the two birdcages that were used to carry out this deception.Drebber: Uh...ughhh...Ryunosuke: Whether Professor Harebrayne's hypothesis is sound or not makes no difference. Because it's the construction of this machine that matters. A machine designed to take Mr Asman's life... ...and lay the blame firmly at the professor's door. Something that could only have been carried out... ...by you, Mr Enoch Drebber!Drebber: Grrr... UWAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: If my learned friend has reached the end of his wild assertions... ...the prosecution would like to crush the defence's argument slowly...but surely.Ryunosuke: Wha...?Van Zieks: Your argument fails to hold water... ...on two counts.Ryunosuke: Two?!Van Zieks: Firstly... ...before and after the experiment, this witness went nowhere near the kinesis machine. Every relevant member of staff from the exhibition has attested to that.Judge: And I believe members of Scotland Yard have also been on watch duty at every public experiment.Van Zieks: In other words, Mr Drebber had no opportunity to switch the alleged pair of birdcages.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: But I've already explained why he wouldn't have needed to!Van Zieks: The nonsense with the crossbow? That doesn't bolster your case at all. The man who disappeared from the stage and the man who crashed into the tower are one and the same. The Forensic Investigation Team's report is unequivocal on that point!Ryunosuke: Agh!Van Zieks: And the second flaw in your assertion... ...is a distinct lack of motive. Why would this man have wanted to take the victim's life? He had no reason to do so.Ryunosuke: A...a motive...? (Do I have to think of everything myself?)Van Zieks: I have here a contract provided by the witness.Judge: What contract is this, Lord van Zieks?Van Zieks: The contract into which Mr Drebber entered with the victim, Mr Asman. It reads: 'Mr Drebber is to receive thirty percent of all remunerations from government grants or other income.'Judge: Thirty percent? Certainly very favourable contractual conditions.Drebber: But there was one very important provision bolted onto that clause.Ryunosuke: What provision?Van Zieks: 'Mr Drebber may only uphold this right on condition that both contracting parties are alive.'Drebber: In other words, if either of us were to die, the contract would become null and void. So you see, I had nothing to gain from Mr Asman's death. The diametric opposite, in fact.Ryunosuke: Ugh...Van Zieks: Need I say more? The witness had neither an opportunity nor a reason to commit the alleged crime. In short, the possibility of Mr Drebber having done as you suggest...is nil.Ryunosuke: Ugh... UWAAAAAAAAAH!Judge: Hm... It seems the defence's assertion was somewhat wide of the mark. Lord van Zieks...you will submit the contract as evidence, please.Drebber's contract has been entered into the Court Record.Ryunosuke: (It's true... If Drebber had no opportunity to switch the birdcage under the stage with the one in the Crystal Tower... ...he couldn't have done it. And in any case, I have no idea what his motive might have been!)Susato: There is one aspect of your argument... ...that still holds true, however.Ryunosuke: ...!Susato: There were two birdcages. The prosecution is unable to deny that.Ryunosuke: Ah...Susato: So I'm sure you're on the right lines, Mr Naruhodo. And I've no doubt there are other aspects of your assertion that are undeniable truths, too!Ryunosuke: ...!Judge: Well, it would seem... ...that the defence has no rejoinder to offer.Drebber: ......... Kuh kuh kuh... Well, I must say I'm a little surprised. I came here to testify about the machine I built, and instead my reputation is defiled. But the prosecution's counter has set the record straight, I think. It's impossible that I'm the culprit.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: At the beginning of this trial, we believed that there was only one birdcage. Yet now we know there must have been two. In other words, there was more to the demonstration than we realised at first.Drebber: .........Ryunosuke: I think it's abundantly clear that the same applies to the culprit.Van Zieks: Get to the point.Ryunosuke: The stage demonstration... ...was constructed and set up in its entirety by you, Mr Drebber. Therefore it's inconceivable that you had no hand in the events that transpired.Drebber: .........Ryunosuke: So if circumstances mean it's impossible that you could have carried out the crime yourself... ...it points to the fact that someone else was involved.Judge: Someone else? Counsel, are you suggesting...?Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord! Mr Drebber had an accomplice!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: An accomplice now? Well then, I presume... ...you're prepared for what's to come? Now that you're accusing not only this witness, but someone else...of the most serious of crimes.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: If these accusations turn out to be false... ...then make no mistake: The prosecution will demand an equally serious punishment for your slander!Ryunosuke: .........Judge: Well, Counsel? Do you intend to pursue this course, and formally accuse another party of involvement in this matter?Ryunosuke: ......... (What do I do here? At the moment, this is little more than a hunch on my part. I don't know for sure if Drebber had an accomplice, or even if he really is the culprit here...)Drebber: .........Ryunosuke: (One way or another, though, I have to make my position clear. ...As a lawyer. So what's my stance going to be? Did Drebber have an accomplice...or not?)Name the accomplice Leads to: \"The defence is ready to name Mr Drebber's accomplice!\"Back down Ryunosuke: (Let's face it, I have no idea who is accomplice might actually have been. Which isn't the strongest position to be in, is it, Ryunosuke?) Susato: Mr Naruhodo, think of the sword at your side. Karuma is crying out. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Susato: Crying out for you to show the strength of your conviction now as a lawyer. Ryunosuke: ...Yes, you're right. This sword that I inherited, which embodies the will of my best friend... ...is my own accomplice! Susato: I'm not sure that's quite the right word, but...that's the spirit, certainly! Leads to: \"The defence is ready to name Mr Drebber's accomplice!\"Ryunosuke: The defence is ready to name Mr Drebber's accomplice! (Somehow the two birdcages must have been switched. Everything points to that. Yet according to the coroner's report, that's not a possibility. But that inconsistency itself is a clue!)Judge: Counsel...Ryunosuke: Hm? ...My Lord?!Judge: You have received a stark warning already. If you are nevertheless determined... ...then I must now ask you to identify this alleged accomplice by name. So...your answer, please. Who do you claim to have been Mr Drebber's accomplice?Present Courtney Sithe profile Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The name of the person in question is...\"Present anyone else Ryunosuke: Judge: ......... Who is this person? Ryunosuke: Someone intimately related to the crime, My Lord...and someone you surely wouldn't say you don't know! Judge: Yes, thank you, I am aware of the person, obviously. But on what basis do you claim felonious involvement? Ryunosuke: ......... Van Zieks: You surely wouldn't say you don't know...would you? Ryunosuke: Uwaaaaaagh! Susato: I'm sure you simply slipped and pointed to the wrong person, didn't you? There's no other explanation! Judge: No 'slip-ups' this time, please, Counsel. Leads back to: \"Who do you claim to have been Mr Drebber's accomplice?\"Ryunosuke: The name of the person in question is...Van Zieks: What's wrong, my Nipponese friend? Surely fear doesn't bind your tongue now. It's a little late for that.Ryunosuke: (Of course I'm afraid. After all, naming her in this capacity is definitely going to make waves. ...A lot of waves. I could very well turn every single person in this courtroom against me.)Susato: I'm sure it will be alright, Mr Naruhodo.Ryunosuke: ...Thank you, Miss Susato.Susato: The enemy always appears larger than life. But you'll appear exactly the same to the enemy!Ryunosuke: ...Alright then, here goes...Van Zieks: You've kept us waiting long enough. Your answer, Counsel...now.Ryunosuke: The person who colluded with Mr Drebber in order to carry out this wicked crime... ...is Scotland Yard's coroner, Dr Courtney Sithe!Judge: What, what the blazes are you talking about? Dr Sithe?Van Zieks: The head of the Forensic Investigation Team, and the coroner who conducted the autopsy on the victim?!Ryunosuke: We know there were two birdcages. So who could have carried out the switch to complete the illusion? The 'accident' happened in front of a huge crowd of spectators, and the area was immediately sealed off. Then everyone, police officers included, were banished to make way for the Forensic Investigation Team. When else could the switch have occurred? It can only have been in that team's presence.Drebber: .........Ryunosuke: It's essential that the court determines exactly what happened following the incident. The defence demands that Dr Sithe be summoned to the witness stand at once to testify!Juror No. 6: You've got a nerve, lad! Standing up there, dragging the Yard's name through the mud!Ryunosuke: I, I didn't mean to...Juror No. 6: I know the woman veeery well. There's no better dead room worker out there! How dare you call her a criminal?!Van Zieks: My learned friend's imagination appears to be wilder than the East End at night.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: But the recklessness of your accusation aside, there's another grave problem with your argument. One which the prosecution demands you address at once.Ryunosuke: A grave problem?Susato: Oh my word...Van Zieks: Who do you claim acted as the victim's doppelgänger?Ryunosuke: W-What?Judge: Hmmm... Certainly, if the 'birdcage' containing the body of the victim was exchanged for another... ...that cage must also have contained a body.Van Zieks: And yet... ...no missing persons or accidental deaths of anyone even remotely resembling the victim have been reported. Which means there was no one, dead or alive, who could have fulfilled the role of a body double for Mr Asman.Ryunosuke: Ugh... (That's true! If my argument is that there were two birdcages, then there must also have been one person inside each! But I don't know if I've got an answer to this yet, have I? What can I do to reveal how this body double stunt was achieved?)Name someone Ryunosuke: Very well. The defence will address my learned friend's concerns... ...by revealing the identity of the person who acted as Mr Asman's body double! Van Zieks: Be my guest. Give us a name. Ryunosuke: (The body double and the birdcage were hiding inside the balloon that was floating above the stage. Which means that any witnesses would only have seen them from sixty feet away. ...So who was it that appeared out of that explosion some eighteen metres above the spectators...?) ......... Aha! In place of Mr Asman in the second birdcage was... Present anyone Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: This person is the most likely candidate I can think of... wouldn't you agree? Judge: ...I would not. Van Zieks: Would anyone? Susato: I'm sorry, Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: Even you're turning your back on me, Miss Susato? I must be really wide of the mark! Van Zieks: ...You have a head. Try using it. Judge: I must ask you to reconsider your answer, Counsel. Leads back to: \"But I don't know if I've got an answer to this yet, have I?\"Present evidence Ryunosuke: Very well. The defence will address my learned friend's concerns... ...by presenting evidence that reveals the true nature of Mr Asman's body double! Judge: Good gracious! Evidence? I do hope this isn't filibustering, Counsel. The court is expecting a name. Van Zieks: If you think you have relevant evidence, present it now. Ryunosuke: (The body double and the birdcage were hiding inside the balloon that was floating above the stage. Which means that any witnesses would only have seen them from sixty feet away. ...So who was it that appeared out of that explosion some eighteen metres above the spectators...?) ......... Aha! The body double inside the second birdcage was... Present Waxwork Head Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"We know that the victim, Mr Asman, was in the birdcage that was situated inside the kinesis machine on stage.\" Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Well...probably something along these lines, I think... Van Zieks: Van Zieks: Then let's see what happens to that piece of evidence when dropped from a great height... ...whilst within your grasp, of course. Susato: He's suggesting you and the evidence die together, Mr Naruhodo! Ryunosuke: ...Yes, that came across. (It's hard to see how another person could have been inside the second birdcage. Which means the body double must have been something else...) Judge: I shall have to ask you to reconsider your answer, Counsel. Leads back to: \"But I don't know if I've got an answer to this yet, have I?\"Nothing at the moment Ryunosuke: I can't explain that at the moment. Van Zieks: Oh really. And when can the court expect an explanation? Ryunosuke: ......... Maybe tomorrow? Van Zieks: Then you can take your leave of us until then. Susato: People who procrastinate lose everything in the end, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: ...Isn't that slightly over-the-top? Susato: We can discuss that later. But for now, you ought to consider what you can do, not what you can't. Ryunosuke: Alright, yes. I'll think again... Leads back to: \"What can I do to reveal how this body double stunt was achieved?\"Ryunosuke: We know that the victim, Mr Asman, was in the birdcage that was situated inside the kinesis machine on stage. And therefore he couldn't have been inside the second birdcage. Instead, that contained something else... What's been described as a 'body double', which is what fell from the sky and crashed into the Crystal Tower.Judge: Yes, Counsel, according to your somewhat elaborate version of events.Ryunosuke: And that 'body double' inside the second birdcage was in fact... .........Susato: It's alright, Mr Naruhodo. You're ready for this. Just steel yourself...and come out with it!Ryunosuke: ...Thank you, Miss Susato! I needed that. As I was saying...the 'body double' inside the second birdcage was... ...as unbelievable as it may seem...that thing there!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: ......... Open your eyes and look into mine, my Nipponese friend. Now tell me......what are you playing at?Ryunosuke: (Stand firm now, Ryunosuke! This is the time to show your Japanese spirit!) As the court will observe...this is a waxwork model. A model, in fact, of an infamous London murderer from ten years ago: the Professor!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: You started by indicting the leader of the Forensic Investigation Team as an accomplice in this crime. And now you've moved on to indicting waxworks?Ryunosuke: ...Yes! That's about the size of it.Van Zieks: But why? And why THIS waxwork? It looks nothing like the victim. In fact, it could hardly resemble him less! What possible justification can you give?Ryunosuke: If you want to know why... ...ask Mr Drebber.Drebber: ...!Van Zieks: What?Ryunosuke: Just days before Professor Harebrayne performed his public demonstration... ...Mr Drebber abducted this model from Madame Tusspells.Judge: Did, did you say...abducted?!Ryunosuke: And two days after the incident at the Great Exhibition... ...he returned it to the museum.Van Zieks: Then the timing...Judge: Is this true, Mr Drebber?Drebber: Ugh... Urmm...Ryunosuke: At first, I couldn't see why Mr Drebber would have stolen the waxwork and then given it back again. But now, the reason is clear. He took it so that he could put it inside the second birdcage...as a body double for Mr Asman!Drebber: Guh...............!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: Are you hearing this, ladies and gentlemen of the jury? Are you hearing the defence's astonishing proposal?Juror No. 1: ...!Juror No. 2: ...!Van Zieks: That the witness fabricated this vast machine with the intention of deceiving some wretched scientist. That he did so in collusion with the country's finest coroner, on a public stage in front of a vast audience.Juror No. 3: ...!Juror No. 4: ...!Van Zieks: And that, to effect the deception, he used a waxwork model that in no way resembles the victim. Are we really to believe this far-fetched tale? What do you decide?Juror No. 5: ...!Juror No. 6: ...!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: Wait! Yes, if you put it like that, of course it sounds implausible!???:My Lord!Juror No. 1: I need to speak, if you please.Judge: Go ahead, Mr Foreman.Juror No. 1: Myself and my colleagues have reached an agreement.Judge: Very good. In that case... ...ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you will state your leanings for the court to hear now!Juror No. 1: Guilty!Juror No. 2: Guilty!Juror No. 3: Guilty!Juror No. 4: Guilty!Juror No. 5: Guilty!Juror No. 6: Guilty!Judge: So, as indicated by the foreman, the jury has reached a consensus.Ryunosuke: (I knew that was going to happen.)Susato: We shall get through this, Mr Naruhodo, as we always do. And uncover some new truths along the way, I'm quite sure.Ryunosuke: Yes, I agree. I'm going to have to appeal to the jurors as usual, and see if I can persuade them to change their minds!Judge: The defence will now embark on a summation examination. Are you and your fellows ready to proceed, Mr Foreman?Juror No. 1: We are, My Lord.Judge: Very well. In that case, I ask you now to state clearly for all present to hear... ...the grounds on which each of you has decided that the defendant is guilty of the crime of which he is charged.Judicial Findings - The Jurors' Contentions -Juror No. 6: I've known that woman for years! She'd never be an accomplice to anything!Juror No. 1: It's utter nonsense to think those two would ever be conniving with one another.Juror No. 2: Oh dear, this is most troubling... But surely the waxwork the man stole is nothing to do with the coroner, is it?Juror No. 3: I have had my own problems with members of the police. I do not trust them much...Juror No. 4: I've seen no rigorous proof that this waxwork was ever inside the birdcage. It's conjecture!Juror No. 5: Accusin' someone without right evidences? Ee's not a proper job, is ee? I won't 'ave it!Judge: Somewhat unsurprisingly... ...it seems the introduction of this waxwork model to the proceedings has polarised opinion.Van Zieks: Given that its face is obscured and its build in no way resembles that of the victim... ...I can only applaud my learned friend's temerity at suggesting it as Mr Asman's body double.Ryunosuke: (Yes, the applause is deafening. ...And yes, I know it seems extraordinary. But that's the point. That's why I have a strong feeling it's actually a greater clue than anyone yet realises...)Susato: What are you thinking, Mr Naruhodo?Ryunosuke: I can't explain why at the moment... ...but I feel as though there's a specific reason why it was used. Why it had to be this model.Susato: Really? A reason why nothing else would do, you mean?Ryunosuke: Yes. And I'm convinced... ...it's something far more significant than whether or not the model looked like the victim.Susato: Well...if that's the case... ...we must prevent the trial from ending prematurely at all costs!Ryunosuke: Yes, agreed. (I have to find a way out of this...!)Judge: If you are ready, Counsel, you may proceed with the summation examination.Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord!Jury Examination - The Defence's Rebuttal -Juror No. 6: I've known that woman for years! She'd never be an accomplice to anything!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Um...the order of things seems to have changed around here for some reason... Juror No. 6: I'm a copper, lad. It's a copper's discretion to bend the rules sometimes, when needs must. What's wrong with that?! Ryunosuke: (...Where do I start?) Juror No. 6: I've been working at the Yard for forty odd years! Ryunosuke: That's...even more than I thought. Juror No. 6: We've only had a metropolitan police service in town for seventy years, you know. 'Course, times have changed. The public didn't trust coppers back when I started. It was rough. We had to fight crime, and we had to fight to win the public's trust as well. And win we did. Forensic science was in its infancy too, even more than it is now. And she spearheaded the revolution! Ryunosuke: Dr Sithe, you mean? Juror No. 6: That's right. About ten years ago now, it was. When I was still a youngish bobby on the beat. That's when she started making a name for herself as a top-class coroner. And now look at her! Head of the Forensic Investigation Team. And a woman, no less. Well you won't hear me complain! It's what we all dreamt of back then, I tell you! Ryunosuke: ...Could you tell me without holding that gun in the air?! Juror No. 6: We were all out to uphold justice, lad! Full of vim, we were. Full of vim. Ryunosuke: ...That's coming across loud and clear.Juror No. 6: She was Courtney Stevens back when I knew her, of course. A legendary coroner, even then.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: She was legendary, was she? Juror No. 6: What did you say?! Ryunosuke: Agh! Juror No. 6: That woman is still the best coroner in the land! Head of the Forensics Investigation Team! Ryunosuke: Um...'legendary' was your description, sir, not mine. Juror No. 6: Rubbish! That word never passed my lips! I'd never describe anybody that way! Ever! Not if they were still in the game! Ryunosuke: ......... ...I think the point you're trying to make is that Dr Sithe is an extremely talented coroner. Would that be fair? Juror No. 6: It would! If it weren't for the fact that you're trying to drag that legendary woman's reputation through the mud! Ryunosuke: (I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that 'legendary'.)Pit against Juror No. 2's statement Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: Good gracious! To whose statements do you refer, Counsel? Ryunosuke: So...juror number two. Juror No. 2: Oh gosh! Me? W-What can I do for you? Ryunosuke: I presume that you heard what juror number six said in his statement? It's brought to light the maiden name of the coroner, Dr Sithe. Which in turn has revealed a connection that wasn't apparent before. Juror No. 2: Well naturally, as a woman of society, I find such connections and relationships irresistible. But oh golly... I'm afraid I fail to see what you mean. Ryunosuke: Dr Sithe's maiden name is Stevens. And through that name, the coroner is very definitely linked to the waxwork of the killer. The defence has evidence to prove it. Juror No. 2: My goodness! Evidence, you say? How, how utterly enthralling! Judge: Counsel, the court cannot overlook that last remark. I very much hope there is substance to your claim. Ryunosuke: Of course, My Lord. I would ask the court to look at this: The evidence that clearly links Dr Sithe to the mass murderer known as the Professor! Present Killer's Autopsy Report Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: I have here a certain autopsy report from ten years ago. Judge: A ten-year-old autopsy report? What relevance does that have? Ryunosuke: It is of course from the autopsy of the person portrayed in the waxwork: the killer known as the Professor. Van Zieks: ...! Judge: The Professor's...? But the man was a capital offender, so... Ryunosuke: That's right. This is the certification of death that was drawn up after the convict's execution. The identity of the killer was never made public, so the report gives few details. But what's important is the name of the coroner who wrote it: Courtney Stevens. Juror No. 2: Oh my! Courtney Stevens?! Juror No. 6: Strike a light! Ryunosuke: It appears that the Professor's autopsy was conducted by Dr Sithe ten years ago. And a few days ago, Mr Drebber very deliberately stole the waxwork of the Professor from Madame Tusspells. A waxwork that doesn't in fact resemble the victim, Mr Asman, at all. Juror No. 2: And do you suppose...there's some unsavoury relationship between those events? Ryunosuke: Absolutely! I'm sure of it! There's no doubt in my mind that the Professor case... ...is at the heart of a link that we have yet to uncover... ...between Dr Courtney Sithe and Mr Enoch Drebber! Juror No. 2: ......... Hidden links...mysterious connections...secret relationships... This is all most extraordinary. We're surely obliged now to explore this further. Juror No. 6: Quite right. We can't let this trial come to an end now. Not while there's this cloud of suspicion hanging over the Yard's best coroner. It wasn't like this in my day! But we're still here to uphold justice in the end! Changes Juror No. 6's statement to \"If a Yard coroner's under suspicion, then we're not done here yet, are we? Clearly!\" Changes Juror No. 2's statement to \"It's the Professor! That's what links that frightful swindler and the coroner!\" Present anything else Ryunosuke: Juror No. 2: Are you quite alright, sir? All colour has drained from your cheeks. You look just like a waxwork yourself. Ryunosuke: I think...my lack of colour must reflect my lack of confidence... Juror No. 6: Hmph. Wait till you hit my age, lad. You won't have any colour left to drain. Judge: I said before that the court could not overlook your claim of evidence. But it seems to me that overlooking it would have been the more preferable choice by some margin. Ryunosuke: (Ugh. I was sure I had something...) Juror No. 2: Oh gosh! There's, there's wax dripping from your brow! You're melting! Ryunosuke: Just a cold sweat. Nothing new. Judge: Let us return to the jurors' statements and put this debacle behind us. Leads back to summation examinationJuror No. 6: If a Yard coroner's under suspicion, then we're not done here yet, are we? Clearly!Juror No. 1: It's utter nonsense to think those two would ever be conniving with one another.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But we're only just starting to understand this case! Juror No. 1: ......... Ryunosuke: W-What are you reading there, sir?! Juror No. 1: The man behind those murders on Solar Pons Street was caught in two days flat. That's real policing for you. Ryunosuke: That's...really not relevant to this case, is it? Juror No. 1: You're wrong there. Because it was Dr Sithe in charge of examining the bodies. And it was evidence arising from her work that led to the arrest of the scoundrel responsible. Ryunosuke: Oh... Juror No. 1: That's right, 'Oh.' That woman is at the forefront of this country's fight against crime. The idea that she's somehow involved in this murky business is a load of old tosh. Ryunosuke: (I thought it was up to me to 'press' the jurors, not the other way around...)Juror No. 2: Oh dear, this is most troubling... But surely the waxwork the man stole is nothing to do with the coroner, is it?Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Why would you assume that? Juror No. 2: Well, quite simply because...that unsettling swindler has no relationship with the woman, does he? Ryunosuke: True. As it stands, we don't know of any connection. Juror No. 2: Oh gosh, but it would be delightfully romantic if they were somehow to have a mutual interest in the waxwork. Ryunosuke: Romantic? Juror No. 2: A woman of society such as myself views everything in terms of relationships, you know. Ryunosuke: Well, you learn something new every day! (Even if you don't want to.) Juror No. 2: One might wonder about a possible relationship between the defendant and this coroner woman. Or perhaps between the defendant and the handsome prosecutor just there. Ryunosuke: (This woman...may be more astute than I've been giving her credit for.) Susato: If that's the woman's stance... ...then perhaps demonstrating some connection between the waxwork and Dr Sithe would be enough... Ryunosuke: Yes, I agree. As soon as we have even a whiff of a connection, she'll be the first to know!Pit against Juror No. 6's statement (after Juror No. 6 changes his statement) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: Good gracious! To whose statements do you refer, Counsel? Ryunosuke: So...juror number two. Juror No. 2: Oh gosh! Me? W-What can I do for you? Ryunosuke: I presume that you heard what juror number six said in his statement? It's brought to light the maiden name of the coroner, Dr Sithe. Which in turn has revealed a connection that wasn't apparent before. Juror No. 2: Well naturally, as a woman of society, I find such connections and relationships irresistible. But oh golly... I'm afraid I fail to see what you mean. Ryunosuke: Dr Sithe's maiden name is Stevens. And through that name, the coroner is very definitely linked to the waxwork of the killer. The defence has evidence to prove it. Juror No. 2: My goodness! Evidence, you say? How, how utterly enthralling! Judge: Counsel, the court cannot overlook that last remark. I very much hope there is substance to your claim. Ryunosuke: Of course, My Lord. I would ask the court to look at this: The evidence that clearly links Dr Sithe to the mass murderer known as the Professor!

Courtney Stevens?! Juror No. 6: Strike a light! Ryunosuke: It appears that the Professor's autopsy was conducted by Dr Sithe ten years ago. And a few days ago, Mr Drebber very deliberately stole the waxwork of the Professor from Madame Tusspells. A waxwork that doesn't in fact resemble the victim, Mr Asman, at all.

We can't let this trial come to an end now. Not while there's this cloud of suspicion hanging over the Yard's best coroner. It wasn't like this in my day!

Clearly!\" Changes Juror No. 2's statement to \"It's the Professor! That's what links that frightful swindler and the coroner!\" Present anything else Ryunosuke: Juror No. 2: Are you quite alright, sir? All colour has drained from your cheeks. You look just like a waxwork yourself. Ryunosuke: I think...my lack of colour must reflect my lack of confidence... Juror No. 6: Hmph. Wait till you hit my age, lad.

Leads back to summation examinationJuror No. 2: It's the Professor! That's what links that frightful swindler and the coroner!Juror No. 3: I have had my own problems with members of the police. I do not trust them much...Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What sort of problems? Juror No. 3: Let's just say we have run into each other on numerous occasions while I've been performing on the street. Ryunosuke: Right, I see. Juror No. 3: Obviously artists such as myself cannot appear on stage as we work in close proximity to our audiences. So we perform our great magic in parks...on street corners...and the like. But the police use any excuse to make our lives difficult. Sometimes they even cook up a story to extort monies from the poor. Pursue Juror No. 6 (before Juror No. 6 changes his statement) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Do you have something to say in response to that... Mr Ottermole?! Juror No. 6: Who are you calling a mass murderer?! Ryunosuke: Ah! Sorry, my mistake! I, I got confused because I heard you look like him... Juror No. 6: I don't look anything like the man! You wanna be locked up, sonny? Ryunosuke: (Thanks, Mr Sholmes...) Perhaps we could move on... I was really wondering if you had something you wanted to add in response to what juror number three just said. And clearly you do. Juror No. 6: ......... Back in my day... Back in the good old days... ...it wasn't like this! Ryunosuke: What was it like, sir? Juror No. 6: We worked our fingers to the bone to earn the public's trust, we did! And by Jove we earnt it! People respected us back then! Juror No. 3: Respected you? Hmph. Juror No. 6: No one would've called a coroner into question in them days! A coroner's report was the hallmark of an investigation done right! Especially when Dr Courtney Stevens put her name to it! She was the best of the best! And the apple of the force's eye! Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: H-Hold on a minute! What are you talking about? Who's Courtney Stevens? Juror No. 6: Ah... Sorry. Got a bit carried away there. Van Zieks: Stevens is Dr Sithe's maiden name. Ryunosuke: Her maiden name... (So that was before she was married...) Juror No. 6: O' course, yes. Silly me. It's Sithe now, isn't it? Ryunosuke: (Stevens... I'm sure I've seen that name somewhere recently...) Juror No. 6: Anyway! The point is, those were the great days of policing! Not like now... Ryunosuke: Sorry to interrupt, sir... ...but do you think you could change your statement to include that name? Juror No. 6: Well, yes...I don't see why not. Changes Juror No. 6's statement to \"She was Courtney Stevens back when I knew her, of course. A legendary coroner, even then.\" Ryunosuke: Well, that's definitely not right. Juror No. 3: Yes, and it is why I say that if you trust the police, you will have trouble. But here you are, claiming this waxwork model was stolen to star in an illusionary spectacular. The idea is so wild, I think I will take my chances and believe the authorities on this occasion. Ryunosuke: (This is how the public at large view Scotland Yard, is it?) Susato: Our own police force in Tokyo is not even twenty years old yet, is it? Perhaps we should view what's happened here in London as a measure of what may happen at home. Ryunosuke: Yes... Like a Scotland Yardstick. (I wonder how a policeman would feel listening to the way this juror speaks about the force... I'm sure he'd have a word or two to say in response.)Juror No. 4: I've seen no rigorous proof that this waxwork was ever inside the birdcage. It's conjecture!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But you claimed the whole instantaneous kinesis demonstration was a trick! Juror No. 4: That I did. But there's more than one way to pull a rabbit out of a hat, isn't there? Ryunosuke: Sorry? Juror No. 4: I grant you, given that this cage appeared from amidst an explosion, there'd have been no need to use a real person. But if a waxwork had been used, the culprit could at least have had the decency to make it look like the victim. Ryunosuke: I'm not sure exactly how much criminals are governed by decency... Juror No. 4: The point is, if you're going to make a claim about that waxwork being inside the birdcage... ...you need to give us some evidence. Without that, it's just not science! Susato: I suppose we should expect nothing less than a logical argument from a fellow of the Royal Society. But that perhaps means his mind could be changed if we managed to present suitable evidence... Ryunosuke: (Evidence that the Professor waxwork was inside that birdcage. Hm... Can I produce that or not?) I have evidence Ryunosuke: ...Actually, I have something I'd like you to see, sir. Juror No. 4: Oh? I must warn you that I firmly believe it's only wise to trust men in white coats. So given your jet-black outfit, I don't mind admitting to a sense of trepidation here. Ryunosuke: (So you don't trust anyone in black? Looking in the mirror must be very trying...) I do have some evidence that proves the waxwork was inside that birdcage. Namely... Present Piece of Broken Glass Ryunosuke: Juror No. 4: What's that? A piece of glass? Though it's unusually thick for glass... Ryunosuke: Yes, it's a piece of broken glass that we found inside the jacket on the waxwork. As you say, it's not ordinary glass, though. It's very thick, and clearly made for extra strength. Much like the special glass that was developed for the construction of the Crystal Tower. Juror No. 4: The Crystal To- Holy smoke! Ryunosuke: Exactly! The centrepiece of the Great Exhibition, where the very incident we're talking about took place! On the day in question, the birdcage fell from above and smashed through a window of that special glass. Juror No. 4: From whence this small piece originated...is that it? Ryunosuke: Precisely. So, what do you say... ...now that clear evidence in support of the assertion has been placed before you?! Juror No. 4: ......... Well, as I said, I only trust men in white coats as a rule. However... ...when the reasoning is sound, it's fair to say colour shouldn't come into it. In light of what you've shown me here, yes, I feel obliged to change my position on the matter. Judge: In that case, juror number four, you will amend your statement now, please. Changes Juror No. 4's statement to \"The presence of that piece of glass leaves me in little doubt that the waxwork was indeed inside that birdcage.\" Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Let me start by showing you...this! Juror No. 4: ......... It's an unimpressive opening, if I'm honest. Ryunosuke: Ah, well, um... What comes next is the real point! Judge: It's already apparent that what comes next is equally disappointing, Counsel. Ryunosuke: Ugh... (How about after that...?) Susato: If the waxwork of the Professor was inside the second birdcage... ...I would assume that means it must have crashed into the Crystal Tower. Ryunosuke: Yes, that's right. I'd managed to think it through to that point myself. Susato: Well, it's really only a tiny leap from there, I would think! Leads back to: \"Evidence that the Professor waxwork was inside that birdcage.\" I have nothing Ryunosuke: Well, I can state quite categorically, sir, that we have no such evidence at the present time! Juror No. 4: That much was abundantly clear before that brassy proclamation, I assure you! And why you can count on the fact that I shan't be changing my leaning! Susato: Oh dear... That proclamation was even brassier than yours, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: (If only we had some evidence, things might be different, though...) Leads back to summation examinationJuror No. 4: The presence of that piece of glass leaves me in little doubt that the waxwork was indeed inside that birdcage.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Thank you for reconsidering your position, sir. Juror No. 4: Your words are misplaced, boy. My opinion is governed by logic and science and nothing else. Yes, science is where you should direct your words of gratitude. Ryunosuke: Ah... Juror No. 4: ......... Ryunosuke: ......... Juror No. 4: What's the matter with you?! Too good to say some words of thanks to the mother of all academic subjects?! Ryunosuke: (...What is it about scientists? Honestly.)Pit against Juror No. 5's statement Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: Good gracious! To whose statements do you refer, Counsel? Ryunosuke: If you could put down your corn for a moment, juror number five...! Juror No. 5: ......... Ooh, you mean me? Ryunosuke: You've pointed out that it's wrong to make an accusation without evidence. But the accusation that the waxwork model was inside the second birdcage on the day in question... ...is not without supporting evidence. As the defence demonstrated to the juror sitting beside you. Juror No. 5: ......... Ooh, is that right? Ryunosuke: ......... Would it be fair to say... ...you didn't follow the argument? Juror No. 5: I don't understand much besides Colonel Cob, to be honest. Ryunosuke: ......... (Of course you don't...) Juror No. 4: If I could interject here... Ryunosuke: Please do, sir. Juror No. 4: Now that this assertion of yours about the waxwork has been backed up by some solid evidence... ...it would be wrong of me, as a man of science, not to pursue the matter further. Juror No. 5: Ar, well, me too, then! Ryunosuke: Sorry?! Juror No. 5: If this brainy gentleman says ee's right, then ee must be! See...I, um... ...I wouldn't dream of goin' against Colonel Cob or anyone who's got stuffin' between the ears! Ryunosuke: (Success! ...If you can call it that.) Changes Juror No. 4's statement to \"The possibility has been established reasonably and logically. It now warrants further research.\" Changes Juror No. 5's statement to \"Well, 'course if ee's got some evidences, that's a whole other cob o' corn, innit? Lovely job!\"Juror No. 4: The possibility has been established reasonably and logically. It now warrants further research.Juror No. 5: Accusin' someone without right evidences? Ee's not a proper job, is ee? I won't 'ave it!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: I've got to ask...why have you brought that corn into court with you? Juror No. 5: Colonel Cob? Ee's bin growin' back on the farm. Picked 'im off on me way into town. Ee's a proper nibbler, ee is. Ryunosuke: Yes, the nibbling seems to be taking quite a while. Maybe it could wait until after the trial? Juror No. 5: Ooh, I don't like the sound o' that. You need colonels at times like these. Whenever I've summat big to decide, the colonels always point me in the right direction, see. Ryunosuke: Y-You're talking about your cob of corn? Juror No. 5: Nibble nobble guilty bobble, nibble not guilty out. Nibble nobble guilty bobble, nibble not guilty out. Nibble nobble guilty bobble, nibble not guilty out. Nibble nobble guilty bobble, nibble not guilty out. Susato: ...Perhaps it's akin to fortune-telling with flower petals like people do back home? Ryunosuke: (So Professor Harebrayne's fate is to be decided by a cob of corn...) Could you not at least wait until we've had more time to find the truth before deciding on the defendant's guilt? Juror No. 5: Ooh, I don't know about that. Me tum's awfully full already. Ryunosuke: (A-maize-ing...)Pit against Juror No. 4's statement (after Juror No. 4 changes his statement) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other! Judge: Good gracious! To whose statements do you refer, Counsel? Ryunosuke: If you could put down your corn for a moment, juror number five...! Juror No. 5: ......... Ooh, you mean me?

Lovely job!\"Juror No. 5: Well, 'course if ee's got some evidences, that's a whole other cob o' corn, innit? Lovely job!Ryunosuke: (I know it seems a little far-fetched to think that the waxwork model of the Professor was in that birdcage... ...but on the other hand, it explains a lot.)Susato: If there really is a reason why that particular waxwork had to be used as Mr Asman's double... ...we must do everything we can to make the jurors understand it.Ryunosuke: The truth is, I'm sure that's the key to this, but it's the most puzzling part of it, too.Susato: In that case, you should see what additional information you can glean whilst trying to change the jurors' minds. If you can read a book whilst eating a rice cracker, Mr Naruhodo, I'm sure you can do this!Ryunosuke: ...Right. Yes!After Jurors No. 2, 4, 5, and 6 vote innocent:Judge: Thank you, Counsel, that will do. As a result of the summation examination, the jury's overall leaning has changed. Two jurors now call guilty. Against four who call not guilty. Accordingly the court has failed to reach a consensus at this time... ...and the trial must continue!Ryunosuke: We, we did it!Susato: Oh, well done, Mr Naruhodo! Another wonderful victory!Judge: Hmmm, a waxwork of the despicable Professor... ...used as a 'body double' for the victim in this quite extraordinary case... I must say, it's extremely hard to believe the assertion could possibly be true. However, it would appear that it does at least warrant further investigation.Ryunosuke: It's the waxwork of the Professor that links Mr Drebber and Dr Sithe. And I'm convinced that there's a special significance to that link!Juror No. 6: I don't know what you're hoping to prove, lad, I really don't!Susato: The truth, sir. By using evidence and testimony.Juror No. 6: Hmph.Van Zieks: If the court is to delve deeper into the alleged involvement of the waxwork in this case... ...then the prosecution calls for the owner of the model to be summoned as a witness.Judge: The owner?Van Zieks: Madame Tusspells.Ryunosuke: ...! (I, I really thought... ...that Lord van Zieks would object to this whole line of enquiry...)Judge: Very well, I concur. Make arrangements for Madame Tusspells to appear as a witness with immediate effect.Van Zieks: ......... Listen carefully, my learned friend.Ryunosuke: Oh... Yes?Van Zieks: You should know... ...that you're on the brink of opening Pandora's box. .........Judge: The court shall now adjourn for forty-five minutes. During that time, the prosecution will summon the new witness and prepare her for taking the stand.Van Zieks: Madame Tusspells, yes. I shall see to it at once, My Lord.To be continued...24th October, 11:53 a.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' AntechamberSholmes: Ah, the knight-errant himself!Ryunosuke: Oh, have you been watching from the gallery, Mr Sholmes?Sholmes: I've been on the edge of my seat the entire time! Courtroom trials are fascinating affairs. As a spectator, at least.Ryunosuke: I'm glad you've been enjoying yourself...Harebrayne: I, I have to ask... ...what on earth is going on?! It makes no sense! What's this Professor business all about? He doesn't look like any professor I've ever met before! Who even is he?Ryunosuke: Ah, of course... ...you were in Germany already ten years ago.Sholmes: Yes, the Professor... When I discovered 'he' was the one who had been abducted, a sense of foreboding stirred within me. But who knew the monster would come knocking at your door? My heartfelt sympathies! Ah ha ha ha ha hah!Ryunosuke: As it turns out... ...Lord van Zieks is even more intimately tied to this case than any of us realised, isn't he?Susato: Yes, how true. His great friend from university in the dock...Sholmes: ...And now a waxwork of the killer who took his esteemed brother's life makes an appearance, too. I imagine even the shrewd Mr Reaper failed to foresee that kick in the teeth. An extraordinary move on your part, my dear fellow, to throw that in front of the man.Ryunosuke: You make it sound deliberate...Susato: I can't help feeling... ...that this Professor case is really very puzzling.Sholmes: Oh yes? In what particular manner?Susato: Well, there's Mr Drebber, Dr Sithe and Lord van Zieks... It seems that everybody in the trial has a link to the case somehow.Harebrayne: Yes, in fact I, alone, am not a member of the set! Though that leaves me as an empty set...all alone with no intersection to any other...???:Excuse me.Ryunosuke: D.........D.........Dr Sithe!Sholmes: Ah, Dr Courtney Sithe, née Stevens. Good day to you.Sithe: Hello, Sholmes. That was very shrewd of you.Sholmes: ...What in particular, pray?Sithe: You requested that ten-year-old autopsy report from Gregson, didn't you?Sholmes: Why would you assume such a thing?Sithe: Because Gregson told me.Sholmes: .........Sithe: To think it's been ten years... Ten years in the laboratory, wielding my scalpel. I smell of nothing but corpses and disinfectant.Ryunosuke: A policeman on the jury had a lot to say about you as it happens, Dr Sithe. And I've...accused you of being complicit in what happened. I'm hoping that you'll take the stand and tell the truth about what really happened.Sithe: That certainly won't be possible.Ryunosuke: ...!Sithe: Lord van Zieks won't be summoning me as a witness. Lord Stronghart has forbidden it.Ryunosuke: Lord Stronghart?Sithe: The Pandora's box you were warned about...is the Professor case. But please don't make the mistake of thinking you'll get any information about it out of me.Susato: But attempting to hide from the truth... That's cowardice!Sithe: I've always fought crime in the way that I see fit. I have no regrets. None at all. And that's all I came here to say. So...good day to you.Ryunosuke: ......... She mentioned it, too. This Pandora's box...Susato: Whatever does it all mean?Sholmes: There's really no cause for concern. I assure you, when the trial resumes... ...the meaning will become all too apparent, whether you'd like it to or not.Ryunosuke: Huh?Sholmes: Now then, I believe it's almost time. I must make my way back to the public gallery. The edge of my seat awaits!Ryunosuke: (I think maybe you're enjoying yourself a little too much...)Sholmes: Ah yes, one word of warning before I go: If, in the course of the trial this afternoon, you perceive even a shadow of doubt about the truth... ...don't let it out of your sight. Pursue it like a dog with a bone.Ryunosuke: ...!Sholmes: To the bitter end, you understand. Do not falter, whatever may come to pass.Ryunosuke: ......... Alright, I understand. ...Thank you.Sholmes: Good. I shall make myself scarce, then. I purchased a bar of caramel earlier, so I shall be gnawing on that as you gnaw away at the truth!Ryunosuke: (What did that warning from Mr Sholmes really mean, I wonder? Especially the bit about 'whatever may come to pass'... .........)It's time for the final chapter, then. I'm determined to find the truth... ...no matter what.24th October, 12:40 p.m. The Old Bailey CourtroomJudge: In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby reconvene the proceedings of this court. Counsels for the defence and prosecution, are you ready and able to continue?Van Zieks: The prosecution is ready, My Lord.Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord. The defence is also ready.Judge: As the court is aware, the case under our scrutiny began with a damaging incident at the Great Exhibition. Yet we now find ourselves embroiled in the details of a convicted felon who was sent to the gallows a decade ago. This trial has certainly defied all expectation.Van Zieks: As seems to be the fate of all trials in which this Nipponese is involved, My Lord.Judge: So then... ...let us begin our exploration of the defence's assertion that the waxwork was cardinally involved in this matter. Lord van Zieks...Van Zieks: My Lord?Judge: Are we still awaiting the arrival of Madame Tusspells?Van Zieks: Not at all. She is in the antechamber as we speak and ready to be summoned.Judge: Very well. Bring in the witness!Van Zieks: At once, My Lord. Bailiff! Show Madame Tusspells to the stand!Ryunosuke: (Things are about to become a lot more intense. If Drebber is responsible, as I'm sure he is, it means he must have had an accomplice...in Dr Sithe.)Susato: And what connects the pair of them...is the waxwork.Ryunosuke: (Yes, the model of the Professor... That's the key to the link between these otherwise unrelated individuals. It's a tenuous link, admittedly. But at present, it's all we have to go on.)Van Zieks: State your name and occupation for the court, please.Tusspells: My name is Madame Esmeralda Tusspells. I am a waxwork artisan. And the proprietress of the Madame Tusspells Museum of Waxwork. You will have to pardon me for working as I testify. My new exhibit must open very soon.Ryunosuke: ......... (Oh, so he finally gets a statue, does he? Now there are two of them in the world...)Susato: Oh my... What expression is she carving onto that face?Van Zieks: A number of days ago, a particular waxwork model was stolen from your museum. Can you confirm this?Tusspells: Oui. That is true. At first, we believed it had been kidnapped.Judge: A waxwork model? Kidnapped?!Tusspells: Yes, My Lord. There was a demand for ransom money left behind by the culprit. However, according to what I have just been told outside the courtroom, that was not the true reason. I understand it was utilised as a substitute for the body of a murder victim?Van Zieks: At present, that is no more than conjecture proposed by the defence. This is the victim of the case in question. Mr Odie Asman.Tusspells: But of course, I know him well. He is a part of my odious personages exhibit. ...I detest to say what is evident, but Mr Asman does not resemble the Professor at all.Ryunosuke: Yes, but...perhaps! Perhaps their faces are very similar!Tusspells: Are you suggesting that we should see now the demasked visage of the Professor? I have here the key, but it is strictly forbidden to open the lock.Van Zieks: This is absurd!Tusspells: Pardon?Van Zieks: I don't know what face you've carved onto your fancy figure beneath that mask... ...but clearly it won't be that of the actual killer.Judge: Indeed. The man's identity was never made public, after all.Van Zieks: The trial took place in a closed court. The proceedings were strictly confidential. The condemned man was summarily executed. His identity remains a closely guarded national secret. There is no possible way that a repository of tawdry exhibits could get its hands on that information.Tusspells: ......... Quel dommage. It would seem you are unaware of the Tusspells' principles.Ryunosuke: What principles?Tusspells: The family Tusspells has always prided itself on sculpting its models à la perfection. Every detail, including the visage, is fashioned with complete fidelity. ...Et voilà: our principles.Susato: There is a well known legend about the Tusspells waxworks from the time of the French Revolution. A member of the Tusspells family is said to have made a waxwork of the queen who was executed.Tusspells: Oui, that is true. It was a century ago now.Susato: I believe the queen's face was carved in the minutes following her death, actually at the guillotine site.Tusspells: You are correct. The model is on display still today in the House of Horrors. We Tusspells will stop at nothing to obtain a faithful replica of our subjects.Judge: Dear me... A somewhat disturbing tenacity of purpose.Tusspells: It is the only way to obtain a truly lifelike representation of the subject. And it has been my family's secret for generations.Ryunosuke: Do, do you mean to say...that beneath that mask...?Tusspells: Oui. The true visage of the killer is there.Van Zieks: ...This is ludicrous. It's out of the question!Tusspells: The Professor spread terror throughout Great Britain. As a result, the Madame Tusspells Special Exhibit remains extremely popular even today. The killer...emerging from his own grave... It is a sight to behold. You should come.Judge: I think, madame, it would be beneficial to hear your formal testimony on this matter. You will explain every detail of this macabre model. And your personal involvement in its creation.Tusspells: ...With pleasure.Witness Testimony - The Professor Waxwork -Tusspells: The special exhibit in the House of Horrors is based on a rumour that shocked society in London. An impression of the visage was taken directly from the corpse...in accordance with Tusspells family principles. I enlisted the aid of the gravedigger, and created a mould for the head in the cemetery just before the interment. I hid myself until he gave me a signal. ...I was there for a very long time that night. As dawn approached, I was very worried that I could be discovered.Judge: The gravedigger?! The man sanctioned this?Tusspells: Oui. I will do all that is necessary to achieve the true resemblance my family is celebrated for. Nobody else knew. Only the gravedigger. What harm did it do, uh?Van Zieks: So you truly saw it? The face of that monster!Tusspells: ......... Naturally, I was aware at the time that his identity was a secret. But Tusspells would not be Tusspells if we did not insist on absolute fidelity to our sculptures.Van Zieks: I don't believe this...Judge: I myself have seen the special exhibit at your museum, madame. A truly blood-curdling scene, in which the murderer is emerging from his own grave.Tusspells: The scene it depicts was the subject of many rumours in London ten years ago. I have here a newspaper from the time. The special exhibit was based upon the picture in this article. It was the most detailed account of what happened, as reported by the eyewitness who saw it.The ten-year-old article has been entered into the Court Record.Van Zieks: 'Man Rises from the Grave!'... It's too absurd for words.Tusspells: The public enjoy absurdity, monsieur. That is why I have reproduced the scene as carefully as possible in my museum.Ryunosuke: And it's a waxwork from that exhibit that was stolen some days before the incident at the Great Exhibition, wasn't it.Tusspells: That is correct. The Professor you see before you here.Judge: Hm... Most puzzling... Counsel for the Defence...proceed with the cross-examination!Ryunosuke: (This waxwork links Drebber to Dr Sithe... And there has to be some reason for that, which hasn't yet come to light. But I'll find it. I'll get to the bottom of what really happened. I'll prove that Dr Sithe and Drebber were in on this crime together!)Cross-Examination - The Professor Waxwork -Tusspells: The special exhibit in the House of Horrors is based on a rumour that shocked society in London.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: And that rumour would be...? Tusspells: A ten-year-old tale now...but one that no Londoner would ever forget. Juror No. 1: Ah, right. I know just what you're talking about, I think. Juror No. 2: Of course, it couldn't be anything else... Juror No. 3: Yes, that story will never disappear. Tusspells: The tale of the condemned killer rising from the dead... That is the central attraction of my House of Horrors. The rumour was whispered all over the city. And it was like this... It was in Lowgate Cemetery behind the prison, in the dead of night after the execution of the killer. The interred Professor slid back the stone slab covering his tomb, and emerged from his grave. A young man who witnessed this felt a scream welling up inside him... ...but an instant later, he heard an ear-splitting gunshot from over his shoulder. The bullet struck the emerging corpse... and he fell motionless once more. The scream finally found its way from the mouth of the young witness, who turned and ran for his life. Ryunosuke: The, the corpse climbed out...of his own grave...? Susato: And then somebody shot him? Who, who was it?! Tusspells: Nobody knows, even today. But remember, it was just a rumour. ...Perhaps nothing more than a ghost story. The good people of London, they love stories like this. That is why it was in every newspaper across the capital. Ryunosuke: But, but was it just a story? I mean, this is exactly the scene that can be seen today at your museum, isn't it? Tusspells: Oui. The special exhibit was modelled on that very illustration. For a while afterwards, the contents of that article were reproduced in every newspaper imaginable. Susato: Madame, might I say something? Tusspells: Please, go ahead, mademoiselle. Susato: When something is described as a rumour, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's entirely made up. I believe that often...rumours contain elements of the truth. Tusspells: Ah, I see that people from the East can be just as astute as the people of Europe. Susato: Can we be sure, for instance, that the Professor's execution was successful? Tusspells: ......... It is not possible for the dead to come back to life. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Tusspells: Ten years ago, I was there in Lowgate Cemetery. After the criminal known as the Professor was killed by hanging... ...I took a wax impression of his visage from the corpse just before it was interred. So I can assure you... ...the man was dead. Ryunosuke: ...I see. Judge: Hmmm... It would certainly appear that the condemned man suffered the intended fate. Van Zieks: .........Tusspells: An impression of the visage was taken directly from the corpse...in accordance with Tusspells family principles.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Is, is that true of every waxwork in your museum then? Tusspells: It is...assuming the subject is dead, of course. Live subjects have to cooperate in a similar way. I have letters from imprisoned criminals all the time, you know. Ryunosuke: What sort of letters? Tusspells: 'When my time comes, please make a waxwork of me.' ...Comme ça. Ryunosuke: No! Tusspells: My museum is famous, monsieur. To be made into a waxwork is an honour. And for some criminals, a symbol of status, even. Ryunosuke: (Because nothing says hardened criminal better than... wax.) Tusspells: And it is thanks to one killer in particular, that my museum has gained such popularity in London. I refer to the star of the special exhibit, of course. The Professor. Van Zieks: ...Whose form you claim to have captured by taking an impression from the actual corpse. Tusspells: ...There are no exceptions to the principles of Tusspells.Tusspells: I enlisted the aid of the gravedigger, and created a mould for the head in the cemetery just before the interment.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Surely that's illegal...isn't it? Tusspells: ......... Van Zieks: It would seem the proprietress of this repository of novelties was blinded by monetary good. Tusspells: It had nothing to do with money. The man is part of London's criminal history. That is why I had to sculpt him. To record this history. It is the raison d'être of the Tusspells museum. Ryunosuke: But if the man was convicted in a closed court and sent for immediate execution... ...then surely nobody but the members of the judiciary present know the killer's true identity. Tusspells: I can assure you, behind that mask is hidden the true face of the Professor. Van Zieks: Do you realise what you're saying?! The Professor's identity is a national secret! Tusspells: ...I understand. And now that the truth about the special exhibit has been revealed, it must perhaps close. Van Zieks: Of course it will. As will your entire museum, if you don't tread very carefully, madame. Tusspells: That could be another interesting chapter in the history of my family, I think, don't you? Ryunosuke: So ten years ago, on the night of the Professor's execution, you took a wax impression of his face from the corpse? Tusspells: Oui. Exactement.Tusspells: I hid myself until he gave me a signal. ...I was there for a very long time that night.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You were there longer than you expected to be? Tusspells: ...I had some...difficulties in capturing the subject's form correctly. As I removed the mask, the mouth of the cadaver fell open and I had some problems with the chin. Ryunosuke: Dare I ask...? Tusspells: The man had been dead for a short while already, you see. His muscles were relaxing and consequently his chin would not align itself correctly. Susato: Oh dear...what a horrible thought... Tusspells: Under normal circumstances, I would have an assistant with me. However, that night, I was alone. And as a consequence, I missed my preferred window of time. Ryunosuke: What do you mean? Tusspells: When I take the impression of the visage of a cadaver... ...I always wait until three hours after death. Ryunosuke: Why three hours? Is that amount of time significant? Tusspells: It is because of rigor mortis. Ryunosuke: A...wriggly mortice? Susato: It's the name given to a phenomenon that occurs in recently deceased bodies. As a rule, three hours post death, the muscles in the body begin to stiffen. By approximately ten hours post death, the entire body is completely rigid and inflexible. And then from that point on, the muscles slowly start to revert to their relaxed state. The effect is often used to estimate the time of death when a body is discovered! Ryunosuke: ......... Well, that was an education. If a slightly scary one. Tusspells: As the mademoiselle says, rigor mortis commences three hours after death...and it starts in the jaw. Van Zieks: I see. So that's why you wait. Tusspells: Before that time, the mouth falls open...and it is very difficult to do my work. Ryunosuke: Ugh...it's getting hard for me to do my work with all this talk of corpses... (Hm...I wonder about that information the court's just heard from Madame Tusspells...) It's significant Ryunosuke: Um...the information about rigor mortis that you just shared with us... Would you mind including it in your formal testimony? I believe it could be significant, you see. Tusspells: Of course. I do not mind at all. Susato: I can't help feeling that after this latest topic... ...the atmosphere in the courtroom has become extremely...grave. Ryunosuke: ...This is no time for jokes, Miss Susato. Judge: Madame, kindly amend your testimony as discussed. Tusspells: Bien sûr. Changes statement from \"I hid myself until he gave me a signal. ...I was there for a very long time that night.\" to \"It took me a very long time because it was before the onset of rigor mortis.\" Wait and see Ryunosuke: (I think I'd rather pretend I didn't hear any of those grim details and try to forget all about it.) Thank you, madame. Please continue. Tusspells: Certainly. So, you comprehend a little of the process now, and why it took me so long that night. Leads back to cross-examinationTusspells: It took me a very long time because it was before the onset of rigor mortis.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Rigor mortis being the phenomenon you described whereby the corpse becomes stiff after death? I think you said that it starts at the jaw, about three hours post death. Is that right? Tusspells: Oui, c'est ça. Of course the exact duration depends a little on the season. Ryunosuke: I didn't realise a waxwork artisan would be so well versed in the subject. Tusspells: Non non, that is only elementary knowledge in the field of legal medicine. Ryunosuke: (Well I had no idea about it. But maybe I won't admit to my ignorance about forensic science.) Susato: Hm... I could ask my father to give you a very simple primer, if you like! Ryunosuke: ......... I think corpses should be your domain. I'm...not good with them. Susato: Oh dear...I'll do my very best.Present Killer's Autopsy Report Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Madame Tusspells...\"Tusspells: As dawn approached, I was very worried that I could be discovered.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You say that dawn was approaching? What was the time of day, then? Approximately. Tusspells: Well...I could not say. But when I left the cemetery with my utensils and wax, the morning light was becoming visible. Van Zieks: The execution took place on 17th June...which had the earliest sunrise of that year. Judge: Indeed it did. First light would have been at around 4:40 in the morning. Ryunosuke: (That really is early.) Tusspells: The fact is, I had very little time. So I finished my work in a half hour. It was necessary to complete the impression and bury the body before daybreak, of course. If somebody had discovered me there, it would have been a catastrophe. So I had to hurry. Ryunosuke: (Is it me, or does Mr Sholmes seem to be taking shape more quickly now, too?) Judge: Hm... You certainly appear to go to extraordinary lengths for your work, madame. Ryunosuke: (I wonder... is what she just said particularly significant?) It's significant Ryunosuke: Madame, those details about how long it took you to complete the sculpture and the early sunrise... Could you include them in your testimony? I believe they may be significant. Tusspells: Of course, if you would like me to. Susato: You're quite right, Mr Naruhodo. It is intriguing. A sunrise at four in the morning would be absolutely unimaginable at home, wouldn't it? Ryunosuke: ...That's not quite what I meant by 'significant'. Judge: Kindly amend your formal testimony then, madame. Tusspells: With pleasure, My Lord. Changes statement from \"As dawn approached, I was very worried that I could be discovered.\" to \"I hurried to finish my work in the half hour before sunrise. Then I left as soon as the corpse was interred.\" Wait and see Ryunosuke: (All it really told us is that sunrise in Great Britain is extremely early at the height of summer, I suppose) Thank you, madame. That's all clear now. Tusspells: How frustrating, I was not concentrating on Mr Sholmes here and I have taken away too much wax. Leads back to cross-examinationTusspells: I hurried to finish my work in the half hour before sunrise. Then I left as soon as the corpse was interred.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Did you have reason to believe you might be discovered once the sun came up or something? Tusspells: I had paid the gravedigger money to keep my little secret, of course. But with the morning light, I knew that the warden from the prison would commence his patrol of the area. Ryunosuke: Couldn't you just have paid off the warden too, then? Tusspells: I had already paid the gravedigger, as I said. You cannot buy the silence of everyone, or the secret is no longer a secret, uh? Van Zieks: The sunrise was at 4:40 a.m. that day. Which means that it would have been around four when you began your sculpting work. Tusspells: Oui, that must be correct. That would be when the gravedigger gave me the signal to come out of hiding.Ryunosuke: (So that's all I have to go on...)Susato: What's your feeling, Mr Naruhodo?Ryunosuke: For some reason, Dr Sithe went along with Drebber's plan. Now, if that's really true... ...then the Professor is the only other thing we know of that links the pair of them. So I feel sure that waxwork must be a clue to this mystery somehow...Susato: In that case, we must use this cross-examination to uncover exactly what it means! Otherwise the jurors are sure to revert their leanings and the trial will be over!Ryunosuke: I agree. But interestingly... ...uncovering what the Professor has to do with all of this means more to Lord van Zieks than anyone. That's...the impression I'm getting, anyway.Susato: Yes, as do I...Ryunosuke: (After all, he has a profound connection to the Professor as well...)Ryunosuke: Madame Tusspells... I have here an autopsy report that was filed ten years ago now. It confirms the death of the Professor following his execution at the gallows.Tusspells: And...is that a problem?Ryunosuke: I believe it is. Because your testimony, and a particular detail in the report... ...completely contradict one another.Tusspells: Quoi?!Van Zieks: Are you going to explain yourself, my Nipponese friend?Ryunosuke: According to her testimony, Madame Tusspells was creating her wax impression just before dawn. And at that time, rigor mortis had not yet set in. Am I correct so far, madame?Tusspells: You are, yes. As I said, the stiffening of the jaw is the first sign of rigor mortis, two to three hours after death. But the man's chin was limp, so he cannot have been dead for a long time.Ryunosuke: But on the other hand, if you look at Dr Sithe's report... ...it quite clearly states the following: 'Death by hanging confirmed at midnight, 17th June.'Van Zieks: No...!Ryunosuke: If the Professor indeed died at midnight that day... ...then by the time you were sculpting his face, rigor mortis would already have set in.Tusspells: Oui! Yes, you are right. The chin, it would have been completely stiff.Ryunosuke: In other words, this report...is wrong!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: No coroner makes mistakes when recording the time of death! The very idea is absurd!Ryunosuke: In that case, there's only one possible conclusion: The execution didn't actually take place at the stated time!Van Zieks: Im...Impossible!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Counsel, this is beyond folly! Not only do you indict the author of the report, Dr Sithe... ...but you also implicate members of staff at Barclay Prison where the execution took place!Juror No. 1: By heck!Juror No. 3: Extraordinary!Juror No. 6: Not in my day!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: My learned friend appears to have overlooked one very crucial fact.Ryunosuke: What fact?Van Zieks: The Professor died that night. Without question!Tusspells: He did! Of course he did! I moved the man's limp jaw with my own hands! There was no-Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: Yes, the Professor died that night. But what if he didn't die at the gallows?Van Zieks: Didn't die at...? Are you insane?! What...what exactly are you suggesting did happen in that case?Ryunosuke: (It's almost impossible to believe, but it would explain the link... ...between Dr Sithe, the Professor...and that one other person of interest!) I have evidence that will explain exactly what I'm suggesting happened that night!Judge: Counsel, present the evidence at once! The evidence that allegedly explains what really happened on the night of the Professor's execution!Present Ten-Year-Old Article Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"What happened that night is written very plainly in this newspaper article!\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Judge: Erm...what have we here? Van Zieks: Van Zieks: Before considering the night of the execution... ...I would strongly advise the defence to concentrate on what is happening right now in this courtroom. Ryunosuke: What? Judge: Quite. The next time you present such a nonsensical article, Counsel... ...you may find that tonight is the night of your own execution! Ryunosuke: (Great. I'm so looking forward to trying again now...) Susato: I won't let anyone execute you, Mr Naruhodo! Not tonight! Leads back to: \"Counsel, present the evidence at once!\"Ryunosuke: What happened that night is written very plainly in this newspaper article! 'Executed criminal returns in the dead of night at local cemetery!'Van Zieks: You're suggesting it was a corpse, coming back from the dead now?!Ryunosuke: Well, if this article is to be believed, yes. The Professor, assumed dead following his execution, emerged from his grave...and was killed again!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: Don't be a fool! That's simply a rumour published by the gutter press!Ryunosuke: Can you be certain of that?Van Zieks: Are you serious?!Ryunosuke: The point is, as the article says, there was a witness to what happened.Judge: My word! Yes, indeed!Tusspells: Mais oui! The young man who stole into the cemetery by chance that night!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: Of course there was a witness. The story didn't write itself! But obviously the man made it all up!Judge: And in any case, this was ten years ago now. There would surely be no hope of finding him.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: On the contrary, My Lord. We all know this witness well!Van Zieks: What?Judge: Are you suggesting, Counsel, that you've identified the person in question? That you know who claims to have seen these utterly incredible events take place?Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord. (In fact, you could say that he's right here before my very eyes!)Judge: You will substantiate your latest claim now then, Counsel. Who is the alleged witness of this staggering scene from the cemetery ten years ago?Present Enoch Drebber profile Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The man in question...is Mr Enoch Drebber!\"Present anyone else Ryunosuke: Judge: ......... I must say, I\"m quite staggered by the scene I see before me now, Counsel. That of a young man with his eyes tightly shut, clearly pointing out a person at random. Van Zieks: At least have the decency to open your eyes and face the result of your blunder, for heaven's sake. Ryunosuke: Gyaaaaaagh! Susato: And perhaps you should keep your eyes open when you collapse on the bench like that, too. For safety's sake. Ryunosuke: ...I'll bear it in mind. Leads back to: \"You will substantiate your latest claim now then, Counsel.\"Ryunosuke: The man in question...is Mr Enoch Drebber!Van Zieks: Drebber?!Judge: The, the previous witness?Ryunosuke: The special exhibit in the House of Horrors at Madame Tusspells Museum of Waxwork... ...recreates that decade-old scene in great detail. The condemned criminal emerging from the grave... And beside the tomb... ...a young man with a lantern stumbling upon the terrifying sight. And that young man... ...is a ten-year-younger Mr Enoch Drebber!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!! Surely not, Counsel?Van Zieks: Drebber was there? In Lowgate Cemetery?Tusspells: Um... What is all this talk about Mr Drebber? Is the name significant?Ryunosuke: (Of course. Madam [sic] Tusspells doesn't know, does she?) Yes. It's extremely significant, madame. To your situation as well, in fact.Tusspells: What situation?Ryunosuke: The theft of the Professor waxwork from your museum some days ago... ...was perpetrated by the very same man.Tusspells: Non! But...but that would mean...Van Zieks: ......... Madame Tusspells... ...it would appear you know the name...Enoch Drebber.Tusspells: ......... Oui. yes, I know it. But from long ago in the past.Ryunosuke: What?!Susato: Oh my!Judge: Good gracious!Van Zieks: Explain yourself! Tell us everything you know!Tusspells: Yes... Yes, of course.The story of the young man and the terrible sight he witnessed in the cemetery ten years ago... ...was published in every single newspaper in London and throughout Great Britain. However... ...in all of the articles, the witness was simply described as 'a certain young man'. No details were published about his identity. His name was never revealed. That is, apart from in one newspaper.Tusspells: The Daily Circus. It is the paper from which comes the article I have already shown the court.Ryunosuke: You're saying that his full name was only publicised in that article?Judge: Goodness me! Yes, here it is! 'The university student who experienced this shocking event is Mr Enoch Drebber... ...a disciple of science at the University of London, and a resident of its student dorms.'Ryunosuke: Unbelievable!Tusspells:When I read the article, I went to meet with the man. His discovery of the condemned criminal coming back to life in the cemetery in the dead of night... ...would make a perfect exhibit for my House of Horrors, whether it was the truth or not.Judge: I see. So you went to meet Mr Drebber in order to sculpt a waxwork of the man, did you?Tusspells: Exactement. He was studying science at the University of London in those days. He was just a poor student. I paid him five pounds to model for the waxwork. And since that time, it has been in my museum to recreate the scene of terror from the cemetery.Ryunosuke: So, ten years ago, a young man appealed to the public about an extraordinary event he'd witnessed: A criminal who had been put to death, re-emerging from his grave in the middle of the night. But the public treated his claim as nothing more than an amusing anecdote...that was soon forgotten. Ten years later... ...the same man steals a waxwork model of the executed criminal... ...ostensibly to use as a body double for the victim in the case we're discussing here today. Even though the waxwork's build is a poor match for the victim, and its face is obscured by a mask. So the question is...why would the man do such a thing?Van Zieks: .........Ryunosuke: Which brings us to three days ago, when the birdcage crashed into the Crystal Tower. If the birdcage had in fact contained not the body of Mr Asman, but that same waxwork... ...the coroner from Scotland Yard who investigated, Dr Sithe, would have noticed immediately. And yet she submitted this autopsy report for the victim, which the court has seen earlier. Why?Van Zieks: Because the waxwork was that of the Professor, is that what you're saying?Ryunosuke: Dr Sithe put her name to a document confirming the death of a condemned criminal who was still alive. A criminal whose apparent 'resurrection' was witnessed by Mr Drebber. But that misconduct was a deadly secret the coroner would do anything to protect. Which is precisely why Mr Drebber used that particular waxwork as the body double!Van Zieks: Aaaaaargh...!Ryunosuke: My Lord! This court must summon Dr Sithe to the stand! The defence is determined...to find out exactly how the coroner and Mr Drebber are connected!Van Zieks: ...!Judge: But according to the missive I received this morning through the Prosecutor's Office... ...Dr Sithe is unable to participate in these proceedings. Is that not the case?Van Zieks: .........Susato: She told us so herself, didn't she?Sithe: Lord van Zieks won't be summoning me as a witness. Lord Stronghart has forbidden it.Ryunosuke: Lord Stronghart?Sithe: The Pandora's box you were warned about...is the Professor case. But please don't make the mistake of thinking you'll get any information about it out of me.Ryunosuke: (Something happened on the night of that killer's execution ten years ago. And surely nobody would want to get to the bottom of that more...than Lord van Zieks!)Van Zieks: ......... The prosecution calls...for the instructions in that missive to be scrapped!Ryunosuke: ...!Judge: But, but Lord van Zieks! The missive was issued from the Lord Chief Justice's office.Van Zieks:Van Zieks: The assigned prosecutor has the final say on policy in any particular trial. In other words...me.Ryunosuke: Yes...!Van Zieks: Let Enoch Drebber and Dr Sithe...both take the stand together.Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Very well, I will uphold your request. Bailiff! Send a subpoena with immediate effect, addressed to Dr Sithe of the Forensic Investigation Team. The woman is compelled to attend on Her Majesty's orders!Ryunosuke: (Alright then. Enoch Drebber and Dr Sithe... If they weren't colluding with one another, this crime could never have been committed. I'm just a stone's throw away, I can feel it. The truth behind all of this is about to come out!)Van Zieks: Thank you for your attendance at such short notice... Dr Sithe.Sithe: I'm disappointed in you, Lord van Zieks. You've completely betrayed the agreed policy of both Scotland Yard and the Prosecutor's Office.Van Zieks: Betrayal is not in my nature...as long as the truth isn't compromised. If it is... If there's even a hint of wrongdoing...then no matter whom it concerns or disgruntles... ...I will pursue the matter to the bitter end. As would any prosecutor worth his salt.Sithe: .........Ryunosuke: Mr Drebber... ...you took the victim's life by means of a machine that you constructed in your workshop.Drebber: .........Ryunosuke: And Dr Sithe... ...as the investigating coroner, you were the first on the scene to examine the victim's body. It is the belief of the defence... ...that you collaborated with each other and were both complicit in this crime.Sithe: And where's your evidence?Ryunosuke: At present, we have no definitive evidence. But we do have a very significant clue.Sithe: What are you talking about?Ryunosuke: I'm talking, of course, about the waxwork! This model of the killer known as the Professor...who was sentenced to death ten years ago.Sithe: You don't need to tell me. I witnessed the man's execution with my own eyes. And officially pronounced him dead.Ryunosuke: ...That remains to be seen.Sithe: Is that so?Ryunosuke: According to newspaper reports from the time, on the night following his execution... ...the killer came back to life.Sithe: Tsk! Don't waste my time!Ryunosuke: And the sole witness to that mysterious event... ...was you, Mr Drebber, wasn't it?Drebber: .........Ryunosuke: If what you saw in the graveyard that night ten years ago wasn't some chilling fiction, but reality... ...it would make you privy to a very great secret of Dr Sithe's. A secret so profound, it could compel the coroner to agree to collaborate in your evil scheme, in fact.Drebber: .........Ryunosuke: Mr Drebber, tell the court! Tell everyone the truth of what you saw that night in Lowgate Cemetery!Drebber: .........So he was the student who saw it... You can see the resemblance actually, can't you? With the man in Madame Tusspells, I mean. Surely he's not going to claim that's really what he saw. Especially not after all these years. He was a research student at the University of London, was he? And a bit too clever for his own good, if you ask me... Kuh kuh kuh...Drebber: What an interesting twist.Ryunosuke: ...?Drebber: When at the time, not one person would take me seriously. Yet now here we are, ten years later, and suddenly my story matters. And in a court of law, too. Very well, then. If everyone so wishes. Let's be frank. I'll tell you the truth of what happened that night...for what it's worth.Sithe: .........Drebber: .........Judge: So, Mr Drebber... ...your testimony, please. About the events of that night ten years ago. You will tell the court exactly what you stumbled across in Lowgate Cemetery!Drebber: Yes of course. As you wish.Witness Testimony - In The Cemetery Ten Years Earlier -Drebber: The reason I was in Lowgate Cemetery at all ten years ago was for...a spot of moonlighting, shall we say? Yes, the illustration in that newspaper article was based on what I witnessed that night. But thinking back now, I realise that I never actually saw the Professor. Soon afterwards, I was visited by a young woman who sculpted a model of me from wax. Then I gave up on my dream of becoming a scientist. And it was all because of that newspaper article.Ryunosuke: Wait a minute! You're, you're claiming you didn't actually see the Professor now?!Drebber: Of course. You'd have to have a screw loose if you believed a corpse could come back from the dead.Ryunosuke: But... So you're saying this article is...Drebber: ...Not worth the paper it's printed on? I think that would describe it perfectly, yes.Ryunosuke: Agh!Susato: If the details in the article aren't true... ...it nullifies your argument for why Mr Drebber and Dr Sithe would have been working together.Ryunosuke: (So he's discrediting himself to cripple my argument?!)Judge: Tell me, witness... ...you claim to have been in the cemetery on some... auxiliary business. Can you elaborate?Drebber: That's right. Graverobbing, to be precise. As you know, Lowgate Cemetery is at the rear of Barclay Prison. So among students at the university, it had a reputation for being haunted by the ghosts of condemned convicts.Judge: G-Graverobbing, you say?!Drebber: Yes. Exhuming fresh corpses to sell is reasonably lucrative. Of course, I never laid a finger on any valuables buried with the dead.Van Zieks: So you were one of the so-called Resurrectionists. A particularly unpleasant scourge on society.Drebber: Actually, my fellows and I went by another name: 'The Repurposers'.Judge: That, that is quite beyond the pale! You would invite divine retribution, sir!Drebber: Yes, well...I think I suffered retribution enough. The Daily Circus...eventually unearthed my name and put it in print. It caused me a great many headaches. In the end, I had to leave the university. ...That was the only paper with the bad grace to identify me unambiguously, I might add.Ryunosuke: I see...Van Zieks: Out of interest, who drew the illustration for this article?Drebber: Ah yes, that was the reporter who exposed me. He sketched that right in front of me as I described the scene. Obviously, as time ticked on, I bitterly regretted what I'd done. Claiming to have seen something I never truly saw... Foolish. Very foolish.Judge: Hmmm... Well, Counsel for the Defence...you may proceed to the cross-examination now.Ryunosuke: At once, My Lord.Cross-Examination - In The Cemetery Ten Years Earlier -Drebber: The reason I was in Lowgate Cemetery at all ten years ago was for...a spot of moonlighting, shall we say?Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: By 'moonlighting', you mean graverobbing, do you? Drebber: Surely you only need to look at the graveyard scene and my appearance to gauge the answer to that? Van Zieks: The lantern and spade... Ryunosuke: But who on earth would want to buy a dead body? Sithe: Any major hospital. Ryunosuke: A hospital?! Sithe: In order to better understand the human body, the study of anatomy is crucial to medical science. But there isn't a hospital in the world that has enough 'specimens' to work with. ...Though obviously they can't openly express an interest in obtaining more by dubious means. Drebber: As aspiring scientists, we young research students had no money to work with, as I'm sure you can imagine. So we made surreptitious arrangements with a hospital via some of our medical student acquaintances. We would never take anything of value from the graves. This was all for the furtherance of science, you see. That's what we all told ourselves every time we stole into the graveyard at night, spade in hand. Van Zieks: You realise body-snatching is a serious crime. If you were caught, you could expect the gravest of consequences. Drebber: We students were caught between the hammer and the anvil. We needed funds for research. Ryunosuke: (Professor Harebrayne said exactly the same...) Judge: I'm quite speechless at the apparent levity with which you've revealed this abhorrent behaviour. Drebber: Well, if you wanted to know why I was there at Lowgate Cemetery, that's the reason. But I never expected it to end the way it did. That...I regret to this day.Drebber: Yes, the illustration in that newspaper article was based on what I witnessed that night.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: The strange happening at Lowgate Cemetery...which you now deny. Drebber: Not entirely. I ran to fetch the police at the time, you know. I was shaking like a leaf. But they didn't believe a word of it. In fact, I was very nearly arrested myself. Ryunosuke: So you went to the papers instead? Drebber: I started big, with the London News. But unsurprisingly, they didn't want to know, either. In the end, though, it was reporters from the gossip rags, the gutter press, that came to get my story. And it spread like the plague through the capital, as gossip-hungry Londoners lapped up the tale. Van Zieks: The story was in every single paper at the time, with the exception of some broadsheets. Drebber: And yet only two or three of them actually interviewed me personally. Most of the accounts turned out to be very...interpretive ghost stories. Ryunosuke: What about the article in the Daily Circus? Drebber: That particular journalist found me at my dormitory. I don't know how, but he'd discovered my name. So I recounted to him exactly what had happened that night. Ryunosuke: And from your description, he drew this illustration? Drebber: Precisely. That's how I learnt that the condemned man was the infamous Professor. Because the reporter told me so. I had no idea myself, you see. Van Zieks: Newspaper reporters are wont to snoop around in matters that don't concern them. So the scene portrayed in the illustration is accurate, then? Drebber: Well...Drebber: Thinking back now, I realise that I never actually saw the Professor at all, though.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What are you talking about? Drebber: I think I explained already, didn't I? Lowgate Cemetery is at the rear of Barclay Prison. So it was renowned among us students at the university for being haunted by the ghosts of condemned convicts. For some absurd reason, I was scared of the graveyard at night. And as a result...only too willing to believe that nonsense about the dead coming back to life. Ryunosuke: But you said you actually saw it. Drebber: I said what I'd seen in my mind's eye. After all...resurrection is impossible, isn't it? You'd have to be unhinged to think otherwise. Unless of course... ...you have some evidence that proves I encountered the Professor that night? Ryunosuke: ......... (I don't know. Is there any material evidence that could show he really did see the Professor?) Susato: If we have anything at all, Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: I know. I need to present it against that irritatingly backtracking statement of his! Drebber: The point is, that night was a pivotal moment in my life.Present Ten-Year-Old Article Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Sorry, Mr Drebber, but I don't believe that. Drebber: Don't believe what? Ryunosuke: Your latest claim. You did see the Professor on that night ten years ago. Drebber: Hm, oh dear, we seem to be at odds. But I was there. And you were not. I know what I didn't see. Ryunosuke: The illustration with this article... ...was drawn based upon what you told the journalist that you witnessed. A figure emerging from a tomb...wearing an iron mask. Drebber: ...! Van Zieks: Yes, when the killer was tried ten years ago... ...it was decided in the closed court's ruling that the man would wear the mask to hide his identity. It wasn't to be removed even during his execution and subsequent burial. Judge: Not even the prison wardens were to see the man's face. But obviously, the provision of this mask was not public knowledge. Ryunosuke: So, Mr Drebber, as you've just heard... Drebber: Agh! Ryunosuke: ...a lowly student of the University of London certainly wouldn't have known about the condemned man's mask. So unless you'd actually seen the Professor that night... ...it's inconceivable that the artist would have included the mask in that illustration! Drebber: Aaaaaargh! Judge: Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! ...Well, Mr Drebber? Drebber: ......... It's a vile scene, isn't it? If you look closely. Ryunosuke: ...! Drebber: And as I've already been at pains to point out, I was utterly petrified. Which is why I had it in my head that I'd seen such a blood-curdling sight. But afterwards, I came to my senses. And realised that I'd been mistaken. Ryunosuke: You... You're still saying you didn't see it?! Van Zieks: If you're stubbornly sticking to that story, witness... ...then amend your testimony to explain exactly how you think your eyes deceived you. Drebber: Of course, of course. Only too happy to oblige. Ryunosuke: (I can't believe he's still not going to concede the point!) Drebber: ......... Changes statement from \"Thinking back now, I realise that I never actually saw the Professor at all, though.\" to \"What I in fact witnessed, was a fellow graverobber at work.\"Drebber: What I in fact witnessed, was a fellow graverobber at work.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: A fellow graverobber? What are you talking about? Drebber: Well, I wasn't the only one busy in the cemetery that night, you know. Other body snatchers were at work. Of course, when I saw one emerging from the hole he'd dug, my heart very nearly stopped. So that's the terrifying sight I actually saw, you see. Van Zieks: You're claiming it was just another student on equally insalubrious business as yourself? Drebber: Many of the medical students would wear metal masks to protect them from bacteria during dissections. Clearly the fellow was using such a mask to protect his anonymity...wouldn't you say? Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But there's more to the story, isn't there? The article goes on to say: 'In the next second, a gunshot rang out suddenly from behind. The bullet pierced the resurrected man's chest, whose breath then stilled once more.' Judge: We might assume that the sexton discovered the miscreants at work, perhaps? And fired upon one of them. Ryunosuke: If a gravedigger had shot someone in the cemetery, I think it might have been rather big news, My Lord. Judge: Ah! Yes, well... Drebber: I can only assume it was an embellishment bolted on later by the reporter. Pursue Esmeralda Tusspells (before adding statement) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Madame Tusspells! ...Don't take it out on Mr Sholmes. Tusspells: ......... Oh là là! Pardon. I was...lost in my thoughts. Ryunosuke: Would it be fair to say that Mr Drebber's last remark... ...was significant to you in some way? Tusspells: ......... I thought it was a little strange, that is all. How Monsieur Drebber could claim this now. Drebber: If you don't mind me saying, madame... What are you talking about? Tusspells: Well, when I met you ten years ago at your university dormitory... ...you recounted to me about your adventures in the cemetery, non? Including the gunshot... Drebber: Stop! You might want to watch your tongue, you know! Van Zieks: Van Zieks: Have a care, Drebber. That's no way to speak to a lady. Drebber: Grrr... Ryunosuke: Please, Madame Tusspells, carry on. Tusspells: Of course. According to what Monsieur Drebber told me at the time... ...he did hear a gunshot from behind him, and the bullet hit the condemned man. Drebber: I said nothing of the sort! Tusspells: Non, you were very explicit about the details. About the mask that the figure was wearing... ...and the blood that splattered over you when he was shot. Drebber: Enough! Shut up, woman! You're making all this up! Judge: That will do! Mr Drebber... Drebber: Hm? Yes? Judge: You refute the account just given by Madame Tusspells? Drebber: ......... I have no recollection of ever saying those things. Ryunosuke: Come on! Do you really expect us to believe you?! Judge: Control yourself, Counsel. I will not permit baseless accusations in my courtroom. Ryunosuke: Right... Judge: Under the circumstances... ...I think it best that you supplement your testimony with a statement to clarify your position on this, witness. Drebber: V...Very well. Van Zieks: ......... Adds statement \"There was no gunshot from behind me at all. Nor any splattering blood.\" Ryunosuke: An embellishment? Drebber: As I explained earlier, most of what the papers published about those events was fabricated nonsense. The journalists had a great time fashioning it into a horrifying ghost story. Ryunosuke: So...now you're saying there was no gunshot? Drebber: That's right, yes. I'm afraid so. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Drebber: I mistakenly thought I'd seen a corpse coming back to life and then fled the scene. That's really all that happened.Drebber: There was no gunshot from behind me at all. Nor any splattering blood.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Yet Madame Tusspells has testified that you told her about both of those details. Drebber: Not true. I said nothing of the sort. Van Zieks: Ten years have passed. Without material evidence to the contrary, you have no grounds on which to question the witness's word. Ryunosuke: Agh! Tell me, Madame Tusspells... Tusspells: Oui? Ryunosuke: ...what exactly did Mr Drebber say about the blood that apparently spattered on him? Tusspells: Alors, this is what he told me: All of a sudden, he heard a very loud gunshot from behind his back. The bullet hit the figure who was emerging from the tomb in the middle of the chest. In his heart. Judge: Hm... One dreadful sight after another... Tusspells: And since Monsieur Drebber was at that time facing towards the condemned man... ...the blood sprayed from the wound and spattered on his body. That is what he told me. Ryunosuke: So...not an experience you would ever forget, is it? Drebber: Precisely. And I didn't forget it. Because, as I've already said... ...it never happened in the first place. Ryunosuke: (He's clearly lying. If only I had some evidence to prove it...) Susato: We can't let him win, Mr Naruhodo! So we mustn't overlook a single detail, no matter how small!Present Camera (after examining bloodstain on bellows and pressing statement \"Soon afterwards, I was visited by a young woman who sculpted a model of me from wax.\") Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Mr Drebber, do you remember this camera?\"Drebber: Soon afterwards, I was visited by a young woman who sculpted a model of me from wax.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: That young woman being Madame Tusspells, of course. Drebber: Precisely. I must say, I didn't expect to run into her again like this ten years later. Tusspells: As I have explained... ...I went by the name published in the article, and... comme ça I found the man. Ryunosuke: Yes, the article in the Daily Circus, I think you said. Drebber: I was a poor student with barely a penny to my name at the time. And the young lady put five pounds in front of me. Van Zieks: So you readily consented to having a waxwork of yourself made and gave permission for it to be put on display. Drebber: I did. I should sell what little I had to sell, I concluded. Tusspells: Ah, oui, I remember now... ...I purchased something else from you that day, n'est-ce pas? Drebber: Did you? I can't say I remember. Ryunosuke: What was it, madame? Tusspells: His camera. Ryunosuke: Ah... Drebber: Oh yes. I made a point of taking it with me whenever I... made an excursion into any cemetery. Judge: You took a camera with you, sir? To what end? Drebber: To record the details of the bodies I disinterred. But I had no intention of ever visiting a graveyard again after that night...so I sold it. Judge: Hm, I see... Tusspells: But I still have it, monsieur. It is part of the special exhibit in my House of Horrors. I am very meticulous about such details. It is the Tusspells way. Susato: It would seem, then... ...that this is the very camera Mr Drebber took with him to Lowgate Cemetery on the night in question. Ryunosuke: Yes. Interesting... The details of the camera have been updated in the Court Record.Press (subsequent times) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: That young woman being Madame Tusspells, of course. Drebber: Precisely. I must say, I didn't expect to run into her again like this ten years later. Tusspells: As I have explained... ...I went by the name published in the article, and... comme ça I found the man. Ryunosuke: Yes, the article in the Daily Circus, I think you said. Drebber: I was a poor student with barely a penny to my name at the time. And the young lady put five pounds in front of me. Van Zieks: So you readily consented to having a waxwork of yourself made and gave permission for it to be put on display. Drebber: I did. I should sell what little I had to sell, I concluded.

Ryunosuke: Ah... Drebber: Oh yes. I made a point of taking it with me whenever I... made an excursion into any cemetery. Judge: You took a camera with you, sir? To what end? Drebber: To record the details of the bodies I disinterred. But I had no intention of ever visiting a graveyard again after that night...so I sold it. Judge: Hm, I see...

Susato: It would seem, then... ...that this is the very camera Mr Drebber took with him to Lowgate Cemetery on the night in question. Ryunosuke: Yes. Interesting...Examine evidence Camera Back side Ryunosuke: This is where the photographic plate goes, I think, isn't it? Susato: Yes, that's right. Isn't it incredible to think that this is the actual camera Mr Drebber used that night? I certainly never imagined a piece of evidence would be on display in Madame Tusspells! Ryunosuke: She's very keen on everything being as true to life as possible though, isn't she?Drebber: Then I gave up on my dream of becoming a scientist. And it was all because of that newspaper article.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: This article, you mean? Published in the Daily Circus? Drebber: Yes. Somebody informed the dean that it was my name that appeared in the article. And carelessly let slip that night after night, I was digging up graves. Hardly a model student, you might say. The university's reputation was execrably defiled, and I was expelled as a result. Tusspells: Mon Dieu, I had no idea... Van Zieks: And having been run out of university, you found employment in a somewhat...specialist trade. Drebber: ......... Ryunosuke: You combined your knowledge of science with your knowledge of stage magic... ...to create various 'experimental machines' intended to demonstrate never-before-seen technology. And you used those deceptive machines to trick the government and private investors into giving you money. Drebber: ......... Ryunosuke: Professor Albert Harebrayne was just your latest victim, wasn't he? Drebber: Whatever are you talking about? I have no recollection of doing anything of the sort. Sithe: .........Ryunosuke: (What's Drebber up to? Why would he suddenly change his tune and recant his claim?)Susato: I wonder if perhaps...it's because his circumstances have changed now.Ryunosuke: What circumstances?Susato: Well...if he admits to having seen the Professor emerging alive from his grave ten years ago... ...it will expose a secret in Dr Sithe's past that she would desperately want to hide.Ryunosuke: Yes, of course! If Drebber and Dr Sithe are working together now... ...then if Drebber were to betray her, there would be no reason for her to continue to cooperate. (In that case, there's only one way around it. I'll have to prove he really did see it. Prove he really did see the Professor's corpse coming back from the dead as he originally claimed!)Susato: Yes, Mr Naruhodo! Exactly!Ryunosuke: Mr Drebber, do you remember this camera?Drebber: ...!Tusspells: But...that is the camera from that fateful night!Ryunosuke: Yes, we...borrowed it from the House of Horrors. It's the camera you took with you to the cemetery that night, Mr Drebber.Drebber: ......... And...is that supposed to be significant?Ryunosuke: This kind of camera is rarely seen in our homeland, so my colleague and I were keen to examine it closely. We noticed that the lens extends forwards on the end of some bellows... ...like this.Van Zieks:Van Zieks: What's that? There...just on the bellows... It looks like...a dark red stain...Drebber: Ah...Ryunosuke: That's right. It's a rather conspicuous mark here on the bellows, in fact.Judge: Good Lord! Are you suggesting...?Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord. It would appear to be a spatter of blood.Susato: Something that could be confirmed with a simple chemical test. Isn't that right, Dr Sithe?Sithe: ...! It would be difficult to determine if it was human blood and not the blood of some animal. But yes, to test whether or not it's blood at all is simple enough.Ryunosuke: I propose that Madame Tusspells's testimony was correct. And that on the night in question ten years ago...you were spattered with blood from the gunshot wound.Drebber: Well I...Ryunosuke: And that furthermore...you really did witness the condemned Professor emerging from his tomb!Drebber: Grrr... Gaaaaaaaaaaaagh!Ryunosuke: There's simply no way you could have forgotten such a traumatic experience! In other words, the only explanation... ...is that you're trying to hide the fact that you saw the Professor that night!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: But why?! Why would he want to do that?Ryunosuke: Well...not for his own gain, it would seem.Van Zieks: For whose, then? Who could benefit?Ryunosuke: Mr Drebber is obviously lying in order to protect somebody.Judge: My goodness! He's shielding someone?Drebber: .........Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord. And clearly... ...it's someone who doesn't want the truth about the Professor 'coming back to life' to be exposed!Judge: Well, Counsel, who is it then? Who is this witness trying to protect by lying about what he saw that night?Present Courtney Sithe profile Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The obvious answer...is Dr Sithe!\"Present anyone else Ryunosuke: Judge: Good gracious. That's certainly not the answer I was expecting! Ryunosuke: (Uh-oh! That's not the reaction I was expecting either.) Van Zieks: I suggest...you go and crawl into a tomb. Maybe then you'll emerge with a better grasp on the case. Ryunosuke: Uwaaaaaagh! Susato: Fear not, Mr Naruhodo! I'll shield you, even if I must lie to do it! I'll tell them that such a terrible mistake is completely out of character! Ryunosuke: (...I can't have Susato-san committing perjury for me. No. No more mistakes. I need to get this right now!) Leads back to: \"Well, Counsel, who is it then?\"Ryunosuke: The obvious answer...is Dr Sithe!Van Zieks: Sithe...?Judge: What, whatever do you mean?Sithe: .........Ryunosuke: Imagine if the convict who'd been sentenced to death was not in fact killed... Imagine if that was to come to light...Sithe: What are you insinuating?Ryunosuke: And imagine if the convict in question was the country's most hated mass murderer... ...if it was the Professor...Judge: That, that would be an unprecedented scandal!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: This is beyond a joke! Need I point out that the dead cannot come back to life? What you're suggesting would mean...that the execution never actually happened.Ryunosuke: Yes, that's exactly what it would mean.Van Zieks:Van Zieks: Once a man is sent to the gallows, he hangs. No one could escape. Not in Great Britain.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: But the fact is...there was a witness to the fact that the man did escape his hanging!Judge: If that were really true, Counsel, the implications of misconduct would not stop at the supervising coroner. It would taint the honour of the entire judiciary, from the ground up!Sithe: .........Ryunosuke: And it's exactly because of those monumental repercussions... ...that Dr Sithe would consent to any demand made of her by someone who threatened to expose the secret. Even if that meant being complicit in a crime.Judge: You, you mean...Ryunosuke: I mean that Dr Sithe wasn't collaborating in Mr Drebber's wicked scheme... ...she was coerced into collaborating! In order to protect her decade-old secret... ...she switched the dead body of Mr Asman with the waxwork model and fabricated the autopsy report!Sithe: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!Ryunosuke: L-Lord van Zieks!Van Zieks: Pray forgive my freshly filled hallowed chalice...and a whole raft of other discourtesies now.Judge: Goodness me!Van Zieks: It's just the sort of tall tale Londoners would enjoy, I grant you. An executed killer rising from the dead... A Scotland Yard cover-up... A conspiracy at the highest levels... So let me ask you one thing...Ryunosuke: What's that?Van Zieks: If the condemned man really did emerge from his tomb that night only to be shot in the chest... ...who pulled the trigger and disposed of him forever?Ryunosuke: Uh, well... (I have no idea at the moment!)Susato: We have too little information to work that out at present, I think.Ryunosuke: I, I couldn't agree more...Van Zieks: The Old Bailey is no place for wild fantasies.Ryunosuke: Ugh...Van Zieks: And have you considered this, my learned Nipponese friend?Ryunosuke: Considered what?Van Zieks: Do you realise just what a dangerous endeavour it would be to coerce this woman into such criminal activity? It's tantamount to declaring war on the entire British police force and judiciary.Juror No. 4: Quite. Hard to imagine any sum of money being offered for research could warrant it.Juror No. 3: To rely on some stage deception when so much is at stake would be madness.Ryunosuke: Well, well I suppose...Van Zieks: And this was no petty crime, either. The victim was murdered. A man who'd already invested money in the venture, and would be instrumental in future profits, too.Drebber: Yes, I had no reason to kill Mr Asman at all. Or are you forgetting that his death results in me receiving not a single penny? The court is already aware of the contract between myself and the victim, no?Judge: Hmmm... There is the contract, that's very true...Ryunosuke: ......... (The motive for this case runs deep, though. I can feel it.)Susato: Using threats to force the head of the Forensic Investigation Team to cooperate is extreme. Especially for a government grant he had no guarantee of receiving in the first place.Ryunosuke: ...If the research grant was the aim, taking Mr Asman's life would have made no sense anyway. Which means... ...Mr Drebber's motive wasn't money at all. He was...just trying to kill Mr Asman! (But why? What WAS his motive, then?)Van Zieks: Your time is up, my learned friend. I'd say you have one last chance before the jury lose their patience with this charade.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: Let's see if you can back up your heady proposal, shall we? How do you explain why this engineer would throw all caution to the wind and threaten his own country?Judge: At this point, I'm not prepared to listen to more of this outlandish conjecture without proof. So, Counsel...present your evidence.Ryunosuke: (Alright... Who exactly was Mr Asman to Drebber? There's a connection there that no one's seen yet. And I'm going to have to present two pieces of evidence to show what it is.) Yes, My Lord. The evidence that establishes a motive and explains why the witness wanted the victim dead is right here!Present Drebber's Contract Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Mr Drebber, I have here the contract that you signed with Mr Asman. Drebber: Yes, that's right. The very document, in fact... ...that proves I had no reason to kill the man. Ryunosuke: No, I'm afraid not. As it turns out... ...this contract actually helps to establish the real motive for the murder you committed. Judge: It does? Well I never! Drebber: What are you talking about? Read it again, you idiot! Ryunosuke: I'm not finished. In order to demonstrate what your motive really was... ...I need this contract...and one other piece of evidence! Van Zieks: What other evidence? Judge: Counsel, you will present your supplementary evidence without delay. The evidence, which when cross-referenced with the contract, establishes a motive for the deed! Present Ten-Year-Old Article Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"It's this newspaper article, My Lord.\" Present anything else Ryunosuke: Judge: I think it's fair to say that after your presentation of evidence, Counsel, we have only half the story. Ryunosuke: That's right, My Lord. Which is why I just presented another piece of evidence to complete it! Van Zieks: Clearly my learned friend only had half an education. And irony wasn't included on the syllabus. So let me put this in words of zero syllables that even you will understand. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Wait! I see it now! It's a play on 'syllabus' and 'syllables'! That's the irony! Susato: ...That was just a pun, Mr Naruhodo. The irony was...elsewhere. Ryunosuke: Oh. Judge: Your argument clearly does not stand without this second piece of evidence, which remains elusive. Ryunosuke: Ah, yes! Sorry, My Lord! (The evidence I need to supplement the contract... I know it's right in front of my eyes!) Leads back to: \"Counsel, you will present your supplementary evidence without delay.\" Ryunosuke: It's this newspaper article, My Lord. Van Zieks: That was written ten years ago...and every detail has been examined already. What can it possibly tell us? Drebber: That drivel should never have been written! It's typical gutter press nonsense that means nothing! Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But there's something significant that this newspaper article and the contract have in common. Leads to: \"Really?\"Present Ten-Year-Old Article Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: It's this newspaper article, My Lord. Van Zieks: That was written ten years ago...and every detail has been examined already. What can it possibly tell us? Drebber: That drivel should never have been written! It's typical gutter press nonsense that means nothing! Ryunosuke: Yes, on its own, it isn't particularly significant. However... ...when considered alongside another piece of evidence... ...it will completely explain your motive for wanting Mr Asman dead. Van Zieks: What other evidence? Judge: Counsel, you will present your supplementary evidence without delay. The evidence, which when cross-referenced with the newspaper article, establishes a motive for the deed! Present Drebber's Contract Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"It's this contract, My Lord.\" Present anything else Ryunosuke: Judge: I think it's fair to say that after your presentation of evidence, Counsel, we have only half the story.

Mr Drebber, this is the contract you signed with Mr Asman. Drebber: Yes, that's right. The very document, in fact... ...that proves I had no reason to kill the man. Ryunosuke: No, I'm afraid not. Drebber: What? Ryunosuke: There's something very significant that this newspaper article and the contract have in common. Leads to: \"Really?\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: If indeed this piece of evidence reveals the motive... Judge: ......... 'If', Counsel? Ryunosuke: .........Yes. If it did...it would be great, I was thinking. Or hoping, anyway. ...Well, wishing, really. Judge: Are you treating my courtroom like a fountain that grants wishes when you throw money into it? Ryunosuke: (I knew I should have thrown more than a farthing in last time I was at the park...) Susato: I don't think this has anything to do with your offerings to the gods, Mr Naruhodo. Leads back to: \"At this point, I'm not prepared to listen to more of this outlandish conjecture without proof.\"Judge: Really?Ryunosuke: And it's that common link... ...that shows very clearly why you were determined to kill Mr Odie Asman!Van Zieks: It seems the defence has uncovered something the rest of us have missed. So, my learned friend...point out what these two pieces of evidence have in common. Where exactly is the link between this newspaper article and the contract?Present signature Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"What these two pieces of evidence have in common...\"Present anywhere else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Well...if you look just here... Judge: What am I supposed to be seeing there? Ryunosuke: J-J-Just here...is what the two...have in common! Judge: ......... That they're both made of paper won't do, Counsel. Susato: Mr Naruhodo, I feel sure you've already noticed what the contract and article have in common. But just in case it's slipped your mind...look closely at the illustration! Judge: I think perhaps you had better try that again. Van Zieks: ...For what good it will do. Leads back to: \"Where exactly is the link between this newspaper article and the contract?\"Ryunosuke: What these two pieces of evidence have in common... ...is a signature.Judge: A, a signature?Ryunosuke: The signature on the illustration that accompanies the ten-year-old article and the signature on the contract... ...belong to the same person!Van Zieks: What?!Drebber: Agh...............Ryunosuke: As the court has heard, this illustration was drawn ten years ago... ...by the newspaper reporter who found Mr Drebber and interviewed him about his ordeal. If you look closely, the reporter's signature can be seen in the bottom-right corner of the drawing.Drebber: .........Ryunosuke: And if you look at the contract here, which was signed between the witness and the victim last year... ...you can clearly see Mr Asman's signature at the bottom.Judge: Let me see now... Good Lord, yes! They're identical!Ryunosuke: In short... ...the journalist who drew the illustration and wrote the article published about Mr Drebber ten years ago... ...was the victim of this case...Mr Odie Asman!Drebber: Ugh... URAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGH!Van Zieks:Van Zieks: But explain to the court why! Why would that constitute a motive for the witness to murder Asman?!Ryunosuke: Well, if you think back... ...you'll remember that Mr Drebber talked about that article in his testimony.Judge: G-Graverobbing, you say?!Drebber: Yes. Exhuming fresh corpses to sell is reasonably lucrative.Judge: That, that is quite beyond the pale! You would invite divine retribution, sir!Drebber: Yes, well...I think I suffered retribution enough. The Daily Circus...eventually unearthed my name and put it in print. It caused me a great many headaches. In the end, I had to leave the university. ...That was the only paper with the bad grace to identify me unambiguously, I might add.Drebber: Then I gave up on my dream of becoming a scientist. And it was all because of that newspaper article.Drebber: .........Ryunosuke: At the time, you were a student of the University of London who dreamt of becoming a scientist. However... ...this single newspaper article changed your entire life.Drebber: .........Judge: So Mr Asman used to be a newspaper journalist, did he?Van Zieks: He did, My Lord. In fact, it's a widely held belief that Asman managed to position himself at the heart of his criminal network... ...thanks to the many dubious connections he made during his time as reporter.Drebber: .........Ryunosuke: So you had to give up on your dream and leave university. You lost everything. Eventually you found yourself working in the field of science, but only in the shadows. And all because of that article...written by Mr Asman!Drebber: ENOUGH! ......... Stop this endless drivel about my life!Ryunosuke: Wha...?Judge: Explain yourself, Mr Drebber!Drebber: Yes, it's true. I had to leave the university as a result of that article. But it was just the straw that broke the camel's back.Ryunosuke: What do you mean?Drebber: Almost every student of science in the faculty was too poor to actually conduct any research. But they struggled on with their hypotheses anyway. We all did. Only to have them taken by vultures. Sooner or later, you knew your ideas would be stolen and patented by some wretch or other, after all.Judge: Good gracious...Drebber: Making a name for yourself as a scientist in a climate like that... ...was a miracle only a select few geniuses could ever hope to achieve. Personally, I wasn't one of those geniuses. So it was hardly a wrench. Being forced out of the university because of Lowgate was the best thing that could have happened to me!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: Mr Drebber... ...do you genuinely believe that?Drebber: Of course I do! Who's better placed to know whether or not I possess a talent for science than me?Ryunosuke: I'm sorry to say...that your words don't ring true at all.Drebber: ...How dare you?!Ryunosuke: And I have evidence to prove it.Drebber: How are you in a position to say anything about me? I don't know you from Adam! Fine, if you think you have evidence, go ahead. Show it! What could you possibly have to disprove the idea that I was happy to leave university because I lacked talent?Present Science Trophy Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Do you remember this, Mr Drebber?\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: I think this piece of evidence speaks for itself, doesn't it? Drebber: ...In describing your own lack of talent, yes. Ryunosuke: Hm? Drebber: Believe me, I've seen many a young man's dreams crushed in the vice of life. Van Zieks: My advice is for you to do what you Nipponese do best: bow out, and go back home to the farm. Ryunosuke: (But my 'farm' is a fifty-day boat ride away...) Susato: If Lord van Zieks is trying to imply that Tokyo is some small, provincial agricultural town, he's sorely mistaken! Ryunosuke: As I said, the idea that you left university without looking back because you thought you had no talent is nonsense. Drebber: ...! Leads back to: \"And I have evidence to prove it.\"Ryunosuke: Do you remember this, Mr Drebber? We found it at your workshop.Drebber: ...!Van Zieks: I-Is that...a Royal Society trophy for excellence in science?Judge: ...What exactly is this trophy, Counsel?Ryunosuke: It's the greatest honour that can be bestowed on a young scientist, My Lord.Drebber: .........Van Zieks: There is no higher accolade. It recognises emerging talent and promises a bright future.Judge: Good gracious!Ryunosuke: Your prospects for the future were excellent, weren't they, Mr Drebber? Because even then, you were a genius in your field.Drebber: ...!Ryunosuke: But you lost everything. You had no more future. Your talents would go to waste. All as a result of this one newspaper article.Drebber: .........Ryunosuke: I don't know when you realised who Mr Asman was. But when it dawned on you that he was the same journalist who ten years ago ruined your life... ...it's abundantly clear...that you had no intention of forgiving the man!Drebber: ......... .................. The truth...is...Ryunosuke: (Finally, he's going to fold.)Susato: .........???:Sithe: Haaah... Fine. Clearly this has run its course now.Drebber: What?!Sithe: I admit it. All of it.Ryunosuke: (What?!)Drebber: W-What are you doing?!Sithe: It's exactly as the Japanese man said. I was coerced into going along with this man's plot to murder the victim. On the condition that he kept my dirty secret from ten years ago.Ryunosuke: I...Van Zieks: No...Judge: GOOD LOOOOOOOOORD!Van Zieks: Dr Sithe! Do you realise what you're saying, woman?!Sithe: ......... It's all true. That day... ...when I arrived at the Crystal Tower and saw the birdcage... ...my heart nearly stopped beating. That memory from a decade ago that I'd done my best to bury deep inside myself... It was the Professor again, staring me in the face. And then, before I had a chance to react, I noticed something else. There was a note tucked inside the model's jacket.'Dr Sithe, You will go along with my plan. From someone who knows the truth about what really happened that night ten years ago.' .........Sithe: All the instructions were there in the note. Every detail was meticulously written out. I had no choice but to do what it said. I made the necessary 'alterations' to the scene and fabricated the autopsy report as instructed. There was really no other choice. It had to be done to protect the judiciary. ...I can only apologise now.Drebber: Why on earth would you buckle now?Sithe: ......... Well there's no point trying to hide it any more, is there? I would have done anything to stop it coming out. Even collaborate in a murder. But the great lie about that execution ten years ago has been exposed. Whatever happens...I'm finished.Van Zieks: .........Ryunosuke: So then, Mr Drebber, what do you say to that? Your accomplice has admitted everything.Drebber: ......... Surely it goes without saying.Ryunosuke: You admit your part in it too, then?Drebber: I admit nothing! At all!Ryunosuke: Wha...?!Van Zieks: .........Drebber: Have you forgotten that the kinesis machine was ripped to shreds by an explosion? Short of me admitting to a crime, there's really no possible way for you to prove I did anything wrong.Ryunosuke: Nnn...NOOOOOOOOO!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!!Sithe: Whatever this man says, I admit everything. He threatened to expose my secret, so I went along with his plan. And Lord van Zieks...Van Zieks: Yes?Sithe: I hope you'll accept my apologies. ...What happens next is in your hands, of course.Van Zieks: .........Judge: I have heard more than enough now. I hereby present the final findings of this court.Ryunosuke: ...!Judge: This trial is not the proper forum in which to pursue the alleged wrongdoings of Mr Drebber. The defendant is Professor Albert Harebrayne.Van Zieks: ......... Very true. It had slipped my mind.Ryunosuke: ...Isn't he one of your closest friends?Judge: As the court has heard, Dr Sithe has admitted to the allegations brought by the defence... ...thereby absolving the defendant of any possible guilt.Ryunosuke: ...! You, you mean...Judge: At the present time, it is the conclusion of this court that the defendant was not involved in any wrongdoing. Does the prosecution have any objection?Van Zieks: ......... ...None, My Lord.Susato: Oh, congratulations, Mr Naruhodo! You've proven Professor Harebrayne's innocence!Judge: Without further ado then, the adjudication. Unless the prosecution or defence have any other matters to discuss?Van Zieks: .........Ryunosuke: ......... (I don't know... This doesn't feel quite right. Why did Dr Sithe suddenly admit to it like that?)Susato: Is everything alright, Mr Naruhodo?Ryunosuke: Like you said before, the way the trial is set to end now... ...the judge will certainly deliver a verdict of not guilty. (But is that really what we want? What the defence should be pushing for now is...)Immediate adjudication Ryunosuke: (If the judge gives his verdict now, Professor Harebrayne will be found not guilty, without any doubt.) Susato: Is something troubling you, perhaps? Ryunosuke: Yes... But it's probably nothing. (In the antechamber during the recess earlier... ...I did give Mr Sholmes my word though, didn't I? I told him I'd pursue any doubts I had about the truth to the absolute last.) Susato: If you gave Mr Sholmes your word, then it most certainly isn't nothing! And it means there's only one right answer here. Ryunosuke: ...Yes, you're right. (I don't know why I was ever wavering.) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The defence objects to the trial ending at this time, My Lord.\"Further testimony Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"The defence objects to the trial ending at this time, My Lord.\"Ryunosuke: The defence objects to the trial ending at this time, My Lord.Judge: I beg your pardon?Ryunosuke: We demand...one final testimony!Judge: WHAT?! You do realise I'm about to adjudicate in favour of your client, I presume?Van Zieks: What are you playing at now, my Nipponese friend? Why would you want to obstruct the conclusion of the trial at this point? No defence lawyer in his right mind would do that.Ryunosuke: .........Susato: Mr Naruhodo, what exactly are you thinking?Ryunosuke: The truth - the whole truth - and a way to bring it all out into the open.Susato: Right!Ryunosuke: ......... (Yes, in hindsight...)Sholmes: Ah yes, one word of warning before I go: If, in the course of the trial this afternoon, you perceive even a shadow of doubt about the truth... ...don't let it out of your sight. Pursue it like a dog with a bone.Ryunosuke: ...!Sholmes: To the bitter end, you understand. Do not falter, whatever may come to pass.Ryunosuke: (...I'm sure Mr Sholmes knew. He must have deduced that this would happen.) Yes, I'm here in court to advocate for my client. And to secure an acquittal.Van Zieks: Obviously.Ryunosuke: But that's not all. I believe that I have a duty to the court... ...to pursue the whole truth of the case until every last detail is laid bare!Van Zieks: .........Ryunosuke: And that is why the defence calls for further testimony from Dr Sithe.Sithe: Testimony from me? About what?Ryunosuke: About the nature of your collaboration with Mr Enoch Drebber!Sithe: Hah! In case it's escaped your attention, I've already admitted to everything I did. The whole truth has already been revealed. So stop wasting everyone's time.Ryunosuke: Agh!Sithe: As His Lordship made very plain, your client will get the acquittal you wanted for him. There's simply no point protracting this business further with another tedious cross-examination.Van Zieks:Van Zieks: ...Pray forgive my careless handling of that hallowed bottle. I slipped.Ryunosuke: (That's what you call it?)Judge: W-What is your objection, Lord van Zieks?Van Zieks: The prosecution... ...also calls for supplementary testimony from the witness.Sithe: Don't be stupid!Van Zieks: If there is more to this case than has yet come to light... ...then I will join my learned friend in pursuing the facts until the bitter end.Sithe: You'll what...?Ryunosuke: Lord van Zieks...Judge: This is most irregular, to say the least. However, as the prosecution also calls for it, I will uphold the request. Dr Sithe, you will testify for the court... ...explaining the full extent of your involvement in the murder apparently committed by Mr Drebber.Sithe: I... ...Very well.Witness Testimony - The Waxwork Plot -Sithe: It all began at the scene when I saw the waxwork and the note tucked inside its jacket. The actual body of the victim, as indicated in the note's instructions, was beneath the experimentation stage. The body had to be 'arranged' in certain ways to implicate the defendant...which was my job. I enlisted the help of the entire Forensic Investigation Team to dress the scene appropriately. The truth about the execution ten years ago is a state secret of the highest level. I had to protect it.Ryunosuke: So I was right: the stage and the machine were all specially designed for the deception.Sithe: So it seems. And all meticulously prepared. You did well to see through it. You're a very shrewd boy.Ryunosuke: So kind of you to say...Susato: And what about this autopsy report, then?Sithe: All I did was record the location of the body as being in the Crystal Tower instead of under the stage.Susato: That's all...? That's a terrible corruption!Sithe: Only my team were aware of the deceit, and then only under my explicit instructions. Nobody else at Scotland Yard knew anything about it, I assure you.Judge: Hm...we must be thankful for small mercies, I suppose. Well, I believe that testimony has clarified everything. There's no particular need for a cross-examination, I would say...Ryunosuke: (No, I disagree. I can't shake the feeling that something's wrong. Just look at that expression on Dr Sithe's face.) It's the defence's right to cross-examine any witness following testimony!Sithe: Tsk! What is it about you Japanese that makes you all so doggedly persistent?Judge: Very well. If you so desire, Counsel, proceed with the cross-examination!Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord!Cross-Examination - The Waxwork Plot -\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Susato Mikotoba\nDescription: A judicial assistant sent to Britain on a study tour.

However, the testimony by Madame Tusspells (Testimony 6, 7) indicates that the wax impression was taken before the onset of rigor mortis (which starts at the jaw about three hours after death), meaning that at the time of impression, the corpse could not have been dead for long.\n\nThis contradiction suggests either the time of death in the autopsy report is incorrect, or the timing of the wax impression was inaccurately stated.\n",

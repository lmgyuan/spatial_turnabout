Testimony 4 claims that “the defendant’s fingerprints were also all over the knife,” implying that the fingerprints belong to whoever is on trial. Yet Evidence 15 (the Knife) specifically shows that the knife bears the victim’s blood and Engarde’s fingerprints. This contradiction suggests that the knife’s evidence does not match the testimony’s assertion about the defendant’s prints being present. It creates an inconsistency regarding whose fingerprints are really on the murder weapon.

Testimony 4 insists that the culprit was dressed in the Nickel Samurai costume while stabbing Juan Corrida. However, Evidence 9—the crime photo—shows that Juan Corrida, the victim, was wearing a samurai outfit at the time of his murder, which contradicts the insinuation that the killer wore the costume. This discrepancy between the victim’s attire in the photographic evidence and the witness’s claim is the contradiction.

Testimony 4 states, "I felt as though I was about to faint, so I poured myself a glass of juice." However, Evidence 8—the Wine Glass found next to the victim—is noted to be completely filled with tomato juice with no indication it was used or partly consumed, which contradicts the suggestion that someone actually poured and drank from it.

Testimony 1 claims, "I suppose I must have opened the guitar case... after I knocked the vase over," implying that Andrews handled the case. However, Evidence 7, the "Guitar Case," clearly notes that it bears only Corrida's fingerprints, which conflicts with Andrews’ statement. This contradiction between Andrews’ claim of having opened the case and the forensic evidence that no traces of her touch are present indicates a clear inconsistency.

Testimony 0 by Andrews claims, "That glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself," distancing himself from any direct handling of the glass. However, Evidence 8—the Wine Glass—is filled with tomato juice and bears Andrews' fingerprints. The presence of his fingerprints on the glass directly contradicts his assertion that he did not pour the juice, thereby exposing a discrepancy between his testimony and the evidence.

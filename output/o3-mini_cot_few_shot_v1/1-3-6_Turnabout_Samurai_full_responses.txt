Testimony 4 states, "At 2:30, we took a 15‐minute break in the meeting." Meanwhile, Evidence 3 – Jack’s Autopsy Report – records the victim’s time of death as 2:30 PM. This directly contradicts the testimony, as the victim couldn’t have died at the exact moment when those involved were actively breaking for a meeting.

******************************
Testimony 1 claims that the assistant was present but that Will Powers was absent at the scene. However, Evidence 5—a photograph taken at the studio entrance at 2:00 PM—shows Powers present at the scene. This directly contradicts Testimony 1.

Testimony 5 claims outright that the bellboy seen coming out of Juan Corrida’s room must be the assassin. However, Evidence 30 – the Bellboy’s Uniform – was recovered from De Killer’s hideout and noted as having been worn by De Killer on the night of the murder. This shows that the uniform (and by extension the “bellboy” seen) was in fact part of De Killer’s guise, contradicting Powers’ assertion that an ordinary hotel bellboy was to blame.

Testimony 5 claims that the “knife” (along with the “button”) was created and planted, implying it was not involved in the actual crime. However, Evidence 15 shows the knife was found bearing the victim's blood and Engarde's fingerprints, suggesting it was indeed the murder weapon rather than a planted prop.

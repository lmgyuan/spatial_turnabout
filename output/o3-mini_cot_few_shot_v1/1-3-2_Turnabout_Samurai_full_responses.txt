Testimony 7 claims that the man Powers was walking purposefully toward the studio, yet Evidence 5—a photo of Will Powers taken at 2:00 PM at the gate—shows him visibly dragging one leg. This physical detail contradicts the testimony’s implication of a brisk, unimpeded stride toward the studio.

The testimony by Oldbag in Testimony 3—"If they had, I would have seen them!"—suggests that he was in a clear position to spot anyone entering. However, Evidence 11, "Mr. Monkey's Head," explains that the path to the scene of the crime was blocked between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM. This obstruction means that even if others had been entering, Oldbag might not have seen them at all, directly contradicting his claim.

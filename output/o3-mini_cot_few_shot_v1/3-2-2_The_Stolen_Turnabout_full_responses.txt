Testimony 3 claims that Mask☆DeMasque’s pattern is to target nothing but priceless, precious works of art. However, Evidence 4 describes the Sacred Urn—a treasure from Kurain Village—that, while labeled as “priceless,” is simultaneously observed to have no monetary value, suggesting it isn’t the kind of valuable art piece one would typically target. This mismatch between what the testimony insists (only truly precious art gets stolen) and what the evidence implies (a supposedly “priceless” but financially worthless urn being involved) creates a contradiction.

Evidence 6 states that Mask☆DeMasque knocked Atmey out with a blow to the back of the head. However, in Testimony 5, Atmey claims that the thief’s blow landed on his third eye, placing the impact on the forehead rather than the back of his head. This discrepancy indicates a contradiction between the evidence and the testimony.

Testimony 5 states, "As for my broach, I snagged it on the door handle and it got torn off, that's all!" However, Evidence 14 ("DeMasque's Broach") explains that the broach was instead found in the shadow of Ami Fey’s statue, which directly contradicts Ron’s claim about where and how it was lost.

Testimony 8 claims that "The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!" while Evidence 9, labeled "May Testimony," asserts that "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck." These two descriptions of the victim's escape direction are mutually contradictory.

Testimony 6 asserts, "You see? You hit her twice!" while Evidence 5, Mia's Autopsy Report, clearly states that the victim suffered from a single blunt force trauma. This contradiction between the claimed double blow in the testimony and the single impact supported by the autopsy report makes them inconsistent.

Testimony 2 claims that "Then, the next moment, I saw Miss Mia run to the left!"â€”suggesting she was still moving after the attack. However, Evidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report) states that she died instantly from a single blunt force trauma at exactly 9:00PM, which contradicts the idea that she could have run immediately after being attacked.

Testimony 3 states, "That is when I saw this glass light stand" while Evidence 8 (the Floor Plans of the law offices) indicates that the light stand is blocked from view from within the office. If the stand were out of view as shown in the floor plans, then White could not have seen it the way he testified.

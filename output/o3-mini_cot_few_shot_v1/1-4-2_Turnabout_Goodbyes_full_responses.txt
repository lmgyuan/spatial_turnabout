Testimony 0 from Lotta claims she clearly saw the man on a boat—identified as Mr. Edgeworth—but Robert’s Autopsy Report (Evidence 3) states the fatal shot was fired from approximately one meter away. Being on a boat would have meant a significantly longer distance, making it impossible for the murderer to have shot the victim from that close range. This direct conflict between the autopsy’s details and the witness’s account shows a clear contradiction.

Testimony 3 states, "The camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower," whereas Evidence 2 describes Lotta's Camera as being set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected. This conflict in the purpose and trigger mechanism of the camera indicates a contradiction between them.

Testimony 7 states, "Then I saw a flash, near one of the men's hands, and I heard another gunshot," which—when combined with her earlier remark in Testimony 5 about hearing a single “bang”—suggests she only witnessed two distinct gunshots. However, Evidence 10 (the Pistol) explicitly indicates that it was fired three times. This mismatch between the number of shots fired and the number of gunshots the witness claims to have heard presents a clear contradiction.

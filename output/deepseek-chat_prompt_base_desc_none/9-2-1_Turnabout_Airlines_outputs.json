Evidence 6 is the Captain Ugo Piggy Bank, which would have been in Franziska's possession before turbulence according to her testimony.\n3. However, Testimony 2-4 describe how the body was in a suitcase during turbulence and was discovered after, implying the piggy bank couldn't have been acquired before turbulence if the focus was on handling the body during turbulence.\n\nThe key contradiction is between Testimony 0 (acquiring piggy bank before turbulence) and the rest of the scenario which suggests all attention was on handling the body during turbulence, making it unlikely the piggy bank was acquired beforehand. This is supported by Evidence 6 being the piggy bank that shouldn't have been acquired before the main events.\n"

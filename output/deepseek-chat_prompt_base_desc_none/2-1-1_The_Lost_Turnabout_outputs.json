If Maggey Byrde was wearing glasses (as suggested by Evidence 3), Wellington would not have been able to see her \"sweet face\" or \"pretty\" features clearly from below, as glasses would obscure or distort the view of her face from that angle. This inconsistency suggests Wellington might be lying or mistaken.\n"

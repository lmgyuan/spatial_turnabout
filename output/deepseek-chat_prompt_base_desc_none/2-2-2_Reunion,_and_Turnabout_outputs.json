    "cot": "Here's one pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other:\n\n- **Testimony 3** claims that the defendant attacked and killed a person who was not fighting back, implying a violent struggle. \n- **Evidence 11 (Maya's Costume)** could contradict this if the costume shows no signs of struggle or blood, which would be inconsistent with the testimony.\n\nHowever, **Testimony 2** explicitly states that the costume is covered in blood, which aligns with the violent act described in Testimony 3. Therefore, the more direct contradiction is between **Testimony 1** (claiming the defendant was wearing the costume at the time of the crime) and **Evidence 11** (if the costume's condition or other evidence suggests it couldn't have been worn during the crime).\n\nBut based on the given information, the most straightforward contradiction is between **Testimony 1** (the costume was worn during the crime) and **Evidence 17 (Clothing Box)**, if the box suggests the costume was stored and not worn. However, since **Evidence 17**'s details aren't specified, the next best contradiction is between **Testimony 2** (costume covered in blood) and **Evidence 15 (Cloth Scrap)**, if the scrap shows no blood. \n\nGiven the ambiguity, the safest answer is:\n```json"

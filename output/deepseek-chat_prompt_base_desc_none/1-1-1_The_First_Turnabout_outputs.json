    "cot": "The testimony from Sahwit states that he called the police at exactly 1:00 PM using a public phone in a nearby park because the phone in the apartment wasn't working. However, the Blackout Record (Evidence 4) likely indicates that there was a blackout during that time, which would make it impossible for the public phone to be operational. This contradiction suggests that Sahwit's testimony about the time and method of calling the police is inconsistent with the evidence of the blackout.\n"

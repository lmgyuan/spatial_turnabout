However, Evidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report) would likely show the actual cause of death, which we know from the game's plot was not from blunt force trauma from The Thinker statue, but rather from other means (poisoning).\n\nThis creates a contradiction between April May's testimony about the murder weapon and the actual cause of death shown in the autopsy report.\n"

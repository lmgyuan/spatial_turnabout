    "cot": "Here's the analysis:\n\nThe contradiction is between Testimony 2 from Soseki, where he claims the victim couldn't have locked the door behind him if the tea was poisoned (implying the victim was already incapacitated), and Evidence 12 (Bottle of Poison), which suggests poison was involved. Gregson's testimonies (3 and 4) support that strychnine takes time to act, meaning the victim could have locked the door after being poisoned but before symptoms appeared, contradicting Soseki's claim that the door being locked proves the tea was harmless.\n\nThe most direct contradiction is between Soseki's Testimony 2 and the existence of poison (Evidence 12).\n\n```json"

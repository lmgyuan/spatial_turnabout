    "cot": "Here's the analysis:\n\nThe contradiction is between Testimony 4 (where Cosmos states Detective Arme fired two warning shots at the figure) and Evidence 15 (the Bullet from Arme's Gun). If Arme fired two warning shots, there should be two bullets accounted for, but the evidence only mentions one bullet from Arme's gun. This discrepancy suggests inconsistency in the testimony.\n"

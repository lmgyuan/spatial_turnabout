The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) and Lotta Hart's Testimony 0.

In Lotta Hart's Testimony 0, she says "I saw it clear as day. The man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth!", which implies that she saw Edgeworth on the boat at the time of the murder. However, the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) shows an empty lake with no sign of a boat or Edgeworth, which contradicts Lotta's testimony. This raises questions about the accuracy of Lotta's testimony and whether she actually saw Edgeworth on the boat.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) and Lotta Hart's Testimony 4.

In Lotta Hart's Testimony 4, she says "When I heard that noise out on the lake, I looked with my binoculars", which implies that she was able to see the boat and the people on it with her binoculars. However, the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) shows that the fog was thick and visibility was low, which contradicts Lotta's testimony. This raises questions about the accuracy of Lotta's testimony and whether she actually saw Edgeworth on the boat.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the Lotta's Camera (Evidence 2) and Lotta Hart's Testimony 6.

In Lotta Hart's Testimony 6, she says "There wasn't much else to look at, so I just watched that boat the whole time", which implies that she was focused solely on the boat. However, the Lotta's Camera (Evidence 2) shows that it was set up to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected, which suggests that Lotta was trying to capture a photo of something else, possibly the lake monster Gourdy. This contradiction raises questions about Lotta's true intentions and what she was actually trying to photograph.

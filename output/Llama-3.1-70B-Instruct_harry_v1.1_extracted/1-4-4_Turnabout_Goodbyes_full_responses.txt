The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) and Yanni Yogi's Testimony.

In Yanni Yogi's Testimony, he says "That man was the defendant... he was saying "I can't believe he's dead."", which implies that he saw Miles Edgeworth near the lake and heard him say those words. However, the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) shows an empty lake with no sign of a boat or Edgeworth, which contradicts Yanni Yogi's testimony. This raises questions about the accuracy of Yanni Yogi's testimony and whether he actually saw Edgeworth near the lake.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) and Larry Butz's Testimony 3.

In Larry Butz's Testimony 3, he says "But I'm sure I heard that gunshot!", which implies that he only heard one gunshot. However, the Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) states "I heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25", which contradicts Butz's testimony. This raises questions about the accuracy of Butz's testimony and whether he actually heard the gunshots.

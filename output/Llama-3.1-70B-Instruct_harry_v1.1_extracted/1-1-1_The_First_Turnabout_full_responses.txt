The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the Statue (Evidence 2) and Sahwit's Testimony 3.

In Sahwit's Testimony 3, he says "Then I saw her lying there... A woman... not moving... dead!", which implies that the body was discovered in the apartment. However, the Statue (Evidence 2) was found lying on the floor next to the victim, suggesting that the murder occurred elsewhere and the body was moved. This contradiction raises questions about the events surrounding the murder.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the Blackout Record (Evidence 4) and Sahwit's Testimony 1.

In Sahwit's Testimony 1, he says "There was a voice saying the time... It was probably coming from the television." However, the Blackout Record (Evidence 4) states that electricity to Ms. Stone's building was out from noon to 6 PM on the day of the crime, which means that the television would not have been working. This contradiction raises questions about Sahwit's claim that he heard the time from the television.

The Hotel Guidemap evidence contradicts Dick Gumshoe's Testimony 3, which states that the Jammin' Ninja's button was ripped off of the ninja costume and was found in Mr. Engarde's "hakama". However, the Hotel Guidemap evidence shows that Engarde's room is located to the north of the path, and Corrida's room is located to the south, which would have made it unlikely for the button to have been ripped off of the ninja costume and found in Engarde's "hakama" without anyone noticing.

The Knife evidence contradicts Dick Gumshoe's Testimony 4, which states that the defendant bought the knife for the crime, making it a premeditated murder. However, the Knife evidence shows that the knife is engraved with "Gatewater", which would have made it unlikely for the defendant to have bought the knife specifically for the crime.

The Hotel Guidemap evidence contradicts Wendy Oldbag's Testimony 1, which states that she saw the Nickel Samurai, Matt Engarde, coming out of Juan Corrida's room. However, the Hotel Guidemap evidence shows that Engarde's room is located to the north of the path, and Corrida's room is located to the south, which would have made it unlikely for Oldbag to have seen Engarde coming out of Corrida's room.

The Lotta's Photo evidence contradicts Adrian Andrews' Testimony 3, which states that she saw the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo. However, the Lotta's Photo evidence shows that the photo was taken in the hallway right after the murder, and a person in samurai garb stands outside the door, which would have made it unlikely for Andrews to have seen the exact same scene as in the crime scene photo.

The Guitar Case evidence contradicts Adrian Andrews' Testimony 1, which states that she must have opened the guitar case after knocking the vase over. However, the Guitar Case evidence shows that the case was empty and had some water on top of the lid, which would have made it unlikely for Andrews to have opened the case without noticing the water.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 1}
The Press Conference Ticket evidence contradicts Adrian Andrews' Testimony 2, which states that she doesn't have any way to prove that Matt Engarde was the murderer. However, the Press Conference Ticket evidence shows that the Nickel Samurai was to confess something after the post-ceremony stage show, which would have made it unlikely for Andrews to have not had any way to prove Engarde's motive.

{"evidence": 3, "testimony": 2}
The Crime Photo evidence contradicts Adrian Andrews' Testimony 1, which states that she was surprised when she walked into the room and saw it in a messy state. However, the Crime Photo evidence shows that the victim's room was not in a messy state, but rather it was a crime scene with a victim and a glass of juice on the dresser, which would have made it unlikely for Andrews to have been surprised by the state of the room.

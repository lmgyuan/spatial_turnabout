The Max G. Bust evidence contradicts Acro's Testimony 1, which states that he has a strong upper body from working as an acrobat, and only his legs were injured. However, the Max G. Bust evidence shows that the bust is rather heavy, which would have made it unlikely for Acro to have been able to lift it with his upper body alone.

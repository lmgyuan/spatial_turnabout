The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the Folding Screen (Evidence 4) and Gumshoe's Testimony 3.

In Gumshoe's Testimony 3, he says "The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back", which implies that the victim was not defending himself. However, the Folding Screen (Evidence 4) shows that there is a bullet hole in the screen, which suggests that the victim may have been trying to defend himself or escape. This raises questions about the accuracy of Gumshoe's testimony and whether the victim was actually not fighting back.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the Pistol (Evidence 9) and Gumshoe's Testimony 3.

In Gumshoe's Testimony 3, he says "The victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed", which implies that the victim missed the shot. However, the Pistol (Evidence 9) shows that the pistol was fired twice and bears Maya's and Grey's fingerprints, which suggests that the victim may have actually hit Maya. This raises questions about the accuracy of Gumshoe's testimony and whether the victim actually missed the shot.

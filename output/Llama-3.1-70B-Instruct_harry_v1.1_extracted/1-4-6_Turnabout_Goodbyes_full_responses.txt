The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the DL-6 Case File (Evidence 18) and Miles Edgeworth's Testimony 5.

In Miles Edgeworth's Testimony 5, he says "A moment later, there was a single gunshot, then a scream", which implies that only one shot was fired. However, the DL-6 Case File (Evidence 18) states that the murder weapon was fired twice, which contradicts Edgeworth's testimony. This raises questions about the accuracy of Edgeworth's testimony and whether he actually fired the gun.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the Powers'(?) Photo (Evidence 5) and Security Lady's Testimony 7.

In Security Lady's Testimony 7, she says "It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!", which implies that she saw Powers heading to the studio at 2:00 PM. However, the Powers'(?) Photo (Evidence 5) shows the Steel Samurai (who is actually Powers) walking at the gate between the entrance and the Studios at 2:00 PM, but it does not confirm that he was heading to the studio. In fact, the photo does not provide any information about the direction Powers was heading. This contradiction raises questions about the accuracy of Security Lady's testimony.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the Mr. Monkey's Head (Evidence 11) and Security Lady's Testimony 3.

In Security Lady's Testimony 3, she says "If they had, I would have seen them!", which implies that she was able to see anyone who went to the studio before 2:30 PM. However, the Mr. Monkey's Head (Evidence 11) shows that the path to the scene of the crime was blocked between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM, which means that Security Lady may not have been able to see anyone who went to the studio during that time. This contradiction raises questions about the accuracy of Security Lady's testimony.

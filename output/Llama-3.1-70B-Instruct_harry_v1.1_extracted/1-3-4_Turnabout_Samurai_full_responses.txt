The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the Steak Plate (Evidence 16) and Sal Manella's Testimony.

In Sal Manella's Testimony, he says "Eating my t-bone steak! What else!?", which implies that he ate a t-bone steak by himself. However, the Steak Plate (Evidence 16) shows that there were two plates, one with a large bone and traces of sleeping pills, which suggests that someone else was eating with Manella. This contradiction raises questions about Manella's alibi and his claim that he was eating alone.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the Cody's Camera (Evidence 15) and Cody Hackins's Testimony 5.

In Cody Hackins's Testimony 5, he says "I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em", which implies that he was able to take pictures with his camera. However, the Cody's Camera (Evidence 15) is described as a new digital camera that Cody is still learning how to use, and in his previous testimony, he stated that the lens wouldn't open in time to take a picture. This contradiction raises questions about Cody's ability to use his camera and the accuracy of his testimony.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the Baseball Glove (Evidence 6) and Gumshoe's Testimony 1.

In Gumshoe's Testimony 1, he says "During his date, the victim was pushed from the bench area", which implies that the victim was pushed with a significant amount of force. However, the Baseball Glove (Evidence 6) shows that the victim was wearing a custom-made glove on his right hand, which suggests that he may have been holding onto something or someone at the time of the push. This raises questions about the accuracy of Gumshoe's testimony and whether the victim was actually pushed or fell.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the Baseball Glove (Evidence 6) and Gumshoe's Testimony 5.

In Gumshoe's Testimony 5, he says "From this, we could confirm that the victim wrote this name with his right hand", which implies that the victim was able to write with his right hand. However, the Baseball Glove (Evidence 6) shows that the victim was wearing a custom-made glove on his right hand, which suggests that he may not have been able to write with his right hand. This raises questions about the accuracy of Gumshoe's testimony and whether the victim was actually able to write with his right hand.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the Baseball Glove (Evidence 6) and Richard Wellington's Testimony 4.

In Richard Wellington's Testimony 4, he says "Of course I remember her sweet face. It was that of the pretty defendant there", which implies that he saw Maggey Byrde at the scene of the crime. However, the Baseball Glove (Evidence 6) shows that the victim, Dustin Prince, was left-handed, which suggests that Maggey Byrde may not have been the one who pushed him. This raises questions about the accuracy of Wellington's testimony and whether he actually saw Maggey Byrde at the scene of the crime.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the Glasses (Evidence 3) and Richard Wellington's Testimony 0.

In Richard Wellington's Testimony 0, he says "The girl on the upper path ran away as soon as she realized I was there", which implies that he was able to see the girl clearly. However, the Glasses (Evidence 3) shows that Wellington was wearing near-sighted lenses, which suggests that he may not have been able to see the girl clearly. This raises questions about the accuracy of Wellington's testimony and whether he actually saw the girl on the upper path.

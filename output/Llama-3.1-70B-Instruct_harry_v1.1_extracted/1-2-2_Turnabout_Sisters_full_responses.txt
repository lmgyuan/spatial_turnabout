The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the Maya's Memo (Evidence 4) and Gumshoe's Testimony 5.

In Gumshoe's Testimony 5, he says "Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!", which implies that the victim wrote the killer's name on the memo. However, the Maya's Memo (Evidence 4) states that "A conversation I had with my sister is recorded on my cell phone", which does not mention anything about the victim writing the killer's name. This contradiction raises questions about the authenticity of the memo and the victim's actions before death.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the Floor Plans (Evidence 8) and April's Testimony 1.

In April's Testimony 1, she says "The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right", which implies that the victim ran to the right in a straight line. However, the Floor Plans (Evidence 8) show that the Fey & Co. Law Offices, where the murder took place, have a corner to the right of the victim's position. This means that the victim would not have been able to run straight to the right, contradicting April's testimony.

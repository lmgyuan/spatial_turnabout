The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the May Testimony (Evidence 9) and Redd White's Testimony 8.

In Redd White's Testimony 8, he says "The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!", which implies that the victim ran to the left. However, the May Testimony (Evidence 9) states "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck", which implies that the victim ran to the right. This contradiction raises questions about the accuracy of Redd White's testimony.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the Floor Plans (Evidence 8) and Redd White's Testimony 1.

In Redd White's Testimony 1, he says "When you assaulted the girl, she first ran to the left", which implies that the victim ran to the left in a straight line. However, the Floor Plans (Evidence 8) show that the Fey & Co. Law Offices, where the murder took place, have a corner to the left of the victim's position. This means that the victim would not have been able to run straight to the left, contradicting Redd White's testimony.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the Mia's Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) and Redd White's Testimony 5.

In Redd White's Testimony 5, he says "Then you did her in with a single blow! Thwap!", which implies that the victim was killed with a single blow. However, the Mia's Autopsy Report (Evidence 5) states "Cause: single blunt force trauma. Death was instantaneous", which implies that the victim died instantly from a single blow, but does not confirm that the killer struck her only once. Redd White's testimony implies that the killer struck her twice, once to make her dodge and once to kill her, which contradicts the autopsy report.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the Glass Shards (Evidence 2) and Redd White's Testimony 3.

In Redd White's Testimony 3, he says "That is when I saw this glass light stand", which implies that the glass light stand was intact when he saw it. However, the Glass Shards (Evidence 2) show that the glass light stand was broken beyond all recognition, contradicting Redd White's testimony.

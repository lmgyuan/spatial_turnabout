The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the Steak Plate (Evidence 16) and Dee Vasquez's Testimony 5.

In Dee Vasquez's Testimony 5, she says "Sal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer", which implies that there were only two plates and two people eating. However, the Steak Plate (Evidence 16) shows that there were two plates, one with a large bone and traces of sleeping pills, which suggests that someone else was eating with them. This contradiction raises questions about Vasquez's alibi and her claim that she was eating with Sal Manella.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are the Steak Plate (Evidence 16) and Dee Vasquez's Testimony 5.

In Dee Vasquez's Testimony 5, she says "I went back to the trailer to get my script and direction notes", which implies that she ate a t-bone steak in the trailer. However, the Steak Plate (Evidence 16) shows that there were two plates, one with a large bone and traces of sleeping pills, in the employee area, which suggests that Vasquez ate a t-bone steak in the employee area, not in the trailer. This contradiction raises questions about Vasquez's alibi and her claim that she was eating in the trailer.

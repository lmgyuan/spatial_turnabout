    "cot": "The evidence regarding Kane's Autopsy Report (Evidence 15) states that the time of death was at 1 AM on October 12, which aligns with the time when the camera data indicated activity at the crime scene (Evidence 7). Meanwhile, if we consider the testimony from Gumshoe (Testimony 0), it states that Mask☆DeMasque began his crime spree 6 months ago, which does not explicitly contradict any specific time-related evidence, but inherently it suggests that he is not involved in a murder at 1 AM if the evidence shows a precise time. However, the conflict arises when we realize that despite claiming to have knowledge of Mask☆DeMasque's patterns and operations, if he was in position to witness these events shortly after or around the time of murder, it creates ambiguity about whether he could accurately provide such information. \n\nThus, we can summarize that the testimony from Gumshoe on the timeline of Mask's operations may conflict with the assumptions we can draw from the evidence timeline. \n\nTherefore, the conflicting statements are:\n",

    "cot": "We need to examine the evidence and testimonies provided to identify a contradiction.\n\nTestimony 2 states that Ron does not have an alibi for the night the urn was stolen. However, Evidence 12 indicates that Ron's Key Card was used on October 12th at 1 AM, which suggests he was present at the scene during the time of the crime. This contradicts his claim of having no alibi, implying that Ron may have intentionally misled about his whereabouts.\n",

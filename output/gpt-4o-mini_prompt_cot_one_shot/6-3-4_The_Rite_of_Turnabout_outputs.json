    "cot": "Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. \n\nTestimony 3 states that Lady Kee'ra attacked and killed Tahrust with a strength quite beyond any mortal woman, implying a supernatural or divine strength. However, Evidence 3, \"Tahrust's Autopsy Report,\" clarifies that the cause of Tahrust's death was from an abdominal wound delivered by a bladed weapon, suggesting he was killed by a mortal and not a supernatural being. This contradiction indicates that Tahrust's testimony regarding Lady Kee'ra's actions is inconsistent with the report of how he actually died.\n",

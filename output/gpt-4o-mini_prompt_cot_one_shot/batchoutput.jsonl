However, Evidence 3, the Autopsy Report, confirms that the victim was shot from approximately one meter away with a bullet to the heart, which suggests that the scene would likely have been well within view of the attacker and supports the notion that Edgeworth is the one suspected of committing the murder. Yet, it does not directly verify Lotta's claim.

Evidence 4, \"Time Keeper,\" states that it's the murder weapon used on the victim, Gloomsbury, while Testimony 2 implies that Larry is upset about a conflict, and there's no indication he was around the crime scene during the murder, which raises questions. Furthermore, Larry's testimonies don't provide any clarity on the specifics of the murder weapon or the incident. Thus, there doesn't seem to be an outright contradiction in a narrower view; instead, the testimonies lack relevance to the established evidence of the murder weapon.\n\nNow looking closely, Testimony 3 states there's a clear indication of two Pegabulls based on the pamphlet, which may be contradicted by the unclear presence of only one Pegabull in other pieces of evidence (like the descriptions).

In contrast, **Testimony 5** from Juniper Woods states, \"I swear I didn't attack Apollo! Why would I ever hurt such a kind person?\" implying that Woods is denying any personal involvement in an assault or attack that would contribute to death, but the evidence indicates a violent event has indeed occurred.\n\nThe contradiction arises because Juniper Woods's testimony implies a lack of direct involvement in violence, while the evidence indicates that a violent head trauma led to Arme's death. This suggests a relationship that counters the assertion of innocence in the context of the violent outcome.\n",

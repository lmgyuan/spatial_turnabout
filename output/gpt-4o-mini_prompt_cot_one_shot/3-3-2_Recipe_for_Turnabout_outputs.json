However, Evidence 13 (\"Coffee Cup\") indicates that the coffee contained potassium cyanide and was associated with the victim and Maggey. These items found with Maggey suggest she may be implicated with the poison, but does not confirm what the testimony suggested about when the items were found.\n\nHowever, Evidence 10 indicates that Glen (the victim) died from potassium cyanide poisoning, which logically contradicts Testimony 4 if it suggests the poison was found in a manner that would imply Maggey had inappropriate access to the toxin before the murder was investigated.\n",

    "cot": "Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided. Testimony 1 states that \"the young boy slumped over the table as soon as he took one sip of his javaccino.\" However, Evidence 10, which is \"Glen's Autopsy Report,\" indicates that he died of potassium cyanide poisoning, and the time of death was between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. This suggests that he would not have been slumping over from a drink right before his death if it was caused by the poison, thus creating a contradiction regarding the timeline of events. \n",

Evidence 2 (Glass Shards) and Testimony 3 (Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim's!) seem to contradict each other. 

The Glass Shards evidence states that the glass light stand was "broken beyond all recognition." However, if the glass was broken beyond recognition, it's unlikely that the lab would be able to find a usable blood sample on the shards. Yet, Testimony 3 states that lab tests were able to determine that the blood was the victim's. This implies that the blood sample was not on the glass shards, but rather somewhere else, possibly on the victim's finger as mentioned in Testimony 4.

However, another pair of evidence and testimony that directly contradict each other is Evidence 1 (The Thinker) and Testimony 5 (Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!). The Thinker is described as the murder weapon, a clock that was used to deliver a single blunt force trauma, resulting in instantaneous death (as per Evidence 5, Mia's Autopsy Report). However, Testimony 5 claims that the victim wrote the killer's name before she died, which would be impossible if the death was instantaneous.

Evidence 9 (May Testimony) and Testimony 1 (The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right) seem to be the same, but Evidence 9 is a description of May's testimony. However, Testimony 1 is actually part of May's testimony. So, they do not contradict each other.

A pair that does contradict each other is Evidence 1 (The Thinker) and Testimony 4 (That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? "The Thinker," I think?). Evidence 1 describes The Thinker as the murder weapon, a clock that was used to deliver a single blunt force trauma. Testimony 4, however, describes The Thinker as a "statue-y clock", which seems to be uncertain. This is not a direct contradiction.

A more direct contradiction is between Evidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 1 (The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right) and Testimony 2 (Then the girl in the hippie clothes ran after her...). Evidence 5 states that the cause of death was a single blunt force trauma and that death was instantaneous. However, Testimonies 1 and 2 describe a sequence of events where the victim dodges an attack, runs, and is then hit. This sequence of events contradicts the instantaneous death described in Evidence 5.

Evidence 4 (Sacred Urn) and Testimony 3 (His pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 4 states that the Sacred Urn looks like a plain old pot, which implies that it may not be a particularly precious or valuable art piece. However, Testimony 3 claims that Maskâ˜†DeMasque's pattern is to always go after only the most precious art pieces, which contradicts the fact that the Sacred Urn is not a particularly valuable item.

Evidence 6 (Shichishito) and Testimony 2 (Just as I began to turn, the coward struck a fierce blow upon my noble head!) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 6 states that the Shichishito, a ceremonial sword, was not bent before the crime, which implies that it was not used in the crime. However, Testimony 2 claims that Atmey was struck on the head, which contradicts the fact that the Shichishito was not bent, suggesting that it may have been used in the crime.

Evidence 14 (DeMasque's Broach) and Testimony 5 (As for my broach, I snagged it on the door handle and it got torn off, that's all!) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 14 states that DeMasque's Broach was found in the shadow of Ami Fey's statue, which implies that it was torn off of some clothing while DeMasque was near the statue. However, Testimony 5 claims that the broach was torn off when it snagged on the door handle, which contradicts the fact that the broach was found in the shadow of the statue.

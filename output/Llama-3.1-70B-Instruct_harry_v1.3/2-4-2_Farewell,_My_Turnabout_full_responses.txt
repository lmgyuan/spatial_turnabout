Evidence 15 (Knife) and Testimony 5 (The defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 15 states that the knife bears the victim's blood and Engarde's fingerprints, and has "Gatewater" engraved on the grip, which implies that the knife was not purchased by Engarde specifically for the crime. However, Testimony 5 claims that the defendant (Engarde) bought the knife for the crime, which contradicts the fact that the knife has "Gatewater" engraved on it, suggesting that it may have been a knife already present at the Gatewater Hotel.

Evidence 17 (Lotta's Photo) and Testimony 3 (That's when someone showed up! It was a man coming out of poor Juan's room) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 17 states that Lotta's photo shows a person in samurai garb standing outside the door, but Testimony 3 claims that Oldbag saw Engarde coming out of Juan's room, which implies that Engarde was not wearing samurai garb at the time. However, the main contradiction is that Testimony 3 claims that Engarde was coming out of Juan's room, but Evidence 17 shows that the person in samurai garb is standing outside the door, which suggests that Engarde may have been wearing samurai garb.

However, a more direct contradiction is between Evidence 16 (Jammin' Ninja's Button) and Testimony 5 (He was wearing his flashy racing jacket. Honestly, it's all just for show). Testimony 5 claims that Engarde was wearing his racing jacket, but Evidence 16 states that the Jammin' Ninja's button was found in Engarde's "hakama", which implies that Engarde was wearing a samurai costume, not his racing jacket.

Evidence 16 (Jammin' Ninja's Button) and Testimony 4 (So he must've worn that Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing poor Juan) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 16 states that the Jammin' Ninja's button was found in Engarde's "hakama", which implies that Engarde was wearing the Jammin' Ninja costume, not the Nickel Samurai costume. However, Testimony 4 claims that Engarde must have worn the Nickel Samurai costume when he was stabbing Juan, which contradicts the fact that the Jammin' Ninja's button was found in Engarde's "hakama".

Evidence 8 (Wine Glass) and Testimony 4 (I felt as though I was about to faint, so I poured myself a glass of juice) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 8 states that the wine glass was found next to the victim, filled with tomato juice, but with no sign that it had been drunk. However, Testimony 4 claims that Andrews poured herself a glass of juice, which implies that the glass had been used, contradicting the fact that there was no sign that it had been drunk.

{"evidence": 8, "testimony": 4}
Evidence 7 (Guitar Case) and Testimony 2 (It's not a big deal though, right? The case was empty after all) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 7 states that the guitar case was found next to the victim, empty, but with some water on top of the lid. However, Testimony 2 claims that Andrews opened the case, which implies that the case was not empty when Andrews opened it, contradicting the fact that the case was found empty.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 2}
Evidence 16 (Jammin' Ninja's Button) and Testimony 5 (That button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 16 states that the Jammin' Ninja's button was found in Engarde's "hakama", which implies that the button was not torn off during a fight, but rather was deliberately placed in Engarde's "hakama". However, Testimony 5 claims that the button was torn off of Juan during his fight with Matt, which contradicts the fact that the button was found in Engarde's "hakama".

{"evidence": 16, "testimony": 5}
Evidence 8 (Wine Glass) and Testimony 4 (To be honest, I thought he had just fainted or something. So I went to pour him some juice) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 8 states that the wine glass was found next to the victim, filled with tomato juice, with no sign that it had been drunk. However, Testimony 4 claims that Andrews poured juice for Juan, which implies that the glass had been used, contradicting the fact that there was no sign that it had been drunk.

Evidence 8 (Note to Iris) and Testimony 3 (Iris came to the Inner Temple. She was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 8 states that the note to Iris was found in the Main Hall, which implies that Iris may have been in the Main Hall at some point. However, Testimony 3 claims that Iris came to the Inner Temple, and was dressed exactly as she had been at dinner, which contradicts the fact that the note was found in the Main Hall, suggesting that Iris may have been in a different location.

Evidence 6 (Iris's Hood) and Testimony 3 (Now that you mention it... Iris didn't have her hood on) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 6 states that Iris's Hood is a magical hood said to offer protection from evil spirits, and it is worn by Iris at all times. However, Testimony 3 claims that Iris didn't have her hood on, which contradicts the fact that the hood is worn by Iris at all times.

Evidence 5 (Photo of Elise) and Testimony 5 (And when I awoke... Mystic Ami was... stabbing Mystic Elise through the back!) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 5 states that the photo of Elise shows her wearing a white robe and a hood, and holding a book and a staff with a crystal sphere attached to it. However, Testimony 5 claims that Bikini saw Mystic Ami stabbing Mystic Elise through the back, which contradicts the fact that the photo shows Elise, not Ami, holding the staff with a crystal sphere.

Evidence 7 (Weather Data) and Testimony 0 (I saw the murder at around 11 PM...) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 7 states that the lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45, which implies that the murder occurred before 11 PM. However, Testimony 0 claims that Bikini saw the murder at around 11 PM, which contradicts the fact that the lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45, suggesting that the murder may have occurred before 11 PM.

Evidence 7 (Weather Data) and Testimony 1 (I was lying under my bedding when a white flash almost blinded me!) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 7 states that the lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45, which implies that the lightning strike occurred at a specific time. However, Testimony 1 claims that Butz was lying under his bedding when a white flash almost blinded him, which contradicts the fact that the lightning strike occurred at 10:45, suggesting that the white flash may have been caused by something else.

Evidence 6 (Iris's Hood) and Testimony 2 (I saw Iris flying! Her white hood fluttering!) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 6 states that Iris's Hood is a magical hood said to offer protection from evil spirits, and it is worn by Iris at all times. However, Testimony 2 claims that Butz saw Iris flying with her white hood fluttering, which contradicts the fact that Iris's Hood is worn at all times, suggesting that Iris may not have been wearing the hood when Butz saw her.

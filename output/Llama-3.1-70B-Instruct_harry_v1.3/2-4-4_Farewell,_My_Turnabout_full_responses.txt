Evidence 30 (Bellboy's Uniform) and Testimony 5 (Yeah! So he had to be the assassin! I'm sure of it!) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 30 states that the bellboy's uniform was worn by De Killer on the night of the murder, which implies that De Killer was the one who wore the uniform, not the bellboy. However, Testimony 5 claims that Powers is sure that the bellboy was the assassin, which contradicts the fact that De Killer was the one who wore the uniform.

Evidence 15 (Knife) and Testimony 5 (But even more appalling is the creation and planting of the "knife" and "button") seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 15 states that the knife bears the victim's blood and Engarde's fingerprints, which implies that the knife was used in the crime. However, Testimony 5 claims that the knife was created and planted by Adrian Andrews, which contradicts the fact that the knife has Engarde's fingerprints on it.

Evidence 25 (Figurine) and Testimony 3 (One of these was to find the bear figurine and to give it to Adrian Andrews) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 25 states that the figurine was found at Engarde Mansion, which implies that it was already in the possession of Engarde or Andrews. However, Testimony 3 claims that de Killer was asked to find the bear figurine and give it to Adrian Andrews, which contradicts the fact that the figurine was already found at Engarde Mansion.

Evidence 10 (Ring) and Testimony 5 (In the end, I wasn't able to give it to her, so I've still got it in my pocket!) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 10 states that a cheap ring with an eerie sparkle was found, which has the engraving "From T to R" on it. However, Testimony 5 claims that Trilo still has the engagement ring in his pocket, which contradicts the fact that a ring was found at the crime scene.

Evidence 3 (Silk Hat) and Testimony 3 (His face was silhouetted, but there was no doubt that it was him) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 3 states that the silk hat was found at the crime scene, which implies that Max was not wearing it at the time of the crime. However, Testimony 3 claims that Moe saw Max's face silhouetted, which contradicts the fact that Max's face would have been obscured by the hat if he was wearing it.

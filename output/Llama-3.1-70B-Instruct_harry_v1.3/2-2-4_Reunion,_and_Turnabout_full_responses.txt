Evidence 10 (Knife) and Testimony 4 (I wasn't, like, scared at all. And, like, her costume looked totally, like, normal) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 10 states that the knife bears Maya's fingerprints, which implies that Maya was involved in the murder. However, Testimony 4 claims that Ini's sister (Mimi) told her something terrible, which implies that Mimi was the one who was present in the Side Room, not Maya. This contradicts the fact that the knife bears Maya's fingerprints.

Evidence 6 (Newspaper Clipping 2) and Testimony 3 (I was, like, totally pooped too, so I, like, fell asleep in the passenger's seat...) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 6 states that Mimi Miney, Ini's older sister, died in a car accident after falling asleep at the wheel. However, Testimony 3 claims that Ini was the one who fell asleep in the passenger's seat, which contradicts the fact that Mimi was the one who died in the car accident.

Evidence 6 (Newspaper Clipping 2) and Testimony 4 (She, like, would say things like, "No way am I letting a newb drive my car!") seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 6 states that Mimi Miney, Ini's older sister, died after falling asleep at the wheel, which implies that Mimi was driving the car. However, Testimony 4 claims that Mimi would not let a new driver (Ini) drive her car, which contradicts the fact that Mimi was the one who died in the car accident while driving.

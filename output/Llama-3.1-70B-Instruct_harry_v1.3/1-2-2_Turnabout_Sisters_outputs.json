    "response": "Evidence 2 and Testimony 3 seem to contradict each other. Evidence 2 describes the broken remains of a glass light stand, but Testimony 3 mentions lab test results showing the blood on the memo was the victim's, but it does not mention the memo being written on the glass shards, nor does it mention the memo being next to the glass shards. However, the actual contradiction lies in Evidence 2 and Testimony 5. Testimony 5 states that the victim wrote the killer's name before she died, but Evidence 2 describes the broken glass shards, which does not support this claim. However, Evidence 2 does not directly contradict Testimony 5.\n\nA more accurate contradiction can be found between Evidence 5 and Testimony 5. Evidence 5 describes Mia's Autopsy Report, which states that death was instantaneous, but Testimony 5 claims that the victim wrote the killer's name before she died. This implies that the victim lived for a short time after being hit, which contradicts the autopsy report.\n\n{\"evidence\": 5, \"testimony\": 5}",

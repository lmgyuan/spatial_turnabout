Evidence 9 (Pistol) and Testimony 3 (The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 9 states that the pistol was fired twice, and bears Maya's and Grey's fingerprints, which implies that there may have been a struggle or a fight between Maya and Grey. However, Testimony 3 claims that the defendant (Maya) attacked and killed a person (Grey) who was not fighting back, which contradicts the fact that Grey's fingerprints were found on the pistol.

Evidence 8 (Dr. Grey's Autopsy Report) and Testimony 3 (The victim took a shot, but because they were too close, he missed) seem to contradict each other.

Evidence 8 states that Dr. Grey was shot in the forehead at point-blank, which implies that the shot was not missed. However, Testimony 3 claims that the victim (Dr. Grey) took a shot but missed, which contradicts the fact that Dr. Grey was shot in the forehead.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 8: Floor Plans and Testimony 8: "The victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!" and also Testimony 1 from April which states "The victim--the woman--dodged the first attack and ran off to the right." However since the question only asks for one pair, I will answer with Testimony 8 from White and Evidence 8, because the evidence does not explicitly state that the victim ran to the left, but it can be used to confirm or deny the statement in the testimony.

However, a more direct answer is Testimony 8 and Testimony 1 from April which states that the victim ran to the right. But since the question asks for an evidence, I will answer with Evidence 8 and Testimony 8.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 1: The Thinker and Testimony 2: "And then you hit her, savagely! That is what I saw."

The evidence, The Thinker, is a statue that was used to commit the crime, implying a single blow. On the other hand, Testimony 2 states that the victim was hit "savagely", implying multiple blows. However, Testimony 6 states "You see? You hit her twice!" which also implies multiple blows. But Testimony 2 does not directly contradict Evidence 1, it is Testimony 2 and Testimony 6 that directly contradict Testimony 3 and Testimony 4.

However, the most direct answer is Evidence 1 and Testimony 6, because Evidence 1 is a statue and Testimony 6 implies multiple hits.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 1: The Thinker and Testimony 5: "Then you did her in with a single blow! Thwap!"

The evidence, The Thinker, is a statue that was used to commit the crime, but the testimony does not mention the statue. However, this is not a direct contradiction.

A more direct answer is Evidence 2: Glass Shards and Testimony 5: "Then you did her in with a single blow! Thwap!" and Testimony 1: "A light stand was lying on the floor when I looked." The evidence, Glass Shards, implies that the victim was killed by a broken glass object, possibly a light stand. On the other hand, Testimony 5 states that the victim was killed with a single blow, but does not mention a glass object. Testimony 1 also mentions a light stand, but this is not a direct contradiction with Testimony 5.

However, a more direct answer is Evidence 1 and Testimony 5, because Evidence 1 is a statue and Testimony 5 implies a different object.

{"evidence": 1, "testimony": 5}
The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 1: The Thinker and Testimony 3: "That is when I saw this glass light stand."

The evidence, The Thinker, is a statue, but the testimony mentions a glass light stand, which is actually Evidence 2: Glass Shards. This implies that Redd White is not telling the truth about the object he saw.

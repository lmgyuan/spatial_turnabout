The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 1: Powers's Letter and Testimony 7: "It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!"

The evidence, Powers's Letter, is a letter written by Powers stating that he was not at the studio on the day of the murder. On the other hand, Testimony 7 states that Powers was seen heading towards the studio at 2:00 PM. This implies that either Powers is lying in his letter or the Security Lady (Oldbag) is lying in her testimony.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 8: Trailer Key and Testimony 2: "No one else went there!"

The evidence, Trailer Key, implies that someone else had access to the trailer, which is likely the studio where Jack Hammer was killed. On the other hand, Testimony 2 states that no one else went to the studio before 2:30 PM, except for Will Powers. This implies that the Security Lady (Oldbag) is not telling the whole truth, as someone else must have had access to the trailer.

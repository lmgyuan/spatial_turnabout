The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 15: Max G. Bust and Testimony 0: "I suppose I could have lifted something the size of that bust."

The evidence, Max G. Bust, is a large and heavy object, but Testimony 0 states that Acro could have lifted it, which is contradicted by Testimony 3: "There's no way I could have exerted that kind of force on my lower body." This implies that Acro's injuries would have made it impossible for him to lift the bust.

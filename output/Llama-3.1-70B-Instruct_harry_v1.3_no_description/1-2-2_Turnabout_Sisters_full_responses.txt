The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 2: Glass Shards and Testimony 5: "Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!"

The evidence, Glass Shards, implies that the victim was killed by a broken glass object, possibly in a sudden or violent manner, which would make it difficult for the victim to write the killer's name. On the other hand, Testimony 5 states that the victim wrote the killer's name before she died, which implies a more calm and deliberate action. These two pieces of information contradict each other, as the victim's death being caused by Glass Shards would likely not have allowed for the calm and deliberate action of writing the killer's name.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 2: Glass Shards and Testimony 4: "That... that clock! Um... the kinda statue-y clock? 'The Thinker,' I think?"

The evidence, Glass Shards, implies that the victim was killed by a broken glass object. On the other hand, Testimony 4 states that the murder was committed with a statue-y clock called "The Thinker", which is also listed as Evidence 1. This implies that the murder was committed with a different object than the Glass Shards.

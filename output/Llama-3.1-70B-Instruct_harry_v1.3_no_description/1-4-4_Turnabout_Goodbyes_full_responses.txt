The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 4: Lake Photo and Testimony 4: "I looked out over the lake, but I didn't notice the boat."

The evidence, Lake Photo, shows a boat on the lake, but Testimony 4 states that Larry Butz did not notice the boat when he looked out over the lake. This implies that the boat should not be visible in the photograph, but it is.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 5: Gourdy Article and Testimony 5: "Just when she said 'Hey! It's almost Christmas!' I heard the gunshot!"

The evidence, Gourdy Article, states that the DJ's show ended at 9 PM, but Testimony 5 states that the DJ said "Hey! It's almost Christmas!" just before the gunshot, implying that the show was still on at the time of the gunshot. However, the Gourdy Article also mentions that the gunshot occurred at 10 PM, which contradicts the testimony.

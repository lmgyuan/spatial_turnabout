The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 11: Maya's Costume and Testimony 2: "As you can see, it's covered in blood."

The evidence, Maya's Costume, does not show any bloodstains, but Testimony 2 states that the costume is covered in blood. This implies that the costume should have bloodstains, but it does not.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 8: Dr. Grey's Autopsy Report and Testimony 1: "Of course, the victim used the last of his strength to fight back, sir."

The evidence, Dr. Grey's Autopsy Report, likely states that the victim died from a single stab wound or gunshot, but Testimony 1 states that the victim fought back, implying that there should be multiple injuries or defensive wounds on the victim's body.

The evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 9: Pistol Bullet and Testimony 4: "I picked it up, and threw it at Mr. Yogi. I wanted them to stop fighting."

The evidence, Pistol Bullet, implies that a pistol was fired, but Testimony 4 states that Miles Edgeworth threw something at Mr. Yogi, not that he fired a pistol. This implies that the object Edgeworth threw was not a pistol, but the presence of a pistol bullet suggests that a pistol was indeed fired.

The Blackout Record states that the electricity was out from noon to 6 PM on the day of the crime, which would explain why the phone wasn't working. However, Sahwit claims to have seen the defendant fleeing at 1:00 PM (Testimony 8), but the autopsy report (Evidence 1) states the time of death was between 4 PM and 5 PM. This inconsistency suggests that Sahwit's testimony about the phone not working due to the blackout contradicts the timeline of events.\n"

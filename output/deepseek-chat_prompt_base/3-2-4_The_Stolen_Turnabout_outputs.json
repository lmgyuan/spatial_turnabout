    "cot": "Here's one pair where the evidence and testimony contradict each other:\n\n- **Testimony 3 (Atmey)**: Atmey claims he sent the calling card 10 days beforehand, implying he knew about the urn's existence and its value at that time.\n- **Evidence 10 (Blackmail Letter)**: The blackmail letter reveals that Ron DeLite was being blackmailed to steal the urn, and the letter was written by Kane Bullard. This suggests the urn's value and existence were known to others, but Atmey's testimony about sending the calling card 10 days prior contradicts the timeline and his knowledge of the urn, as the urn was only moved and revealed later.\n\nThe contradiction lies in Atmey's claim of knowing the urn's value and sending the calling card 10 days prior, while other evidence suggests the urn's status was not publicly known until later.\n\n```json"

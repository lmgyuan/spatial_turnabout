Since they started with 3500 points each (Testimony 0), if the victim had 9200 points, that would mean he won 5700 points from the defendant, who would then have negative points (-2200), which is impossible in poker as you can't bet more than you have.\n\nThis contradicts Testimony 3's claim that the victim was winning, as the chip counts show an impossible situation where the defendant would have had to bet more than he possessed.\n"

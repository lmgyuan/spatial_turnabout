Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 5 states, "A moment later, there was a single gunshot, then a scream." However, Evidence 18, which is "DL-6 Case File," states that "the murder weapon was fired twice", which implies that there were two gunshots, not just one as stated in Testimony 5.

{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 5}

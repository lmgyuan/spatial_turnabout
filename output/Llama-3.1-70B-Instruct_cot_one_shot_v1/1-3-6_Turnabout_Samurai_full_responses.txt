Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 5 states, "Sal and I ate t-bone steaks on the table in front of the trailer." However, Evidence 16, which is "Steak Plate," states that it was found in the employee area, not in front of the trailer. This implies that the steak plate was not used by Sal and Vasquez in front of the trailer as stated in Testimony 5.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 7 states, "I knew that Hammer was injured and couldn't do any action scenes, so I left them behind." However, Evidence 3, which is "Jack's Autopsy Report," states that the time of death was 10/15 at 2:30 PM, and the cause of death was pierced through the chest by a spear, which implies that Jack Hammer was killed during an action scene.

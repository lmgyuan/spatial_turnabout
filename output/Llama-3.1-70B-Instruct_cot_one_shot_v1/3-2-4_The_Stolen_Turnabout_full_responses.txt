Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 5 states, "At last, I held the urn in my hands for the first time at 1 AM on October 12th." However, Evidence 5, which is "DeMasque's Calling Card," states that the card was sent "10 days beforehand" and the message is "Take good care of the speckled urn, won't you...", which implies that Atmey was aware of the urn's existence before the day of the crime, contradicting his statement.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 2 states, "It was Mr. Bullard who wrote the blackmail letter and sent it to Ron DeLite." However, Evidence 10, which is "Blackmail Letter," states that it was "Written with a fountain pen. Found in Ron's room", which implies that the blackmail letter was not written by Kane Bullard, but rather was found in Ron DeLite's room.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 0 states, "I suppose I could have lifted something the size of that bust." However, Evidence 15, which is "Max G. Bust," states that the bust "looks rather heavy", which implies that Acro's statement about being able to lift the bust may not be entirely accurate.

{"evidence": 15, "testimony": 0}

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 4 states, "I wasn't, like, scared at all. And, like, her costume looked totally, like, normal." However, Evidence 13, which is "Lotta's Photo 2," states that Maya Fey is standing, pistol in hand, wearing a "blood-splattered robe", which implies that Maya's costume was not normal.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 6 states, "I, like, didn't have my license, so, like, I couldn't take over driving for her." However, Evidence 18, which is "License Photo," states that it is "Ini's photo for her driver's license", which implies that Ini did have a driver's license.

{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 6}
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 3 states, "My sis' new car was, like, a totally special model from England." However, Evidence 6, which is "Newspaper Clipping 2," states that Mimi Miney "died after falling asleep at the wheel", which implies that Mimi was driving a car, but it does not mention that the car was a special model from England. However, a more direct contradiction is found between Testimony 3 and Evidence 6. Testimony 3 states, "My sis' new car was, like, a totally special model from England." However, Evidence 6, which is "Newspaper Clipping 2," states that Mimi Miney "died after falling asleep at the wheel", but it does not mention that the car was a special model from England, it actually implies that Mimi was driving a regular car.

However, another more direct contradiction is found between Testimony 0 and Evidence 18. Testimony 0 states, "Like, around that time, I was, like, really close to getting my license." However, Evidence 18, which is "License Photo," states that it is "Ini's photo for her driver's license", which implies that Ini already had a driver's license.

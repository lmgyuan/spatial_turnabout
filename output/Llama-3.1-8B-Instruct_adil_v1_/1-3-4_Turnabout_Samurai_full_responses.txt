The testimony about getting lost on the way to the studio for about 30 minutes (Testimony 4) contradicts the evidence of Mr. Monkey's Head (Evidence 11), which blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM, suggesting that Cody would not have been able to get to the studio during that time.

The testimony about missing the shot because the lens wouldn't open in time (Testimony 3) contradicts the testimony about taking a few shots and then erasing them (Testimony 5).

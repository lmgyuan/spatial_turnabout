Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's start by going through the evidence and testimonies one by one to see if anything stands out as conflicting.

First, I'll look at the evidence. There's a lot here, but a few pieces catch my attention. Evidence 5 is Mia's Autopsy Report, which states that Mia died from a single blunt force trauma and that the death was instantaneous. It also mentions that she may have lived for a few minutes after being hit. This seems pretty straightforward.

Now, looking at the testimonies, I see that Testimony 5 comes from Gumshoe, where he says, "Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name!" This is interesting because the autopsy report doesn't mention anything about Mia writing the killer's name before she died. In fact, it says the death was instantaneous, which would mean she didn't have time to write anything after being struck.

So, there's a contradiction here. The autopsy report suggests that Mia died immediately from the blunt trauma without any opportunity to write, but Gumshoe's testimony claims that she did write the killer's name before dying. These two pieces of information don't align, which indicates a direct contradiction between Evidence 5 and Testimony 5.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's start by going through the evidence and testimonies one by one to see where there might be discrepancies.

First, looking at the evidence:

- **Evidence 5: Mia's Autopsy Report** states that Mia died from a single blunt force trauma and that the death was instantaneous. It also mentions that she may have lived for a few minutes after being hit.

Now, looking at the testimonies provided by Redd White:

- **Testimony 1:** White claims that Maya first ran to the left after being attacked.
- **Testimony 2:** He says that Maya was hit savagely by the defendant.
- **Testimony 3:** White mentions that with her last strength, Maya ran to the right.
- **Testimony 4:** He states that the defendant chased Maya and delivered the final blow.
- **Testimony 6:** White emphasizes that the defendant hit Maya twice.

From the autopsy report, it's clear that Mia died from a single blow, not multiple hits. However, White's testimonies suggest that there were multiple attacks: Maya was hit once, ran, and then was hit again. This directly contradicts the medical evidence that shows only one blunt force trauma caused her death.

Therefore, the contradiction lies between **Evidence 5 (Mia's Autopsy Report)** and **Testimony 6 (White's claim that the defendant hit Maya twice)**.
</think>

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 6}
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let me start by going through the evidence and testimonies one by one to see if I can spot any inconsistencies.

First, looking at the evidence:

- **Evidence 0**: Attorney's Badge. This seems straightforward, just identifying the attorney.
- **Evidence 1**: The Thinker. It's the murder weapon, a clock statue made by Larry Butz, with gears removed.
- **Evidence 2**: Glass Shards. These are from a broken glass light stand.
- **Evidence 3**: Receipt. It's for a glass light stand, bought the day before the murder, with blood on the back.
- **Evidence 4**: Maya's Memo. Says a conversation with her sister is on her cell phone.
- **Evidence 5**: Mia's Autopsy Report. Time of death is 9/5 at 9:00PM, cause is a single blunt force trauma, death was instantaneous, but she might have lived a few minutes after.
- **Evidence 6**: Maya's Cell Phone. Has a conversation between the Chief and Maya.
- **Evidence 7**: Wiretap. Found in Miss May's hotel room.
- **Evidence 8**: Floor Plans. Murder scene at Fey & Co. Offices, with a note about the stand being blocked from view.
- **Evidence 9**: May Testimony. Says the victim dodged an attack, ran to the right, was caught and struck.
- **Evidence 10**: Photograph. DL-6 Incident Exhibit A.
- **Evidence 11**: Photograph. DL-6 Incident Exhibit B.
- **Evidence 12**: Bellboy's Affidavit. Describes a man with Miss May at the hotel.
- **Evidence 13**: Newspaper Clipping. Politician's suicide with "White" written on top.
- **Evidence 14**: Mia's Memo. List of people's names.

Now, the testimonies:

- **Testimony 0**: White says he looked at another window when he heard something fall.
- **Testimony 1**: Saw a light stand on the floor.
- **Testimony 2**: Saw Miss Mia run to the left.
- **Testimony 3**: The killer (me, according to him) attacked her, but she dodged.
- **Testimony 4**: She ran for the door.
- **Testimony 5**: I struck her with a single blow, killing her instantly.

Looking for contradictions, let's see:

- **Testimony 2 and 3**: White says Mia ran to the left, but **Evidence 9** says she ran to the right. That's a direct contradiction.
  
- **Testimony 5**: Says she died instantly from a single blow, but **Evidence 5** says she may have lived a few minutes after being hit. Another contradiction.

So, there are at least two pairs that contradict each other. But the user asked for one pair. I'll choose the most direct one: Testimony 2 and 3 vs Evidence 9.
</think>

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 2}
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to identify a pair consisting of one evidence and one testimony that contradict each other. To do this, I'll start by carefully examining each piece of evidence and testimony to understand their contents and see where inconsistencies might arise.

First, I'll list out the key points from the evidence and testimonies provided.

**Evidences:**
- **Evidence 0:** Attorney's Badge - Not directly relevant to the murder.
- **Evidence 1:** The Thinker - The murder weapon, a clock statue with gears removed.
- **Evidence 2:** Glass Shards - Broken remains of a glass light stand.
- **Evidence 3:** Receipt - For a glass light stand, purchased the day before the murder, with blood on the back.
- **Evidence 4:** Maya's Memo - Records a conversation with her sister.
- **Evidence 5:** Mia's Autopsy Report - Death by blunt force trauma, time of death at 9:00 PM.
- **Evidence 6:** Maya's Cell Phone - Contains a conversation.
- **Evidence 7:** Wiretap - Found in April May's hotel room.
- **Evidence 8:** Floor Plans - Murder scene, Fey & Co. Law Offices.
- **Evidence 9:** May Testimony - Victim dodged attack, ran right, then struck.
- **Evidence 10:** Photograph - DL-6 Incident Exhibit A.
- **Evidence 11:** Photograph - DL-6 Incident Exhibit B.
- **Evidence 12:** Bellboy's Affidavit - Describes a man with April May.
- **Evidence 13:** Newspaper Clipping - Politician's suicide, "White" written on top.
- **Evidence 14:** Mia's Memo - List of names.

**Testimonies:**
- **Testimony 0:** White - Entered Fey & Co. offices the week before the murder.
- **Testimony 1:** White - Entered to place a wiretap.
- **Testimony 2:** White - Saw a glass light stand during this time.

Now, I'll look for contradictions between evidence and testimony.

1. **Testimony 0, 1, 2 by White** state that he entered the Fey & Co. offices the week before the murder to place a wiretap and saw a glass light stand. This implies that the glass light stand was present and intact at that time.

2. **Evidence 2 and 3** indicate that the glass light stand was broken into shards and that a receipt for it exists, dated the day before the murder. This suggests that the glass light stand was purchased and possibly broken on the day of the murder.

The contradiction arises because White claims to have seen the glass light stand a week before the murder, but the evidence suggests that the stand was purchased and broken the day before the murder. If the stand was purchased the day before the murder, it wouldn't have been present a week earlier when White claims to have seen it.

Therefore, **Evidence 3** (Receipt showing purchase the day before the murder) contradicts **Testimony 2** (White claims to have seen the glass light stand a week before the murder).

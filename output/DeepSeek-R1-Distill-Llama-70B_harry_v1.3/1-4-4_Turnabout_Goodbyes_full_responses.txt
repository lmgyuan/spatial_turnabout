Alright, I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let me start by going through the evidence and testimonies provided.

First, I'll look at the evidence. There's a Lake Photo (Evidence 4) that was taken automatically on December 25th at 12:15 AM. The photo shows one person holding a gun and firing at another person, but the fog is so thick that their faces aren't visible. This seems like a crucial piece of evidence because it captures the exact moment of the shooting.

Next, I'll examine the testimonies. Testimony 0 from Larry Butz says he was out in a boat on the lake that night. Testimony 3 mentions that after he found something, he heard a "bang" and looked out over the lake but didn't notice the boat. Testimony 4 states that after hearing the single gunshot, he went home.

Now, I need to see if any of these testimonies contradict the evidence. The Lake Photo shows two people involved in the shooting, but Larry Butz's testimony only mentions hearing a single gunshot and not seeing the boat. This seems contradictory because the photo clearly shows two individuals, implying that there was more than one person involved. If Larry was there and only heard one gunshot, it doesn't align with the photo showing two people.

Additionally, Testimony 5 says he went home after hearing the single gunshot, which doesn't explain the presence of two people in the photo. It makes me question if Larry is withholding information or if there's more to the story than he's letting on.

So, the contradiction here is between the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) showing two people and Larry Butz's testimony (Testimony 0) about only hearing one gunshot and not seeing the boat. This inconsistency suggests that Larry might not be telling the whole truth or there's an error in his account.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let me start by going through the evidence and testimonies provided.

First, the evidence. There's a Lake Photo (Evidence 4) that was taken automatically on December 25th at 12:15 AM. The photo shows one person holding a gun and firing at another, but the fog is so thick that their faces can't be seen clearly. This seems like a key piece of evidence because it actually captures the moment of the shooting.

Now, looking at the testimonies, I see that Larry Butz (Character 4) made several statements. In Testimony 5, he says, "Just when she said 'Hey! It's almost Christmas!' I heard the gunshot!" This suggests that he heard a single gunshot at that specific time. 

But wait, according to the Lake Photo, there were actually two people involved in the shootingâ€”one firing a gun and another being shot. If Butz only heard one gunshot, that might mean he didn't see or hear the other person, which could indicate that the photo shows something he didn't perceive or acknowledge. Alternatively, if the photo shows two people but he only heard one shot, there might be a discrepancy in his testimony.

Another point is the timing. The Lake Photo was taken at 12:15 AM, and Butz mentions hearing the gunshot when the DJ said it was almost Christmas, which would align with that time. So, the timing seems consistent, but the number of gunshots or people involved might be the conflicting point.

I also see that there's a Pistol (Evidence 10) that was fired three times, and Pistol Bullets (Evidence 9) that match the murder weapon. But Butz only mentions hearing one gunshot. This could mean that there were multiple shots, but he only heard one, which might be because he was distracted by the radio or the environment.

Furthermore, Lotta Hart (Character 3) has a testimony where she mentions hearing two sounds like gunshots (Testimony 11). This supports the idea that there were multiple shots, which contradicts Butz's claim of hearing only one.

So, putting it all together, the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) shows a scene with two individuals and likely multiple shots, while Butz's testimony (Testimony 5) indicates he only heard one gunshot. This discrepancy suggests that Butz might not have been telling the whole truth or didn't notice the second shot, which could be important for the investigation.

Therefore, the contradiction lies between Evidence 4 (Lake Photo) and Testimony 5 (Butz's statement about hearing only one gunshot).

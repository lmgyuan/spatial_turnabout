Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm presented with a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies, and I need to identify a pair where the evidence and testimony contradict each other. I have to choose only one pair and present it in a specific JSON format.

First, I'll start by understanding the context. The scenario seems to be a murder investigation involving several characters, with Dr. Turner Grey being the victim. The defendant in question is Maya Fey, who is a spirit medium and the sister of Mia Fey. The evidence includes various items like the Attorney's Badge, Guidemap of Fey Manor, Maya's Magatama, Newspaper Clippings, Folding Screen, Black Key, Floor Plans of the crime scene, Dr. Grey's Autopsy Report, Pistol, Knife, Maya's Costume, Lotta's Photos, Sacred Urn, Cloth Scrap, Pearl's Ball, Clothing Box, and License Photo.

The testimonies provided are from Dick Gumshoe, the detective in charge. He presents Maya's Costume as evidence, stating it's covered in blood and that Maya attacked Dr. Grey, who wasn't fighting back.

Now, I need to find a contradiction between any evidence and testimony. Let's look at the evidence and testimonies in detail.

Evidence 11 is Maya's Costume, which has blood splatters and a bullet hole in the sleeve. The testimony from Gumshoe (Testimony 3) claims that Maya attacked Dr. Grey, who wasn't fighting back. However, the presence of a bullet hole in Maya's costume suggests that she might have been shot at, implying that there was some form of struggle or retaliation, which contradicts Gumshoe's statement that Dr. Grey wasn't fighting back.

Therefore, Evidence 11 (Maya's Costume) and Testimony 3 (Gumshoe's statement) contradict each other because the bullet hole in the costume indicates that Dr. Grey might have defended himself, which Gumshoe's testimony denies.

Alright, let's try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. So, we have a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies related to the murder of Dr. Turner Grey.

First, I need to understand the testimonies given by Detective Gumshoe. He describes a scenario where Maya Fey stabbed the victim in the chest during a channeling session. The victim, Dr. Grey, then fought back, pulled out a gun, and missed a shot because they were too close. Finally, Maya took the gun and killed him.

Now, looking at the evidence, there's Dr. Grey's autopsy report which states that he was stabbed in the chest and then shot in the forehead at point-blank range. There's also the Pistol evidence, which is the murder weapon, and it bears both Maya's and Grey's fingerprints. Additionally, Maya's Costume has blood splatters and a bullet hole in the sleeve.

The key point here is the bullet hole in Maya's costume. If the shot was fired at point-blank range, as the autopsy suggests, there should be gunpowder residue around the bullet hole in the costume. However, the description of Maya's Costume mentions a bullet hole but doesn't mention any gunpowder residue, which would be expected in a point-blank shot.

This discrepancy suggests that the testimony about the shooting being at point-blank might not align with the physical evidence, as the lack of gunpowder residue on the costume contradicts the autopsy's findings.

So, the evidence that contradicts the testimony is the absence of gunpowder residue on Maya's Costume, which should have been present if the shot was fired at point-blank range as described.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I have a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies related to a case, and I need to find a pair where the evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user has provided a specific format for the answer, which is a JSON object with the evidence and testimony numbers.

First, I'll look at the evidence and testimonies provided to understand their contents. The key is to find a contradiction between what a piece of evidence states and what a testimony claims.

Looking at the evidence, I notice Evidence 18: DL-6 Case File, which mentions that the murder weapon was fired twice. On the other hand, Evidence 10: Pistol, states that the weapon was fired three times. This discrepancy suggests a contradiction between these two pieces of evidence, but the user wants a contradiction between an evidence and a testimony.

Now, examining the testimonies, Testimony 5 by Edgeworth mentions that there was a single gunshot after he threw something at Mr. Yogi. However, Evidence 10 indicates that the pistol was fired three times. This directly contradicts Edgeworth's testimony of hearing only one gunshot.

So, the contradiction lies between Testimony 5 (which claims one gunshot) and Evidence 10 (which states the pistol was fired three times). This seems to be the pair that contradicts each other.

I should make sure there's no other more significant contradiction, but from the provided information, this seems to be the most clear-cut example.

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 5}

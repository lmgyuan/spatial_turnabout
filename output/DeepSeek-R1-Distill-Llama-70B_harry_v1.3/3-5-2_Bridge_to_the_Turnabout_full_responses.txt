Alright, I need to find a pair where the evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by examining the evidence and testimonies.

Looking at the evidence, the Crystal Sphere (Evidence 16) is found near Dusky Bridge with blood on it, suggesting it was used in the crime. However, the Dagger (Evidence 19) is found but doesn't match the victim's blood, indicating it's not the murder weapon.

Now, considering the testimonies, Bikini's Testimony 0 states she was helping an acolyte that night, implying she wasn't at the crime scene. However, the Crime Photo (Evidence 13) shows the courtyard where the victim was found, suggesting she might have been present.

The contradiction lies in Bikini's alibi and the evidence suggesting she was at the scene. Therefore, the evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 16 and Testimony 0.

{"evidence": 16, "testimony": 0}
{"evidence": 16, "testimony": 3}
{"evidence": 16, "testimony": 5}
{"evidence": 16, "testimony": 5}
{"evidence": 16, "testimony": 5}
{"evidence": 16, "testimony": 5}

{"evidence": 16, "testimony": 5}

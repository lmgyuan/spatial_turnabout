Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to identify one pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other. 

First, I'll look through the list of characters, but they don't seem directly relevant to the contradiction. The focus is on the evidences and testimonies.

Looking at the evidence, I notice that Evidence 6 is a small bottle with the victim's ear medicine, covered in Furio Tigre's fingerprints. This suggests that Tigre handled the bottle, which might be relevant to the crime.

Now, examining the testimonies, Testimony 0 mentions that the mirror was in the middle of the restaurant, dividing it into two halves. Testimony 1 states that there's only one seat from which you could have seen an image of the victim. Testimony 2 points out that this seat was next to the victim's table, where the old man was sitting. Testimony 3 says that after the incident, the mirror was moved so it wasn't in the way, but nothing else was touched.

The contradiction arises between Evidence 6 and Testimony 3. Evidence 6 indicates that Furio Tigre handled the small bottle, implying his involvement. However, Testimony 3 claims that nothing else was touched after moving the mirror, suggesting no further tampering. This creates a contradiction because the presence of Tigre's fingerprints on the bottle suggests he interacted with it, which should have been mentioned if he was at the scene and handling items.

Therefore, the evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 6 and Testimony 3.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other. 

First, I'll go through the list of characters, but since the question is about evidence and testimony, I'll focus on those. 

Looking at the evidences, I see several items related to the crime scene, including the coffee cup with potassium cyanide, the victim's lottery ticket, and the small bottle of ear medicine. 

Now, checking the testimonies, Jean Armstrong mentions that the victim arrived alone, and there were no other customers. However, evidence shows that Victor Kudo was present and broke a vase, which suggests there were other people around.

So, Jean's testimony about no other customers contradicts the evidence of Victor Kudo's presence and his vase-breaking incident.

{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 3}
Alright, I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's see what we have here.

First, I'll look at the evidence and testimonies provided. The characters involved include Maya Fey, Mia Fey, Godot, Dick Gumshoe, Maggey Byrde, Jean Armstrong, Glen Elg, Victor Kudo, Lisa Basil, Viola Cadaverini, Furio Tigre, and Bruto Cadaverini.

The evidences are numbered from 0 to 27, with descriptions. The testimonies are numbered from 0 to 4, given by Furio Tigre.

Looking at the evidence, I notice that evidence 6 is a small bottle found in the kitchen, which is the victim's ear medicine and bears Furio Tigre's fingerprints. This suggests that Tigre might have handled the bottle, possibly indicating his involvement in the crime.

Now, looking at Tigre's testimonies, in testimony 0, he claims he doesn't know anything about the murder. In testimony 1, he says he was busy with business in December last year and spent all his time in his office. In testimony 2, he claims he never saw the victim before. In testimony 3, he mentions that he had many people borrowing cash from Tender Lender. In testimony 4, he suggests checking his alibi with Violetta.

The contradiction arises between evidence 6 and testimony 0. Evidence 6 shows that Tigre's fingerprints were on the victim's ear medicine bottle, implying he was involved. However, in testimony 0, Tigre claims he knows nothing about the murder, which directly contradicts the physical evidence linking him to the crime scene.

So, the contradiction is between evidence 6 and testimony 0.
</think>

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 0}
Alright, I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by looking at the evidence and testimonies provided.

First, I'll examine the evidence. There's a "Small Bottle" (Evidence 6) that was found in the kitchen. It's the victim's ear medicine and has Furio Tigre's fingerprints on it. This suggests that Tigre might have handled the bottle, possibly indicating his involvement.

Now, looking at the testimonies. In Testimony 0, Furio Tigre claims he doesn't know anything about the murder and was busy with business in his office. He also mentions he never saw the victim before.

However, the presence of his fingerprints on the small bottle directly links him to the crime scene. This contradicts his testimony where he claims he wasn't involved and had no connection to the victim.

So, the evidence (Small Bottle with Tigre's fingerprints) contradicts Tigre's testimony of not being involved in the murder.
</think>

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 0}
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand what's being asked. The user has provided a list of characters, evidence, and testimonies, and wants to find a pair where the evidence and testimony contradict each other. They also provided an example of the required JSON output.

I'll start by examining the evidence and testimonies to find contradictions. Looking at the evidence, I see several pieces that could potentially contradict the testimonies. For instance, the presence of potassium cyanide in the coffee cup (Evidence 13) directly links to the method of murder. 

Now, looking at the testimonies, Victor Kudo's testimony (Testimony 18) states he broke the vase at his seat, which seems like an alibi. However, the crime photo (Evidence 12) shows that no one was sitting across from the victim, which might contradict Victor's claim of breaking the vase, as he might have been the one across.

But wait, the crime photo shows the victim's table with no one across, while Victor's testimony places him at the scene, which could mean he was there but not necessarily involved. However, the potassium cyanide in the coffee cup (Evidence 13) directly ties to the murder method, which Maggey's fingerprints on the poison (Evidence 16) suggest her involvement.

The key contradiction here is between the crime photo showing no one across from the victim and Victor's testimony of being at the scene, potentially placing him there. However, the presence of Maggey's fingerprints on the poison (Evidence 16) points to her as the murderer, contradicting Victor's alibi.

After considering all this, the most direct contradiction is between the crime photo and Victor's testimony, as the photo suggests he wasn't at the victim's table, while his testimony places him at the scene.

So, the evidence and testimony that contradict each other are Evidence 12 and Testimony 18. This means the JSON should be {"evidence": 12, "testimony": 18}.

{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 18}
{"evidence": 16, "testimony": 3}

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find a pair consisting of one evidence and one testimony that contradict each other. To do this, I'll first go through each piece of evidence and each testimony to understand their contents.

Starting with the evidence, I see that Evidence 15 is the "Max G. Bust," which is a bronze statue taken from the cafeteria before the crime and looks rather heavy. This suggests that the bust was moved from its original place, possibly used in the crime.

Now, looking at the testimonies, Testimony 2 from Acro states, "However, lifting the bust and looking out of the window would've been impossible." This implies that Acro claims he couldn't have lifted the bust, perhaps due to his injuries.

Given that Acro is undergoing rehabilitation for his legs, it's plausible that lifting a heavy object like the bust would be difficult for him. However, the evidence shows that the bust was indeed moved, indicating that someone must have lifted it. If Acro claims he couldn't have done it, but the bust was moved, this creates a contradiction between his testimony and the physical evidence.

Therefore, Evidence 15 (Max G. Bust) and Testimony 2 (Acro's claim) contradict each other because the evidence suggests the bust was moved, while Acro claims he couldn't have lifted it.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other. 

First, I'll go through the list of characters, but since the question is about evidence and testimony, I'll focus on those. 

Looking at the evidences provided, I see several items related to the crime scene, including a coffee cup with potassium cyanide, a victim's lottery ticket, and various other objects. The testimonies include statements from Gumshoe about the crime's reporting and the search of Maggey Byrde.

One testimony that stands out is Gumshoe's statement that nothing was missing from the crime scene. However, when I look at the evidence, I see that the victim's prescription bag was empty. This suggests that something might have been taken, which contradicts Gumshoe's testimony.

So, the contradiction is between Gumshoe's claim that nothing was missing and the evidence of the empty prescription bag, implying that something was indeed missing.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's start by going through the evidence and testimonies provided.

First, looking at the evidence, I see that Evidence 16 is the Potassium Cyanide, which is a deadly poison found in Maggey's apron pocket, and it has her fingerprints on it. This suggests that Maggey might have been the one to administer the poison.

Now, looking at the testimonies, Testimony 5 from Victor Kudo states that he saw the serving girl (Maggey) put white powder into the victim's coffee. He also mentions that the victim collapsed after drinking it. This seems to directly support the idea that Maggey was involved in poisoning the victim.

However, there's a contradiction here. Evidence 16 shows that the poison was in Maggey's possession and had her fingerprints, which would incriminate her. But Victor Kudo's testimony also points to her as the one who put the poison in the coffee. So, at first glance, they seem to align rather than contradict each other.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let's check other testimonies. Testimony 4 from Gumshoe mentions that the victim didn't have any identification on him, and they found the lottery ticket and poison on Maggey. This also points to her guilt.

But perhaps the contradiction lies elsewhere. Let me look at other evidence. Evidence 14 is the Victim's Lottery Ticket, which is a winning ticket worth half a million dollars. This could be a motive for the murder, suggesting that Maggey wanted the money.

However, looking back at the testimonies, Victor Kudo's testimony seems to be the key. He directly accuses Maggey of poisoning the victim. But if we consider the possibility that Victor might be lying or mistaken, that could create a contradiction.

Wait, but the evidence supports Victor's testimony. The poison was found in Maggey's apron, and she had the lottery ticket. So, both the evidence and testimony point to her guilt, meaning they don't contradict each other.

Hmm, maybe I need to look for a different pair. Let's consider Evidence 6, the Small Bottle, which was the victim's ear medicine and had Furio Tigre's fingerprints. This suggests that Furio might have handled the bottle, potentially implicating him.

But looking at the testimonies, there's no direct mention of Furio being involved in the poisoning. Victor's testimony focuses on Maggey. So, perhaps there's a contradiction between the evidence pointing to Furio and the testimony focusing on Maggey.

Wait, but the main contradiction seems to be between Victor's testimony and the evidence. Victor says he saw Maggey put something in the coffee, and the evidence confirms the poison was in her possession. So, they actually support each other rather than contradict.

Maybe I'm overcomplicating this. The most straightforward contradiction is between the evidence of the poison in Maggey's possession and Victor's testimony accusing her, which actually corroborate each other. Therefore, there might not be a direct contradiction, but if I have to choose, perhaps the closest is Evidence 16 and Testimony 5, as they both incriminate Maggey.

But wait, that's not a contradiction. Maybe the contradiction is elsewhere. Let me think again.

Perhaps the contradiction is between the evidence showing the poison in Maggey's apron and Victor's testimony about seeing her put the poison in the coffee. They both point to her guilt, so they don't contradict each other.

Maybe I need to look for a different pair. Let's consider Evidence 17, the Victim's Prescription Bag, which was empty. This could imply that the victim was using the bag for something else, but there's no testimony directly about this.

Alternatively, Evidence 23, the MC Bomber, which contains a computer virus made by Glen Elg, could be a red herring. But there's no testimony directly contradicting this.

I think I'm stuck. The most obvious contradiction seems to be between the evidence of the poison and Victor's testimony, but they actually support each other. Maybe the intended answer is different.

Perhaps the contradiction is between Evidence 16 (Potassium Cyanide) and Testimony 5 (Victor Kudo's accusation), but they align rather than contradict. Maybe the answer is different.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between the evidence of the poison and the testimony about the victim's time of death. Evidence 10 says the time of death was between 1:30 and 2:30 PM, and Testimony 0 mentions the crime was reported at 2:25 PM, which aligns. So, no contradiction there.

I think I need to conclude that the main contradiction is between Evidence 16 and Testimony 5, even though they seem to support each other. Maybe the contradiction is that Victor's testimony is false, but that's speculative.

After considering all options, I'll go with the initial pair: Evidence 16 and Testimony 5.

{"evidence": 16, "testimony": 5}
Alright, so I need to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's start by understanding the case details.

We have a victim, Glen Elg, who died from potassium cyanide poisoning in a coffee cup at Trés Bien. Maggey Byrde, a waitress there, was found guilty but claims she's innocent. The key evidence includes the coffee cup with both Glen and Maggey's fingerprints, a bottle of potassium cyanide in Maggey's apron, and a lottery ticket found on her.

Now, looking at the testimonies, Victor Kudo testified that he saw Maggey put something in Glen's coffee. He described her as the serving girl with a ribbon in her hair and loose apron straps. He also mentioned that Glen was holding a newspaper and listening to the wireless, which seems a bit unusual.

The evidence that stands out is the potassium cyanide found in Maggey's apron pocket. This directly links her to the poison used in the murder. However, Victor's testimony about Glen holding a newspaper and listening to the wireless while being served by Maggey introduces some inconsistencies. If Glen was occupied with the newspaper and wireless, it might have been difficult for Maggey to slip the poison into his coffee without him noticing. Additionally, the presence of the lottery ticket on Maggey raises questions about her potential motive, but Victor's detailed account of her actions adds credibility to the prosecution's case.

The contradiction lies in the fact that Victor's testimony places Maggey at the scene with the means and opportunity, while the evidence of the poison in her possession strengthens the case against her. However, the details about Glen's activities while being served could imply that there was less opportunity for Maggey to administer the poison without being noticed, which might contradict the direct evidence linking her to the crime.

After considering all the evidence and testimonies, the most contradictory pair is the potassium cyanide in Maggey's apron and Victor's testimony about her actions during the incident. This contradiction highlights the tension between the physical evidence and the eyewitness account, which could be pivotal in the case.

{"evidence": 16, "testimony": 5}
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let me go through the list step by step.

First, I'll look at the characters. The main ones involved seem to be Maggey Byrde, the defendant, and Glen Elg, the victim. The incident happened at Trés Bien, a restaurant where Maggey works. Victor Kudo was a customer there and claims to have witnessed the incident.

Now, looking at the evidences:

- **Evidence 16: Potassium Cyanide** - This is a deadly poison found in Maggey's apron pocket, bearing her fingerprints.
- **Evidence 13: Coffee Cup** - The coffee contained potassium cyanide and had both the victim's and Maggey's fingerprints.

And the testimonies:

- **Testimony 5: Victor Kudo** - He testified that Maggey put white powder into the victim's coffee, which led to his collapse.

At first glance, it seems like the evidence supports Victor's testimony because the poison was found, and Maggey had the poison in her apron. However, I need to check for contradictions.

Wait, looking closer, **Evidence 17: Victim's Prescription Bag** was empty, suggesting the victim might have taken his own medicine, which could be the poison. But Victor's testimony says Maggey put the poison in the coffee, which would mean she's responsible.

But **Evidence 6: Small Bottle** had the victim's ear medicine and Furio Tigre's fingerprints. This could imply someone else handled the bottle, possibly indicating another person was involved.

However, the main contradiction is between **Evidence 16** and **Testimony 5**. Victor's testimony directly accuses Maggey of putting poison in the coffee, but the presence of the victim's prescription bag and the small bottle with Furio's fingerprints suggests there might be another explanation for the poison's origin.

So, the contradiction lies in the source of the poison. If the victim had his own medicine, which could be the poison, it contradicts Victor's claim that Maggey added it to the coffee. This means either Victor is lying, or there's another way the poison was administered.

Thus, the evidence and testimony that contradict each other are **Evidence 16** and **Testimony 5**.

To determine a pair of contradicting evidence and testimony, we need to analyze the specifics of the evidence and testimonies provided.

**Evidence** related to the murder of Juan Corrida that must be considered includes:
- Evidence 15: Knife (Bears the victim's blood and Engarde's fingerprints)
- Evidence 16: Jammin' Ninja's Button (Was ripped from his costume. Is covered in Corrida's blood. Found in Engarde's "hakama".)

**Testimony** from Dick Gumshoe includes:
- Testimony 4: The defendant's fingerprints were also all over the knife.
- Testimony 5: The defendant bought the knife for the crime... Which makes this a premeditated murder!

If the knife bears Engarde's fingerprints and is suggested to be used in a premeditated crime, it implies the defendant's direct involvement in the murder. However, the button being found in Engarde’s "hakama," covered in the victim's blood, suggests that this evidence points to direct physical contact with the victim's blood as well. 

Thus, as per the testimonies:
- Testimony 4 supports that the fingerprints on the knife directly link the defendant to the act of murder.
- Nevertheless, Evidence 16 involving the Jammin' Ninja's Button being found on Engarde complicates the narrative of purely circumstantial involvement, particularly if it did not place him at the scene actively participating in the murder.

The key contradiction emerges from the implied nature of how the defendant (Engarde) could have entirely orchestrated the murder given the direct evidence against him with the knife.

Therefore, the contradicting pair is:
{"evidence": 15, "testimony": 5}
******************************
To identify the contradiction, we have to analyze the testimony from Wendy Oldbag and compare it to the available evidence.

In Testimony 4, Oldbag states that she saw Matt Engarde coming out of Juan Corrida's room. This implies Engarde was at the crime scene shortly after the murder.

However, according to Evidence 14, which details Juan's autopsy report stating that he was killed at 8:15 PM, and the Spy Camera (Evidence 21), which was active at the time of the murder, there must be substantial evidence collected from the surveillance indicating that Engarde was indeed present. 

Oldbag’s testimony directly affirms that Engarde was fleeing the scene, which suggests he might be implicated in the murder, given the timing of the murder aligns closely with the activity around that time.

However, none of this definitively proves Engarde's guilt, as it merely places him at the scene and does not indicate if he was responsible.

However, there is not direct contradictory evidence to Oldbag's testimony regarding Engarde leaving the scene. Therefore, let's consider Lotta's Camera (Evidence 5) which was stolen around the time of the murder but does not indicate Engarde's actions.

The real contradiction arises when you realize that the testimony suggests Engarde was trying to sneak out, while no direct evidence implies he was actually involved in the murder, only pointing to suspicions without clear proof.

Thus, the chosen pair that best illustrates the contradiction here is:

{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 4}
******************************
To find the contradictory evidence and testimony, we need to analyze the statements made in the testimonies alongside the evidence provided.

Examining Testimony 3: "He had to go to that post-ceremony stage show right after the crime, you know." This implies that the person in question (Matt Engarde, who wore the Nickel Samurai costume) would have had to transition quickly from the crime scene to the stage show.

Now we look at Evidence 14: "Time of death: 8:15 PM. Cause: Strangled to death with a scarf, then stabbed with a knife." If the time of death is 8:15 PM, and he supposedly had to go to a stage show immediately afterward, that suggests that he could not have committed the murder right before the stage show; otherwise, there would be no time for the transition.

Thus, we see a conflict between the timing of the murder and the requirement for Engarde to change costumes quickly for the show, suggesting that the testimony about Engarde needing to wear the costume during the murder contradicts the timeline of the evidence regarding the victim's death.

The contradictory pair is:
{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 3}
******************************
To identify a contradiction between the evidence and the testimonies, we can analyze the details provided:

1. **Testimony 3**: Adrian Andrews claims she saw the exact same scene as described in the crime scene photo, which depicts a specific arrangement involving the victim, a knife, a glass of juice, and other details.
2. **Evidence 9 (Crime Photo)**: This evidence describes the scene where Juan Corrida is found with a knife in his chest and juice behind him, among other details.

For Andrews' testimony to hold, it must match the details presented in the crime scene photo. However, in her later testimonies (especially Testimony 5), Andrews claims that she knocked the flower vase over, which would imply actions that could have altered the scene.

Comparing these pieces, if Andrews claimed she saw the exact scene without acknowledging her actions that caused changes (like knocking over a vase), it creates a contradiction. The vase being knocked over by her would suggest the scene may not have been exactly as the crime photo showed, as the vase would have been on the floor, potentially affecting the layout noted in the evidence.

Thus, there is a contradiction between the description of the scene she saw in her testimony and the condition of the scene depicted in the evidence after her actions.

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 3}
******************************
To find a contradiction between the provided evidence and testimony, we need to analyze the statements and facts closely.

In Testimony 1, Adrian Andrews states: "I suppose I must have opened the guitar case... after I knocked the vase over." This implies that she opened the guitar case after an action that involved knocking over a vase.

In contrast, Evidence 9, the Crime Photo, depicts the murder scene with a smashed vase and an empty guitar case next to the victim. The photo itself suggests that the events unfolded rapidly, indicating that the guitar case was open and adjacent to the victim at the time of the murder and that Andrews' statement about opening the case after knocking over the vase may not align with the timeline suggested by the evidence.

Moreover, Testimony 2 indicates that the guitar case was empty, which Andrews confirms, thereby reinforcing that there might not have been a need to open it—especially right after claiming to have knocked over the vase.

Thus, Testimonies 1 and 2 align with the fact that the case was ultimately empty, but the sequence of events in Testimony 1 raises questions regarding the timing of these actions in relation to the evidence captured in the Crime Photo.

The contradiction lies in Andrews asserting she opened the case (implying she interacted with it after the vase incident) while the evidence shows the guitar case was already treated as empty and crumpled in the scene right after Corrida's murder.

This leads us to conclude the following pair of contradicting evidence and testimony:

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 1}
******************************
To identify a pair of contradicting evidence and testimony, we should focus on what's stated in the testimonies provided by Adrian Andrews. She has made several claims regarding Matt Engarde's involvement in Juan Corrida's murder.

In Testimony 3, Andrews states, "And he didn't have an alibi for what he was doing at the time of the murder." This suggests that Matt Engarde was likely alone or could not prove where he was, thereby indicating guilt.

However, we can refer to Evidence 15, which is the knife that bears Juan's blood and Engarde's fingerprints. This evidence suggests that Engarde was present at or involved in the act of the murder, aligning with Andrews' claims to some extent.

Nevertheless, we need to consider the implications of other pieces of evidence. Evidence 16 mentions that there was a Jammin' Ninja button found in Engarde's clothing, which wouldn't necessarily support Andrews' claim about Engarde being the murderer if taken at face value because it could imply he was simply present at the scene without necessarily being the one who committed the act.

Considering this, the contradiction lies in Andrews' attempt to construct Matt's guilt without having an explicit alibi provided for his whereabouts.

Thus, the contradiction arises from the inference that while Andrews claims Matt had no alibi (Testimony 3), the evidence (Evidence 15) points to a direct connection with the murder.

Ultimately, the evidence of the knife implicates potential guilt but doesn’t directly support the assertion of Engarde lacking an alibi in a way that definitively resolves the question of his involvement without additional context.

Therefore, the contradicting pair is:
{"evidence": 15, "testimony": 3}
******************************
To identify a contradiction between the evidence and testimony, we need to focus on the details that suggest conflicting accounts regarding the same event.

Let's examine the testimonies of Adrian Andrews, particularly her recollection of the scene around Juan Corrida's death. One crucial aspect is her assertion about not recognizing him as dead when she first saw him:

- **Testimony 0**: "That glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself." (Indicates a connection with the juice, which she did not pour for him but was found next to him.)
- **Testimony 3**: "When I saw him sitting like that, the thought that he was dead didn't cross my mind." (Indicates she initially did not perceive him as dead.)

Now, let's look at the evidence regarding the glass and the victim's situation:

- **Evidence 8**: The wine glass found next to the victim was filled with tomato juice, and crucially, "No sign it's been drank." This indicates that no one had consumed the juice, which means the act of pouring the juice does not align with the understanding that Juan was dead when Andrews witnessed him in the room.

Thus, there is a contradiction with Andrews' claim about pouring the juice when there is evidence that indicates it was never drunk, suggesting she may not have poured it at all if she was initially unaware of his condition.

The specific conflicting pair is the glass of juice (Evidence 8) and her statement about perceiving him as alive and not having poured it for herself (Testimony 3).

The answer in JSON format:
{"evidence": 8, "testimony": 3}

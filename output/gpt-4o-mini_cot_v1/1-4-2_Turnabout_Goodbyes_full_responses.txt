To determine the evidence and testimony that contradict each other, we first analyze both. 

The testimony provided by Lotta states that she saw "the man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth." This would imply that she saw Miles Edgeworth at the scene around the time of the shooting.

Now, looking at the evidence, particularly Evidence 10, which describes the pistol as the murder weapon and indicates that it bears prints from Edgeworth's right hand, it implies that he shot the victim. However, this raises questions about Lotta's clarity of sight, her vantage point, or potentially mistaken identity, particularly since there could have been other circumstances surrounding the event.

Further evidence we could examine is the autopsy report (Evidence 3), which details the victim's death but doesn't give us a direct contradiction with what Lotta claims. However, Evidence 4 (the lake photo taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM) supports the scenario but doesn't directly contradict the testimony.

Thus, the contradiction lies in the assertion by Lotta that she clearly saw Edgeworth, whereas the circumstances surrounding the case (his fingerprints on the gun) suggest that he might not have been acting as Lotta claims. However, the best immediate contradiction revolves around the potential misidentification due to the circumstances.

The pair of evidence that contradicts Lotta's claim about seeing Edgeworth clearly are the following: the inherent contradiction of her observation against the possible framing or manipulation of evidence surrounding Edgeworthâ€™s prints on the gun.

Therefore, the JSON representation of the contradiction would be:

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 0}
******************************
To identify contradicting evidence and testimony, we need to analyze the contents of the provided evidence and testimonies systematically.

1. **Evidence 2**: Lotta's Camera is set to automatically take a picture when a loud noise is detected, and it faces the lake. This implies that if a loud noise occurred (such as gunshots), the camera should have taken a photo.

2. **Testimony 4**: Lotta states that when she heard the noise out on the lake, she looked with her binoculars. This implies that she was alert and visually attentive to the lake at the moment she heard the loud noise.

Next, we look at **Evidence 4**, which actually describes the actual time frame of the photograph taken by Lotta's Camera, which was triggered at midnight (12:15 AM) on December 25. However, we need to check for inconsistencies.

The critical moment here involves the timing and what was captured or observed directly by Lotta. Lotta's testimony suggests that she was reactive to a loud noise (presuming a gunshot), but the key question is whether the camera indeed took a photo at that point when she was looking through the binoculars. 

The lack of information in the testimonies regarding an actual photograph being taken just after the gunshots creates a gap. If Lotta was looking at the lake instead of monitoring the camera, it wouldn't have captured the event.

From the analysis, there doesn't seem to be an outright contradiction but rather a concern about alignment in timing and trigger events.

Hence, assessing the contradiction from a timing perspective:
- The **camera's automatic mechanism** (Evidence 2) implies something should have been captured due to the noise heard as per Lotta's statement (Testimony 4), yet the testimonial observation overrides camera reliance.

After careful consideration, they do align somewhat but do present a situation to challenge. However, Testimony 4 does contradict the implication of an actual dynamic capture via Evidence 2. 

Thus, my answer is coherently boiled down to: 
```json
{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 4}
```
******************************
To identify a contradiction between the evidence and testimonies, we need to analyze both closely. 

Looking at the testimonies provided by Lotta Hart, she claims to have been camping out by the lake to take pictures of a monster and describes witnessing two gunshots. However, the evidence indicates specific details regarding events surrounding the shooting:

1. **Testimony 3** says: "That's why I was camping out by the lake." This suggests she was there for a legitimate reason related to her interest in photography.
2. **Evidence 11** states: "I heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25." 
3. **Evidence 4**, "Lake Photo", indicates that it was taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM. This supports the timeline of the events near the lake.

The key contradiction comes from **Testimony 5**, where Lotta claims she "looked right straight out at that lake" when she heard the "bang." This implies she saw the events unfolding directly, and in the same testimony, she also asserts she was merely watching the boat during that time. With the timeline overlapping with when the gunshots were heard, it could lead to confusion over whether she was paying enough attention to the relevant events, or potentially testifying to events she did not actually directly witness.

Thus, the contradictory pair I have identified is:

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 5}

To determine which testimony and evidence contradict each other, we need to review their contents and timestamps carefully.

1. **Testimony 1, 5, and 6** (given by Oldbag) mentions that:
   - The murder occurred at **2:30 PM**.
   - Oldbag claims to have seen Powers heading toward the studio at **2:00 PM**.

2. **Evidence 3** (Jack's Autopsy Report) confirms that Jack Hammer was murdered at **2:30 PM**.

3. **Evidence 5** (Powers's Photo) indicates that Powers is seen walking at the gate at **2:00 PM** dragging one leg, but does not specifically confirm his actions afterward.

From the analysis, all testimonies and evidence align regarding the time of the murder (2:30 PM) and the alleged sighting of Powers at 2:00 PM. However, there is a contradiction regarding the presence of any obstacles at the scene at the critical time when Powers was supposedly seen heading towards the crime scene, as later revelations about other evidence like **Evidence 11** (Mr. Monkey's Head blocking the path) complicate the narrative.

Therefore, the contradiction lies between Oldbag's testimony of seeing Powers at **2:00 PM** and subsequent evidence suggesting that Powers could not have easily reached the crime scene after 2:15 PM due to the blockage.

The most clear-cut contradiction does indeed arise between the timeline provided in Oldbag's testimony and the impact of Evidence 11.

Thus, the answer is:

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 6}
******************************
Let's analyze the testimonies and evidence provided. 

From the testimonies:
1. Oldbag claims that at 2:30 PM, Jack Hammer was dead.
2. Oldbag also states that Will Powers was the only person seen going to the studio before that time.
3. She asserts that nobody else went to the studio, which includes the time of the murder.

From the pieces of evidence:
1. We have Jack's Autopsy Report, which states the time of death was 10/15 at 2:30 PM.
2. We also have "Mr. Monkey's Head," which indicates it blocked the path to the crime scene between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM.

Now, let’s find a contradiction:
- The evidence of Jack's Autopsy Report confirms Hammer's death at 2:30 PM. Oldbag’s testimony suggests that no one else went to the studio apart from Will Powers, which implies that if anyone had gone to Studio One (including the murderer), she would have seen them, yet the path was blocked until 4:00 PM as per the evidence of Mr. Monkey's Head.

The contradiction arises from oldbag's vehement insistence that no one but Will Powers was in the vicinity before 2:30 PM, while it's reasonable to assume that since Mr. Monkey's Head blocked the path, others could not have accessed that area either.

Thus, the contradictory evidence and testimony are:
- Evidence: 11 (Mr. Monkey's Head)
- Testimony: 1 (Oldbag claiming only Will Powers went to the studio).

Therefore, the answer is:
{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 1}

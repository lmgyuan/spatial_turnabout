To find a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other, we need to carefully analyze both the evidences and the testimonies provided.

First, let's consider the testimony given by Dick Gumshoe. He states:
1. He found a memo next to the victim's body with the word "Maya" written in blood.
2. Lab test results showed that the blood was the victim’s.
3. There was blood found on the victim's finger.
4. Before she died, the victim wrote the killer's name.

From this, it is clear that Gumshoe suggests that Mia wrote "Maya" in her own blood. 

Next, let's look at the evidence related to the bloody memo. The evidence that would be directly relevant to this context would be the "Receipt" (Evidence 3) which has letters written in blood on the back. This could potentially contradict Gumshoe's claim if it suggests that the blood wasn’t Mia’s.

Upon closer inspection:
- The receipt is related to a glass light stand and does not indicate that it is connected to Mia or the blood mediation witnessed by Gumshoe.

In summary, the testimony suggests the implication that Mia wrote "Maya" as part of a memo next to her body, while evidence does not support any memo at all, but a receipt instead, which could imply nature that the blood was related to the item purchased the day before.

Thus, the contradiction arises between the memo in testimony (which suggests it was written by Mia) and the absence of a memo in the evidence, suggesting another context:

Here's the JSON conclusion based on the findings: 

{"evidence": 3, "testimony": 2}
******************************
To find a contradiction between evidence and testimony, we should examine the statements made in the testimonies alongside the relevant pieces of evidence.

Testimony from April May states that she witnessed the victim dodging an attack and running to the right, then being hit with a weapon (the clock). This implies a sequence of events where the victim was attacked.

However, Evidence 5, Mia's Autopsy Report, states that Mia died from a single blunt force trauma that rendered her dead instantly. If the victim was hit and died instantly, she would not have been able to run or dodge an attack at all.

Thus, there is a contradiction between April's testimony that indicates the victim dodged and ran before being hit and the evidence indicating the victim died instantaneously from the attack.

The conflicting elements come from April's testimony about the sequence of events and Mia's Autopsy Report.

Therefore, the answer is: {"evidence": 5, "testimony": 1}.

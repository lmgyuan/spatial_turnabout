To find a contradiction between the evidences and testimonies, we need to analyze the details closely. 

We have testimony from Dee Vasquez regarding a meeting that started at noon and was scheduled to end at 4 PM, including a break at 2:30 PM. During this break, the testimony indicates that they had t-bone steaks. 

However, the autopsy report from Jack Hammer indicates that the time of death was at 2:30 PM. This poses a significant issue: if Jack Hammer (the victim) was killed at 2:30 PM while Dee Vasquez was in a meeting and claimed to be eating in a trailer, it contradicts the timeline of events.

Thus, the relevant evidence is the autopsy report (Evidence 3), and the testimony is regarding the break in the meeting and the activity during that time (Testimony 4). 

Therefore, the conclusion of which evidence contradicts which testimony can be summarized as follows:

{"evidence": 3, "testimony": 4}

To find a contradictory pair of evidence and testimony, we first need to analyze the details provided.

The key evidence involves the timeline and location concerning the characters and events at Global Studios. A significant piece of evidence is the "Mr. Monkey's Head" (Evidence 11), which states that it blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM. 

Additionally, we have Testimony 3 from Vasquez stating that the security lady claimed Powers did it as she was agitated and pointing at him when they found the body.

If we consider the timeline—Jack Hammer's time of death was at 2:30 PM (based on Evidence 3), and Mr. Monkey's Head blocked access to the scene until 4:00 PM—it suggests that no one, including Powers, could have accessed the crime scene during that timeframe after 2:15 PM. This creates a contradiction with Testimony 3, which implies that Powers was somehow at the scene shortly after the body was found.

Thus, the contradiction lies between the evidence that blocks access to the crime scene around the time of the murder and the testimony that indicates Powers was at the scene shortly after the murder was discovered. 

Hence, the contradicting pair is:

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 3}

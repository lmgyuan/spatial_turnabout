We need to identify a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other. Let's analyze the provided information.

- **Evidence 11** (Tres Bien Floor Plans) indicates that the view from the entrance is obstructed and could only see the patio. This suggests that visibility of the scene around the tables is limited.

- **Testimony 1** from Jean Armstrong states, “Z'ere is only one seat from which you could 'ave seen an image of la victim," and indicates that this seat was at the table next to the victim's. This suggests that it was possible to see the victim from that specific seat.

- **Testimony 3** states that after the incident occurred, Armstrong moved the mirror so it was not in the way. If visibility was already obstructed significantly because of the layout (as per Evidence 11), then moving the mirror suggests that it played a role in the visibility of the victim, introducing a contradiction as to how much sight was actually available of the victim during the incident.

Given that Evidence 11 states that the visibility is obstructed and Testimony 3 implies that Armstrong's action of moving the mirror was significant for visibility, these two pieces contradict each other.

Thus the contradicting pair is:

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 3}
******************************
To find a contradiction between the evidence and testimonies, we must analyze the details provided in both categories. 

We'll look specifically at the timeline of events, especially concerning the time of the poisoning incident as detailed in the testimonies of Jean Armstrong, the owner of Tres Bien.

In Testimony 6, Armstrong is adamant that "there was no time for a phony to do la acting." However, when cross-referenced with the details from Evidence 10 (Glen's Autopsy Report), which indicates that Glen Elg died of potassium cyanide poisoning between 1:30 and 2:30 PM, the specifics on when the poisoning occurred and the time of interaction may imply that there was considerable room for the act to have taken place.

Testimony 5 supports the idea of timing closely linking to the celebration of the lottery win, stating that "it was approximately 5 minutes later that the poisoning incident occurred." If the poisoning occurred shortly after the excitement over the lottery win, the exact timing becomes crucial.

Considering all these points, there could be confusion regarding the sequence and timing presented in Armstrong’s testimony versus the evidence outlining the time of death from the autopsy report. Armstrong claims no opportunity for others to interject, which appears to conflict with the timing suggested by other evidence.

Thus, the contradictory pair is:

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 6}
******************************
To find a contradiction between the evidence and testimony, we first look at what is established by the evidence and what is claimed in the testimonies.

1. Evidence 10 states that Glen Elg died between 1:30 PM and 2:30 PM due to potassium cyanide poisoning.
2. Testimony from Tigre states that he spent all his time in his office during December and states that he never saw the victim, Glen Elg.

The contradiction arises because if Tigre was in his office the entire time, he could not have seen Glen Elg, who died during the timeframe when Tigre was claiming to be busy and had no involvement. This implies that he is potentially lying about his whereabouts during the time of the murder, as his testimony does not align with the timeline established by the evidence.

Thus, the contradiction is between:
- Evidence 10 (Glen's time of death) 
- Testimony 2 (Tigre saying he never saw Glen Elg and was in his office)

Therefore, the output is:

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 2}
******************************
To identify contradicting evidence and testimony, we can analyze the statements made by the characters in the testimonies alongside the details provided in the evidence.

1. Testimony 0 and Testimony 1 from Tigre state he never met Glen Elg and only knows of him wanting to borrow cash.
2. Evidence 10, which is Glen's Autopsy Report, states that he died of potassium cyanide poisoning between 1:30 and 2:30 PM on December 3rd, the day of the incident.
3. Victim’s Lottery Ticket shows that Glen had a considerable sum of money, which could explain why someone wanted to borrow from him.
4. Testimony 4 indicates Tigre has never been to Tres Bien, where the incident occurred, yet he was expected to meet Glen there.

Analyzing these relationships, Tigre claims he didn’t meet Glen but also suggests that Glen wanted to borrow cash from him, indicating some awareness of Glen's existence. This is directly contradicted by Testimony 0, where he insists he never met Glen.

Thus, the evidence of Glen dying the day Tigre claims ignorance about him meeting creates a contradiction between the testimonies of Tigre.

The pair that contradict each other is Testimony 0 and the evidence relating to Glen's death on that day.

Here is the output in the required JSON format:

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 0}
******************************
To find contradictions between the evidence and testimony, let's inspect the relevant details. 

1. **Testimony from Furio Tigre (Testimony 0 - 4)**: This witness claims he saw the crime scene and describes the victim laid out over a table. He mentions he "split" when he realized the place might get hot, and he went back to his office after hearing police sirens.

2. **Evidence - Glen's Calendar (Evidence 20)**: On December 3rd, there’s a note saying "Meet with The Tiger."

The contradiction arises from the timing of events. If Tigre was scheduled to meet with Glen Elg at the restaurant that afternoon, he should have been there for the meeting. However, his testimony suggests he came as an observer and left immediately after seeing the crime scene. This raises questions about whether he was genuinely there to meet Glen or was just a bystander.

Thus, the contradiction is between the information in Glen's Calendar and Tigre’s actions as their timelines do not align.

{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 0}
******************************
To find a contradiction between the provided evidence and testimony, we need to look for a scenario where the testimony suggests an event that cannot align with what the evidence shows.

Let's examine the testimony provided by Tigre. He states that Glen Elg was "real lucky" for winning a lottery of half a million dollars and indicates that if it hadn't been for the waitress (Maggey), everything would have been over. This implies that Tigre was looking for his payment related to the loan and was affected by the situation surrounding Glen’s win and Maggey's actions.

On the other hand, looking at the evidence, we see Glen's Autopsy Report (Evidence 10) indicates that Glen died from potassium cyanide poisoning, with the time of death estimated to be between 1:30 and 2:30 PM—the time when the incident occurred at Tres Bien. If Tigre states he didn't have "any other reason to kill the guy," yet Glen was killed that day (indicating a direct action or motive), this presents a contradiction regarding Tigre's claim.

In summary, Tigre’s testimony suggests that his concerns were financial and that he had no motive to kill Glen, while the evidence clearly states that Glen was murdered, implying a motive was present for financial gain. Therefore, the contradictory pair has been identified.

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 7}

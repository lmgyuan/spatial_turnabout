To identify the contradiction between evidence and testimony, we will look closely at the timeline and the statements made by the witnesses.

From the testimonies presented by Redd White, he claims to have seen a "spiky-haired man" (which likely refers to Miles Edgeworth) attacking a woman with long hair (this would be Mia Fey, as she is the only female character mentioned). Specifically, in Testimony 8, he states that "the victim ran to the left, and you gave chase!" However, we also have Evidence 8, the Floor Plans, which indicate that the murder scene has a specific layout where the stand and the area could be obstructed from view depending on where one is positioned.

Furthermore, we have Testimony 9, where White mentions a "terrible impaction!" happening at the scene, which we could correlate with the actual murder details mentioned in Mia's Autopsy Report (Evidence 5). That report details the single blunt force trauma resulting in instantaneous death.

The contradiction arises mainly from the fact that White describes the victim running to the left when the evidence does not support such a clear path or doesn't indicate it could be seen from his alleged vantage point. Since the layout matters and his details contradict the known circumstances of the crime scene, they cannot both be true.

Thus, the specific contradiction can be identified between Testimony 8 and, albeit indirectly, the implications of the Floor Plans, as well as the overall sequence of the events surrounding the murder.

Finalizing this, the distinct evidence linked to his testimony would again lead us to point out:

{"evidence": 8, "testimony": 8}
******************************
To find the contradiction, we need to closely examine the testimonies and the evidence provided.

### Evidence Analysis
1. **May's Testimony (Evidence 9)** states: "The victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but she was caught and struck."
2. **Mia's Autopsy Report (Evidence 5)** indicates that the cause of death was a "single blunt force trauma" at 9:00 PM, meaning she could not have been hit multiple times.
3. **April May's Testimony** (Testimony 0 to 6 from Redd White) suggests a sequence where the victim was chased and hit several times, asserting that Mia was hit twice.

### Testimony Analysis
1. Redd White’s testimonies imply a sequence of events that suggest a multiple-strike attack, with phrases like "hit her savagely" and "you hit her twice".
2. Given Mia's autopsy shows only one blow killed her, these statements contradict the evidence of a single cause of death.

### Identifying the Contradiction
The main contradiction arises between the autopsy report (which supports that Mia died from a single blow) and Redd White's testimonies (which support that she was hit multiple times during the struggle).

Therefore, the contradictory pair is:

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 6}
******************************
To identify the contradictions between the evidence and testimonies, we pick through the details. 

1. **Maya's Memo and the Testimony:** Maya has a memo which likely shows she had conversations with Mia prior to the incident. However, this evidence may not directly contradict any particular testimony.

2. **Mia's Autopsy Report vs Testimonies:** The autopsy report specifies that the cause of death was a single blunt force trauma. White's testimony (particularly Testimony 5) states that "Then you did her in with a single blow! Thwap!" This aligns with the autopsy report.

3. **Glass Shards vs Testimony:** While the glass shards are an important piece of evidence, they don’t contradict the testimonies provided. 

4. **April May's Testimony:** We consider Testimony 9 in particular which states that Mia "dodged an attack then ran to the right." However, Mia's autopsy report confirms she was struck with a blunt object, which means she couldn't have dodged an attack if she was indeed fatally injured right away.

5. **Photographs and Newspaper Clippings:** These don’t provide a contradiction but offer context.

Now focusing on the testimonies provided by Redd White, we specifically look at the sequence and action described. Testimony 3 states that "the killer... attacked her but she dodged," which contradicts the autopsy report indicating she died from a blow which suggests no dodging was possible. 

Thus, the contradicting pair between the evidence (Mia's Autopsy Report) and the testimony (Redd White's assertion that Mia dodged the attack) can be expressed as:

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 3}
******************************
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies for contradictions.

Evidence 2 states, "The broken remains of a glass light stand. Broken beyond all recognition." This artifact is crucial because it establishes the existence and condition of the glass light stand associated with the murder.

On the other hand, Testimony 3 comes from Redd White, who claims, "That is when I saw this glass light stand." This testimony indicates that Redd White saw the glass light stand, which contradicts the condition described in Evidence 2. If the glass light stand was broken beyond all recognition, it would not be feasible for someone to have seen it clearly enough to recognize and identify it.

Therefore, the contradiction exists between the description of the evidence concerning the glass light stand and the testimony given by Redd White about seeing it.

{"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}

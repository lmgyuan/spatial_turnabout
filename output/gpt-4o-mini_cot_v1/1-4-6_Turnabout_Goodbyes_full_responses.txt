To find a contradiction between evidence and testimony, we need to analyze the details provided by each.

1. **Understanding the testimonies**:
   - Testimonies from Edgeworth recount events in the courtroom during the DL-6 Incident. He mentions an earthquake that trapped them in an elevator, a fight between his father and Mr. Yogi, and that something heavy fell at his feet. Notably, he recalls a single gunshot followed by a scream.

2. **Understanding the evidence**:
   - Evidence related to the DL-6 Incident includes reports about bullets and a gun. Notably, the DL-6 Incident Photo (Evidence 19) has a bullet hole in the door, which suggests a gun was fired in that location.

3. **Key contradiction**:
   - Edgeworth's testimony mentions "a single gunshot," which could align with evidence suggesting a bullet fired, yet there is also mention of multiple shots related to the confession in Evidence 18, which states that the murder weapon was fired twice. 

Given that Edgeworth's single gunshot contradicts the evidence indicating more than one shot could have been fired in the incident, we can conclude that there exists a contradiction.

Thus, the JSON output representing the conflicting pair is:

{"evidence": 18, "testimony": 5}

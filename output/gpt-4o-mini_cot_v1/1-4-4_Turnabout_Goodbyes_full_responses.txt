To analyze the provided characters, evidences, and testimonies, we note that one key testimony comes from Larry Butz, which states:

1. He heard a "bang" shortly after being out on Gourd Lake.
2. He describes hearing a single gunshot before he went home.

The evidence pertaining to this incident is crucial. In particular, we focus on Evidence 11, which states:

- "I heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25." - This is a reference to Lotta Hart's deposition.

From Larry Butz's testimony, he specifically mentions hearing a single gunshot, which contradicts Lotta Hart's statement of hearing two gunshots.

Therefore, the contradictory pair consists of Lotta's deposition and Larry Butz's testimony regarding the number of gunshots heard.

Based on this analysis, the contradictory evidence and testimony pair is:

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 5}
******************************
To identify a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other, we need to analyze both the content of the testimonies provided by Larry Butz and the available evidence.

Testimony 3 states that Larry Butz is "sure I heard that gunshot." However, later testimonies describe the circumstances surrounding this moment.

Evidence 11 records Lotta Hart's deposition, which states, "I heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25." This suggests that there were two gunshots rather than just one, raising the question of whether Butz heard a single gunshot during a different time or event.

Considering this context, Testimony 3, where Butz insists on hearing a single gunshot, contradicts the implication that there were two gunshots heard by Lotta.

Hence, the contradicting pair of evidence and testimony is:

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 3}

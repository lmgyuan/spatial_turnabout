To identify a contradiction between an evidence and a testimony, let's analyze the relevant details.

In the testimonies provided by Will Powers, he claims:

1. **Testimony 0 to 5**: Powers describes his encounter with a bellboy who came out of Juan Corrida's room. He thinks it's strange for a bellboy to be empty-handed when coming out of a guest's room, inferring that this bellboy must be suspicious, possibly even the assassin.

Now, let's look at the evidence:

- **Evidence 4 (Radio Transceiver)**: This evidence indicates that the bellboy was connected to Maya's kidnapper, De Killer. The implication is that the bellboy's actions are suspicious, given he comes from a context of a kidnapping.

The contradiction arises here. If Powers is identifying a bellboy he saw as potentially suspicious and as the assassin, he suggests this bellboy is an ordinary character, which conflicts with the existence of a professional assassin (De Killer) who was masquerading in the role of a bellboy.

Summarizing this contradiction:

- The evidence (Radio Transceiver) implies a more serious context (that the bellboy is indeed connected to criminal activities).
- Powers' testimony suggests that he views the bellboy merely as someone strange, implying innocence or at least a normality in his actions.

Thus, we find the contradiction between the nature of the bellboy Powers saw and the implication of the evidence surrounding the real bellboy thwarting any potential ordinary explanation.

To find a contradiction between the provided evidence and testimonies, let's break down the elements.

- Testimony 3 from de Killer states: "While pretending to be the first person to discover the body and enter the scene."
- The evidence regarding the scene of the murder includes the Crime Photo (Evidence 9), which depicts Juan Corrida's body and shows the conditions in which he was found.

If Adrian Andrews had knowledge of the condition of the body before any official discovery, it indicates that she was aware of the situation prior to pretending to find it. This suggests premeditation or involvement in the crime.

However, the evidence showing the way the scene was set up—indicating chaos and an apparent rush—contradicts the implication that someone could "pretend" to find the body without prior knowledge or involvement. 

Thus, we see a potential contradiction where the testimony about tampering implies a level of forethought and deceit that is at odds with the initial shock and discovery of the body.

The relevant evidence for this contradiction could be the Crime Photo (Evidence 9), which illustrates the situation at the crime scene when the body was discovered.

Therefore, the contradictory pair is:

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 3}
******************************
To find a contradiction between the provided evidence and testimony, let's review the key aspects of both. 

Looking closely at the testimonies given by de Killer, we find Testimony 3 states, "One of these was to find the bear figurine and to give it to Adrian Andrews." 

This implies that de Killer was tasked with specifically delivering a bear figurine to Adrian Andrews, suggesting that there was a clear intention and purpose behind this. 

Now, referring to the evidence regarding the bear figurine itself, Evidence 25 describes it as a "wooden bear-shaped figurine," and it’s mentioned that “only Corrida and Andrews know how to open it.” This suggests a deep personal connection with both parties, specifically implying that Andrews has prior knowledge of the figurine. 

However, a contradiction arises when we compare this information to Evidence 27, which is Celeste's Suicide Note, stating additional information about Engarde's perceived wrongdoings, but does not directly mention any task about the figurine in relation to Andrews.

Thus, while the testimonies and the figurine have overlapping connections with Andrews and Corrida, the context of de Killer's actions does not neatly support or align with the evidence about the significance of the task regarding the figurine as it relates back to Andrews in terms of intent or motive given the hidden nature of the figurine. 

Therefore, both the claim that de Killer had to deliver the bear figurine to Adrian Andrews and the contextual use of Andrews' knowledge of the figurine does not coherently parallel, hinting at a contradiction.

The straightforward contradiction I identify is that de Killer’s intention of delivering a figurine to Andrews doesn’t hold, based on the implications of Evidence 25.

Thus, the answer is:
{"evidence": 25, "testimony": 3}

To find a contradictory pair of evidence and testimony, we need to analyze the testimonies provided by Gumshoe and the evidence listed.

1. Testimony 0 states that the crime was reported at 2:25 PM, which is a specific time when the incident was reported.
  
2. Evidence 10 is the victim's autopsy report, which states that the time of death was between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. 

Thus, the time of the reported incident (2:25 PM) comes very close to the time of death of the victim. However, if we consider that the victim was found dead and the report was made at 2:25 PM, this could imply that the death occurred shortly before the report was made.

This leads to an interpretation that the victim was likely deceased before the report but the circumstances imply that it would need to take place around the same or a close time. There is no direct contradiction here, but the timing is very closely related without specifying who found the victim and the state of Maggey.

However, focusing on Testimony 4, which states that when Maggey was searched, they found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison – coupled with the evidence that the victim died due to potassium cyanide poisoning (Evidence 10), also found in the bottle.

Gumshoe’s testimony indicating a smooth investigation process after identifying the victim suggests a lack of other significant pieces of evidence that pointed further towards Maggey alone being guilty.

The key contradiction can be derived where the conclusion reached (without established evidence that fails to connect) from Gumshoe suggests that Maggey had the items on her which clearly could not have linked to the murder directly without clarifying the sequence leading to the victim’s death as it was essential for the investigation to highlight Maggey's possible innocence over that connotation given the evidence gathered.

Since the statement indirectly suggests an inferred guilt from Maggey without needing further evidence as testified in Testimony 5 that nothing else was missing from the crime scene, whereas it indicates she had possession of key evidence (the poison in her apron), it leads us to find the clear juxtaposition.

Thus, while both may seem aligned, they lead to differing interpretations of guilt versus possession.

The evidence about the "found lottery ticket" implying a valuable clue unrelated to Mr. Elg’s direct murder and testimony involving search findings nonetheless leads effectively to different interpretations of the situation as a whole conflicting the narrative built up.

Hence, here is the contradiction found in an essential piece:

{"evidence": 16, "testimony": 4}
******************************
To find a contradiction between evidence and testimonies, we should focus on the details regarding the incident and specifically examine the testimony of Victor Kudo, who provides an eyewitness account of what transpired during the crime.

Testimony 3 states that the man (the victim) took one sip of the javaccino, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed. This aligns with the notion that the coffee contained potassium cyanide, as evidenced by the Coffee Cup (Evidence 13), which has the victim's fingerprints on it, showing he did drink from it.

However, Evidence 10 is the autopsy report which states the victim died of potassium cyanide poisoning. According to the time of death specified (between 1:30 and 2:30 PM), it supports the notion that he collapsed after ingesting the poison.

Meanwhile, Kudo's testimony, particularly in Testimony 1 and 2, suggests that he saw the serving girl (Maggey) deliberately put something in the javaccino before the victim drank it. Kudo describes it as "very conspicuous." However, if the coffee cup (Evidence 13) is found to contain potassium cyanide, then it contradicts the notion of the white powder being placed in it by Maggey, as the evidence directly links the cyanide poison to the coffee cup that the victim drank from.

Given this reasoning, we can outline that the testimony suggesting the act of the powder being added is contradicted by the evidence that shows the coffee cup was used and contains the poison with no clear indication it was tampered with beyond the original preparation.

Thus, the contradictory pair found between the testimony and evidence is:

{"evidence": 13, "testimony": 2}
******************************
To find a contradiction between the evidence and testimony, we need to carefully analyze both.

Looking at the testimonies of Victor Kudo, he describes an incident where a "young man" is involved with a cup. Specifically, he notes that the serving girl brought over a "javaccino" (Testimony 3), and that the young man picked up the cup and took a sip (Testimony 4).

On the other hand, the evidence regarding the coffee cup (Evidence 13) indicates that the cup contained potassium cyanide and has the fingerprints of both the victim and Maggey Byrde on it. However, there may be implications here about who actually sipped from that particular cup and its connection to the timing of the events described in Kudo's testimonies.

The key contradiction arises from the fact that Kudo mentions the "young man" sipping from the cup, but if the cup is established as containing poison that leads to the victim's death, it raises questions about Kudo's account of the experience—especially since Maggey is implicated in the crime. Kudo's statement doesn't align with the established fact that the cup was not just any drink but one tainted with a deadly substance.

This contradiction centers around the idea that Kudo's casual observations of the young man do not align with the severe implications of the coffee cup being poisoned.

Therefore, the contradicting pieces of evidence and testimony are:
- Evidence 13: Coffee Cup (which was poisoned)
- Testimony 4: Kudo's claim of the young man sipping from an ordinary drink.

The JSON format reflecting this contradiction would be:
{"evidence": 13, "testimony": 4}
******************************
To identify the contradiction, we need to carefully analyze the provided testimonies and evidence.

Testimony 0 (by Kudo) does not provide clear facts about the incident beyond expressing uncertainty. Testimony 1 states that the young boy (Glen Elg) slumped over the table after taking a sip of his javaccino, which suggests that the incident occurred soon after he consumed his drink. Testimony 2 indicates that Kudo witnessed the clumsy idiot (Glen Elg) upsetting the vase. Testimony 3 states that when the vase broke, the cloth on the table got soaked, which indicates an event happening after the coffee was spilled. Testimony 4 also emphasizes the chaos of the moment but doesn't provide new information.

Meanwhile, Evidence 10 (the autopsy report) states that Glen Elg died of potassium cyanide poisoning between 1:30 PM and 2:30 PM. However, if he drank a javaccino and immediately slumped over the table, it implies that the timing could restrict the sequence of events leading up to his death.

In this context, if the coffee (which was poisoned and contained potassium cyanide) was spilled and Kudo's testimony indicated that it happened immediately before the slumping, there would be detail disparity regarding immediate effects of drinking the coffee versus the time of death stated in the evidence.

Looking closely, the contradiction lies in the details of how immediate the response was after Glen drank the javaccino versus the autopsy report detail of when he died. Particularly, since Kudo seemed to witness the breaking of the vase (after the coffee) and indicated chaos, which may not fully match with the timeline given in the autopsy findings regarding immediate effects of the poison leading to his death.

Thus, a clear contradiction occurs with assertion of the immediate physical effects observed by Kudo and the medical timing of Glen's actual death.

Therefore, the evidence that stands in contradiction is Evidence 10 (the autopsy report) and Testimony 1 (the immediate response after drinking the coffee).

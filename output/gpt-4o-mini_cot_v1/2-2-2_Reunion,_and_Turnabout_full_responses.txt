To find a contradiction between the evidence and testimony, we need to analyze what each piece of evidence and testimony suggests.

1. **Testimony 3 (Gumshoe)** states that “The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back.” This implies that the person who was attacked (Turner Grey) was unable to defend themselves during the attack, suggesting a one-sided confrontation.

2. **Evidence 9** is a "Pistol," identified as the murder weapon that was owned by Turner Grey and indicates that there were two shots fired, as well as fingerprints from both Maya and Turner Grey found on it. This suggests a scenario where there was a struggle or confrontation, especially since the weapon was in the possession of the person who was killed.

The contradiction arises because if the defendant (Maya) killed someone who was not fighting back, it would imply that there was no struggle, yet the evidence suggests that a struggle may have occurred, especially since a gun was discharged.

So the conflicting pair of evidence and testimony is:

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 3}
******************************
To find a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other, we need to analyze both the testimonies and the evidences closely. 

The testimonies provided by Gumshoe relate to a sequence of events leading to the murder of Dr. Turner Grey. Here are some key points from the testimonies:

1. **Gumshoe's Testimonies:**
   - The defendant (Maya) stabbed Grey first.
   - Grey fought back and attempted to use a gun, but missed due to the close distance.
   - The defendant then took the gun from Grey and shot him.

This narrative suggests a struggle involving a knife and a gun, with close quarters leading to the missed shot.

Now, let’s look at the relevant evidence:

The key piece of evidence to consider in contradiction to the testimonies is the **Pistol** (Evidence 9), which is noted to have "Maya's and Grey's fingerprints" on it. This suggests that both Maya and Dr. Grey had handled the gun, but it does not clarify the circumstance clearly.

If we consider that Grey had taken out the gun and missed while fighting Maya, this leads us to think about the order and control of the events when the gun was fired. The fact that there are fingerprints from both on the gun indicates they both interacted with it, but it does not validate the sequential account provided in the testimonies. 

The very detail that contradicts is the assertion about the struggle with the gun, which according to the testimony implies Maya took ownership of the gun after the struggle and shot Grey. However, it does not explain how her fingerprints are on the gun without clarifying the moment of acquisition.

The claim that the victim, in the desperate fight, "took out his gun" (Testimony 2), and then shot but missed (Testimony 3) creates an inconsistency because it presupposes the gun was already with Grey and he must have been active with it, yet Maya is also found to have her fingerprints on it, denoting she was closely involved in its handling afterwards.

Hence the contradictory nature emerges when considering the ownership of the gun in succession to the struggle implied. Therefore, from this analysis, the contradiction stands between the evidence claiming ownership and handling of the gun versus the sequence of events in which it was used.

Thus, the conflicting pair is:

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 3}

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence or character contradicts one of the testimonies in this case. Let's start by going through all the information provided.

First, I'll look at the characters. There's Miles Edgeworth, who is a prosecutor and seems pretty tough. Then there's Robert Hammond, the victim, who was also involved in the DL-6 Incident. Yanni Yogi is the caretaker who thinks he runs a restaurant, which is a bit odd. 

Now, looking at the evidences, there's the Pistol (Evidence 10), which is the murder weapon. It's a 22-caliber and has Edgeworth's fingerprints on it. The DL-6 Bullet (Evidence 21) was taken from Gregory Edgeworth's heart and has clear ballistic markings. The DL-6 Case File (Evidence 18) mentions that the murder weapon was fired twice, and there's a bullet hole in the door shown in the DL-6 Incident Photo (Evidence 19).

Next, I'll examine the testimonies. Miles Edgeworth testified about being in the courtroom, an earthquake happening, and an argument between his father and Yanni Yogi. He mentioned that something heavy fell at his feet, he picked it up and threw it at Yogi, and then there was a gunshot and a scream. He specifically said there was only one gunshot.

But wait, the DL-6 Case File (Evidence 18) states that the murder weapon was fired twice. This directly contradicts Edgeworth's testimony where he mentioned only one gunshot. So, if the case file says two shots were fired, but Edgeworth only heard one, that's a contradiction.

I should also consider other possible contradictions, but this one seems the most straightforward. The evidence clearly states two shots, while the testimony claims only one. This inconsistency could be crucial in the case, suggesting that Edgeworth might not be telling the whole truth or there's some misunderstanding.

I don't see any other obvious contradictions right now, so I'll go with this pair.

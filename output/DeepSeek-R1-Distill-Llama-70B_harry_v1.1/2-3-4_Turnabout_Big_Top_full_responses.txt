Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies related to a murder case, and I need to find a pair that contradicts each other. The user has provided a specific format for the answer, so I need to ensure I follow that.

First, I'll start by understanding the context. The case involves a murder at the Berry Big Circus, and Max, the magician, is the accused. The victim is Russell Berry, the Ringmaster. The evidence includes items like a crime photo, a silk hat, a promo poster, and various other items found at the scene or related to the case.

Looking at the testimonies, I see that Acro, one of the circus performers, is making statements about his physical capabilities. He mentions that while he could lift the bust due to his strong upper body from being an acrobat, his legs were injured, making it impossible to look out the window or exert force on his lower body. He also claims it would have been unrealistic for him to drop the bust on the victim.

Now, I'll examine the evidence to find a contradiction. Evidence 15 is the Max G. Bust, described as a bronze statue that's quite heavy. If Acro claims he couldn't have lifted the bust due to his leg injury, but the bust was indeed found at the scene, this creates a contradiction. The fact that the bust was present suggests that someone with the ability to lift it was involved, which Acro denies.

Additionally, the crime photo (Evidence 2) shows the victim lying on a case in the snow with footprints leading up to him. If Acro couldn't have moved the bust, but the bust was moved, this supports the contradiction.

So, the contradiction lies between Acro's testimony about his inability to lift the bust and the presence of the bust at the crime scene, which suggests that the murderer did indeed lift and use it.

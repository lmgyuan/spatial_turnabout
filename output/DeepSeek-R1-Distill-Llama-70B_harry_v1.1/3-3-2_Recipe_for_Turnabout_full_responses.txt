Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm supposed to find a pair consisting of either an evidence and a testimony or a character and a testimony that contradict each other. I'll start by carefully reviewing the provided information to identify any inconsistencies.

First, I'll look at the testimonies given by Gumshoe. Testimony 4 states that when Maggey was searched, they found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison. However, looking at the evidence list, specifically Evidence 16, it mentions that the potassium cyanide (poison) was found in Maggey's apron pocket. But Testimony 4 claims that the poison was found in her apron pocket, which aligns with Evidence 16. So, there's no contradiction there.

Next, I'll examine Testimony 5, which states that there was nothing else missing from the crime scene. Now, looking at the evidence, particularly Evidence 14, it mentions that the Victim's Lottery Ticket was found during a body search of Maggey. This suggests that the lottery ticket was indeed found, which means something was missing from the crime scene—the lottery ticket was taken by Maggey. This directly contradicts Testimony 5, which claims nothing was missing.

So, the contradiction lies between Evidence 14 (Victim's Lottery Ticket) and Testimony 5, which claims nothing was missing. This inconsistency shows that Testimony 5 is false because the lottery ticket was indeed missing and later found on Maggey.

{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 5}
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to figure out which evidence or character contradicts a testimony in this case. So, first, I'll go through each testimony and see if there's any evidence that directly contradicts it.

Looking at the testimonies, Victor Kudo makes several statements about Maggey Byrde, the waitress. He claims that she put white powder into the victim's coffee, which led to his death. Specifically, in testimony 2, he says, "There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there." This seems pretty incriminating.

Now, I'll check the evidence to see if anything contradicts this. The evidence includes a coffee cup with potassium cyanide, which is the poison that killed Glen Elg. The coffee cup has both the victim's and Maggey's fingerprints on it, and there's a lip stain and a floral handle. Additionally, there's a small bottle found in the kitchen with an unknown contents, and potassium cyanide was found in Maggey's apron pocket.

Wait a minute, testimony 2 mentions white powder, but the autopsy report and the evidence list potassium cyanide as the cause of death. Potassium cyanide is a powder, but it's not white; it's usually a crystalline solid and can have a different appearance. Also, the small bottle's contents are unknown, but there's no mention of it being white powder.

Furthermore, in testimony 5, Kudo describes Maggey as having a ribbon in her hair and loose apron straps, but there's no evidence provided about her appearance that contradicts this. The key contradiction lies in the description of the poison.

So, evidence 10 (Glen's Autopsy Report) and evidence 16 (Potassium Cyanide) both indicate that the poison used was potassium cyanide, which doesn't align with Kudo's testimony about white powder. This discrepancy suggests that Kudo might be misrepresenting what he saw or that there's a mix-up in the evidence.

Therefore, the testimony that mentions white powder doesn't match the actual poison found, creating a contradiction.

{"evidence": 16, "testimony": 2}
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence or character contradicts a testimony in this case. Let's start by going through everything step by step.

First, I'll look at the characters involved. There's Maggey Byrde, who's the defendant and a waitress at Trés Bien. Victor Kudo was a customer there at the time of the incident and seems to have a crush on waitresses. Glen Elg is the victim, a programmer who was found dead, and Maggey apparently didn't know him before. Then there's Jean Armstrong, the owner of Trés Bien, who's into aromatherapy.

Now, looking at the evidences, the key ones here are the Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) and the Potassium Cyanide (Evidence 16). The Coffee Cup had potassium cyanide in it, and both the victim and Maggey's fingerprints were on it. The Potassium Cyanide itself was found in Maggey's apron pocket and had her fingerprints on it.

Victor Kudo's testimony is pretty detailed. He says that Maggey brought the victim a javaccino and put something in it, which he describes as white powder. He claims she was conspicuous about it, and after the victim took a sip, he collapsed.

Now, looking at the evidence, the Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) clearly shows that the coffee contained potassium cyanide, and both the victim and Maggey touched it. The Potassium Cyanide (Evidence 16) was found in Maggey's apron, which directly links her to the poison.

But Victor's testimony says he saw Maggey put something in the cup. However, the evidence shows that the poison was already in the cup, and Maggey's fingerprints were on it. This could mean that Victor's testimony is accurate, and Maggey did indeed put the poison in the cup. But if Maggey was the one who served the coffee, her fingerprints would naturally be on the cup, which aligns with the evidence.

Wait, but the testimony says she put something in it, and the evidence shows she had the poison. So actually, they seem to support each other rather than contradict. Maybe I'm missing something here.

Let me think again. Victor's testimony points to Maggey adding the poison to the coffee. The evidence confirms the poison was in the coffee and that Maggey handled the cup. So, they don't contradict each other; they corroborate the same events.

Hmm, maybe I need to look elsewhere. Is there any other evidence that contradicts Victor's testimony? Let's see.

The Victim's Lottery Ticket (Evidence 14) was found on Maggey, which could be a motive if she knew about it. But that doesn't directly contradict Victor's testimony about her putting poison in the coffee.

The Autopsy Report (Evidence 10) shows the victim died from potassium cyanide poisoning between 1:30 and 2:30 PM. Victor's testimony places the incident during this time frame, so that doesn't contradict either.

The Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows the coffee cup knocked over and the tablecloth stained, which supports Victor's account of the victim collapsing after drinking.

The Trés Bien Floor Plans (Evidence 11) and the Coffee Cup's description both indicate that the victim was alone at the table, which doesn't contradict Victor's testimony since he was at another table.

Wait, maybe the contradiction lies elsewhere. Victor's testimony mentions that he saw Maggey put something in the cup, but the evidence shows that the poison was already present. Perhaps the timing or the method of poisoning is different?

Alternatively, maybe Victor's testimony about the time or the exact actions contradicts the evidence. For example, if the autopsy shows the poison was ingested earlier than when Victor claims to have seen it, that could be a contradiction.

But according to the Autopsy Report, the time of death was between 1:30 and 2:30 PM, which aligns with Victor's testimony of the incident happening around that time.

I'm still not seeing a clear contradiction between the evidence and the testimony. Perhaps the contradiction is more about the presence of the poison in the cup versus Victor's claim of seeing her add it, but that seems more like corroboration.

Wait, maybe the fact that the poison was in her apron pocket suggests she planned it, while Victor's testimony shows it was done conspicuously in front of him. That might not necessarily contradict but could indicate premeditation.

Alternatively, if the evidence shows that the poison was already in the cup before Maggey brought it out, that would contradict Victor's claim of seeing her add it. But the evidence doesn't specify when the poison was added, just that it was present.

I'm going in circles here. Let's try to pinpoint one specific pair. The Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) had the poison, and Victor's testimony says he saw her put something in it. They seem to align, but perhaps the presence of her fingerprints on both the cup and the poison container indicates she handled both, which supports the testimony.

Alternatively, if Victor's testimony about the time or method doesn't match the evidence, that could be a contradiction. But based on the information, they seem consistent.

Maybe the contradiction is that Victor's testimony places Maggey at the scene and involved in the poisoning, while another evidence suggests someone else was involved. But I don't see another evidence pointing to a different suspect.

I'm struggling to find a direct contradiction, but perhaps the key is that Victor's testimony directly implicates Maggey by witnessing her add the poison, while the evidence (Coffee Cup and Potassium Cyanide) supports that she had the means and opportunity. They don't contradict; they support each other.

Wait, but the user is asking for a contradiction. Maybe I need to look for something else. Perhaps Victor's testimony about the victim's appearance or actions contradicts another evidence.

Victor says the victim was wearing broken spectacles and was listening to the wireless. If there's evidence that contradicts this, like the victim not having a radio with him, that could be a contradiction.

Looking back, the Crime Photo (Evidence 12) shows papers near the coffee table but doesn't mention a radio. The Sports Paper (Evidence 3) was present, but not a radio. So maybe Victor's testimony about the victim listening to the wireless contradicts the lack of a radio in the evidence.

Alternatively, the Magazine Clipping (Evidence 2) and Sports Paper (Evidence 3) are present, but no radio, which could contradict Victor's testimony about the victim listening to the wireless.

So, perhaps Victor's testimony about the victim listening to the radio (Testimony 2) contradicts the evidence that doesn't show a radio present.

But I'm not entirely sure. I think the main contradiction is between Victor's testimony of seeing Maggey add poison and the evidence showing she had the poison on her, which actually supports each other rather than contradict.

Maybe the contradiction is that Victor's testimony places Maggey at the scene, but another evidence shows she wasn't there. But I don't see such evidence.

I think the best answer is that Victor's testimony about seeing Maggey add poison to the coffee (Testimony 2) contradicts the evidence that the poison was already present in the cup (Evidence 13 and 16). But actually, they don't contradict; they support each other.

Perhaps the contradiction is that Victor's testimony says he saw her put something in the cup, but the evidence shows that the poison was already in the cup before she brought it out. However, the evidence doesn't specify when the poison was added, so it's not a direct contradiction.

I'm not entirely confident, but I'll go with the initial thought that Victor's testimony supports the evidence rather than contradicts it. Maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.

After considering all, I think the best pair is:

{"evidence": 13, "testimony": 2}

This is because Victor's testimony describes Maggey adding something to the coffee, and Evidence 13 shows the coffee contained poison, linking her to the crime.
</think>

{"evidence": 13, "testimony": 2}
Alright, I'm trying to figure out which evidence or character contradicts a testimony in this case. Let's go through the information step by step.

First, I'll look at the testimonies provided by Victor Kudo. He mentions that the victim, Glen Elg, was reading a sports paper and listening to the wireless. He also describes how the victim took a sip of his javaccino, collapsed, and how Victor himself broke a vase at his seat during the incident.

Now, I'll examine the evidence to see if anything contradicts these testimonies. 

Looking at Evidence 13, the Coffee Cup, it's described as containing potassium cyanide and having both the victim's and Maggey's fingerprints. The cup has a lip stain on the front and a floral handle on the right. This suggests that Maggey handled the cup, which aligns with the testimony that she served the coffee.

However, Victor's testimony mentions that the victim was holding the sports paper in his right hand and listening to the wireless. If the victim was holding the paper and listening, it's unlikely he would have used his right hand to pick up the coffee cup, especially if the handle was on the right side. This could imply that someone else, possibly Maggey, handled the cup more than the victim, which might contradict Victor's account of how the victim interacted with the coffee.

Additionally, Victor's testimony about breaking the vase and the resulting mess could be exaggerated or inconsistent with the crime scene photo, which shows intact vases on both tables. This might suggest that Victor's recollection of events is unreliable.

Considering these points, the most direct contradiction seems to be between Evidence 13 (Coffee Cup) and Testimony 2, where Victor describes the victim taking a sip from the cup. The evidence shows that Maggey's fingerprints were on the cup, indicating she handled it, which might contradict Victor's implication that the victim was the one who drank from it.

Another possible contradiction is between Evidence 12 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 3, where Victor talks about breaking the vase and the tablecloth getting soaked. The crime photo shows intact vases, which contradicts Victor's claim of breaking one.

After weighing both options, the contradiction between Evidence 13 and Testimony 2 seems more significant because it directly relates to who handled the poisoned coffee cup, which is central to the case.

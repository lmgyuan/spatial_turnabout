Alright, I'm trying to figure out which evidence or character contradicts a testimony in this case. Let's go through the information step by step.

First, I'll look at the testimonies provided by Cody Hackins. He says he wanted to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal and found a map online to get to the studios. He claims he went through the woods to avoid the old lady at the gate and got a bit lost for about 30 minutes. Then, when he came out by the studio, he saw the Steel Samurai and the Evil Magistrate, and the Steel Samurai defeated the bad guy. He also mentions that if he had his camera, he could have taken a photo.

Now, looking at the evidence, there's a piece called "Cody's Camera" (Evidence 15), which is described as a new digital camera that Cody always carries, though he's still learning how to use it.

There's a potential contradiction here. Cody testified that he didn't have his camera with him during the incident, as he says, "If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot, I tell you." However, Evidence 15 states that Cody always carries his camera. This suggests that Cody might have had the camera with him but didn't use it, which contradicts his testimony of not having it.

So, the contradiction is between Cody's testimony that he didn't have his camera and the evidence that he always carries it.

Alright, let's try to figure out which evidence or character contradicts one of the testimonies in this case. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I'll look at the characters involved. There's Maya Fey, Miles Edgeworth, Dick Gumshoe, Will Powers, and several others. The defendant is Will Powers, an action star who plays the Steel Samurai. The victim is Jack Hammer, another actor. There are also other witnesses like Cody Hackins, a fan, and Dee Vasquez, a producer.

Now, looking at the evidences, there's a variety of items: an attorney's badge, Powers's letter, a guidemap, an autopsy report, a cardkey, a photo of Powers, a samurai spear, a sleeping pill bottle, a trailer key, a memo, a script, Mr. Monkey's Head, some trading cards, a book of photos, a camera, a steak plate, an old photo, and a van.

The testimonies are from Cody Hackins. He talks about wanting to see a Steel Samurai rehearsal, finding a map online, going through the woods to avoid the security lady, getting lost for 30 minutes, seeing the Steel Samurai, watching the Steel Samurai take down the bad guy, and trying to take a picture but missing the shot. He also mentions erasing the photos he took because they were too late.

I need to find a contradiction between any evidence and testimony. Let's go through each testimony and see if any evidence contradicts it.

1. **Testimony 0**: Cody agrees with someone, but there's no direct evidence mentioned here.
2. **Testimony 1**: Cody describes the Steel Samurai escaping the villain. This seems more like a description of the show, not necessarily contradictory to evidence.
3. **Testimony 2**: Cody says he held up his camera to take a picture. There's a camera listed as Evidence 15. This seems to support his testimony, not contradict it.
4. **Testimony 3**: Cody says the lens wouldn't open in time, so he missed the shot. Again, this is about the camera's functionality, which is covered in Evidence 15.
5. **Testimony 4**: Cody claims that's all that happened. No evidence directly contradicts this.
6. **Testimony 5**: Cody mentions taking a few shots but erasing them because they were too late. This directly relates to Evidence 15, the camera.

Wait a minute. If Cody said he erased the photos because they were taken too late, but the camera (Evidence 15) is described as a new digital camera that Cody always carries, though he's still learning how to use it. If he erased the photos, there should be no photos on the camera. However, Evidence 5 is a photo taken at the gate, which shows the Steel Samurai walking. This photo was taken at 2:00 PM, around the time of the murder.

So, Cody claims he erased his photos because they were too late, but there's a photo (Evidence 5) that exists, which contradicts his testimony that he erased all his photos. This suggests that Cody might be hiding something or not telling the whole truth.

Therefore, the contradiction is between **Evidence 5** (the photo) and **Testimony 5** (Cody saying he erased all his photos).

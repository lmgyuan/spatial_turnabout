Okay, let me try to figure out which evidence or character contradicts a testimony in this case. 

First, I'll look at the testimonies provided. The Security Lady (Oldbag) testified that she saw Will Powers heading towards Studio One at 2:00 PM on the day of the murder. She also mentioned that the murder happened at 2:30 PM, so Powers was in the area around that time.

Now, looking at the evidence, there's a photograph (Evidence 5) taken at the gate between the entrance and the Studios. It shows the Steel Samurai walking at 2:00 PM on October 15th. Since Will Powers plays the Steel Samurai, this photo suggests he was at the gate at that time.

However, if the Security Lady saw Powers heading towards Studio One at 2:00 PM, but the photo shows him at the gate at the same time, there's a contradiction. He can't be in two places at once. This inconsistency could mean that either the Security Lady's testimony is unreliable or the photo is misleading.

So, the contradiction is between the Security Lady's testimony (Testimony 7) and the photograph (Evidence 5).

Alright, I'm trying to figure out which evidence or character contradicts a testimony in this case. Let's start by reviewing the evidence and testimonies provided.

First, I'll look at the testimonies. Security Lady (Oldbag) claims that Will Powers was the only person she saw entering the studio before the murder, specifically mentioning that she saw him heading towards the studio at 2:00 PM. She also states that no one else went there before the murder, and if they had, she would have seen them.

Now, I'll examine the evidence to see if anything contradicts this testimony. One key piece of evidence is the "Powers'(?) Photo" (Evidence 5). This photo was taken at the gate between the entrance and the Studios at 2:00 PM, showing someone dressed as the Steel Samurai walking towards the studio. The question is whether this person is actually Will Powers.

If the photo shows someone else dressed as the Steel Samurai entering the studio at 2:00 PM, this would contradict Oldbag's testimony that only Will Powers was seen entering the studio before the murder. It suggests that there might have been another person, possibly in a Steel Samurai costume, who entered the studio around the same time, which Oldbag didn't mention.

Additionally, considering that the murder occurred at 2:30 PM, and the photo was taken at 2:00 PM, the presence of another individual in the studio area could provide an alternative suspect or at least cast doubt on Powers being the only person present.

Therefore, the contradiction lies between the testimony that only Will Powers was seen entering the studio and the photo evidence showing someone else (possibly in a Steel Samurai costume) entering around the same time.

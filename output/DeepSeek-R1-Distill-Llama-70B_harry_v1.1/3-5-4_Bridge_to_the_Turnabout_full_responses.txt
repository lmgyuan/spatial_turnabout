Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find a pair consisting of either an evidence and a testimony or a character and a testimony that contradict each other. The user has provided a detailed story with characters, evidences, and testimonies, so I'll need to carefully analyze each part to identify any inconsistencies.

First, I'll review the testimonies provided by Iris. She claims that Mystic Elise struck Mystic Maya with her staff, and then Mystic Elise used a dagger to deliver a fatal strike. Iris also mentions that Mystic Maya tried to defend herself and stole the weapon, justifying the action as self-defense.

Next, I'll examine the evidence list. One key piece of evidence is the Shichishito, which is described as the apparent murder weapon. It's a seven-branched, jagged sword with the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints. Another important evidence is the Crystal Sphere, found near Dusky Bridge with blood on it.

Now, looking at Iris's testimony, she mentions a dagger being used in the crime. However, the evidence points to the Shichishito sword as the murder weapon. There's no mention of a dagger being the primary weapon used. This discrepancy suggests that Iris's testimony about the dagger contradicts the physical evidence of the Shichishito sword.

Additionally, Iris's role as a witness is crucial. She is a nun at Hazakura Temple and reminds the narrator of "her," which might imply some connection or similarity, possibly to Dahlia Hawthorne, given the context. Her testimony might be influenced by her own biases or secrets, especially since she wears a hood that offers protection from evil spirits, hinting at her mystical involvement.

Considering the evidence and the testimonies, the contradiction lies in the murder weapon. Iris testified about a dagger, but the evidence clearly indicates that the Shichishito sword was used. This inconsistency undermines the credibility of Iris's testimony and points to a potential cover-up or misdirection.

Therefore, the contradictory pair is between the testimony of Iris and the evidence of the Shichishito sword.

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 3}
Alright, let's try to figure this out. I'm looking at the evidence and testimonies provided and need to find a pair that contradicts each other. 

First, I'll go through the evidence. Evidence 10 is the Shichishito, which is described as the apparent murder weapon with the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints. It's a seven-branched, jagged sword. 

Now, looking at the testimonies, specifically testimony 3 from Iris. She says, "That's when Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise!" This suggests that the murder was committed with a weapon, which aligns with the Shichishito being the murder weapon. 

But wait, testimony 4 says, "Mystic Elise managed to fling the knife away, but then... Then... she collapsed." This introduces a knife as the weapon used, which conflicts with the Shichishito being the murder weapon. 

So, there's a contradiction here. The Shichishito is the murder weapon according to evidence 10, but testimony 4 mentions a knife being used, which isn't supported by the evidence. This inconsistency needs to be highlighted.

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 4}
Alright, let me try to work through this problem. So, I have a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies related to a murder case. My task is to find a pair where an evidence and a testimony contradict each other. I need to provide an explanation and then output a JSON with the evidence and testimony numbers that contradict.

First, I'll start by understanding the context. The story involves various characters, including Maya Fey, Mia Fey, Godot, and others. The murder victim is Elise Deauxnim, and the case involves spiritual channeling and some mystical elements. The evidences include items like an attorney's badge, a magatama, a weather data report, and so on. The testimonies are statements from characters involved in the case.

Looking at the testimonies, I see that Iris has made several statements about the events of the crime. In Testimony 6, she claims that by the time the murder took place, the snow had already stopped. Now, I need to check the evidence to see if anything contradicts this.

The weather data report (Evidence 7) states that snow fell from 7 PM to approximately 10:50 PM, and lightning strikes occurred from 10 PM to 11 PM. It also mentions that lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM, and the fire started around then, lasting about 30 minutes.

So, according to the weather data, it was still snowing until 10:50 PM. If the murder took place between 10 PM and 11 PM, as indicated by the autopsy report (Evidence 11), then Iris's claim that the snow had stopped by the time of the murder is contradicted by the weather data, which shows that snow was still falling until 10:50 PM.

Therefore, Evidence 7 (Weather Data) contradicts Testimony 6 because the weather report indicates that snow was still falling around the time of the murder, whereas Iris testified that the snow had already stopped.

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 6}
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this scenario. 

First, I'll review the evidence and testimonies provided. The evidence includes various items like the victim's staff, autopsy reports, weather data, and more. The testimonies are from different characters, each providing their account of the events surrounding the crime.

Looking at the testimonies, I notice that Maya Fey's testimony describes her experience during the crime. She mentions being struck on the head, stumbling, and seeing someone behind her attacker. Specifically, she says, "I could see a man behind my attacker by the light of the stone lantern." This is important because it suggests that there was someone else present during the attack, illuminated by the stone lantern.

Now, I'll look at the evidence to see if anything contradicts this testimony. The evidence includes a stone lantern found in the Inner Temple garden, described as not being lit the night of the crime. If the lantern wasn't lit, Maya wouldn't have been able to see the man behind her attacker, as she claimed.

So, the contradiction arises because Maya's testimony relies on the light from the stone lantern to see the other person, but the evidence indicates that the lantern wasn't lit. This inconsistency suggests that Maya's account might not be entirely accurate, or perhaps the lantern was lit after all, despite the evidence stating otherwise.

I'll double-check to make sure I'm interpreting the evidence correctly. The stone lantern evidence clearly states it wasn't lit that night, which directly contradicts Maya's testimony about seeing someone by its light. This seems like a clear contradiction between the physical evidence and the eyewitness account.

Therefore, the evidence that contradicts the testimony is the stone lantern, and the specific testimony is Maya's statement about seeing someone by its light.

{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 4}
Okay, let me try to work through this problem. I'm a bit new to this, so I'll take it step by step.

First, I need to understand the task. I'm given a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies related to a murder case. My job is to find one pair where an evidence and a testimony contradict each other. The answer should be in JSON format, like {"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3} or {"character": 4, "testimony": 11}.

Alright, let's start by looking at the characters, evidences, and testimonies provided.

**Characters:**
There are several characters, but the ones that seem most relevant are:
- Character 0: Maya Fey (assistant)
- Character 1: Mia Fey (Maya's sister, deceased)
- Character 5: Elise Deauxnim (victim)
- Character 6: Iris (nun, suspect)
- Character 7: Larry Butz (Elise's pupil, witness)

**Evidences:**
Some key pieces of evidence:
- Evidence 10: Shichishito (murder weapon with blood and fingerprints)
- Evidence 11: Elise's Autopsy Report (time and cause of death)
- Evidence 14: Tracks Photo (tracks leading to Dusky Bridge)
- Evidence 15: Larry's Sketch (shows a figure gliding over the bridge)
- Evidence 20: Stone Lantern (not lit during the crime)

**Testimonies:**
Relevant testimonies:
- Testimony 3: Iris describes dragging the body across Dusky Bridge.
- Testimony 4: Iris mentions using a snowmobile to move the body.
- Testimony 6: Iris claims the snow had stopped by the time of the murder.

Now, I need to find a contradiction between an evidence and a testimony.

Let me focus on Testimony 6: Iris says the snow had stopped by the time of the murder. However, looking at Evidence 7: Weather Data, it shows that snow was falling until approximately 10:50 PM, and lightning strikes were happening around 10 to 11 PM. The crime is reported to have occurred between 10 and 11 PM.

So, if the snow was still falling until 10:50 PM, Iris's statement that the snow had stopped by the time of the murder (which was between 10 and 11 PM) seems contradictory.

Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 7 (Weather Data showing snow until 10:50 PM) and Testimony 6 (Iris claiming the snow had stopped).

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 6}
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence or character contradicts a testimony in this case. Let me start by going through the evidence and testimonies provided.

First, I'll list out the key evidence and testimonies to understand their contents better.

**Evidences:**
- **Evidence 0:** Attorney's Badge - My badge as a defense attorney.
- **Evidence 1:** Magatama - A present from Maya that reacts to people with secrets.
- **Evidence 2:** Oh! Cult! New Year's Issue - An occult magazine featuring Hazakura Temple.
- **Evidence 3:** Hazakura Temple Map - Shows the temple and surrounding area.
- **Evidence 4:** Hanging Scroll - Shows Misty Fey, Master of the Kurain Technique.
- **Evidence 5:** Photo of Elise - Taken by Laurice Deauxnim.
- **Evidence 6:** Iris's Hood - A magical hood for protection from evil spirits.
- **Evidence 7:** Weather Data - Regional weather report for the night of the crime.
- **Evidence 8:** Note to Iris - Found in the Main Hall.
- **Evidence 9:** Victim's Staff - Carried by Elise Deauxnim with her fingerprints.
- **Evidence 10:** Shichishito - The murder weapon with victim's blood and suspect's fingerprints.
- **Evidence 11:** Elise's Autopsy Report - Time of death between 10-11 PM, cause of death loss of blood from a stab wound.
- **Evidence 12:** Iris's Testimony - She rang the lights out bell at 10 PM and stayed in her room.
- **Evidence 13:** Crime Photo - Shows the courtyard where Elise was murdered.
- **Evidence 14:** Tracks Photo - Shows tracks leading from Main Gate to Dusky Bridge.
- **Evidence 15:** Larry's Sketch - A sketch of a burning bridge with a silhouette gliding over it.
- **Evidence 16:** Crystal Sphere - Found near Dusky Bridge with blood.
- **Evidence 17:** Kurain Master's Talisman - Worn by Elise, found in the Inner Temple garden.
- **Evidence 18:** Burnt Letter - Found in the Inner Temple incinerator.
- **Evidence 19:** Dagger - Found behind a tree in the Inner Temple garden.
- **Evidence 20:** Stone Lantern - Not lit the night of the crime.
- **Evidence 21:** Dusky Bridge Photo - Taken the morning after the crime.

**Testimonies:**
- **Testimony 0:** Pearly was stuck on the Inner Temple side that night.
- **Testimony 1:** The next morning, she looked around but couldn't find anyone.
- **Testimony 2:** The next day, when the bridge was fixed, she was in the spare prep room.
- **Testimony 3:** That's when Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time.
- **Testimony 4:** He found Pearly first and cheered her up.

Now, I need to find a contradiction between any evidence and a testimony.

Looking at **Testimony 3**, it says that Mr. Godot arrived at the Inner Temple for the first time the next day when the bridge was fixed. However, **Evidence 7** shows that the weather data indicates lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM, and the fire started and went out within 30 minutes. This suggests that the bridge was damaged during the crime, which occurred the night before. If the bridge was damaged, it's unlikely that Mr. Godot could have arrived at the Inner Temple the next day unless the bridge was already repaired or he took an alternative route.

But wait, **Testimony 3** says he arrived when the bridge was finally fixed, implying that the bridge was repaired by then. However, **Evidence 21** (Dusky Bridge Photo) taken the morning after the crime shows the bridge's condition, which might indicate whether it was usable or not. If the photo shows the bridge as damaged, it would contradict the testimony that Godot arrived via the bridge the next day.

Additionally, **Testimony 0** mentions that Pearl was stuck on the Inner Temple side, which aligns with the bridge being damaged. If the bridge was indeed damaged, Godot couldn't have used it to arrive unless it was repaired quickly, which seems unlikely given the time frame.

Therefore, the contradiction lies between **Testimony 3** and **Evidence 7**, as the weather data and bridge damage imply that the bridge was not usable, making Godot's arrival via the bridge the next day improbable.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm trying to find a pair consisting of either an evidence and a testimony or a character and a testimony that contradict each other. The user has provided a detailed list of characters, evidences, and testimonies, so I'll need to carefully analyze them to spot any inconsistencies.

First, I'll go through the evidence list to understand what each piece indicates. Evidence 11 is "Maya's Costume," which has blood splatters on it. This suggests that Maya was in close proximity to the victim during the crime, as her clothing would have gotten bloody.

Next, I'll look at the testimonies. Testimony 3, given by Gumshoe, states that "The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back." This implies that the victim was unarmed or not resisting, which might suggest a more straightforward attack.

Now, I'll cross-reference these two. If Maya's costume has blood on it, it indicates she was involved in a physical altercation where blood was shed. However, if the victim wasn't fighting back, the presence of blood on Maya's clothing might seem inconsistent because a one-sided attack might not result in such significant blood splatter unless the victim was indeed fighting back.

But wait, the presence of blood doesn't necessarily confirm whether the victim was fighting back. It could simply indicate that Maya was at the scene when the victim was injured. So, maybe there's no direct contradiction here. Perhaps I need to look for a more obvious inconsistency.

Looking at other evidence, there's Evidence 9, the Pistol, which was fired twice and bears Maya's and Grey's fingerprints. This suggests that Maya might have handled the weapon, which could imply her involvement in the shooting. However, if Testimony 3 says the victim wasn't fighting back, it might not directly contradict the evidence unless the evidence suggests the victim did fight back.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Let's consider another angle. Testimony 3 focuses on the victim not fighting back, while Evidence 11 (Maya's Costume) shows blood splatters, which could imply a struggle. If the victim wasn't fighting back, significant blood splatter might be unexpected, creating a contradiction.

Alternatively, maybe the key is in the testimonies and evidence that directly link Maya to the crime. Gumshoe's testimony is trying to incriminate Maya, but if other evidence supports her innocence, that could be a contradiction. However, in this case, the evidence seems to support Gumshoe's claims.

I think the main contradiction lies in the implication of struggle versus the victim not fighting back. The blood on Maya's costume suggests a physical confrontation, while the testimony claims the victim didn't resist. This could be the contradiction the question is pointing towards.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. The task is to identify a pair consisting of an evidence and a testimony (or a character and a testimony) that contradict each other. The user has provided a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies related to a murder case involving Maya Fey and Dr. Turner Grey.

First, I'll review the evidence and testimonies to understand the case better.

**Evidences:**
- **Evidence 8:** Dr. Grey's Autopsy Report states that he was stabbed in the chest and shot in the forehead at point-blank range.
- **Evidence 9:** Pistol used in the murder, with two shots fired, bearing Maya's and Grey's fingerprints.
- **Evidence 10:** Knife used in the murder, a small fruit knife from the Fey's, with Maya's fingerprints.
- **Evidence 11:** Maya's Costume, with blood splatters.
- **Evidence 12 & 13:** Photos showing Maya at the crime scene with Grey's body.

**Testimonies:**
- **Testimony 0:** Gumshoe describes Maya stabbing Grey in the chest during channeling.
- **Testimony 1:** Gumshoe claims Grey fought back.
- **Testimony 2:** Gumshoe states Grey pulled out a gun.
- **Testimony 3:** Gumshoe says Grey missed the shot.
- **Testimony 4:** Gumshoe concludes Maya took the gun and killed Grey.

Now, looking for contradictions:

1. **Evidence 8 vs. Testimony 3:**
   - The autopsy report shows Grey was shot at point-blank range, indicating the shot was direct and fatal.
   - However, Testimony 3 claims Grey missed the shot because they were too close, which contradicts the autopsy's finding of a point-blank shot.

2. **Evidence 10 vs. Testimony 0:**
   - The knife has Maya's fingerprints, suggesting she used it.
   - Testimony 0 says Maya stabbed Grey, which aligns with the knife evidence.

3. **Evidence 9 vs. Testimony 4:**
   - The pistol was used, and Maya's fingerprints are on it.
   - Testimony 4 says Maya took the gun and ended it, which aligns with the evidence.

The most direct contradiction is between **Evidence 8** and **Testimony 3**. The autopsy confirms a point-blank shot, while the testimony claims the shot was missed, which can't both be true.

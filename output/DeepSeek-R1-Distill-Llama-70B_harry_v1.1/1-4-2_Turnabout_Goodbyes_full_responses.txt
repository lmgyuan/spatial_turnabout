Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm presented with a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies, and I need to find a pair where the evidence and testimony contradict each other. I'll start by understanding the context and the details provided.

First, I'll look at the characters involved. The main characters include Maya Fey, Miles Edgeworth, Dick Gumshoe, Lotta Hart, Larry Butz, Marvin Grossberg, Robert Hammond, Misty Fey, Gregory Edgeworth, Manfred von Karma, and Yanni Yogi. The victim is Robert Hammond, a defense attorney, and Miles Edgeworth is the prosecutor.

Next, I'll examine the evidence. There are 22 pieces of evidence, including an Attorney's Badge, a Popper, Lotta's Camera, Robert's Autopsy Report, a Lake Photo, and others. The key evidence seems to be the Lake Photo, which was taken automatically on December 25th at 12:15 AM. This photo might show something crucial, like a person or an object in the lake.

The testimonies provided include only one testimony from Lotta Hart, where she claims to have seen Miles Edgeworth on a boat at the time of the murder. She states, "I saw it clear as day. The man on the boat was Mr. Edgeworth!"

Now, I need to find a contradiction between this testimony and any of the evidence. Let's focus on the Lake Photo (Evidence 4) and Lotta's testimony. If the Lake Photo was taken at 12:15 AM on December 25th, and Lotta claims to have seen Edgeworth on the boat around that time, I should check if the photo supports her claim.

However, the Lake Photo's description doesn't mention seeing anyone on a boat. It was taken automatically and might not show any people, only the lake. If Lotta's testimony places Edgeworth on the boat, but the photo doesn't show him, that's a contradiction. Alternatively, if the photo shows someone else or nothing at all, it would contradict her testimony.

Therefore, the contradiction lies between Lotta's testimony placing Edgeworth on the boat and the Lake Photo not showing him there.

{"evidence": 4, "testimony": 0}
Alright, I'm trying to figure out which evidence or character contradicts a testimony in this case. Let's start by looking at the evidence and testimonies provided.

First, I see that there's a Lake Photo (Evidence 4) taken automatically on December 25th at 12:15 AM. This photo shows an empty lake. Then, there's Lotta Hart's testimony (Testimony 0) where she claims she saw Miles Edgeworth on a boat in the lake around that time.

If the Lake Photo shows an empty lake, but Lotta says she saw someone, that seems contradictory. The photo suggests no one was there, but her testimony says someone was. So, the Lake Photo and Lotta's testimony don't align.

I should also consider other evidence and testimonies to make sure there's no other contradiction, but this one stands out because it directly conflicts about the presence of someone in the lake.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out which evidence or character contradicts a testimony in this case. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, I look at the characters. There's Lotta Hart, who claims to be a research student but is actually an investigative photographer. That's interesting because it shows she might have had different motives for being at the lake.

Now, looking at the evidences, there's "Lotta's Camera" (Evidence 2), which is set to take pictures when it detects a loud noise. It's facing the lake, which makes sense if she's trying to capture something happening there.

The testimonies from Lotta Hart include her saying she's an investigative photographer and that she heard two gunshots. However, she also mentions that her camera was set up to take pictures automatically when it detects a loud noise. 

Wait a minute, if her camera was set to take pictures automatically when it detects a noise, but she also claims to have heard two gunshots, why didn't the camera capture both? The camera should have taken pictures during both loud noises, but maybe it only captured one. That could mean that there was only one actual gunshot, contradicting her testimony of hearing two.

So, the evidence "Lotta's Camera" (Evidence 2) might contradict her testimony about hearing two gunshots (Testimony 11). The camera's automatic function would have recorded both if they happened, but perhaps it only captured one, indicating she might be exaggerating or mistaken about the number of shots.

Another point is the "Lake Photo" (Evidence 4) taken at 12:15 AM, which shows the lake but doesn't necessarily show any boat or people. If Lotta saw a boat with men, the photo should have captured something, but it's empty. This could contradict her testimony about seeing a man on the boat (Testimony 0).

I think the contradiction lies between Lotta's testimony of hearing two gunshots and the camera only capturing one, or the empty lake photo contradicting her claim of seeing someone on the boat.

After considering, I believe the main contradiction is between the camera evidence and her testimony about the number of gunshots.

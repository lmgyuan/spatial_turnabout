Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 5 states, "Yeah! So he had to be the assassin! I'm sure of it!" However, Evidence 30, which is "Bellboy's Uniform," states that "One of its special buttons is missing", which implies that the bellboy was likely a victim of De Killer, rather than the assassin himself.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 4 states, "Adrian Andrews already knew from the very beginning that Juan Corrida was dead!" However, Evidence 14, which is "Juan's Autopsy Report," states that the cause of death was "Strangled with a scarf, then stabbed with a knife", which implies that the victim was strangled first, and then stabbed. This contradicts de Killer's testimony that Andrews already knew the victim was dead, since the stab wound would have been a separate action after the initial strangulation.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 3 states, "One of these was to find the bear figurine and to give it to Adrian Andrews." However, Evidence 27, which is "Celeste's Suicide Note," states that it was "Found inside the Figurine", which implies that the figurine was already in Adrian Andrews' possession, and de Killer did not need to give it to her.

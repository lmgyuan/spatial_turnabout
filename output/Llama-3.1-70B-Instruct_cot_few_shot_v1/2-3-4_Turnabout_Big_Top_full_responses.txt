Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 3 states, "There's no way I could have exerted that kind of force on my lower body." However, Evidence 15, which is "Max G. Bust," states that "Bronze statue taken from the cafeteria before the crime. It looks rather heavy", which implies that the bust is heavy and would require significant force to move, but Acro claims he could have lifted it, contradicting his previous statement.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 5 states, "At last, I held the urn in my hands for the first time at 1 AM on October 12th." However, Evidence 5, which is "DeMasque's Calling Card," states that Mask DeMasque sent a calling card to Lordly Tailor 10 days before the crime, which implies that Atmey knew about the urn before the crime, contradicting his testimony that he held the urn in his hands for the first time at 1 AM on October 12th.
{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 5}
Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 0 states, "I, Luke Atmey, had no points of contact with the victim whatsoever." However, Evidence 18, which is "Kane's List," states that Kane Bullard had written down Luke Atmey's name on his list, which implies that Kane Bullard was investigating Luke Atmey, and therefore, Luke Atmey did have a point of contact with the victim.

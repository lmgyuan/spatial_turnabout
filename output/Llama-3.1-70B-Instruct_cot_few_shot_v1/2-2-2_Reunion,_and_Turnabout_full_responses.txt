Testimony 3 states, "The defendant attacked and killed a person who, without a doubt, was not fighting back." However, Evidence 8, which is "Dr. Grey's Autopsy Report," states that "After being stabbed in the chest, he was shot in the forehead at point-blank", which implies that the victim was stabbed before being shot, suggesting that there may have been a struggle.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 7 states, "It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!" However, Evidence 5, which is "Powers'(?) Photo," states that the photo was taken at the gate between the entrance and the Studios, and the Steel Samurai is seen walking, but it does not confirm that it was Powers himself, as the Steel Samurai costume is worn by the actor.

Let's analyze the evidence and testimonies provided.
Testimony 3 states, "If they had, I would have seen them!" However, Evidence 11, which is "Mr. Monkey's Head," states that "Blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM", which implies that the witness might not have seen someone going to the studio during that time.

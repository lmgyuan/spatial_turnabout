Alright, I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's go through everything step by step.

First, I'll look at the characters involved. The main ones are Maya Fey, Dick Gumshoe, Franziska von Karma, Max, Regina Berry, Russell Berry, Ben, Moe, Acro, and Bat. The crime seems to be the murder of Russell Berry, the Ringmaster, and Max is the defendant.

Looking at the evidence:

- Evidence 0: Attorney's Badge – not relevant here.
- Evidence 1: Maya's Magatama – also not relevant.
- Evidence 2: Crime Photo – shows the crime scene with footprints leading to the victim.
- Evidence 3: Silk Hat – Max's hat found at the scene.
- Evidence 4: Max G. Promo Poster – shows Max's symbols: silk hat, cloak, white roses.
- Evidence 5: Ringmaster's Papers – about salary negotiations.
- Evidence 6: Circus Map – layout of the circus, lodging house, etc.
- Evidence 7: Broken Bottle – orange juice bottle in the cafeteria.
- Evidence 8: Trilo Quist – Ben's puppet.
- Evidence 9: Money the Monkey – Acro's monkey.
- Evidence 10: Ring – engraved "From T to R," found in Phoenix's possession.
- Evidence 11: Russell's Autopsy Report – died from blunt force trauma at 10:15 PM.
- Evidence 12: Wooden Box – 20 lb box with a lock.
- Evidence 13: Small Seasoning Bottle – pepper inside the box.
- Evidence 14: Grand Prix Photo – Max with two girls.
- Evidence 15: Max G. Bust – bronze statue taken from cafeteria.
- Evidence 16: Note – torn note found in Ringmaster's pocket, mentioning a meeting at 10 PM.
- Evidence 17: Stage Costume – shiny vest, not Maya's size.
- Evidence 18: Léon – lion shot by Ringmaster six months ago.
- Evidence 19: Scarf – Bat's scarf with blood and pepper.

Now, the testimonies:

- Testimony 0-5: Trilo Quist (Ben's puppet) says he planned to propose to Regina and had a ring in his pocket.

Looking for contradictions, I notice that Evidence 10 is a ring engraved "From T to R" found with Phoenix. Trilo's testimony says he had a ring intended for Regina, which he kept in his pocket. If Trilo had the ring, why is it in Phoenix's possession? Also, the engraving suggests it's from someone named T to R, possibly T to Regina, but Trilo is the one talking about proposing. This could mean Trilo is lying or there's another connection.

Another point is the note (Evidence 16) mentioning a meeting at 10 PM, which aligns with the time of death. But Trilo's testimony doesn't mention this note, focusing instead on the ring and proposal.

The main contradiction seems to be between the ring (Evidence 10) and Trilo's testimony (Testimony 4). Trilo claims he had the ring in his pocket, but it's found with Phoenix, suggesting Trilo might be hiding something or not telling the truth about the ring's whereabouts.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, I'll look at the characters involved. There's Maya Fey, Dick Gumshoe, Franziska von Karma, Max, Regina Berry, Russell Berry, Ben, Moe, Acro, and Bat. The main focus seems to be on the murder of Russell Berry, the Ringmaster.

Now, looking at the evidence, there are several items listed. I'll try to identify which ones might be relevant. Evidence 14 is a photo of Max's award ceremony, showing him with two girls and a bust nearby. Evidence 15 is the Max G. Bust, which is a bronze statue that was taken from the cafeteria before the crime. 

The testimonies provided are from Trilo, who claims to have seen Max at the crime scene. Trilo mentions seeing someone wearing Max's three symbols, which are a silk hat, cloak, and white roses. 

I need to find a contradiction between an evidence and a testimony. Let's consider Trilo's testimony that he saw Max at the scene. If the evidence shows that the bust was taken from the cafeteria, which is where the crime happened, then maybe Trilo's claim that he saw Max there is contradicted by the fact that the bust was moved. If the bust was taken, it might mean that Max wasn't actually there, or that Trilo's memory is incorrect.

So, the contradiction would be between the evidence of the bust being moved (Evidence 15) and Trilo's testimony that he saw Max at the scene (Testimony 4). This suggests that Trilo might not have seen Max, or that the presence of the bust was altered, making his testimony unreliable.

{"evidence": 15, "testimony": 4}
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm looking at the provided information, which includes a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies. The goal is to find a pair where one evidence contradicts one testimony. 

First, I'll go through the characters to understand who's involved. There's Maya Fey, Dick Gumshoe, Franziska von Karma, Max, Regina Berry, Russell Berry, Ben, Moe, Acro, and Bat. The main focus seems to be on the murder of Russell Berry, the Ringmaster, and the accused is Max, the magician.

Next, I'll examine the evidences. Evidence 15 is a bronze statue of Max G., which was taken from the cafeteria before the crime. It's described as rather heavy. Now, looking at the testimonies, Moe claims to have seen Max in the plaza, specifically noting his symbols like the silk hat and cloak. However, Moe also mentions that he couldn't see what Max was carrying because the cloak was fluttering in the wind.

The contradiction arises here. If Max was carrying the heavy bronze statue, it's unlikely he would have been able to do so without it being noticeable, especially in the wind. Moe's testimony that he couldn't see what Max was carrying because of the cloak fluttering suggests that Max wasn't carrying anything heavy like the statue. This creates a contradiction because the evidence (the statue) implies Max was handling a heavy object, which Moe's testimony doesn't support.

So, the evidence (Max G. Bust) contradicts Moe's testimony about not seeing what Max was carrying.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's start by going through the provided information step by step.

First, I'll look at the characters involved. There's Maya Fey, Dick Gumshoe, Franziska von Karma, Max, Regina Berry, Russell Berry, Ben, Moe, Acro, and Bat. The main focus seems to be on Max being accused of murder, with Russell Berry as the victim.

Now, looking at the evidences, there's a lot here. Evidence 4 is the Max G. Promo Poster, which mentions three symbols: a silk hat, cloak, and white roses. This is important because it describes Max's signature look. Then, in the testimonies, Moe testifies that he saw Max at the crime scene wearing a silk hat but specifically mentions that there were no white roses that night (Testimony 0). However, according to the evidence, Max's identity is tied to these three symbols, including the white roses.

This seems contradictory because if Max's identity is defined by the presence of all three symbols, and Moe claims he didn't see the white roses, it suggests that either Moe's testimony is incorrect or the evidence is misinterpreted. Since the evidence clearly states that the white roses are part of Max's symbols, Moe's claim that he didn't see them contradicts the evidence.

So, the key point here is that the evidence (Promo Poster) includes white roses as one of Max's symbols, but Moe's testimony denies seeing them at the crime scene. This direct contradiction is the main issue in the case.

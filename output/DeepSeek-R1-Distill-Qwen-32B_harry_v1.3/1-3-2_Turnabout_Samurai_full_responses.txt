Alright, let's tackle this problem. I'm given a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies related to a murder case. My task is to find a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other.

First, I'll go through the evidence list to understand what each piece of evidence entails.

1. **Attorney's Badge**: This seems more like an identification item rather than directly related to the crime.
2. **Powers's Letter**: This is a document proving Will Powers requested an attorney. It might be relevant if there's any doubt about his legal representation.
3. **Guidemap**: A map of Global Studios. Useful for understanding the layout but not directly contradictory.
4. **Jack's Autopsy Report**: This details the time and cause of death, which is crucial for establishing the timeline.
5. **Cardkey**: Grants access to Studio One. Important for establishing who had access to the crime scene.
6. **Powers'(?) Photo**: Shows Will Powers at the gate at 2:00 PM, dragging one leg. This could be significant for establishing his whereabouts.
7. **Samurai Spear**: The murder weapon. Important for identifying the means of murder.
8. **Empty Bottle → Sleeping Pill Bottle**: Found with Jack's fingerprints. Suggests he was using sleeping pills, which might explain his state before the murder.
9. **Trailer Key**: Access to Studio Two Trailer. Relevant for understanding who was where.
10. **Vasquez's Memo**: Requests a specific script, indicating her activities on the day.
11. **Script**: Episode 13 of "The Steel Samurai." Might tie into the motive or alibi.
12. **Mr. Monkey's Head**: Blocked the path to the crime scene between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM. Important for understanding the timeline of access to the scene.
13. **Steel Samurai Card**: A trading card, possibly a clue for a fan.
14. **URP Card**: A valuable collectible card, might be a motive for theft.
15. **"Path to Glory"**: Contains photos of every victory scene. Could be relevant to the killer's motivation.
16. **Cody's Camera**: A digital camera that might have captured evidence.
17. **Five-Year-Old Photo**: Shows an accident involving Jack Hammer. Might provide context about past incidents.
18. **Van**: Used by Manella to drive Vasquez to Studio One. Important for alibis.

Now, looking at the testimonies:

1. **Oldbag's Testimony 0**: Arrived at the guard station at 1:00 PM.
2. **Testimony 1**: Jack and others were doing a run-through since the morning.
3. **Testimony 2**: Had errands to run that morning.
4. **Testimony 3**: Confirms arrival at 1:00 PM.
5. **Testimony 4**: Was at the main gate from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM.
6. **Testimony 5**: Murder happened at 2:30 PM.
7. **Testimony 6**: Noticed Powers at 2:00 PM heading towards the studio.
7. **Testimony 7**: Identifies Powers as the man seen at 2:00 PM.

Now, I need to find a contradiction between an evidence and a testimony.

Looking at **Evidence 6** (Powers'(?) Photo) and **Testimony 7**:

- **Evidence 6** states that the photo was taken at 2:00 PM, showing Will Powers dragging one leg.
- **Testimony 7** claims that Powers was seen heading towards the studio at 2:00 PM.

At first glance, they seem consistent. However, if the photo shows Powers at 2:00 PM, and the testimony claims he was heading towards the studio at that time, but if the photo was taken at the gate, it might suggest that Powers was leaving rather than entering. This could mean that the testimony is incorrect if Powers was actually leaving the premises.

Alternatively, if the photo was taken as Powers entered, it aligns with the testimony. But if the photo shows him exiting, it contradicts the testimony that he was heading in.

Another point is the dragging of one leg. If the photo shows him limping or dragging a leg, it might suggest he was injured or in a hurry, which could be inconsistent with the testimony's description.

Wait, the key point is that **Evidence 6** says the photo was taken at the gate between the entrance and the Studios, and **Testimony 7** says Oldbag saw Powers heading towards the studio at 2:00 PM. If the photo shows Powers at the gate at 2:00 PM heading towards the studio, it aligns. But if the photo shows him exiting, it contradicts.

However, the description says "dragging one leg," which might not directly contradict but could imply something else. The main contradiction is if the photo shows him entering or exiting.

Given that the photo is described as taken at the gate between the entrance and the Studios, and the testimony says he was heading towards the studio, it's consistent. Therefore, there's no direct contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Let me re-examine.

**Evidence 6** states: "Taken at the gate between the entrance and the Studios. [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2] [caption] Steel Samurai is seen walking. He's dragging one leg."

**Testimony 7**: "It was Powers! That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!"

So, both indicate that Powers was at the gate at 2:00 PM heading towards the studio. No contradiction here.

Wait, perhaps I need to look elsewhere. Maybe the timing of the photo and the testimony.

Wait, the photo is at 2:00 PM, and the testimony says he was seen heading towards the studio at 2:00 PM. That's consistent.

Alternatively, perhaps the autopsy report (Evidence 4) says the time of death was 2:30 PM, and if Powers was seen at 2:00 PM heading towards the studio, he could still be the killer. No contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the issue is elsewhere. Let me check other testimonies.

Wait, the user provided only one testimony, Testimony 7, but in the previous interactions, multiple testimonies were given. However, in this case, the user only provided Testimony 7.

Wait, no, looking back, the user provided multiple testimonies, but in the last query, only Testimony 7 is relevant.

Wait, perhaps I need to consider that the photo shows Powers at 2:00 PM, but the autopsy report says death was at 2:30 PM. So, Powers could have committed the murder between 2:00 PM and 2:30 PM.

But that's not a contradiction; it's a timeline.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is that the photo shows Powers at 2:00 PM, but the testimony says he was seen heading towards the studio at 2:00 PM, implying he was entering, but if the photo shows him exiting, that's a contradiction.

But the description says the photo was taken at the gate between the entrance and the Studios, and the caption says he's seen walking, dragging one leg. It doesn't specify direction. If the testimony says he was heading towards the studio, implying entering, but the photo could be of him exiting, that would contradict.

Alternatively, if the photo shows him entering, it's consistent.

But since the photo is described as taken at the gate, and the testimony says he was heading towards the studio, it's consistent if he was entering. Therefore, no contradiction.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. Maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.

Looking at **Evidence 12** (Steel Samurai Card) and **Testimony 7**: If the testimony mentions Powers as the Steel Samurai, but the evidence is about a card, perhaps no direct contradiction.

Alternatively, perhaps **Evidence 17** (Five-Year-Old Photo) shows an accident involving Jack Hammer, and if the testimony mentions something about Jack's past, but that's not directly contradictory.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between **Evidence 4** (Cardkey) and **Testimony 7**. If Powers had the cardkey, he could access Studio One, but if the testimony says he was seen heading towards the studio, it's consistent.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between **Evidence 16** (Steak Plate) and **Testimony 7**. If the steak plate has traces of sleeping pills and a bone, perhaps indicating Jack was there, but the testimony is about Powers.

No, that's not directly contradictory.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between **Evidence 10** (Script) and **Testimony 7**. If the script is Episode 13, and the testimony mentions nothing about it, no contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between **Evidence 14** (URP Card) and **Testimony 7**. If the card is valuable, and Powers is seen with it, but the testimony doesn't mention it.

No, that's not a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between **Evidence 11** (Mr. Monkey's Head) and **Testimony 7**. If the monkey's head blocked the path between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM, and the testimony says Powers was seen at 2:00 PM, that's consistent.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between **Evidence 12** (Steel Samurai Card) and **Testimony 7**. If Powers was the Steel Samurai, but the card is a collectible, perhaps no contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between **Evidence 13** (URP Card) and **Testimony 7**. If the URP card is valuable, and Powers was seen with it, but the testimony doesn't mention it.

No, that's not a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between **Evidence 15** (Cody's Camera) and **Testimony 7**. If Cody was present and took photos, but the testimony doesn't mention it.

No, that's not a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between **Evidence 17** (Five-Year-Old Photo) and **Testimony 7**. If the photo shows Jack in an accident, but the testimony is about Powers.

No, that's not a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between **Evidence 18** (Van) and **Testimony 7**. If Manella used the van to drive Vasquez to Studio One, but the testimony is about Powers.

No, that's not a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between **Evidence 9** (Vasquez's Memo) and **Testimony 7**. If Vasquez was requesting a script, but the testimony is about Powers.

No, that's not a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between **Evidence 8** (Trailer Key) and **Testimony 7**. If Powers had the trailer key, but the testimony doesn't mention it.

No, that's not a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between **Evidence 7** (Empty Bottle → Sleeping Pill Bottle) and **Testimony 7**. If Jack was using sleeping pills, but the testimony is about Powers.

No, that's not a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between **Evidence 5** (Cardkey) and **Testimony 7**. If Powers had the cardkey, he could access Studio One, but the testimony says he was seen heading towards the studio, which aligns with having the cardkey.

No contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between **Evidence 6** (Powers'(?) Photo) and **Testimony 7**. If the photo shows Powers at 2:00 PM, and the testimony says he was seen heading towards the studio at 2:00 PM, it's consistent.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is that the photo shows Powers at 2:00 PM, but the autopsy report says death was at 2:30 PM, so he could have committed the murder, but that's not a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is that the photo shows Powers at 2:00 PM, but the testimony says he was seen at 2:00 PM, so it's consistent.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. Maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.

Looking back at the previous interactions, the user provided a history where the contradiction was between Evidence 8 and Testimony 4. But in this case, the setup is different.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between **Evidence 6** (Powers'(?) Photo) and **Testimony 7**. If the photo shows Powers at 2:00 PM, and the testimony says he was seen heading towards the studio at 2:00 PM, it's consistent. But if the photo shows him exiting, it contradicts.

But the description says the photo was taken at the gate between the entrance and the Studios, and the caption says he's seen walking, dragging one leg. It doesn't specify direction. If the testimony says he was heading towards the studio, implying entering, but the photo could be of him exiting, that's a contradiction.

Alternatively, if the photo shows him entering, it's consistent.

But since the photo is described as taken at the gate, and the testimony says he was heading towards the studio, it's consistent if he was entering. Therefore, no contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is that the photo shows Powers at 2:00 PM, but the autopsy report says death was at 2:30 PM, so he could have committed the murder, but that's not a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is that the photo shows Powers at 2:00 PM, but the testimony says he was seen heading towards the studio at 2:00 PM, implying he was entering, but if the photo shows him exiting, that's a contradiction.

But the description doesn't specify the direction. Therefore, it's possible that the photo shows him exiting, contradicting the testimony that he was heading in.

Thus, the contradiction is between **Evidence 6** (Powers'(?) Photo) and **Testimony 7**.

{"evidence": 6, "testimony": 7}
Okay, so I need to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's start by understanding the situation.

First, let's look at the characters involved. There's Maya Fey, Miles Edgeworth, Dick Gumshoe, Will Powers, the Security Lady (Oldbag), Jack Hammer, Penny Nichols, Sal Manella, Cody Hackins, and Dee Vasquez. The main focus seems to be on Will Powers as the defendant, with Jack Hammer being the victim.

Looking at the evidence, there are several key pieces:

- **Evidence 5**: A photo taken at 2:00 PM showing Will Powers walking towards the studio, dragging one leg.
- **Evidence 11**: Mr. Monkey's Head, which blocked the path to the crime scene between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM.
- **Evidence 3**: Jack's autopsy report stating the time of death as 2:30 PM.
- **Evidence 6**: The Samurai Spear, the murder weapon.
- **Evidence 7**: An empty sleeping pill bottle with Jack's fingerprints.
- **Evidence 16**: A steak plate with traces of sleeping pills and a large bone.
- **Evidence 17**: A five-year-old photo showing an accident involving Jack Hammer.
- **Evidence 18**: A van used by Sal Manella to drive Dee Vasquez to Studio One after a meeting in the trailer.

Now, looking at the testimonies:

- **Testimony 0**: Oldbag, the security guard, mentions that the murder happened at 2:30 PM.
- **Testimony 1**: Oldbag states that the only person she saw go to the studio before the murder was Will Powers.
- **Testimony 2**: Oldbag claims that no one else went to the studio before the murder.
- **Testimony 3**: Oldbag is confident that if anyone else had gone to the studio, she would have seen them.

So, the main points are:

1. The murder happened at 2:30 PM.
2. Will Powers was seen heading to the studio at 2:00 PM.
3. The path to the crime scene was blocked by Mr. Monkey's Head between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM.
4. Oldbag, the security guard, was at the main gate from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM and only saw Will Powers going into the studio before the murder.

Now, to find a contradiction, I need to see if any evidence conflicts with any testimony.

One possible contradiction could be between **Evidence 11** (Mr. Monkey's Head blocking the path from 2:15 PM to 4:00 PM) and **Testimony 1** or **Testimony 2**. If the path was blocked starting at 2:15 PM, that means no one could have entered the crime scene after that time. However, Oldbag claims that Will Powers was the only person she saw going to the studio before the murder at 2:30 PM. But if the path was blocked starting at 2:15 PM, Powers couldn't have reached the crime scene after that time. This suggests that Powers couldn't have committed the murder at 2:30 PM if the path was blocked from 2:15 PM onwards.

Another possible contradiction could be between **Evidence 5** (the photo of Powers at 2:00 PM) and **Evidence 11** (the blocked path starting at 2:15 PM). If Powers was seen at 2:00 PM heading towards the studio, but the path was blocked 15 minutes later, it would mean Powers couldn't have reached the crime scene by 2:30 PM. This would contradict the timeline of the murder.

Additionally, **Evidence 7** (sleeping pill bottle with Jack's fingerprints) and **Evidence 16** (steak plate with sleeping pills and bone) might suggest that Jack Hammer was involved in taking sleeping pills, which could have made him disoriented or unconscious around the time of the murder. This could imply that Hammer might have been involved in his own death or that someone else administered the pills to him.

However, focusing on the most direct contradiction, the key issue is the timing of the path being blocked and the time of the murder. If the path was blocked from 2:15 PM, and the murder occurred at 2:30 PM, then no one could have entered the crime scene after 2:15 PM. But Oldbag saw Powers heading to the studio at 2:00 PM, implying that Powers could have arrived before the path was blocked. However, if the path was blocked at 2:15 PM, Powers would have had to reach the crime scene by 2:15 PM to commit the murder by 2:30 PM. This seems possible, but it's a tight timeline.

Alternatively, if the path was blocked from 2:15 PM, and Powers was seen at 2:00 PM, he might have had enough time to reach the crime scene before the path was blocked. Therefore, this might not be a direct contradiction but rather a point of contention in the timeline.

Another angle is **Evidence 18** (the van used by Sal Manella to drive Dee Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting in the trailer). If Manella used the van to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting, it suggests that Vasquez was present at Studio One after the meeting. However, the murder occurred at 2:30 PM, and if Vasquez was at Studio One after that time, it could mean she wasn't present at the time of the murder. This might contradict any testimony that implicates her in the crime.

But looking back at the testimonies, Oldbag only mentions seeing Powers heading to the studio. There's no direct testimony implicating Vasquez, so this might not be a contradiction.

Considering all these points, the most direct contradiction seems to be between **Evidence 11** (Mr. Monkey's Head blocking the path from 2:15 PM) and **Testimony 1** (Oldbag stating that only Will Powers went to the studio before the murder). If the path was blocked at 2:15 PM, and the murder happened at 2:30 PM, then Powers couldn't have reached the crime scene after 2:15 PM, making it impossible for him to commit the murder at 2:30 PM. This contradicts Oldbag's testimony that Powers was the only one who went to the studio before the murder.

Therefore, the pair that contradicts each other is **Evidence 11** and **Testimony 1**.

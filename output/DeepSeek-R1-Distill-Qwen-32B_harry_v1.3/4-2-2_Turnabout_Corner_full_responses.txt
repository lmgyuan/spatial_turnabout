Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'm presented with a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies from a fictional mystery scenario. My task is to identify a pair where an evidence and a testimony contradict each other.

First, I'll go through each piece of evidence and testimony to understand their details and see if any contradictions stand out.

Looking at the evidence:

- Evidence 10: A knife with Wocky's fingerprints found at the crime scene.
- Evidence 11: Autopsy report showing the victim died from a bullet wound.
- Evidence 14: A pistol found at the scene, two rounds fired, fingerprints wiped.
- Evidence 19: A bullet found in the safe, squashed from impact.
- Evidence 12: Noodle stand where the victim died.
- Evidence 9: Check-up report showing a metallic object near Meraktis's heart.
- Evidence 16: Alita's sandals with a big toe print.

Testimonies:

- Wesley Stickler claims he saw Wocky with a pistol, shooting the victim from the front.

Now, considering the testimonies, Wesley Stickler's account is that he saw Wocky holding a pistol and shooting the victim from the front. However, the evidence shows that the victim died from a bullet wound to the right temple. This suggests the bullet entered from the front, aligning with Stickler's testimony.

But wait, the evidence also includes a knife (Evidence 10) and a pistol (Evidence 14). The autopsy report (Evidence 11) confirms the cause of death was a bullet wound. The testimony doesn't mention a knife, focusing solely on the pistol. There's no direct contradiction here since the testimony aligns with the cause of death.

Another point: the sandals (Evidence 16) have a big toe print, possibly linking to someone else. The check-up report (Evidence 9) mentions a metallic object near Meraktis's heart, possibly the bullet. The map (Evidence 1) shows the area around Wright's office.

I don't see a direct contradiction between any evidence and testimony provided. The key points align regarding the use of a firearm causing the victim's death, as per both the testimony and evidence.

Alright, so I've been given this problem where I need to figure out which piece of evidence contradicts a given testimony. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I need to understand the characters, evidence, and testimonies provided. The characters include Phoenix Wright, Trucy Wright, Dr. Hickfield, Guy Eldoon, Plum Kitaki, Alita Tiala, Ema Skye, Wocky Kitaki, Pal Meraktis, Winfred Kitaki, and Wesley Stickler. Each has their own description and role in the scenario.

Looking at the evidence, there are 19 items listed, each with a description. The testimonies are from Wesley Stickler, who claims to have seen the events unfold and points out that Wocky Kitaki is the defendant.

Now, I need to identify which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Wesley Stickler's testimony claims that he saw Wocky Kitaki holding a pistol and firing it, causing the victim's death. However, evidence 10 mentions a knife found at the crime scene with Wocky's fingerprints. This suggests that Wocky might have used a knife instead of a pistol, contradicting Stickler's testimony about the use of a pistol.

So, the contradiction lies between evidence 10 (the knife) and testimony 3 (Stickler's account of a pistol being used). Therefore, the evidence and testimony that contradict each other are evidence 10 and testimony 3.

{"evidence": 10, "testimony": 3}
Okay, I need to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's go through the provided information step by step.

First, I'll look at the evidence and testimonies listed. The evidence includes various items like the attorney's badge, a map, a bowl, slippers, a mirror, a cell phone, Trucy's panties, a letter of request, fingerprint powder, bloomers, a knife, an autopsy report, a noodle stand, a check-up report, a pistol, orders from Detective Skye, sandals, a lamp, a chart, and a bullet.

The testimonies include statements from Wesley Stickler, who claims he witnessed the crime and saw the defendant, Wocky Kitaki, at the scene. He mentions seeing the victim pulling a noodle stand with a sign that said "ELDOON".

Looking at the evidence, there's a noodle stand described as "Mr. Eldoon's noodle stand. Victim died pulling it. [caption] A sign reads 'ELDOON'." This directly supports Stickler's testimony about seeing the sign "ELDOON" on the noodle stand.

Since Stickler's testimony aligns with the evidence regarding the noodle stand's sign, there's no contradiction here. Therefore, the evidence and testimony don't contradict each other.

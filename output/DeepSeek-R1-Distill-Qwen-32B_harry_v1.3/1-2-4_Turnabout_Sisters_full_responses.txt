Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's start by going through the information step by step.

First, I'll look at the characters involved. There's Mia Fey, the chief attorney, who was found dead. Her sister Maya is a suspect. Dick Gumshoe is the detective, Miles Edgeworth is the prosecutor, April May is an eyewitness, Marvin Grossberg is Mia's mentor, there's a bellboy, and Redd White, another eyewitness who's the CEO of Bluecorp.

Now, looking at the evidences:

- Evidence 0 is the Attorney's Badge, which seems irrelevant here.
- Evidence 1 is "The Thinker," which is the murder weapon. It's a clock shaped like a statue, made by Larry Butz, with gears removed.
- Evidence 2 is Glass Shards from a broken glass light stand.
- Evidence 3 is a receipt for a glass light stand purchased the day before the murder, with blood-written letters.
- Evidence 4 is Maya's Memo mentioning a conversation recorded on her phone.
- Evidence 5 is Mia's Autopsy Report stating she died from a blunt force trauma, death was instantaneous, but she might have lived a few minutes after being hit.
- Evidence 6 is Maya's Cell Phone with a conversation between her and Mia.
- Evidence 7 is a Wiretap found in Miss May's hotel room.
- Evidence 8 is Floor Plans of the murder scene, noting that the stand is blocked from view.
- Evidence 9 is May's Testimony describing the attack.
- Evidence 10 and 11 are Photographs with exhibit numbers.
- Evidence 12 is the Bellboy's Affidavit.
- Evidence 13 is a Newspaper Clipping with "White" written on it.
- Evidence 14 is Mia's Memo with a list of names.

Now, the testimonies from Redd White (Character 7):

- Testimony 0: It was about 9:00 PM.
- Testimony 1: He was reading by the window.
- Testimony 2: He heard a commotion.
- Testimony 3: He looked at the building across and saw a spiky-haired man attacking a woman.
- Testimony 4: The man was the lawyer (Miles Edgeworth).
- Testimony 5: He called April May over.
- Testimony 6: The victim ran away, and the attacker chased her.
- Testimony 7: The victim ran to the left, and the attacker chased.
- Testimony 8: There was a terrible impact, then it was over.

Looking for contradictions, I notice that in the floor plans (Evidence 8), it's mentioned that the stand is blocked from view looking from the office. This might imply that from where Redd White was, he couldn't see the stand clearly.

But wait, the key point is in Testimony 8 where White says the victim ran to the left, but in the previous scenario, April May (Testimony 9) said the victim ran to the right. That seems contradictory.

Wait, no, in the current setup, April May isn't testifying here. The testimonies are all from White. So perhaps I'm mixing up previous cases.

Wait, in the current scenario, all testimonies are from White. So the contradiction must be within his own testimonies or with the evidence.

Looking again, Testimony 7 says the victim ran away, and the attacker chased her. Testimony 8 says the victim ran to the left. So that's consistent. But perhaps the direction is conflicting with some evidence.

Wait, Evidence 8 says the stand is blocked from view. If the stand was used as a weapon, perhaps the direction the victim ran would affect visibility.

Alternatively, perhaps the time of death in the autopsy report (Evidence 5) says 9:00 PM, and White's testimony (Testimony 0) also mentions 9:00 PM. That's consistent.

Wait, but in the previous case, the contradiction was between the autopsy report and a testimony about the victim dodging and running, implying she was alive longer than the report stated. But in this case, the focus is on White's testimonies.

Wait, perhaps the key is in the direction the victim ran. If the floor plans block the view, and White claims to have seen the entire event, that might be a contradiction.

Alternatively, perhaps the receipt (Evidence 3) has blood-written letters, which might be "Maya," but that's from another case.

Wait, perhaps the key is in the autopsy report (Evidence 5) stating death was instantaneous, but White's testimony describes a chase, implying the victim was alive longer.

But in this case, the focus is on White's testimonies and the evidence. Let me check the evidence again.

Evidence 8: Floor Plans note that the stand is blocked from view. If the stand was used as the weapon, perhaps White couldn't have seen the attack clearly if the stand was blocked.

But White's testimony (Testimony 4) says he saw the attacker, who was the lawyer, attacking the victim. If the stand was blocked, he might not have seen the actual attack, only the chase.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is that White claims to have seen the attack, but the floor plans block the view of the stand, which was the murder weapon. So he couldn't have seen the attack if the stand was blocked.

Alternatively, perhaps the receipt (Evidence 3) for the glass light stand was purchased the day before, but the glass shards (Evidence 2) are from a broken stand. If the stand was used as a weapon, perhaps the time of purchase is relevant.

Wait, the receipt is from the day before, so it's consistent with the murder the next day.

Hmm, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let me try to summarize:

- Evidence 8: Floor Plans block view of the stand.
- Testimony 4: White saw the attack, implying he had a clear view.

Contradiction: If the stand was blocked, White couldn't have seen the attack, but he claims he did.

So the pair would be Evidence 8 and Testimony 4.
</think>

{"evidence": 8, "testimony": 4}
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm looking at the provided evidence and testimonies to find a contradiction. 

First, I'll review the evidence. Evidence 8 is the Floor Plans, which mentions that the stand is blocked from view looking from the office. This suggests that from the office's perspective, the stand isn't visible.

Now, looking at the testimonies, Testimony 4 from Redd White states that he saw a spiky-haired man attacking a woman with long hair. He describes chasing her and delivering the final blow. This implies that White had a clear view of the attack.

The contradiction arises because if the stand is blocked from view, as per the Floor Plans, it wouldn't make sense for White to have seen the attack clearly. Therefore, Evidence 8 and Testimony 4 contradict each other.
</think>

{"evidence": 8, "testimony": 4}
Alright, let's dive into this problem. I'm presented with a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies related to a murder mystery. My task is to find one pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other.

First, I'll start by understanding the setup. The main characters include Mia Fey, the chief attorney, her sister Maya Fey, detective Dick Gumshoe, prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, eyewitness April May, defense attorney Marvin Grossberg, Bellboy, and another eyewitness Redd White. The evidences range from an attorney's badge to a receipt with bloodstains and floor plans of the murder scene. The testimonies include statements from April May and Redd White, among others.

Looking at the evidence, I see that Evidence 8 is the Floor Plans, which describes the murder scene at Fey & Co. Law Offices. The caption mentions that "The stand is blocked from view looking from the office." This suggests that from certain angles within the office, the light stand isn't visible.

Now, examining the testimonies, Testimony 1 from Redd White states, "A light stand was lying on the floor when I looked." This implies that White could see the light stand from his vantage point outside the building.

The contradiction arises here: according to the floor plans (Evidence 8), the stand isn't visible from the office, but White claims to have seen it lying on the floor (Testimony 1). This creates a direct conflict because if the stand is blocked from view, White shouldn't have been able to see it.

Therefore, the pair that contradicts each other is Evidence 8 (Floor Plans) and Testimony 1 (White's statement about seeing the light stand).
</think>

{"evidence": 8, "testimony": 1}
Alright, I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's start by going through the information provided step by step.

First, I'll look at the characters involved. There's Mia Fey, the chief attorney, and her sister Maya Fey, who was found at the scene. Dick Gumshoe is the detective in charge, and Miles Edgeworth is a prosecutor. April May is an eyewitness who says she saw Maya commit the murder. Marvin Grossberg is Mia's mentor, and there's also a bellboy and Redd White, another eyewitness and CEO of Bluecorp.

Now, looking at the evidence:

1. **Attorney's Badge**: Not directly relevant to the contradiction.
2. **The Thinker**: The murder weapon, a clock statue with gears removed.
3. **Glass Shards**: Broken remains of a glass light stand.
4. **Receipt**: A receipt for a glass light stand with blood-written letters.
5. **Maya's Memo**: A conversation recorded on her phone.
6. **Mia's Autopsy Report**: States Mia died from a single blunt force trauma, death was instantaneous.
7. **Maya's Cell Phone**: Contains a conversation with Mia.
8. **Wiretap**: Found in Miss May's hotel room.
9. **Floor Plans**: The murder scene's layout, noting the stand is blocked from view.
10. **Photographs**: Exhibit A and B.
11. **Bellboy's Affidavit**: Describes a man staying with Miss May.
12. **Newspaper Clipping**: About a politician's suicide with "White" written on it.
13. **Mia's Memo**: A list of names.

Now, the testimonies:

1. **April May's Testimony**: She saw Maya commit the murder.
2. **Redd White's Testimony**: He saw the attack, the victim running to the left, and being struck.
3. **Other Testimonies**: Additional details from White about the sequence of events.

Looking for contradictions, I focus on the Floor Plans (Evidence 8) and Testimony 1 by Redd White. The floor plans state that the stand is blocked from view, meaning White couldn't have seen the light stand from where he was. However, in his testimony, he claims to have seen the light stand. This direct contradiction suggests that either the floor plans or White's testimony is inaccurate.

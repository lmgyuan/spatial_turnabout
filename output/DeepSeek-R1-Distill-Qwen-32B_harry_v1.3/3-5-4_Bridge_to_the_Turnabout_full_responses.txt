Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let me start by going through the evidence and testimonies step by step.

First, I see that the evidence includes a lot of items related to the crime scene at Hazakura Temple. There's a staff that belonged to Elise Deauxnim, which is evidence 9. It mentions that the staff had her fingerprints and that there was no crystal sphere attached. It also says that there's a sword hidden inside, which is the actual murder weapon.

Looking at the testimonies, Iris testifies that she saw Mystic Elise strike Mystic Maya with her staff and then pull a dagger from inside her robe. She also says that Mystic Maya stole the weapon in self-defense.

Wait, so according to the evidence, the staff itself had a hidden sword, which was the murder weapon. But Iris's testimony talks about a dagger being pulled from the robe. That seems contradictory because the evidence points to the staff as the murder weapon, not a dagger. 

So, the contradiction is between evidence 9, which states the staff was the murder weapon, and testimony 5, where Iris mentions a dagger being used. This means that Iris's account doesn't match the physical evidence found at the scene.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's go through the information step by step.

First, I'll look at the evidence and testimonies provided. The key pieces of evidence here are:

- **Evidence 9 (Victim's Staff)**: This staff was carried by Elise Deauxnim and had her fingerprints. It had a sword hidden inside, which was the actual murder weapon. Only Detective Gumshoe and Phoenix Wright knew about the sword inside.

- **Evidence 10 (Shichishito)**: This is described as the apparent murder weapon, a seven-branched, jagged sword. It had the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints but was not the actual murder weapon.

Now, looking at the testimonies:

- **Testimony 4 (Iris's Testimony)**: Iris testified that Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise with a dagger found behind a tree in the Inner Temple garden. The dagger's blood didn't match the victim's.

Wait, but according to the evidence, the actual murder weapon was the sword hidden inside Elise's staff (Evidence 9). Iris's testimony mentions a dagger, which doesn't match the evidence pointing to the sword as the murder weapon.

So, the contradiction is between **Evidence 9** (which identifies the sword as the murder weapon) and **Testimony 4** (which claims a dagger was used). This means the evidence and testimony don't align, indicating a contradiction.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let me start by going through the information provided.

First, I'll look at the characters involved. There's Maya Fey, who is a spirit medium, and Iris, another nun at the Hazakura Temple. The victim is Elise Deauxnim, an author. The key evidence here is the "Victim's Staff" (Evidence 9), which was used in the murder. The testimony in question is from Iris, who claims she used the Shichishito to alter the wound (Testimony 6).

Wait, the Shichishito is described as the apparent murder weapon but isn't the actual one. The Victim's Staff is the real weapon. So Iris's testimony about using the Shichishito contradicts the evidence that the Victim's Staff was the actual murder weapon. That must be the contradiction.
</think>

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 6}
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let me start by going through all the evidence and testimonies to understand the situation better.

First, the evidence list includes a lot of items, but I'm particularly interested in the ones related to the crime scene and the victim. The victim's staff (Evidence 9) is mentioned, which had the victim's fingerprints and a hidden sword that was the actual murder weapon. Then there's the Shichishito (Evidence 10), which is described as the apparent murder weapon but isn't the actual one used.

Looking at the testimonies, Maya Fey describes the events leading up to her losing consciousness, mentioning that she saw a man behind her attacker by the light of a stone lantern. However, the evidence states that the stone lantern wasn't lit the night of the crime (Evidence 20). This seems contradictory because Maya's testimony relies on the lantern being lit to see the attacker, but the evidence says it wasn't lit.

So, the contradiction here is between Evidence 20 and Testimony 6. The evidence says the lantern wasn't lit, but the testimony claims it was used to see the attacker, which wouldn't have been possible if it was dark.

{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 6}
Alright, I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's go through everything step by step.

First, I'll review the characters, evidences, and testimonies provided. The main characters involved are Maya Fey, the defendant, and others like Phoenix Wright, Dick Gumshoe, and Iris. The key evidence here is the Stone Lantern, which was not lit the night of the crime. Maya's testimony mentions that the torches were lit, and the snow around the stone lantern was cleaned up.

Wait a minute, if the Stone Lantern wasn't lit, how could Maya see the area clearly? That seems contradictory. The evidence says the lantern wasn't lit, but Maya's testimony implies it was. This is a clear contradiction because the lantern's state directly affects the visibility of the crime scene.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let me start by going through the details step by step.

First, I'll look at the characters involved. There's Maya Fey, who is the assistant and a disciple in the Kurain Tradition. She's key here because she's involved in the case. Then there's Mia Fey, her older sister, who has passed away. Other characters include Godot, a mysterious prosecutor, and Dick Gumshoe, the detective. There's also Pearl Fey, a channeling prodigy, and Bikini, a nun at Hazakura Temple. Elise Deauxnim is an author, and Iris is another nun. There's also someone named Larry Butz, who is actually a student of Elise. Phoenix Wright is Maya's friend and a defense attorney. There are others like Franziska von Karma and Miles Edgeworth, but I'll focus on the main ones.

Looking at the evidence, I see items like the Attorney's Badge, Maya's Magatama, an occult magazine, a map of Hazakura Temple, a photo of Elise, Iris's Hood, weather data from the night of the crime, a note to Iris, the victim's staff, the Shichishito sword, Elise's autopsy report, Iris's testimony, crime photos, tracks photo, Larry's sketch, a crystal sphere, Kurain Master's Talisman, a burnt letter, a dagger, a stone lantern, and a photo of Dusky Bridge.

The testimonies include statements from Maya about the events that occurred, particularly about the lantern not being lit and the cleanup of the crime scene.

Now, I need to find a contradiction between an evidence and a testimony. Let's see: the Stone Lantern evidence states it wasn't lit the night of the crime. However, in the testimonies, Maya mentions that the lantern was lit when she came to. This seems contradictory because the evidence says it wasn't lit, but the testimony claims it was.

So, the evidence (Stone Lantern) and Maya's testimony about the lantern being lit contradict each other. The evidence says the lantern wasn't lit, while the testimony says it was. Therefore, the pair that contradicts is evidence 20 and testimony 3.

Alright, I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's go through the information step by step.

First, I'll look at the characters involved. Maya Fey is the defendant, and Miles Edgeworth is the prosecutor. Dick Gumshoe is the detective in charge. Will Powers is the defendant in a different case, but in this scenario, he's the defendant here. The Security Lady claims she saw Powers heading to the scene. Jack Hammer is the victim, and there are several other characters like the Director, Assistant, and a fan named Cody Hackins.

Looking at the evidence, there's a Guidemap (Evidence 2) to Global Studios, which probably shows the layout. The Jack's Autopsy Report (Evidence 3) states the time of death as 2:30 PM. There's a photo of Powers taken at 2:00 PM (Evidence 5), and the Samurai Spear (Evidence 6) is the murder weapon. The Mr. Monkey's Head (Evidence 11) blocked the path to the crime scene between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM.

Now, the testimonies from the Security Lady (Oldbag) say that she was at the guard station from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM and only saw Will Powers go into the studio at 2:00 PM. She claims no one else entered before the murder at 2:30 PM.

The key point here is the timeline. The Security Lady's testimony states that she was at the guard station the entire time and only saw Powers enter at 2:00 PM. However, the Mr. Monkey's Head (Evidence 11) blocked the path to the crime scene starting at 2:15 PM. If the path was blocked, it would have prevented anyone from entering the studio after 2:15 PM. Since the murder happened at 2:30 PM, it would have been impossible for someone to reach the scene after the path was blocked.

This means that if the Security Lady was truthful about seeing Powers at 2:00 PM and no one else entered, but the path was blocked at 2:15 PM, then Powers couldn't have committed the murder at 2:30 PM because he would have been blocked by Mr. Monkey's Head. This creates a contradiction between the evidence (Mr. Monkey's Head blocking the path) and the Security Lady's testimony that Powers was the only one who entered the studio before the murder.

So, the contradiction lies between Evidence 11 (Mr. Monkey's Head) and Testimony 1 (Security Lady's claim that only Powers entered the studio before the murder).

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm given a list of characters, pieces of evidence, and testimonies. My task is to find one pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other. I need to carefully analyze each piece of evidence and each testimony to spot any inconsistencies or contradictions.

First, I'll start by listing out all the evidence and testimonies to have a clear overview.

**Evidences:**
1. **Attorney's Badge**: No one would believe I was a defense attorney if I didn't carry this.
2. **Powers's Letter**: Document proving Will Powers's request for an attorney.
3. **Guidemap**: Guidemap to Global Studios. Click here for details.
4. **Jack's Autopsy Report**: Time of death: 10/15 at 2:30 PM. Cause: Pierced through the chest by a spear.
5. **Cardkey**: Cardkey for Studio Employees. Grants access into Studio One.
6. **Powers'(?) Photo**: Taken at the gate between the entrance and the Studios. [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2] He's dragging one leg. Click here for details. [Oct 15, 2:00 PM, Photo #2]
7. **Samurai Spear**: This spear was found stuck in the chest of the victim. The murder weapon. A break in the shaft has been mended with duct tape.
8. **Empty Bottle â†’ Sleeping Pill Bottle**: Found on a table in the employee area. The label reads "Sleeping Pills." Found on a table in the employee area. Bears Jack Hammer's fingerprints.
9. **Trailer Key**: The key tag reads "Studio Two Trailer".
10. **Vasquez's Memo**: The memo read "Bring me the script from Episode 13".
11. **Script**: A Steel Samurai script. The cover reads "Episode 13".
12. **Mr. Monkey's Head**: Blocked the path to the scene of the crime between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM.
13. **Steel Samurai Card**: A trading card. Apparently, these are really popular with kids these days.
14. **URP Card**: An "Ultra Rare Premium" Steel Samurai collectible card. Very valuable.
15. **"Path to Glory"**: Contains photos of every victory scene in every battle the Steel Samurai has won.
16. **Cody's Camera**: A new digital camera. Cody always carries it, though he's still learning how to use it.
17. **Steak Plate**: Found in the employee area. On it are traces of sleeping pills and a large bone.
18. **Five-Year-Old Photo**: Shows an accident involving Jack Hammer. Click here for details.
19. **Van**: Manella used this van to drive Vasquez to Studio One after the meeting in the trailer.

**Testimonies:**
1. **Cody's Testimony 0**: Yeah, you're right, pops.
2. **Cody's Testimony 1**: The Steel Samurai had just escaped from the clutches of the villain.
3. **Cody's Testimony 2**: So I held up my camera to take a picture!
4. **Cody's Testimony 3**: But the lens wouldn't open in time, so I missed it.
5. **Cody's Testimony 4**: Th-that's all that happened. Yup.
6. **Cody's Testimony 5**: I took a few shots, but it was too late, so I erased 'em.

Now, I'll go through each evidence and see if any testimony contradicts it.

Starting with **Evidence 16: Cody's Camera**. It states that Cody always carries his camera, though he's still learning how to use it. Looking at Cody's testimonies, in **Testimony 2**, he says he held up his camera to take a picture, but in **Testimony 3**, he mentions that the lens wouldn't open in time, so he missed it. This seems a bit contradictory because if he always carries his camera and was trying to take a picture, why did the lens not open? Maybe it's just a technical issue, but it could imply that he didn't have the camera ready, which might contradict the idea that he always has it with him.

Another point is **Testimony 5**, where Cody says he took a few shots but erased them because it was too late. If he always carries his camera, it's odd that he would erase the photos, especially if they were important evidence. This could suggest that he didn't actually take any photos or that he's being untruthful.

Looking further, **Evidence 12: Mr. Monkey's Head** mentions that it blocked the path to the crime scene between 2:15 PM and 4:00 PM. If the crime happened at 2:30 PM, as per **Evidence 3: Jack's Autopsy Report**, then Mr. Monkey's Head would have been blocking the path during the time of the crime. However, if Cody was present and using his camera, why isn't there any photo evidence of this obstruction? This could be a contradiction if Cody claims to have taken pictures but didn't capture the blocked path.

Additionally, **Evidence 17: Five-Year-Old Photo** shows an accident involving Jack Hammer. If Jack was involved in an accident five years ago, it might explain his presence or behavior at the time of the murder, but it doesn't directly contradict any testimony unless Cody's account implies Jack was in good health.

Considering **Evidence 15: "Path to Glory"**, which contains photos of the Steel Samurai's victories, if Cody was a fan and carried his camera, he might have taken photos related to this, but he claims he missed the opportunity. This doesn't necessarily contradict but adds context to his interest.

The most direct contradiction seems to be between **Evidence 16: Cody's Camera** and **Testimony 3** where Cody says the lens wouldn't open, implying the camera wasn't functional, which contradicts the idea that he always carries it and uses it. Furthermore, **Testimony 5** about erasing photos contradicts the expectation that as a fan, he would want to keep those memories.

So, the pair that contradicts is **Evidence 16** and **Testimony 3** or **Testimony 5**. Since the problem asks for one pair, I'll choose the most direct contradiction.

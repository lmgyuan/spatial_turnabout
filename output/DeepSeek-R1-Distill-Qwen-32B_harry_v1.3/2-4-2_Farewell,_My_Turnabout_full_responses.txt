Okay, so I need to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's start by looking at the evidence and testimonies provided.

First, the evidence:

- **Evidence 2: The Nickel Samurai** is a photo of Matt Engarde in his samurai costume. It's described as a glossy photo that Maya pushed onto the main character. This suggests it's a promotional or fan photo, maybe taken during a public event.

- **Evidence 9: Crime Photo** is a picture of the murder scene. It shows Juan Corrida sitting in a samurai outfit, stabbed with a knife, with a glass of juice and an open guitar case nearby. This photo was taken at the crime scene after the murder.

- **Evidence 17: Lotta's Photo** is a picture taken in the hallway right after the murder. It shows a person in samurai garb standing outside the door. This could be Matt Engarde, given his role as the Nickel Samurai.

Now, looking at the testimonies:

- **Testimony 0 to 5 by Gumshoe** all point towards Matt Engarde as the murderer. He mentions their rivalry, the Jammin' Ninja's button found in Engarde's possession, and the fingerprints on the knife.

The key point of contradiction seems to be between **Evidence 2 (The Nickel Samurai photo)** and **Testimony 5 (Gumshoe's statement about the knife purchase)**. 

Wait, no. Let me think again. The Nickel Samurai photo (Evidence 2) is just a promotional image, while the crime photo (Evidence 9) and Lotta's photo (Evidence 17) are from the crime scene. The contradiction arises because the crime photo shows Juan Corrida in a samurai outfit, which is Matt Engarde's costume. However, the evidence suggests that Matt Engarde bought the knife used in the murder, which would imply he's the murderer. But the crime photo shows Juan in the costume, which might suggest he was dressed as the Nickel Samurai, possibly leading to a misidentification.

Alternatively, the contradiction might be between the fact that the crime photo shows Juan in the samurai outfit, but the evidence points to Matt Engarde as the killer, which could be confusing. But the main contradiction is likely between the crime photo showing Juan in the costume and the evidence that Matt Engarde bought the knife, suggesting he was the one who killed Juan while dressed as the samurai.

Wait, no. The crime photo shows Juan in the samurai outfit, but the evidence (Jammin' Ninja's button) and the knife with Engarde's fingerprints suggest Matt Engarde killed Juan. So the contradiction is that the crime photo shows Juan in the samurai outfit, but the evidence points to Matt Engarde as the murderer, which might imply that the photo is misleading or that the killer used the costume to frame someone else.

Alternatively, perhaps the crime photo was taken after the murder, showing Juan in the costume, but the evidence suggests that Matt Engarde was the one who killed him, which would mean that the crime photo doesn't directly contradict the testimony but rather supports it if the killer used the costume.

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating it. The main contradiction is that the crime photo (Evidence 9) shows Juan in the samurai outfit, but the evidence (Jammin' Ninja's button and knife fingerprints) points to Matt Engarde as the killer. However, the crime photo doesn't necessarily show the killer, just the victim in the costume. So maybe the contradiction is elsewhere.

Looking back, perhaps the contradiction is between the crime photo (Evidence 9) and the testimony about the knife purchase (Testimony 5). The crime photo shows Juan in the samurai outfit, but the knife was bought by Matt Engarde, suggesting he killed Juan while dressed as the samurai. However, the crime photo might have been staged to make it look like Juan was the one in the costume, but the evidence points to Matt as the killer.

Alternatively, the contradiction could be that the crime photo shows Juan in the samurai outfit, but the evidence (Jammin' Ninja's button) suggests that the killer was dressed as the Jammin' Ninja, not the samurai. So the crime photo might be misleading, showing Juan in the samurai outfit, while the actual killer was dressed as the Jammin' Ninja.

Wait, no. The Jammin' Ninja's button was found in Engarde's possession, suggesting Engarde was dressed as the Jammin' Ninja during the crime, but the crime photo shows Juan in the samurai outfit. So the contradiction is that the crime photo shows Juan in the samurai outfit, but the evidence suggests that the killer was dressed as the Jammin' Ninja, which would mean the crime photo doesn't match the actual killer's appearance.

Alternatively, perhaps the crime photo was taken after the murder, showing Juan in the costume, but the evidence points to Matt Engarde as the killer, who was dressed as the Jammin' Ninja, not the samurai. So the crime photo doesn't show the killer but the victim in the costume, which might not be a contradiction but rather a red herring.

I think the main contradiction is between the crime photo showing Juan in the samurai outfit and the evidence pointing to Matt Engarde as the killer, suggesting that the crime photo was staged or that the killer used the costume to mislead. However, the evidence (Jammin' Ninja's button and knife fingerprints) clearly points to Matt Engarde, so the crime photo might not directly contradict but rather support the idea that the killer used the costume.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is that the crime photo shows Juan in the samurai outfit, but the evidence suggests that the killer was dressed as the Jammin' Ninja, which would mean that the crime photo doesn't show the killer but the victim, which might not be a contradiction. Alternatively, the crime photo could have been taken before the murder, showing Juan in the costume, but the actual murder happened later, so the photo doesn't contradict the testimony.

I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to outline the key points:

- **Evidence 2 (The Nickel Samurai)**: A promotional photo of Matt Engarde in his samurai costume.

- **Evidence 9 (Crime Photo)**: Shows Juan Corrida in a samurai outfit, stabbed, with a glass of juice and an open guitar case nearby.

- **Evidence 17 (Lotta's Photo)**: Shows a person in samurai garb outside the door after the murder.

- **Testimony 5 (Gumshoe)**: States that Matt Engarde bought the knife used in the murder, implying he's the killer.

The contradiction arises because the crime photo shows Juan in the samurai outfit, but the evidence points to Matt Engarde as the killer. However, the crime photo doesn't necessarily show the killer but the victim. So perhaps the contradiction is elsewhere.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is that the crime photo shows Juan in the samurai outfit, but the evidence (Jammin' Ninja's button) suggests that the killer was dressed as the Jammin' Ninja, which would mean that the crime photo doesn't show the killer but the victim, which might not be a contradiction. Alternatively, the crime photo could have been taken after the murder, showing Juan in the costume, but the actual killer was dressed as the Jammin' Ninja, which would mean the crime photo doesn't show the killer.

Alternatively, perhaps the contradiction is that the crime photo shows Juan in the samurai outfit, but the evidence suggests that the killer was dressed as the Jammin' Ninja, which would mean that the crime photo is misleading or that the killer used the costume to frame someone else.

Alternatively, perhaps the contradiction is that the crime photo shows Juan in the samurai outfit, but the evidence suggests that the killer was dressed as the Jammin' Ninja, which would mean that the crime photo doesn't show the killer but the victim, which might not be a direct contradiction but rather a misleading piece of evidence.

After considering all this, I think the contradiction is between **Evidence 9 (Crime Photo)** and **Testimony 5 (Gumshoe's statement about the knife purchase)**. The crime photo shows Juan in the samurai outfit, but the testimony suggests that Matt Engarde bought the knife and is the killer, which implies that the crime photo might not show the killer but the victim, leading to a contradiction in the timeline or the identity of the killer.

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 5}
Okay, I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's start by understanding the scenario and the provided information.

First, I'll look at the characters involved. The main characters here are Maya Fey, the victim Juan Corrida, Matt Engarde, and others. The crime scene is at the Gatewater Hotel, and the murder involved a knife and some interesting clues like a guitar case and a wine glass.

Looking at the evidence, Evidence 9 is the Crime Photo, which shows Juan Corrida sitting on a chair in a samurai outfit, stabbed with a knife. There's also a glass of juice behind him, a full bottle in front, an open guitar case, and a smashed vase with water on the carpet.

Now, the testimony from Oldbag (Security Lady) says that she saw Matt Engarde coming out of Juan's room wearing his flashy racing jacket. She claims Engarde was trying to sneak out.

I need to find a contradiction between an evidence and a testimony. Let's check each piece of evidence against the testimonies.

Looking at Evidence 9, the Crime Photo, it shows the victim's room with specific details. The testimony says Engarde was seen wearing his jacket, but the Crime Photo doesn't mention anything about Engarde's clothing or presence in the room. However, the main contradiction might be elsewhere.

Wait, the Crime Photo shows the victim's room, but the testimony claims Engarde was seen exiting the room. If the Crime Photo doesn't show Engarde in the room, that could contradict the testimony. But more importantly, the Crime Photo shows a specific setup, including the guitar case and juice, which might not align with the timeline or actions described by Oldbag.

Another point: the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows the victim's room with a knife in his chest, a glass of juice, and an open guitar case. The testimony says Engarde was exiting the room, but if the Crime Photo doesn't show Engarde, it doesn't support Oldbag's claim. However, the main contradiction is likely about the presence of Engarde in the room as per the testimony versus the evidence not showing him there.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is that the Crime Photo doesn't show Engarde, but Oldbag claims to have seen him. Alternatively, the Crime Photo might not show any signs of a struggle or someone else being present, which contradicts Oldbag's testimony of Engarde being there.

But the most direct contradiction is probably between Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 4 (Oldbag's claim of seeing Engarde). The photo doesn't show Engarde, implying he wasn't there, contradicting Oldbag's statement.

So, the answer would be {"evidence": 9, "testimony": 4}.
</think>

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 4}
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's start by understanding the situation. We have a murder scene where Juan Corrida was killed, and Matt Engarde is the prime suspect because of the evidence found. 

Looking at the testimonies, Oldbag, the security lady, claims she saw Matt Engarde, the Nickel Samurai, leaving Juan's room after the murder. She specifically mentions that he was wearing his flashy racing jacket and the Nickel Samurai costume. She's pretty confident about this, saying it would have been convenient for him to wear the costume during the murder since he had to attend a post-ceremony show afterward.

Now, looking at the evidence, especially the Crime Photo (Evidence 9), it describes the scene where Juan is sitting in a samurai outfit, with a knife in his chest, a glass of juice, an open guitar case, and a smashed vase. Importantly, there's no mention of Matt Engarde wearing the Nickel Samurai costume in the crime scene photo. The photo focuses on the victim and the immediate surroundings but doesn't show anyone else, let alone Engarde in a specific costume.

So, the contradiction arises because Oldbag's testimony relies heavily on her belief that Engarde was in the costume, which is crucial for linking him to the crime. However, the crime photo doesn't support this claim. There's no visual evidence of Engarde in the costume at the crime scene, which weakens Oldbag's testimony. The photo doesn't show Engarde at all, let alone in the costume she described.

Therefore, the evidence (Crime Photo) contradicts the testimony (Oldbag's claim about seeing Engarde in the costume) because the photo doesn't corroborate her account.
</think>

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 4}
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the evidence provided. There's a lot of it, but I'll focus on the ones that seem relevant. Evidence 9 is the Crime Photo, which shows Juan Corrida's murder scene. The caption mentions that the victim is sitting in a samurai outfit, there's a knife sticking out of his chest, a glass of juice behind him, a full bottle of juice on the desk, an open guitar case on the floor, and a smashed vase that stained the carpet with water.

Now, looking at the testimonies, Adrian Andrews says that after seeing Juan's dead body, she felt shocked and poured herself a glass of juice. She also claims that she knocked over the flower vase, causing it to fall onto the guitar case.

Wait a minute. The Crime Photo shows that the vase was smashed, but according to the evidence description, the vase only spilled water on the carpet, and the guitar case had water only on the lid. However, the testimony says that Andrews knocked the vase over, which would imply that the vase broke and caused water to spill. But in the crime photo, the vase is already smashed, and the water is on the carpet. This suggests that the vase was already broken before Andrews arrived, contradicting her claim that she knocked it over.

So, the contradiction is between Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 4 (Andrews claiming she knocked over the vase). The evidence shows the vase was already smashed, while the testimony says she did it, which isn't possible if the vase was already broken.
</think>

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 4}
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm presented with a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies related to a murder case. My task is to identify which evidence and testimony contradict each other.

First, I'll start by carefully reading through all the provided information to understand the context and the relationships between the characters, the pieces of evidence, and the testimonies given.

Looking at the characters, there are several key individuals involved:

- **Maya Fey**: The assistant and a disciple in the Kurain tradition.
- **Dick Gumshoe**: The detective in charge of the initial investigation.
- **Matt Engarde**: A popular actor and the prime suspect.
- **Adrian Andrews**: Engarde's manager, who is also a suspect.
- **Juan Corrida**: The victim, a rival actor.
- **Wendy Oldbag**: The security lady who witnessed part of the event.
- **Lotta Hart**: An investigative photographer.
- **Shelly de Killer**: A professional assassin.

Now, examining the evidences:

- **Crime Photo (Evidence 9)**: This photo shows the crime scene with Juan Corrida seated in a samurai outfit, a knife in his chest, a glass of juice behind him, a full bottle of juice on the desk, an open guitar case, and a smashed vase with water stains.

- **Wine Glass (Evidence 8)**: Found next to the victim, filled with tomato juice, with Andrews' fingerprints.

- **Guitar Case (Evidence 7)**: Empty, with water on top, and only Corrida's fingerprints.

- **Knife (Evidence 15)**: Covered in Corrida's blood and Engarde's fingerprints.

- **Jammin' Ninja's Button (Evidence 16)**: Found in Engarde's hakama, covered in Corrida's blood.

- **Lotta's Photo (Evidence 17)**: Taken in the hallway after the murder, showing someone in samurai garb outside the door.

- **Picture Card (Evidence 18)**: Placed next to the victim, carried by Andrews.

- **Spy Camera (Evidence 21)**: Set to record the room, found in a stuffed bear's eye.

- **Video Tape (Evidence 29)**: Retrieved from De Killer's hideout, contents unknown.

- **Bellboy's Uniform (Evidence 30)**: Worn by De Killer, missing a special button.

Now, looking at the testimonies:

- **Testimony 0 (Andrews)**: She went to get Matt Engarde from his room, then to Juan's room where she found his body, was in shock, poured juice, and knocked over a vase.

- **Testimony 1 (Andrews)**: She felt like fainting and poured herself juice.

- **Testimony 2 (Andrews)**: She knocked over the vase, which fell onto the guitar case.

- **Testimony 3 (Andrews)**: She saw the exact same scene as in the crime photo.

- **Testimony 4 (Andrews)**: She was the one who knocked the vase over.

Now, analyzing for contradictions:

1. **Crime Photo (Evidence 9)** shows the vase was smashed next to the guitar case, which was open. The wine glass (Evidence 8) has tomato juice and Andrews' fingerprints, suggesting she was present and may have knocked over the vase.

2. **Testimony 2 (Andrews)** states she knocked over the vase, which aligns with the crime photo. However, **Testimony 4 (Andrews)** also claims she was the one who knocked the vase over, which seems consistent.

3. **Testimony 3 (Andrews)** says she saw the exact same scene as in the crime photo, which matches the evidence.

But wait, there's a potential contradiction:

- **Testimony 4 (Andrews)** says she knocked the vase over, but **Evidence 9** shows the vase was smashed next to the guitar case, which was already open. If Andrews knocked over the vase, it would have happened after the guitar case was open, but the crime photo shows both the open case and the smashed vase.

Alternatively, considering the timeline:

- If Andrews entered the room after the murder, she might have knocked over the vase, but the crime photo already shows the vase smashed and the guitar case open. This suggests that the vase was smashed during the murder, not afterward.

Thus, **Testimony 4 (Andrews)** claiming she knocked over the vase contradicts **Evidence 9**, which shows the vase was already smashed as part of the crime scene.

Therefore, the contradiction lies between **Evidence 9 (Crime Photo)** and **Testimony 4 (Andrews)**.
</think>

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 4}
Okay, I need to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let me start by understanding the scenario.

The case involves the murder of Juan Corrida, a young actor. The main suspect is Matt Engarde, another actor and rival. There are several pieces of evidence and testimonies provided, and I need to find a pair that contradicts each other.

Looking at the testimonies, Adrian Andrews, Matt's manager, testifies that Matt had a motive to kill Juan and that the evidence, specifically the button and the knife, supports this. She mentions that the button was torn off Juan during a fight with Matt.

Now, examining the evidence, Evidence 16 is the Jammin' Ninja's Button, which was ripped from Juan's costume and found in Matt's "hakama." This seems to support Andrews' testimony.

But wait, I also need to check other evidence. Evidence 9 is the Crime Photo, which shows Juan's murder scene. The photo includes an open guitar case and a smashed vase, which doesn't directly relate to the button or knife.

Another piece of evidence, Evidence 15, is the Knife, which has Juan's blood and Matt's fingerprints. This further supports the idea that Matt used the knife, aligning with Andrews' testimony.

Wait, maybe I'm missing something. Let me think again. The key contradiction might be between the testimony and the evidence regarding the presence of the button. If the button was found in Matt's possession, that aligns with Andrews' testimony. But if there's evidence that the button wasn't present or wasn't torn off during a fight, that could contradict.

Wait, no, the button was indeed found in Matt's hakama, so that supports Andrews' claim. Therefore, perhaps the contradiction lies elsewhere.

Wait, maybe the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows the scene without any indication of a struggle involving the button, which might contradict Andrews' testimony about the button being torn off during a fight. But the photo does show an open guitar case and a smashed vase, which could suggest a struggle, but it doesn't specifically mention the button.

Alternatively, perhaps the Knife (Evidence 15) has Matt's fingerprints, which supports the testimony, but if there's evidence that the knife wasn't used in a fight, that might contradict. But the autopsy report (Evidence 14) mentions Juan was stabbed, so that aligns.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is that the button was found in Matt's hakama, implying he had it, but if the Crime Photo doesn't show any signs of a struggle where the button would have been torn off, that could be a contradiction. However, the photo does show an open guitar case and a smashed vase, suggesting a struggle.

Alternatively, maybe the fact that the button was found in Matt's possession supports Andrews' testimony, but if there's evidence that the button wasn't torn off during the murder, that could be a contradiction. But the button was covered in Juan's blood, indicating it was torn off during the crime.

Hmm, perhaps I'm overcomplicating. The contradiction might be that Andrews testifies that the button was torn off during the fight, but the Crime Photo doesn't show the button, only the knife. However, the button was found elsewhere, so that doesn't necessarily contradict.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the Knife (Evidence 15) was used to stab Juan, which aligns with Andrews' testimony, but if the Knife's condition or fingerprints contradict that, but in this case, it doesn't.

Alternatively, perhaps the contradiction is between the testimony that the button was torn off during the fight and the evidence that the button was found in Matt's hakama, which doesn't directly contradict but supports it.

Wait, maybe I'm missing the contradiction. Let me look again. The user's previous examples showed contradictions between evidence and testimony, such as a photo not matching a description.

In this case, perhaps the contradiction is that Andrews testifies that the button was torn off during the fight, but the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) doesn't show the button, only the knife and other items. However, the button was found elsewhere, so that doesn't contradict.

Alternatively, perhaps the fact that the Knife has Matt's fingerprints supports the testimony, but if there's evidence that the Knife wasn't used in the struggle, that could contradict. But the autopsy report confirms the stabbing.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is that Andrews says the button was torn off during the fight, but the button was found in Matt's hakama, implying he had it after the crime, not during. But that doesn't necessarily contradict; he could have picked it up after.

Alternatively, perhaps the contradiction is that the Knife's condition (e.g., blood and fingerprints) supports the testimony, but if the Knife was found elsewhere, that could contradict. But it was found at the scene.

Wait, perhaps the key is that the Knife was found at the scene, but Andrews testifies that Matt used it, which aligns, so no contradiction.

Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is between the testimony that Matt had no alibi and the evidence that he was seen elsewhere. But no such evidence is provided.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is that Andrews testifies that Matt had a motive and the evidence supports it, but if the evidence actually shows someone else did it, that would contradict. But the evidence points to Matt.

I'm a bit stuck. Maybe the contradiction is that the Crime Photo (Evidence 9) shows the scene without the button, but the button was found in Matt's possession, implying he had it after the crime, not during, which contradicts Andrews' testimony that it was torn off during the fight.

So, the contradiction is between Evidence 9 (Crime Photo) and Testimony 4 (Andrews' statement about the button being torn off during the fight). The photo doesn't show the button, suggesting it wasn't present during the crime, contradicting Andrews' claim that it was torn off during the struggle.

Therefore, the answer is {"evidence": 9, "testimony": 4}.
</think>

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 4}
Okay, so I need to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's break down the information provided.

First, looking at the evidence, there's Evidence 8, which is a Wine Glass. It's described as being found next to the victim, filled with tomato juice, and having Andrews' fingerprints. Importantly, there's no sign it's been drunk. So, the wine glass is just sitting there, untouched.

Now, looking at the testimonies, Testimony 4 from Andrews says that when she realized Juan was dead, she poured him some juice. But according to the evidence, the glass wasn't touched. If Andrews had poured juice for Juan, we'd expect the glass to have some signs of being handled or consumed, but it doesn't. This suggests that her testimony about pouring juice doesn't align with the evidence.

So, the contradiction is between Evidence 8 (the untouched wine glass) and Testimony 4 ( Andrews claiming she poured juice for Juan). This means Andrews is either mistaken or not telling the truth about her actions at the crime scene.
</think>

{"evidence": 8, "testimony": 4}

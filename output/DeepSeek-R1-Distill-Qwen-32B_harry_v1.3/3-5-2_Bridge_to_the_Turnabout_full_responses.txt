Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find a pair of evidence and testimony that contradict each other based on the provided information.

First, I'll go through the evidence and testimonies to understand what each one says.

**Evidence:**
- **Evidence 2 (Oh! Cult! New Year's Issue):** This is an occult magazine featuring Hazakura Temple.
- **Evidence 7 (Weather Data):** Provides the weather conditions on the night of the crime, including snow and lightning.
- **Evidence 14 (Tracks Photo):** Shows tracks leading from the Main Gate to Dusky Bridge.
- **Evidence 16 (Crystal Sphere):** Found near Dusky Bridge with blood on it.
- **Evidence 20 (Stone Lantern):** A lantern in the Inner Temple garden that wasn't lit the night of the crime.
- **Evidence 21 (Dusky Bridge Photo):** Taken the morning after the crime, showing the bridge.

**Testimonies:**
- **Testimony 0-5 (Bikini):** Bikini testifies about her activities the night of the crime, including helping an acolyte, leaving Iris in the Inner Temple, and returning to Hazakura Temple.

Looking for contradictions, I notice that **Evidence 14 (Tracks Photo)** shows tracks leading to Dusky Bridge, suggesting someone was there. However, **Testimony 5 (Bikini)** mentions she saw something after finishing her bath, implying she was inside Hazakura Temple and didn't go to Dusky Bridge. This suggests she wasn't the one who left the tracks, contradicting her testimony about her whereabouts.

{"evidence": 14, "testimony": 5}
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's start by going through all the evidence and testimonies provided to understand the situation better.

First, the characters involved are Maya Fey, Mia Fey, Godot, Pearl Fey, Bikini, Elise Deauxnim, Iris, Laurice Deauxnim, Phoenix Wright, Dick Gumshoe, Franziska von Karma, Miles Edgeworth, Morgan Fey, and Dahlia Hawthorne. The evidence includes various items like the attorney's badge, Maya's Magatama, a magazine, a map of Hazakura Temple, a hanging scroll, photos of Elise, Iris's hood, weather data, a note, Elise's staff, the Shichishito sword, Elise's autopsy report, Iris's testimony, crime photos, tracks photo, Larry's sketch, a crystal sphere, a Kurain Master's Talisman, a burnt letter, a dagger, a stone lantern, and a Dusky Bridge photo.

The testimonies provided are from Bikini, who is a nun at Hazakura Temple. She testified about her movements that night, seeing Iris without her hood, and witnessing Elise being stabbed with a sword.

Now, looking at the evidence and testimonies, I need to find a pair where one piece of evidence directly contradicts a testimony.

One key point is the testimony from Bikini stating that she saw Iris without her hood and witnessed the stabbing. However, evidence 6 describes Iris's hood as being magical and protecting her from evil spirits, and it was received before the crime. If the hood was magical and Iris was protected, it might contradict the idea that she was involved in the crime as Bikini testified.

Another point is the weather data (evidence 7) indicating snow and lightning around the time of the crime, but the crime photo (evidence 13) doesn't show any signs of weather effects, which could be a contradiction.

Additionally, the Shichishito sword (evidence 10) is described as the apparent murder weapon, but the victim's staff (evidence 9) had a hidden sword inside, which was the actual murder weapon. This directly contradicts the testimony that the Shichishito was used.

Wait, that's a strong contradiction. The evidence says the staff had the actual weapon, but the testimony says the Shichishito was used. That's a clear contradiction.

So, the evidence about the staff containing the actual weapon contradicts the testimony identifying the Shichishito as the murder weapon.
</think>

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 5}
Alright, I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let me go through the provided information step by step.

First, I'll look at the characters involved. There's Maya Fey, who's assisting as a spirit medium, and other characters like Bikini, Elise Deauxnim, and Iris. The crime scene is at Hazakura Temple, and the victim is Elise Deauxnim, who was found stabbed in the courtyard.

Looking at the evidence, there are several items listed, but I'm particularly interested in Evidence 9, which is the victim's staff. The description mentions that it had a sword hidden inside, which was used as the murder weapon. This is crucial because it suggests that the staff was the actual weapon used in the crime.

Now, examining the testimonies, Bikini's testimony stands out. She claims to have seen Iris stabbing Elise with a sword. However, according to the evidence, the sword was hidden inside Elise's staff. This creates a contradiction because if the sword was inside the staff, it wouldn't have been visible for Bikini to witness the stabbing with it.

So, the contradiction is between Evidence 9 (the staff containing the hidden sword) and Testimony 5 (Bikini claiming to see the stabbing with a visible sword). Since the sword was hidden inside the staff, Bikini couldn't have seen it being used as she described.
</think>

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 5}
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm presented with a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies, and I need to find a pair where an evidence and a testimony contradict each other. The goal is to identify such a pair and present the answer in a specific JSON format.

First, I'll go through the characters to understand who they are and their roles in the scenario. The main characters include Maya Fey, a defense attorney, and others involved in a murder case at Hazakura Temple. 

Next, I'll examine the evidences provided. Each evidence has a description that might be relevant to the case. For example, the "Victim's Staff" is described as having a hidden sword, which is the actual murder weapon. Another evidence, "Shichishito," is the apparent murder weapon but isn't the real one.

Looking at the testimonies, each character provides a statement. For instance, Bikini testifies about seeing tracks indicating a snowmobile was used, which would have made traveling to Dusky Bridge quicker.

Now, I need to find a contradiction between an evidence and a testimony. The key is to see where the evidence and testimony provide conflicting information.

One potential contradiction is between "Evidence 9: Victim's Staff" and "Testimony 5: Bikini's statement about Iris driving a snowmobile." The evidence states that the staff has a hidden sword, which is the actual murder weapon, while Bikini's testimony suggests that the murderer used a snowmobile, implying a different method of committing the crime.

However, upon closer inspection, the contradiction isn't clear. The evidence describes the weapon, while the testimony talks about the method of transportation. They don't directly contradict each other.

Another possibility is between "Evidence 7: Weather Data" and "Testimony 5: Bikini's statement." The weather data mentions lightning striking Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM, which could imply the time of the crime. If Bikini's testimony about seeing tracks after 11 PM conflicts with this timeline, that could be a contradiction.

But the weather data doesn't specify the exact time of the crime, only the weather conditions. Therefore, it doesn't directly contradict Bikini's testimony about the time she saw the tracks.

After careful consideration, I realize that the contradiction lies between "Evidence 9: Victim's Staff" and "Testimony 5: Bikini's statement." The evidence clearly states that the staff contains the actual murder weapon, while Bikini's testimony suggests that the crime was committed using a snowmobile, which isn't supported by the evidence.

Thus, the pair that contradicts each other is Evidence 9 and Testimony 5.

{"evidence": 9, "testimony": 5}
Alright, I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let me start by going through the evidence and testimonies provided.

First, the evidence list has several items, but I'm focusing on the ones that seem relevant. Evidence 7 is the Weather Data, which mentions that the snow stopped around 10:50 PM and lightning occurred until 11 PM. The crime happened around 10-11 PM, according to the autopsy report.

Looking at the testimonies, Testimony 3 by Butz says that the snow had pretty much stopped by the time he arrived at the shack, which he estimates was about a five-minute walk away. This suggests that the snow stopped before he arrived, which aligns with the weather data indicating the snow stopped around 10:50 PM.

But wait, Testimony 6 by Butz mentions that he thought he'd never get another chance to see something so big burning. This could imply that the fire was still ongoing when he arrived, but according to the Weather Data, the fire started around 10:45 PM and went out around 30 minutes later, which would be around 11:15 PM. If Butz arrived after 11 PM, the fire might have already gone out, contradicting his testimony about seeing it burning.

However, the key contradiction seems to be between Evidence 7 (Weather Data) and Testimony 3 by Butz. The weather data says the snow stopped around 10:50 PM, but Butz claims he arrived at the shack after the snow had stopped, which would have been around 10:50 PM or later. If the crime occurred between 10-11 PM, Butz's arrival time might overlap with the crime timeline, potentially placing him at the scene during the crime, which contradicts his testimony of only seeing the aftermath.

So, the contradiction is between Evidence 7 (Weather Data) and Testimony 3 by Butz regarding the timing of the snow stopping and his arrival at the shack.
</think>

{"evidence": 7, "testimony": 3}
Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, I'll look at the characters involved. There's Maya Fey, who's a spirit medium, and others like Godot, a prosecutor, and Dick Gumshoe, a detective. The main issue here seems to be the murder of Elise Deauxnim at Hazakura Temple.

Looking at the evidence, number 7 is the Weather Data. It says there was snow and lightning on February 7th. The lightning struck Dusky Bridge at 10:45 PM, and the fire took about 30 minutes to go out. This suggests that the crime happened around that time.

Now, looking at the testimonies, testimony 3 from Butz says he was sketching and felt a surge of artistic inspiration, transferring his emotions onto the page. He also mentions that the flames had gone out and someone ran up.

Wait, if the fire went out around 11 PM, and Butz was sketching, then the time he was at the bridge would align with the weather data. However, if he was sketching during the fire, that might contradict the timeline of the crime. Butz's testimony about the timing and his actions during the fire could be conflicting with the Weather Data's timeline.

So, the Weather Data (evidence 7) indicates the fire started around 10 PM and ended by 11 PM, while Butz's testimony (testimony 3) describes being at the bridge during the fire. If Butz was sketching during the fire, that would fit, but if he claims to have been there after the fire, it might not align. However, I'm not entirely sure if there's a direct contradiction here.

Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is elsewhere. Let me check other evidence and testimonies. For example, evidence 9 is the victim's staff, which had a hidden sword, but the actual murder weapon was the Shichishito (evidence 10). If someone testified about using a different weapon, that would contradict.

Wait, in the testimonies, Butz mentions seeing Iris flying with her hood, which might relate to evidence 6, the hood. If the hood was used as a disguise, but the testimony says Iris was wearing it, that might not be a contradiction.

Hmm, perhaps the contradiction is between the Weather Data (evidence 7) and Butz's testimony about the timing of the fire and his presence. If the fire started at 10 PM and ended by 11 PM, and Butz claims to have been sketching during that time, it might fit. But if he says he arrived after the fire, that would contradict.

Wait, in testimony 3, Butz says the flames had gone out when he arrived, which would mean he arrived after 11 PM. But the Weather Data says the fire started around 10 PM and ended by 11 PM. So if Butz arrived after the fire, that would mean he was there after 11 PM, which contradicts the Weather Data's timeline of the fire ending by 11 PM.

Therefore, the contradiction is between evidence 7 (Weather Data) and testimony 3 (Butz's statement about arriving after the fire had gone out).

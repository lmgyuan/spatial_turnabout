Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm presented with a list of characters, evidences, and testimonies, and I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. The user has specified that I should only answer one pair and end with a JSON format like {"evidence": 2, "testimony": 3}. 

First, I'll look through the provided information to understand the context. The case involves a murder at Tres Bien, with various characters involved. The key pieces of evidence and testimonies are listed, and I need to identify a contradiction between one evidence and one testimony.

Looking at the testimonies, Jean Armstrong's statements are crucial. He mentions that there was a mirror in the middle of the restaurant, dividing it into two halves. He also states that only one seat provided a view of the victim and that this was where the old man (Victor Kudo) was sitting. After the incident, Armstrong moved the mirror to clear the way but didn't touch anything else.

Now, examining the evidence, specifically Evidence 11 (Tres Bien Floor Plans), it describes the blueprints of the crime scene. It mentions that the view from the entrance is obstructed and that only the patio is visible. This suggests that the layout of the restaurant, including the placement of the mirror, was such that the victim's seat was not easily visible from the entrance.

The contradiction arises because Jean Armstrong's testimony claims that the mirror was moved after the incident, implying that it was previously blocking the view. However, the floor plans (Evidence 11) indicate that the entrance view was already obstructed, meaning the mirror wasn't the only obstruction. This suggests that Armstrong's claim about the mirror's role in obstructing the view might be misleading or incorrect.

Therefore, the pair that contradicts is Evidence 11 and Testimony 3.

{"evidence": 11, "testimony": 3}
Alright, I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's go through the information step by step.

First, I'll look at the evidence and testimonies provided. The key evidence here is the Crime Photo (Evidence 12), which shows the crime scene. It mentions that there's an intact vase on each table, with one knocked over and staining the tablecloth. The testimony from Jean Armstrong (Testimony 3) states that there were no other customers present. However, the Crime Photo shows that the victim was alone, but Jean's testimony might imply that there were no other customers, which could be misleading if there were actually other people or items involved.

Wait, but looking closer, the Crime Photo specifically describes the scene with two tables separated by a folding screen, one empty and the other with the victim. The testimony from Armstrong mentions that there were no other customers, which aligns with the photo showing an empty table. So, maybe they don't contradict.

Hmm, perhaps I need to look elsewhere. The Autopsy Report (Evidence 10) states the time of death was between 1:30 and 2:30 PM, while Armstrong's testimony mentions the incident occurring at approximately 2 PM. That seems consistent. 

Looking at the Floor Plans (Evidence 11), it mentions that the view from the entrance is obstructed, which matches Armstrong's testimony about the mirror blocking the view. So, no contradiction there.

Wait, perhaps I'm missing something. The Coffee Cup (Evidence 13) has the victim's and Maggey's fingerprints, indicating she might have been involved. But Armstrong's testimony doesn't mention Maggey, so that's not a contradiction.

I think I need to focus on the specific details. The Crime Photo shows the vase intact, but Armstrong's testimony says he broke the vase. That's a direct contradiction because the photo shows it's intact, while the testimony claims it was broken.

Yes, that makes sense. The evidence shows the vase was intact, while the testimony claims it was broken, which is a clear contradiction.

{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 3}
Okay, I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's go through the information step by step.

First, I'll look at the characters involved. The main characters include Maya Fey, the defendant's assistant, and others like Dick Gumshoe, the detective, and various witnesses and suspects.

Next, I'll examine the evidence provided. Evidence 27 is the "Viola's Medical Papers," which mentions a $1 million bill for cranial surgery that was due last year. This suggests that Viola Cadaverini had significant medical expenses.

Now, looking at the testimonies, Testimony 4 from Furio Tigre states that if anyone wants to check his alibi, they should ask Violetta. This implies that Violetta (also known as Viola) can corroborate Tigre's whereabouts.

The contradiction arises because if Viola had a $1 million medical bill due last year, she might not have been in a position to provide an alibi for Tigre. Her financial situation could have made it impossible for her to be present to confirm his alibi. Therefore, the evidence about her medical debt conflicts with the testimony that she could vouch for Tigre's whereabouts.

So, the pair that contradicts is Evidence 27 and Testimony 4.

{"evidence": 27, "testimony": 4}
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's start by going through the characters, evidences, and testimonies provided.

First, the characters involved include Maya Fey, Mia Fey, Godot, Dick Gumshoe, Maggey Byrde, Jean Armstrong, Glen Elg, Victor Kudo, Lisa Basil, Furio Tigre, Bruto Cadaverini, Violetta Cadaverini, and others. Each has their own description, but I'm focusing on the evidence and testimonies.

Looking at the evidences, there are 28 listed, each with a description. The key ones seem to be related to the crime scene, the victim's condition, and the involvement of different characters.

The testimonies provided are from various characters, but the focus is on Furio Tigre's statements. He claims he never met Glen Elg, set up a meeting that didn't happen, and wasn't at Tres Bien.

Now, looking for contradictions: Evidence 20 mentions Glen's calendar having a note to meet Furio Tigre on Dec. 3rd, the day of the incident. However, Tigre's testimony says he never met Glen and wasn't at Tres Bien. This directly contradicts the evidence showing a planned meeting.

So, the evidence that Glen had a meeting scheduled with Tigre contradicts Tigre's testimony denying any involvement or meeting with Glen.

{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 4}
Alright, I need to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's start by reviewing the provided information carefully.

First, I'll look at the characters involved. The main characters here are Maya Fey, Mia Fey, Godot, Dick Gumshoe, Maggey Byrde, Jean Armstrong, Glen Elg, Victor Kudo, Lisa Basil, Furio Tigre, and Bruto Cadaverini. Each has their own description, but I'm particularly interested in how they relate to the evidence and testimonies provided.

Next, I'll go through the list of evidence. There are 28 pieces of evidence, each with a description. I need to identify which ones might be relevant to the testimonies given by Furio Tigre.

Looking at the testimonies, Furio Tigre claims that he was supposed to meet Glen Elg at Tres Bien restaurant on December 3rd. He describes arriving at the restaurant, finding Glen dead, and leaving immediately upon seeing the police sirens. He emphasizes that he didn't go to Tres Bien and that he was at his office the entire time.

Now, examining the evidence, I notice that Evidence 20 is Glen's Calendar, which has a note saying, "Meet with The Tiger" on December 3rd. This directly ties into Tigre's testimony about meeting Glen at the restaurant. If the calendar shows a scheduled meeting, it contradicts Tigre's claim that he never went to Tres Bien and didn't meet Glen.

Additionally, Evidence 6 mentions a small bottle found in the kitchen, which contains the victim's ear medicine with Furio Tigre's fingerprints. This suggests that Tigre was present at the crime scene, further contradicting his testimony.

Putting this together, the key contradiction is between Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) and Tigre's testimony about never meeting Glen at Tres Bien. The calendar shows a scheduled meeting, implying Tigre was involved, which conflicts with his denial.

{"evidence": 20, "testimony": 0}
Alright, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the evidence provided. Evidence 20 is Glen's Calendar, which shows a note saying "Meet with The Tiger" on December 3rd, the day of the incident. This suggests that Glen Elg had a scheduled meeting with Furio Tigre, the head of Tender Lender loan company.

Now, looking at the testimonies, Testimony 0 from Furio Tigre states that he loaned Glen Elg $100,000 and that they were supposed to discuss repayment. However, Tigre claims he didn't have any other reason to kill Glen and that the $100,000 was his only motive.

But wait, the calendar shows that Glen had a meeting scheduled with Tigre on the day of the incident. If Tigre was indeed at the meeting, it contradicts his testimony where he claims he wasn't present at the restaurant and had no other reason to kill Glen besides the $100,000 debt. This suggests that Tigre might have been involved in the incident despite his claims.

So, the contradiction lies between Evidence 20 (Glen's Calendar) and Testimony 0 (Tigre's statement about having no other reason to kill Glen). The calendar indicates a scheduled meeting, implying Tigre was involved, while Tigre denies any other motives beyond the debt.

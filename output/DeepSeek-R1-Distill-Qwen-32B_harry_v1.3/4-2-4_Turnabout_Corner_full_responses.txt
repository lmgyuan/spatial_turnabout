Okay, I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let me go through the information step by step.

First, I'll look at the evidence provided. There are several pieces of evidence listed, each with a description. I need to pay attention to the details in each evidence to see how they might conflict with the testimonies.

Looking at the testimonies, each witness provides their account of what happened. My task is to find a pair where an evidence contradicts a testimony.

One piece of evidence that stands out is the "Noodle Stand" (Evidence 12). It mentions that the victim died pulling it, with a sign reading "ELDOON". The testimony by Wesley Stickler (Testimony 4) says he saw the defendant at the scene, with the victim pulling a stand that had a sign reading "NOODLE".

Wait, that's interesting. The evidence says the sign read "ELDOON", but Stickler testified it read "NOODLE". These are different names, which could be a contradiction. The defendant's name is Wocky Kitaki, and the noodle stand's sign is crucial in identifying the scene.

So, the contradiction is between Evidence 12 (sign reads "ELDOON") and Testimony 4 (sign reads "NOODLE"). This means the evidence and testimony disagree on the sign's name, which is a key detail in the case.

Therefore, the pair that contradicts is {"evidence": 12, "testimony": 4}.

{"evidence": 12, "testimony": 4}

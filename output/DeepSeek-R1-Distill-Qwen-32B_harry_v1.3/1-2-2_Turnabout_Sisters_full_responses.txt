Okay, I need to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other. Let's start by going through each piece of evidence and testimony to see if there's a conflict.

Looking at the characters, Mia Fey is the victim, and Maya is her sister who was found at the scene. Dick Gumshoe is the detective, and Miles Edgeworth is the prosecutor. April May and Redd White are witnesses. The bellboy and Marvin Grossberg are also involved.

Now, the evidence includes things like the Thinker statue as the murder weapon, glass shards, a receipt with blood, Maya's memo, Mia's autopsy report, Maya's cell phone, wiretap, floor plans, May's testimony, photographs, the bellboy's affidavit, a newspaper clipping, and another memo from Mia.

The testimonies are all from Gumshoe. He says he examined the crime scene, found a memo with "Maya" written in blood, that the blood was the victim's, there was blood on the victim's finger, and that the victim wrote the killer's name.

Looking at the evidence, Evidence 3 is a receipt with letters written in blood on the back. The description says the letters were written in blood. Testimony 5 says the victim wrote the killer's name, implying that the blood on the receipt is Mia's writing, which would be the killer's name. But Testimony 2 says the word "Maya" was written in blood on the memo. If the receipt (Evidence 3) has letters in blood, and the memo (which is Evidence 4) also has blood, but Testimony 2 says the memo has "Maya" in blood, which is the victim's blood according to Testimony 3. 

Wait, Evidence 4 is Maya's memo, which says "A conversation I had with my sister is recorded on my cell phone." So that's separate. The receipt (Evidence 3) has blood letters, and the memo (Evidence 4) is Maya's. The testimonies say that a memo next to the body had "Maya" in blood, which was the victim's. But the receipt (Evidence 3) also has blood letters. So if the receipt's blood is from Mia, then she wrote something on it, but according to Testimony 5, she wrote the killer's name. But Testimony 2 says the memo had "Maya" in blood, which is the victim's blood. So the receipt's blood is Mia's, but she wrote the killer's name. So if the receipt's blood is Mia's, then she wrote the killer's name on it. But the memo (Evidence 4) is Maya's, so the blood on the memo would be hers, but she's the suspect. 

Wait, but the testimonies say that the memo found had "Maya" in blood, which was the victim's (Mia's) blood. So that contradicts because if Mia wrote "Maya" in her own blood, that would imply she wrote her sister's name, but the receipt (Evidence 3) has blood letters, which according to Testimony 5, Mia wrote the killer's name. So if the receipt's blood is Mia's, she wrote the killer's name, but the memo's blood is also Mia's, writing "Maya". That would mean Mia wrote her sister's name in her own blood, which is possible, but perhaps the contradiction is that the memo's blood is Mia's, but the receipt's blood is also Mia's, but the receipt's letters are the killer's name, which could be Maya. So if the receipt has the killer's name as Maya, then the memo has "Maya" written in blood, which is Mia's blood. So that's consistent. 

Alternatively, maybe the contradiction is between the receipt and the memo. The receipt has letters written in blood on the back, which is Mia's blood (from Testimony 3, the blood on the memo is Mia's). So the receipt's blood is Mia's, meaning she wrote the letters. But Testimony 5 says she wrote the killer's name, so the letters on the receipt are the killer's name. But Testimony 2 says the memo had "Maya" in blood, which is Mia's blood. So Mia wrote "Maya" on the memo, which would imply she accused her sister. But if the receipt has the killer's name written in her blood, that would be the same as the memo, but perhaps the receipt's letters are different. Wait, the receipt is for a glass light stand, and the letters are written in blood. So maybe the letters are the killer's name, which could be someone else, not Maya. But Testimony 2 says the memo had "Maya" in blood, which is Mia's blood. So if Mia wrote "Maya" on the memo, that would suggest she accused her sister, but the receipt's letters might be someone else's name, which would contradict the testimony that the victim wrote the killer's name (Maya). 

Alternatively, perhaps the contradiction is that the memo (Evidence 4) is Maya's, but the testimonies say that the memo found at the scene had "Maya" in blood, which was Mia's blood. But Evidence 4 is Maya's memo, which is separate. So if the memo found at the scene (from Testimony 1-4) is not Evidence 4, but another memo, then perhaps there's a contradiction. Because the testimonies say a memo was found with "Maya" in blood, which was Mia's blood, but Evidence 4 is Maya's memo, which is a different memo. So that could be a contradiction. 

Wait, the testimonies say that Gumshoe found a memo next to the body, which had "Maya" in blood, and that blood was Mia's. But Evidence 4 is Maya's memo, which is a separate document. So the memo found at the scene (from Testimony 1-4) is not Maya's memo but another memo. So the contradiction is that the testimonies say a memo with "Maya" in Mia's blood was found, but Evidence 4 is Maya's memo, which is separate. Therefore, the testimonies suggest that the memo found was Mia's, but Evidence 4 is Maya's memo, which is a different document. 

Alternatively, perhaps the contradiction is that the receipt (Evidence 3) has letters written in blood, which according to Testimony 5, are the killer's name, but Testimony 2 says the memo had "Maya" in blood, which is Mia's blood. So if Mia wrote "Maya" on the memo, that's her sister, but if she wrote the killer's name on the receipt, that would be someone else. So that's a contradiction because if the killer is Maya, then the receipt should have "Maya" as the killer's name, but the testimonies say the receipt's letters are the killer's name, which would be Maya. But the memo's "Maya" is Mia's blood, so that's consistent. Hmm, maybe not a contradiction.

Wait, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 4 and Evidence 3. Testimony 4 says there was blood on the victim's finger, implying she might have written something. Evidence 3 is a receipt with letters written in blood. So if Mia's finger had blood, she could have written on the receipt. But Testimony 5 says she wrote the killer's name, so the receipt's letters are the killer's name. But Testimony 2 says the memo had "Maya" in blood, which is Mia's blood, so she wrote her sister's name. So if the killer is Maya, then the receipt's letters would be "Maya", but the memo also has "Maya" in blood. So that's consistent. 

Wait, maybe the contradiction is that the receipt (Evidence 3) has letters written in blood, which according to Testimony 5, are the killer's name, but Testimony 2 says the memo had "Maya" in blood, which is Mia's blood. So if the killer is Maya, then the receipt's letters would be "Maya", but the memo also has "Maya" in blood. So that's not a contradiction. 

Alternatively, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 4. Testimony 5 says the victim wrote the killer's name, implying it's on the receipt (Evidence 3). But Evidence 4 is Maya's memo, which is a separate document. So if the victim wrote the killer's name on the receipt, but the memo found had "Maya" in blood, which is Mia's blood, then that's consistent because the killer's name is Maya, so both the receipt and the memo have "Maya" in Mia's blood. 

Wait, maybe the contradiction is that the receipt (Evidence 3) has letters written in blood, which according to Testimony 5, are the killer's name, but Testimony 2 says the memo had "Maya" in blood, which is Mia's blood. So if the killer's name is Maya, then the receipt's letters would be "Maya", but the memo also has "Maya" in blood. So that's consistent. 

I'm getting a bit confused. Let me try to list out the key points:

- Testimony 0-5: Gumshoe found a memo with "Maya" in blood (Testimony 2), which was Mia's blood (Testimony 3). There was also blood on Mia's finger (Testimony 4), and she wrote the killer's name (Testimony 5).

- Evidence 3: Receipt with letters written in blood on the back. The receipt is for a glass light stand.

- Evidence 4: Maya's memo, which is a separate document.

So the memo found at the scene (Testimony 1-4) is a different memo than Evidence 4. Therefore, the testimonies mention a memo with "Maya" in Mia's blood, but Evidence 4 is Maya's memo, which is another document. So the contradiction is that the testimonies imply that the memo found was Mia's, but Evidence 4 is Maya's memo, which is a separate document. Therefore, the testimonies and Evidence 4 contradict each other because the testimonies say the memo found had "Maya" in Mia's blood, but Evidence 4 is Maya's memo, which is a different document.

Alternatively, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 3. Testimony 5 says Mia wrote the killer's name, which would be on the receipt (Evidence 3). But if the receipt's letters are the killer's name, and the memo (Evidence 4) is Maya's, then that's consistent. 

Wait, no, because the memo found at the scene (Testimony 1-4) is a different memo than Evidence 4. So the testimonies say that the memo found had "Maya" in Mia's blood, but Evidence 4 is Maya's memo, which is a separate document. So that's a contradiction because the testimonies imply that the memo found was Mia's, but Evidence 4 is Maya's memo, which is another document. 

So the pair would be Evidence 4 and Testimony 2, because Testimony 2 says the memo had "Maya" in blood, which was Mia's, but Evidence 4 is Maya's memo, which is a different document. Therefore, the contradiction is between Evidence 4 and Testimony 2.

Wait, but Testimony 1-4 are about a memo found at the scene, which is not Evidence 4. So the contradiction is that the testimonies say a memo was found with "Maya" in Mia's blood, but Evidence 4 is Maya's memo, which is a separate document. Therefore, the testimonies and Evidence 4 are about different memos, which could be a contradiction because the testimonies imply that the memo found was Mia's, but Evidence 4 is Maya's. 

Alternatively, perhaps the contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 3. Testimony 5 says Mia wrote the killer's name, which would be on the receipt (Evidence 3). But if the killer is Maya, then the receipt's letters would be "Maya", but the memo (Testimony 2) also has "Maya" in Mia's blood. So that's consistent. 

Wait, maybe the contradiction is that the receipt (Evidence 3) has letters written in blood, which according to Testimony 5, are the killer's name, but the memo (Testimony 2) has "Maya" in blood, which is Mia's blood. So if the killer is Maya, then the receipt's letters would be "Maya", but the memo also has "Maya" in blood. So that's consistent. 

I'm not sure. Maybe I should look for another pair. Let's see:

Looking at the evidence and testimonies, another possible contradiction is between Evidence 5 (Mia's autopsy report) and Testimony 9 (May's testimony). The autopsy report says Mia died at 9 PM from a blunt force trauma, death was instantaneous. May's testimony says the victim dodged an attack then ran to the right, but was caught and struck. If the death was instantaneous, Mia wouldn't have had time to dodge and run. So that's a contradiction.

Wait, that's a good point. The autopsy report says death was instantaneous, meaning she died immediately from the blow. But May's testimony says Mia dodged an attack, ran, then was struck. That implies Mia was alive and moving after the initial attack, which contradicts the autopsy report stating death was instantaneous.

So the contradiction is between Evidence 5 (Mia's autopsy report) and Testimony 9 (May's testimony). 

Yes, that makes sense. Because if death was instantaneous, Mia couldn't have dodged, run, and then been struck. So that's a clear contradiction.
</think>

The contradiction arises between the autopsy report (Evidence 5) stating Mia's death was instantaneous and May's testimony (Testimony 9) describing Mia dodging an attack and running before being struck, which implies she was alive longer.

{"evidence": 5, "testimony": 9}
Alright, so I've been given this problem where I need to identify a contradiction between an evidence and a testimony in a fictional murder mystery scenario. The characters, evidences, and testimonies are listed, and I need to find one pair that contradicts each other.

First, I'll start by understanding the setup. There are several characters involved, including Mia Fey, who is the chief attorney, her sister Maya Fey, who was found at the scene, and various other characters like the detective Dick Gumshoe, prosecutor Miles Edgeworth, and eye witnesses April May and Redd White. There are also various pieces of evidence like an attorney's badge, a murder weapon called "The Thinker," glass shards, receipts, memos, autopsy reports, and more.

The testimonies provided are from April May, who claims to have seen the events unfold. She describes the victim dodging an attack, running to the right, being chased by Maya, and then being struck by the weapon, which she identifies as "The Thinker," a statue-like clock.

Now, looking at the evidence, there's a receipt (Evidence 3) that details a purchase of a glass light stand, with bloodstains on the back. There's also an autopsy report (Evidence 5) that states Mia's death was instantaneous, caused by a single blunt force trauma. Additionally, there are glass shards (Evidence 2) found at the scene.

One thing that stands out is the description of the weapon. April May identifies it as "The Thinker," which is described as a statue-like clock made by Larry Butz. However, the receipt mentions a glass light stand, which seems to be a different item altogether. This discrepancy suggests that there might be a contradiction between what April is testifying about the weapon and the evidence found at the scene.

Furthermore, the glass shards (Evidence 2) and the receipt for the glass light stand (Evidence 3) imply that the weapon used in the murder might have been the glass light stand, not the statue-like clock. This contradicts April's testimony where she clearly identifies the weapon as "The Thinker."

Additionally, the autopsy report (Evidence 5) mentions that the death was instantaneous, which aligns with the idea of a blunt force trauma from a heavy object like a statue, but the presence of glass shards and the receipt suggests that the actual weapon might have been the glass light stand, which is a different item.

So, putting this all together, the contradiction lies between the testimony of April May identifying the weapon as "The Thinker" and the evidence suggesting that the weapon was actually a glass light stand, as indicated by the receipt and the glass shards found at the scene.

This means that either April's testimony is incorrect, or there's more to the story that hasn't been revealed yet. It's possible that there was an attempt to frame Maya using the glass light stand, while April mistakenly identified the weapon based on what she saw or was told.

In conclusion, the key contradiction is between the identification of the weapon in April's testimony and the evidence pointing towards a different weapon being used in the murder.

Okay, so I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let me start by going through all the information provided.

First, I'll look at the characters involved. There's Maya Fey, the assistant and spirit medium; Dick Gumshoe, the detective; Franziska von Karma, the prosecutor; Max, the magician accused of murder; Regina Berry, the circus idol; Russell Berry, the victim and Ringmaster; Ben, the ventriloquist; Moe, the clown; Acro, the acrobat; and Bat, who's in a coma.

Now, looking at the evidence, I see several items. Evidence 15 is the Max G. Bust, a bronze statue taken from the cafeteria before the crime, which is quite heavy. Testimony 0 to 5 come from Acro, who is the acrobat. He says he could lift something the size of the bust because of his upper body strength but couldn't look out the window or exert force on his lower body due to his injuries.

So, the key point here is that Acro claims he couldn't have lifted the bust and dropped it on the Ringmaster because of his injuries. However, the evidence states that the bust was indeed used as the murder weapon, implying that someone did lift and drop it. If Acro is injured and couldn't have done it, but the bust was used, there's a contradiction.

Therefore, the evidence that the bust was used (Evidence 15) contradicts Acro's testimony that he couldn't have done it (Testimony 4).

Okay, I'm trying to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. Let's start by understanding the scenario.

So, the main characters involved are Maya Fey, who is the defendant, and Dr. Turner Grey, who was the victim. The crime scene is at Fey Manor, specifically in the Channeling Chamber. The evidence and testimonies provided are crucial in determining what happened.

Looking at the evidence, there are several key items:

- **Evidence 11: Maya's Costume** - This is the outfit Maya was wearing during the murder. It has blood splatters and a bullet hole in the sleeve. The description mentions that the robe is otherwise clean and purple.

- **Evidence 12 and 13: Lotta's Photos** - These are two photos taken by Lotta Hart at the crime scene. They show Maya Fey in the Channeling Chamber after the gunshot, with Dr. Grey lying dead on the floor.

- **Evidence 9: Pistol** - The murder weapon, which was Dr. Grey's. It was fired twice and has fingerprints from both Maya and Grey.

- **Evidence 8: Dr. Grey's Autopsy Report** - Indicates that Dr. Grey was stabbed in the chest and then shot at point-blank range, with gunpowder residue around the bullet hole.

Now, looking at the testimonies:

- **Testimony 0-3: Gumshoe's Testimony** - Gumshoe claims that Maya attacked and killed someone who wasn't fighting back. He points out the blood-covered costume as evidence.

So, the potential contradiction lies between the evidence and the testimony regarding the sequence of events and the presence of a struggle.

From the autopsy report (Evidence 8), Dr. Grey was stabbed and then shot. The presence of a bullet hole in Maya's costume (Evidence 11) suggests that she might have been shot at close range, possibly during a struggle. However, the photos (Evidence 12 and 13) show Maya in a position that doesn't indicate a fight, and the costume is described as otherwise clean except for the blood splatters and bullet hole.

Gumshoe's testimony (Testimony 3) states that Maya attacked someone who wasn't fighting back. If the autopsy shows that Dr. Grey was stabbed and then shot, it implies a struggle, which contradicts the idea that he wasn't fighting back.

Therefore, the contradiction is between the evidence showing a possible struggle (stabbings and close-range shooting) and the testimony claiming the victim wasn't fighting back.

Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other in the given scenario. 

First, I'll review the evidence and testimonies provided to understand the context. The case involves Dr. Turner Grey's murder, and there are several pieces of evidence and testimonies from various characters. 

Looking at the testimonies, Gumshoe is recounting the events of the murder. Specifically, Testimony 3 states that the victim (Dr. Grey) took a shot but missed because they were too close. 

Now, examining the evidence, Evidence 8 is Dr. Grey's Autopsy Report. It mentions that he was shot in the forehead at point-blank range, with gunpowder residue around the bullet hole. 

Here's the contradiction: If Dr. Grey was shot at point-blank range, it means the gun was very close to his forehead when fired. This would typically result in significant gunpowder residue and possibly a burn mark around the bullet hole. However, according to Gumshoe's testimony, the victim took a shot but missed because they were too close. This implies that the gun was not close enough to cause a hit, which contradicts the autopsy report indicating a point-blank shot.

So, the evidence (Autopsy Report) and the testimony (Gumshoe's account) contradict each other regarding the distance from which the fatal shot was fired.

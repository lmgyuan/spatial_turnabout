Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I need to find which evidence and testimony contradict each other. First, I'll go through the provided information carefully.

Looking at the characters, the main ones involved are Miles Edgeworth, Dick Gumshoe, Lotta Hart, Larry Butz, and others. The evidences include various items like the attorney's badge, popper, Lotta's camera, autopsy report, lake photo, and so on. The testimonies are from different characters, each giving their account of what happened.

I need to identify a pair where one piece of evidence directly contradicts a testimony. Let's start by examining the testimonies and see if any of them clash with the evidence provided.

Testimony 0 from Edgeworth mentions that he threw something at Mr. Yogi to stop the argument, and then there was a single gunshot. However, looking at the evidence, Evidence 18 states that in the DL-6 Incident, the murder weapon was fired twice. This seems contradictory because if there was only one gunshot according to Edgeworth's testimony, but the evidence suggests two shots were fired, that creates a contradiction.

Another point to consider is Testimony 5 where Edgeworth mentions hearing a single gunshot, which aligns with the contradiction since the evidence indicates two shots. This further supports the idea that there's a discrepancy between the testimony and the evidence.

I should also check other testimonies and evidence to ensure there aren't more contradictions, but based on the information provided, the most direct contradiction is between Testimony 5 and Evidence 18.

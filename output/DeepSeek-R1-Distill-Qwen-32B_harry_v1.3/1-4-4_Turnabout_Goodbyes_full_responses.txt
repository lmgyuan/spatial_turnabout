Alright, let me try to figure out which evidence and testimony contradict each other in this case. 

First, I need to understand the scenario. There's a murder case involving Robert Hammond, and the key pieces of evidence and testimonies provided need to be analyzed for contradictions.

Looking at the characters involved, we have Maya Fey, Miles Edgeworth, Dick Gumshoe, Lotta Hart, Larry Butz, Marvin Grossberg, Robert Hammond, Misty Fey, Gregory Edgeworth, Manfred von Karma, and Yanni Yogi. 

The evidence list includes items like the Attorney's Badge, Popper, Lotta's Camera, Autopsy Report, Lake Photo, Gourdy Article, Misty Fey's Photo, Edgeworth's Request, Overhead Map, Pistol Bullet, Pistol, Lotta's Deposition, Missile, Fishing Pole, Metal Detector, Air Tank, Second Lake Photo, Parrot, DL-6 Case File, DL-6 Incident Photo, Letter from the Safe, and DL-6 Bullet.

The testimonies are from Lotta Hart and Larry Butz. 

Let's break down the testimonies:

- **Testimony 0 (Lotta Hart):** She claims she's not a research student but an investigative photographer aiming to capture the supposed monster at Gourd Lake. She was camping out by the lake to photograph shooting stars and was watching the lake when she heard gunshots.

- **Testimony 1 (Lotta Hart):** She heard two gunshots just after midnight on 12/25 and took pictures automatically.

- **Testimony 2 (Lotta Hart):** She saw a flash near one of the men's hands and another gunshot.

- **Testimony 3 (Larry Butz):** He was on the lake in a boat, heard a "bang," looked out, didn't see the boat, and then went home after hearing the gunshot.

Now, looking at the evidence:

- **Evidence 4 (Lake Photo):** Taken automatically on 12/25 at 12:15 AM, showing a person firing a gun at another, but faces are unclear due to fog.

- **Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo):** Shows an empty lake, taken at 11:50 PM on 12/24.

- **Evidence 11 (Lotta's Deposition):** She heard two gunshots after midnight on 12/25.

- **Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo):** This photo shows the lake empty at 11:50 PM on 12/24, which is before the time of the supposed incident.

Now, looking for contradictions:

1. **Testimony 4 (Larry Butz):** He heard a single gunshot, while Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) mentions two gunshots. This could be a contradiction regarding the number of shots heard.

2. **Testimony 2 (Lotta Hart):** She mentions seeing a flash and another gunshot, aligning with her deposition of two shots. But Larry Butz only heard one gunshot, which contradicts the number of shots.

3. **Evidence 16 (Second Lake Photo):** Taken at 11:50 PM on 12/24, shows an empty lake. If the incident happened at 12:15 AM on 12/25, this photo might not directly contradict, but if Larry Butz was on the lake at 11:50 PM, it could conflict with his testimony of being there later.

4. **Testimony 3 (Larry Butz):** He was on the lake, heard a bang, looked out, didn't see the boat, and went home after hearing the gunshot. If the lake photo (Evidence 16) shows the lake empty at 11:50 PM, but the incident happened at 12:15 AM, there's a timeline inconsistency.

5. **Testimony 4 (Larry Butz):** He heard a single gunshot, while Lotta heard two, which is a clear contradiction in the number of shots.

Considering the most direct contradiction, the number of gunshots is a significant point. Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) mentions two shots, while Larry Butz's testimony (Testimony 4) mentions only one. This discrepancy suggests conflicting accounts of the event.

Additionally, the Second Lake Photo (Evidence 16) taken at 11:50 PM on 12/24 shows an empty lake, which might conflict with Larry Butz's claim of being on the lake at that time. However, the main contradiction lies in the number of gunshots heard.

Therefore, the pair that contradicts is the evidence of Lotta's Deposition (Evidence 11) and Larry Butz's testimony (Testimony 4) regarding the number of gunshots.

Okay, so I've got this problem here where I need to find a contradiction between an evidence and a testimony. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, I'll look at the characters involved. There's Maya Fey, Miles Edgeworth, Dick Gumshoe, Lotta Hart, Larry Butz, Marvin Grossberg, Robert Hammond, Misty Fey, Gregory Edgeworth, Manfred von Karma, and Yanni Yogi. Each has their own description, but I'm not sure how relevant they are right now.

Next, I'll go through the evidences. There are 22 of them, each with a name and description. I need to pay attention to the details in each evidence. For example, Evidence 11 is Lotta's Deposition where she says she heard two gunshots just after midnight on 12/25. That seems important because it's about the timing of the gunshots.

Now, looking at the testimonies, Testimony 0 to 5 are from Larry Butz. He says he was listening to an all-requests radio show on Christmas Eve, and when the DJ said "Hey! It's almost Christmas!" he heard a gunshot. This is interesting because it's about the timing of the gunshot he heard.

So, the key point here is the timing of the gunshot. Lotta's Deposition says she heard two gunshots just after midnight on 12/25. Larry Butz's testimony says he heard one gunshot at a specific moment when the DJ made a particular announcement, which was also around midnight on 12/25.

Wait, but if Lotta heard two gunshots and Butz heard one, that might be a contradiction. Unless the two gunshots were at different times, but the problem is that both are referring to the same time frameâ€”just after midnight on 12/25.

But looking closer, Lotta's Deposition is Evidence 11, and Butz's testimony is Testimony 5. So, the contradiction is that Lotta heard two gunshots, while Butz only heard one. This suggests that the number of gunshots reported by the two witnesses doesn't match.

Therefore, the pair that contradicts each other is Evidence 11 and Testimony 5.

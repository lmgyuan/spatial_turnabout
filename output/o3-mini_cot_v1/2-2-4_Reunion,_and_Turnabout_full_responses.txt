The detail about Maya's costume is conflicting. Evidence 11 states that Maya's costume was blood-splattered with a bullet hole, indicating a clear sign of violence. However, Ini's Testimony 4 mentions that Maya's costume “looked totally, like, normal.” This contradiction between the physical evidence and Ini's account is notable.

******************************
Testimony 6 states that Ini didn’t have her driver’s license so she couldn’t take over driving. However, Evidence 18 is Ini’s license photo – implying that she did indeed have a valid driver's license (or at least one is on record). This is a contradiction between the testimony and the evidence.

******************************
Evidence 18 (the License Photo) implies that Ini’s driver’s license had already been processed—so her picture was taken and officially used—yet Testimony 0 says, “Like, around that time, I was, like, really close to getting my license,” which implies she hadn’t gotten it yet. This pair contradicts each other.

Evidence 11 ("Lotta's Deposition" stating "I heard two sounds like gunshots just after midnight on 12/25") contradicts Butz’s testimony—specifically Testimony 5, where he states, "So after I heard that single gunshot I went home." This one pair shows a discrepancy in the number of gunshots reported.

******************************
Lotta’s Deposition (Evidence 11) claims she heard two sounds resembling gunshots just after midnight on 12/25. In contrast, Larry Butz’s testimony (Testimony 3) insists that he heard only a single gunshot. This discrepancy between the number of gunshots reported directly contradicts each other.

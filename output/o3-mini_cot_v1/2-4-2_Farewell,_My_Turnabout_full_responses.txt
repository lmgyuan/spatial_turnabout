Testimony 5 claims that the defendant bought the knife for the murder—implying it was deliberately acquired for the crime. However, Evidence 15 describes a knife that bears the victim’s blood and Engarde’s fingerprints, with “Gatewater” engraved on its grip (a detail suggesting it wasn’t a freshly bought, disposable weapon but one with a particular provenance related to the scene). This detail contradicts Gumshoe’s claim that the knife was deliberately purchased to commit the crime.

Evidence 2, “The Nickel Samurai,” clearly shows the costume associated with Matt Engarde’s stage persona. However, Testimony 5 (from Oldbag) states that when Engarde was seen leaving Juan Corrida’s room, he was wearing his “flashy racing jacket” instead of his iconic costume. This discrepancy between the expected Nickle Samurai outfit (as depicted in the photo) and the clothing described by the witness creates a direct contradiction.

Testimony 4 from Oldbag asserts that Engarde must’ve worn his Nickel Samurai costume when he stabbed Juan. However, Evidence 16—a Jammin' Ninja’s Button found on Engarde’s hakama—suggests he came into contact with the rival’s costume rather than exclusively his own. This discrepancy between the testimony and the physical evidence contradicts each other.

******************************
Andrews claimed in testimony 4 that she “poured myself a glass of juice” when she felt faint. However, Evidence 8 (the Wine Glass) is described as being filled with tomato juice with no indication it was ever consumed. This opposition between her claimed action and the untouched state of the juice establishes a clear contradiction.

******************************
Testimony 1 by Andrews states that she opened the guitar case, yet Evidence 7 (the Guitar Case) notes that only Juan Corrida’s fingerprints were found on it. This creates a contradiction, as Andrews’ claim implies her fingerprints should have been present.

******************************
Andrews claims in her testimony that the physical evidence—the button and the knife—confirms Matt Engarde committed the murder. Yet one of the key pieces of evidence is the wine glass (Evidence 8), which was found next to the victim and bears her own fingerprints. This contradiction is striking: while she insists that the evidence points solely to Matt, her fingerprints on the wine glass put her at the scene, suggesting her involvement and undermining her claim that only Matt’s actions are implicated.

******************************
Andrews claims in Testimony 0, "That glass of juice... I didn't really pour it for myself," implying she hadn't handled the juice personally. However, Evidence 8—a wine glass found next to the victim—is filled with tomato juice and bears Andrews' fingerprints. This creates a contradiction between her claim and the physical evidence showing her contact with the glass.

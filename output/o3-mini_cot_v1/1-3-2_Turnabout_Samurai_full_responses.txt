Evidence 5 shows a photograph of Will Powers taken at 2:00 PM at the gate, where he is seen with one leg dragging. In contrast, Testimony 7 (from Oldbag) confidently identifies Powers, saying “That man right there, and he was heading toward the studio!” The photo’s depiction of Powers’ impaired, dragging movement conflicts with the testimony’s portrayal of him purposefully moving toward the studio, suggesting a discrepancy in how his physical state (and likely his intent) is observed at that moment.

******************************
Oldbag claims in Testimony 2 that no one besides Will Powers went to the studio before the murder. However, Evidence 4—the Cardkey for Studio Employees—indicates that studio staff (such as the assistant, director, or security personnel) would be regularly accessing Studio One. This suggests that someone other than Powers likely entered the studio, contradicting Oldbag’s claim.

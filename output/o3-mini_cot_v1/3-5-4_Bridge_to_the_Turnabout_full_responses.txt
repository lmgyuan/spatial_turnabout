Testimony 1 claims that Mystic Elise struck Mystic Maya with her staff, implying that Elise was actively attacking someone. However, Evidence 9 shows the victim’s staff — the very staff carried by Elise Deauxnim when she was alive. Since Elise is the victim, her staff shouldn’t be used in an aggressive strike, which contradicts what Iris claims to have seen.

Testimony 3 asserts that “Mystic Maya stabbed Mystic Elise,” which implies that a knife was used in a direct, fatal attack. However, Evidence 19 is a dagger found lodged in a pine tree whose blood does not match that of Elise—the apparent victim. If Maya’s stab had been the fatal blow, the dagger should have shown her victim’s blood. This stark discrepancy between the claimed stabbing (Testimony 3) and the forensic results on the dagger (Evidence 19) stands as a clear contradiction.

Testimony 5 from Iris states that she used the Shichishito “to alter the way the wound looked,” implying it played an active role in staging or manipulating the fatal injury. However, Evidence 10 reveals that, although the Shichishito carries both the victim's blood and the suspect's fingerprints, it is not the murder weapon. This discrepancy between the testimony and the forensic conclusion represents a clear contradiction.

Evidence 20 states that the Stone Lantern was not lit on the night of the crime. However, in Testimony 4 Maya claims she could see a man behind her attacker "by the light of the stone lantern." This is a clear contradiction because if the lantern was not lit, it couldn't have provided any light.

******************************
Maya’s third testimony—that “the torches were lit… And the body was gone”—implies that she found no body on the scene, yet Elise’s Autopsy Report (Evidence 11) confirms that the body was recovered soon after death (describing its fall and the cause of death). This inconsistency between Maya’s account of a cleaned‐up scene and the fact that an autopsy was performed represents a clear contradiction.

******************************
Larry's Sketch (Evidence 15) shows a silhouette gliding over the burning bridge that night, suggesting someone was moving rather than being stuck. This contradicts Maya’s Testimony 0 in which she states that “Pearly was also stuck on the Inner Temple side that night!” If Pearl were stuck at the temple, she couldn’t have been seen crossing over the bridge as depicted in the sketch.

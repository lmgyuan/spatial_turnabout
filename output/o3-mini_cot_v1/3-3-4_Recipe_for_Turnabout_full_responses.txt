Armstrong claims that a mirror was placed right in the middle of the restaurant to divide it (Testimony 0), yet the crime photo (Evidence 12) clearly shows that two dining tables are separated by a folding screen rather than a mirror. This discrepancy between what was testified and what the photo depicts represents a direct contradiction.

Evidence 7 – the Scooter – was ridden by “my phony,” implying that there was indeed someone impersonating in the act. However, Testimony 6 (from Armstrong) states, “Non, z'ere was no time for a phony to do la acting,” which directly contradicts the existence or opportunity of such an impostor as suggested by the scooter evidence.

The victim's calendar (Evidence 20) clearly shows a note for a meeting with The Tiger on the day of the incident. This fact contradicts Tigre’s testimony (Testimony 1) in which he claims he was tied up doing business in his office all day. If he had indeed been in his office, he couldn’t have kept an appointment with the victim, making these two pieces of evidence mutually exclusive.

******************************
Glen's Calendar (Evidence 20) has a note that schedules a meeting with "The Tiger", implying that the victim, Glen Elg, was set to meet with Tigre. Yet Tigre’s Testimony 0 asserts, "I ain't no liar. I never met Glen Elg." This creates a contradiction between the physical record indicating a definite encounter and Tigre’s claim that such an encounter never happened.

******************************
The contradiction arises between the victim’s calendar and Tigre’s account. Glen’s Calendar (Evidence 20) clearly notes “Meet with The Tiger” for the day of the incident, which points to an appointment between the victim and Tigre. However, Tigre’s own testimony (Testimony 0) claims he was supposed to meet “wid the kid” at the restaurant that afternoon. This discrepancy shows that what the victim had scheduled for his meeting (with The Tiger/Tigre) contradicts Tigre’s claim about meeting with someone else—a kid—instead.

******************************
The Sports Paper (Evidence 3) marks out “100,000” with a crossed-out indication next to a doodle, suggesting this amount was dismissed or became irrelevant. Meanwhile, in Tigre’s final testimony (Testimony 7) he emphasizes that he was motivated solely by the desire for that very 100,000 dollars, stating, “I was after the $100,000. I didn't have no other reason to kill the guy!” This direct conflict between the implied disregard in the evidence versus Tigre’s stated motive is the contradiction.

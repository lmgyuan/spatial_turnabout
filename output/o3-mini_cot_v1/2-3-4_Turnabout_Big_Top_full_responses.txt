Evidence 15 describes the Max G. Bust as a heavy bronze statue, yet in Testimony 0 Acro claims, "I suppose I could have lifted something the size of that bust." This is contradictory because a heavy, cumbersome object like the bust would normally be beyond the lifting capability implied by his other statements.

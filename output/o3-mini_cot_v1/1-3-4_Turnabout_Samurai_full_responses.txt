Cody's Testimony 8 states that he didn't have his camera when the incident occurred, saying, "If I had my camera with me, that woulda been the time for a shot." However, Evidence 15 (Cody's Camera) tells us that he always carries it with him, which contradicts his claim of not having it.

******************************
Cody claimed in his testimony (Testimony 3) that his camera’s lens wouldn’t open in time so he missed capturing the crucial moment. However, Evidence 5 (Powers’s Photo) clearly shows a photograph taken at the correct time at the entrance, suggesting that a photo was indeed captured. This contradiction between Cody’s claim of a camera malfunction and the existence of an actual photo is significant.

Lotta claims she clearly saw Mr. Edgeworth operating the boat during the incident, effectively accusing him of being directly involved in the crime. However, the Letter from the Safe (Evidence 20) instructs someone to “Get your revenge on Miles Edgeworth” and details the set‐up surrounding the murder, implying that Edgeworth was targeted rather than acting as the perpetrator. This direct contradiction—Lotta’s eyewitness account placing Edgeworth at the scene versus a note that frames him as the intended victim—shows that these two pieces of information cannot both be true.

Evidence 2 describes Lotta's Camera as being triggered by loud noises, whereas Testimony 3 states that the camera was set up to take pictures of a meteor shower. This is a clear contradiction regarding the purpose and trigger mechanism of the camera.

Evidence 10 indicates that the murder weapon was fired three times, while Lotta’s deposition (Testimony 11) claims she only heard two gunshots. This discrepancy about the number of shots fired is a clear contradiction between the physical evidence and her testimony.

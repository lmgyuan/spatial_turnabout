Although, I was doing something else entirely for a while there. As for why I decided to formally get back into lawyering... ...let's just say there's unfinished business to take care of. Anyway, I thought I'd reminisce about my first case back on the job. And what a case it was! It happened only a few months after Athena joined our office... Special EpisodeTurnabout Reclaimed Anime cutscene Female pirate: Cap'n Orla! Ye made it just in time! ♪ Oh, we be pirates, we love to sail the seven seas. ♪ ♪ Just a bunch o' scallywags who are as free as free can be. ♪ ♪ We swim through storms and waves, all because, you see ♪ ♪ Grand treasure and adventure's waitin' just for me! ♪ July 20, 12:37 PMWright Anything Agency (Changed from [July 20, 12:37 AM [sic] Wright Anything Agency] in the original release) Phoenix: (Today is my first day back on the job as a lawyer. Putting this attorney's badge on again really makes it hit home. Boy am I pumped! Even Trucy said, \"Looking good, Daddy!\") So Athena, Apollo, what do you think of the ol' attorney's badge? Athena: Wow! This Shipshape Aquarium's show is great! I can't get enough of it! Phoenix: Um... Athena? Athena: I still can't believe they showed the Swashbuckler Spectacular on TV! Good thing I recorded this! ...Now, who's ready for another viewing! Apollo: You've already watched it five times! Let's watch something else now! Athena: How can you even suggest such a thing?! This show is therapeutic! Phoenix: (Uh, boss here, asking you guys a question...) Apollo: What's so \"therapeutic\" about watching a killer whale? Athena: What?! Don't you know anything?! Animal-assisted therapy is an established psychiatric treatment! Apollo: You're kidding. That kind of thing really exists? Athena: It's a real thing! I've been to the aquarium myself to try it, and it really helps. I still go to there every now and then to further my psychology studies. The last time I went, I saw a dolphin and an orca swimming around together! It was so-- Phoenix: Hey, do you two think you could quit goofing off and do some work for a change? Apollo: Work? But we've already cleaned the toilet... Twice. Each. ...Hey, wait a minute. Is that your badge I see? Athena: Wow! Congrats on getting your attorney's badge back, Boss! Phoenix: Thanks. Starting today, I'm officially a lawyer again! (Sheesh. Took 'em long enough to notice...) Apollo: Gee, Mr. Wright... With that badge on, you suddenly look so... capable! Phoenix: Ha ha ha. Um, thanks? (It's not like I was some lazy bum, you know!) Apollo: But what made you suddenly so fired up to get your badge back, anyway? Phoenix: Ah, well... I made a promise to a certain someone... An important promise. Apollo: What could be so important...? Phoenix: Anyway, we have three lawyers now, so we'd better start taking on lots of work! Athena: I'm all for that! Let's get this agency hoppin'! Phoenix: (Well, we have plenty of enthusiasm. All we need now are some clients... It's been eight years since I last wore this badge. I feel like a rookie all over again.) TV: ...And this just in... The owner of Shipshape Aquarium, \"Captain\" Jack Shipley... ...has been murdered. The suspect in the case is reportedly already in custody inside the aquarium. Apollo: Isn't that the aquarium we were just watching, Athena?! Athena: It is! ...I can't believe it! A murder at Shipshape Aquarium...?! But I love that place! We need to get to the bottom of this! ???: R-Really? I guess I'm in luck, then! I need Phoenix Wright to save my friend! Phoenix: (Wh-Who in the world is this?!) Um... are you a client...? Athena: Wait... That costume... It looks just like... I've got it! You must work at Shipshape Aquarium! Buckler: That's right! You min-now it! I'm Sasha Buckler! I perform like an agile catfish in our pirate show! It'll blowfish your mind! Phoenix: (\"Minnow\"? \"Blowfish\"? Those puns floundered a bit...) Athena: Hee hee! I figured out the client's identity! Chalk one up for analytical psychology! Buckler: My friend is under suspicion of murder, so I really need some help. That's why I've gotta find this \"Phoenix Wright\" guy... Phoenix: Well, I'm Phoenix Wright... And this is Apollo Justice and Athena Cykes. They're lawyers, too. Apollo: If there's anything you need, all you have to do is ask! Athena: The same goes for me too, Ms. Buckler! Buckler: Ha ha! Just call me \"Sasha.\" And I'll call you all by your first names, too, if that's all right. Phoenix, Apollo, Athena, you have to help me! Please save my friend! Phoenix: (Guess we'd better start by asking her more about her defense request.) Talk Your defense request Phoenix: Ms. Buckler-- Sasha, could you tell us more about why you need our help? Buckler: My friend is suspected of murdering the captain of Shipshape Aquarium. Phoenix: \"Captain\"? I thought the victim was the owner of the aquarium? Buckler: Yeah, well, our aquarium has a pirate ship theme. That's why we call the owner our \"captain.\" We call the employees \"crew,\" too. Phoenix: That's a pretty unusual aquarium you've got there. Buckler: Anyway, one of the crew members, my friend, is being suspected of the captain's murder. They've already decided she's guilty. I think they're going to give her the death penalty! Phoenix: Wh-What?! (What happened to \"due process\"!?) Buckler: But my friend is as sweet and gentle as a whale shark! She wouldn't hurt a guppy! I know there's no way she murdered anyone, but they won't believe me! But with a name like \"Wright,\" I figured you'd be able to help me set them straight! Apollo: Wait a minute... Don't tell me she picked you all because of a bad pun... Phoenix: Ouch. I see my reputation doesn't precede me... (But seriously. My name can't be the real reason she's here...) Why request me? (appears after \"Your defense request\") Leads to: \"What's the real reason you picked me, Sasha?\" Present Anything Buckler: Sorry. Sea creatures are the only things I know anything about... Phoenix: That's all right. Don't worry about it. (Gee, I didn't mean to put her in a funk.) Phoenix: What's the real reason you picked me, Sasha? Buckler: ...Well, to be honest, I asked a whole slew of lawyers, but they all refused. They said stuff like, \"There's no merit to taking your case,\" or \"I'm not sure I can help.\" They're all as cruel as sharks, with hearts punier than whitebait! Athena: Ooh! I can really feel Sasha's frustration! Phoenix: (With nobody on her side, she must feel all alone... But helping people like her is the whole reason I became a lawyer in the first place.) Buckler: And then I heard about a lawyer named \"Phoenix Wright.\" They say he defends clients to the end, no matter how bleak the circumstances. Phoenix: Hmm, guess my reputation DOES precede me. ...Not sure how well-deserved it is, though. Buckler: I thought to myself, if anybody can save my friend, it's you, Phoenix. Phoenix: (Quite a tall order there for a man who just got his badge back... But I don't want to let Sasha down... or her friend!) Athena: Let's help her, Mr. Wright! Let's save her friend! Phoenix: That's just what I was thinking. Sasha, we'll accept your case. Buckler: Y-You will?! Oh, thank you! You're a lifesaver, literally! Well, no time to stand around and mullet over things! I want you to meet my friend right away! Come to Shipshape Aquarium with me! Athena: You got it! Apollo: And I'll go, too! Phoenix: Sorry, but I need you to stay here and keep an eye on the office until Trucy gets back. You never know when a new client might stop by. Apollo: How come I'M the one who has to stay behind?! Phoenix: Thanks a million, Apollo. Well, ladies, let's move to the aquarium, shall we? Talk What to do Phoenix: So what do you think about this case, Apollo? Apollo: The murder of the owner of Shipshape Aquarium? ............Gah. I can't think with you looking at me so expectantly. I don't really have any ideas. Sorry I'm not any help. Athena: But you ARE a help! As long as you're the one playing officesitter, you're \"fine\"! Phoenix: Hey, there's Apollo's favorite word! I think I'll say it a few times, too. I'm fine! I'm fine! Apollo: Are you two making fun of me? Phoenix: Who, us? Of course not. (Just yanking your chain a little.) Any ideas? Phoenix: So, any ideas for us? Apollo: Well, I think you should give that Swashbuckler video a glance. Athena: Starting to become a fan, too, huh? I knew you'd like it if you gave it a chance! Apollo: It's not so much that... I just thought it might give you some leads, seeing as it's the scene of the crime and all. Phoenix: That's a good idea. I'll take a look when I get a second. Apollo: I've got nothing better to do, so maybe I'll watch it a few times myself. Phoenix: Apollo... Please try to find something better to do... Present Attorney's Badge Apollo: The return of a legendary lawyer! It's kind of exciting. Phoenix: (\"Kind of\"?) So how do I look with it? Apollo: Wow! You present that thing like a real pro! You must've done it a thousand times. Phoenix: It never really seems like enough to just have it pinned to my lapel, for some reason. Apollo: I get wanting to show it off. When I first became a lawyer, I flashed that badge left and right! Phoenix: (Uh, you still do that, actually.) July 20Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel Athena: Wow, this is gorgeous! It's just like being under the sea! Buckler: Yeah, this is the Aqua Tunnel, our pride and joy. I'm r-EEL-y glad you like it! I'm going to go on ahead and fill the detective in on your arrival. Take a look around the tunnel, and then come meet me at the pool up ahead on the right. Athena: Hey, Boss! Look at this cute little fish! Phoenix: Mmm... I bet it would be delicious grilled. Athena: Seriously? Is that really all you can think of? Phoenix: Well, I didn't get to eat lunch today-- Ooh! And here comes some grilled chicken! Athena: That's not a chicken! It's a penguin! C'mere, little cutie! ............*kree* Athena: .........It ignored me... Phoenix: Maybe it was hungry, too... Oh, look. It dropped something. Athena: Ah! It's an ad for the Swashbuckler Spectacular show! Phoenix: That penguin had a whole bunch of these stuffed in its backpack. Athena: So it's passing out flyers, huh? How cute! Phoenix: A carrier penguin that distributes flyers? ...We could use one of those for our office. Swashbuckler Flyer added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Well, can't keep the client waiting! We'd better get going. Athena: Yeah, you're right. Time to roll up our sleeves! July 20Shipshape Aquarium - ??? Phoenix: Huh? I don't see Sasha... ???: Ah! Are you two the lawyers Ms. Buckler mentioned? Athena: Detective Fulbright! Are you the lead detective on this case?! Fulbright: That's right. As long as evil exists in this world, there'll be no rest for me! And who is your sea urchin-like friend there? I don't believe we've met...? Phoenix: (Is he talking about me?) I'm the defendant's lawyer, Phoenix Wright. Fulbright: Well, I'm Detective Bobby Fulbright! People don't usually get to see this area. It's only open now because of the investigation. You two are pretty lucky to get this peek behind the scenes of an aquarium! Phoenix: Lucky... Right... (This guy is even louder than Apollo...) So, where is the suspect being questioned? And where is Ms. Buckler? ???: Here I be, me buckos! Athena: Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeek! Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Buckler: Shiver me timbers! There be one of Dread Pirate Nostache's scurvy swabs! Fulbright: I beg your pardon?! I'm not anyone's \"swab,\" \"scurvy\" or otherwise! Buckler: More shameless than a sea lion ye be, tryin' to make off with me best bucko! If ye want to pick a fight with us, ye'd best bring along an army o' great white sharks! ???: *squeek*... Fweeeeeeet! Phoenix: S-Sasha, what's going on here...? Buckler: Let me introduce you! This is the friend I was telling you about! Her name is Ora Shipley... ...but she only responds to \"Orla,\" so that's what people call her. I'm her trainer. She's the suspect in the murder, but she'd never hurt anybody. Orla: Fweet! Phoenix: SHE'S the suspect...?! Buckler: Yeah, and thank goodness you came before they put her down! I'm r-EEL-y grateful to the two of you. I just know you'll save Orla! Phoenix: ...WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Fulbright: Don't tell me you didn't even know who your client was? Athena: A-An orca is the suspect? Our client is an orca?! Is this for real?! Buckler: Oh, did I forget to mention that? Oopsie! Phoenix: (That's one VERY BIG OOPSIE!) By the way, what was with that mustache earlier...? Buckler: Oh, this be part of me costume for the Swashbuckler Spectacular! When I be wearin' the mustache, I be one of Cap'n Orla's Swashbucklers! A transformation as dramatic as a puffer fish's, wouldn't you say? Phoenix: (I don't think I would ever say that.) Athena: It's a pirate-themed aquarium, so that's why Orla is wearing a pirate hat, right? Buckler: Yup! She really loves wearing hats. She puts them on all the time. But her fake mustache keeps falling off, so that's a problem... Phoenix: I-I see... Well, why don't we start with you telling us a bit more about Orla? Talk Orla the orca Phoenix: So you're really serious about me defending Orla? Buckler: Of course I am! You're the only one who can do it, Phoenix! I heard you once questioned an animal during a trial, and that got your client off the hook! Athena: No way! You did that?! Phoenix: I, ah... might've tried something like that at one point in my career... Athena: Ooh, you're gonna have to tell me all about this later, or I'll ask Apollo for all the juicy details! Buckler: When I heard you didn't discriminate against animals, I knew you'd hear me out. Phoenix: I have to warn you, though. I don't know anything about orcas. I mean, they don't... eat people, do they...? Orla: Fweet! FWEEEEEEET! Phoenix: YIKES! (I think I made her mad!) Buckler: I won't have you talk that way in front of Orla! Orcas have feelings too, you know! Athena: Yeah, Boss! They have emotions just like we do! Phoenix: S-Sorry! (Is anger the only feeling I inspire in women?) Buckler: Don't worry. She says she forgives you! Besides, orcas are very picky eaters. Orla here only eats fish. The captain went to feed Orla this morning, and then he was found dead in this very room. Phoenix: Could you tell us more about his death? About the murder (appears after \"Orla the orca\") Phoenix: So the owner of the aquarium, Jack Shipley, was discovered murdered... Buckler: Yeah... It was about 10:10 this morning, just after the aquarium opened. A visitor was viewing the orca pool from the visitor's corridor and screamed. Phoenix: The orca pool is this tank here? Buckler: Yeah, that's right. This pool is built so that guests can see into it from the corridor on the first floor. The security guard and I heard the scream and came running into this pool room... ...where we found the captain dead at the side of the pool in his Swashbuckler costume. He was as big and tough as an ol' crocodile, the captain. I still can't believe he's dead... Athena: Mr. Shipley was very important to you, wasn't he? Buckler: Sorry. I didn't mean to get all sad goldfish on you... Phoenix: (Sad goldfish...?) Buckler: Okay. Time to snapper out of it! When it's showtime, it's time to smile! That's what the captain always said. Athena: ...By the way, do you know why exactly Orla is being accused of the crime? Why is Orla accused? (appears after \"About the murder\") Leads to: \"Can you think of any reason why Orla would come under suspicion?\" Present Swashbuckler Flyer Sasha: Do you two want to be in the Swashbuckler Spectacular? Phoenix: You have regular people participate? Buckler: Of course! We even have a special tour for people who want to be in it! Athena: What roles would we play if we said yes? Buckler: Let's see... The roles of a blue seahorse and a yellow sea slug are available! Phoenix: Judging by the colors, I must be the seahorse. Athena: A-And I'm the sea slug?! No way! I won't do it! Buckler: But sea slugs are all fluttery and beautiful, Athena! Athena: They're... beautiful? In that case, I'll do it! Phoenix: (Her mind is pretty much an open book.) Buckler: Ha ha ha! I hope we can do a show together someday! Phoenix: Can you think of any reason why Orla would come under suspicion? Buckler: The police think Orla went berserk during practice for the Swashbuckler Spectacular. But Orla would never do anything like that! Right, Orla? Orla: Fweeeeeeet! Fwee, fwee! Athena: Aw, just look at that face! Isn't she adorable! The charges just HAVE to be false! Phoenix: Hate to break it to you, but the police don't usually base its decisions on \"cuteness.\" Fulbright: That's right! We base them on facts! Take a look at this. Phoenix: (A photo of the victim, huh?) He's got a wound on his head. Fulbright: Very perceptive! The victim and the orca were the only ones here. What's more, we couldn't find a weapon of any kind around. Photo of the Body added to the Court Record. Athena: So what's the theory on how Orla supposedly killed the victim? Fulbright: They say orcas sometimes kill their prey by ramming into them underwater. We believe this orca did just that by pulling the victim into this sixty-five-foot pool... (Changed from [We believe this orca did just that by pulling the victim into this 65-foot pool...] in the original release) ...and then ramming into him while they were in the water! Phoenix: (Hmm... Without any suspects besides Orla, this could be one tough case...) Orca Pool Diagram added to the Court Record. Fulbright: No official autopsy has been ordered, but an orca attack makes sense. Phoenix: Why hasn't one been ordered? Fulbright: Accidental death due to a failure to exercise proper oversight over an animal. The medical examiner said it wasn't a homicide, so we don't need an autopsy. Athena: So Orla's going to be put down without a proper investigation?! That isn't fair! That's nothing short of police negligence, Detective Fulbright! Fulbright: The incident wasn't determined a homicide, so there's nothing we can do, Ms. Cykes! Ordinarily, the owner of the aquarium would be held responsible for the oversight failure... ...but the owner is the victim himself, so all we can do is hold the orca responsible. Buckler: Phoenix! Isn't there anything you can do?! They're going to put Orla down! Phoenix: (Sasha and Orla are depending on me. I want to do everything I can to help them! But how do I help an orca? Wait... Yes, I can do this!) Find the real killer Phoenix: ...I'll find the real killer! Buckler: Oh, thank you, Phoenix! And I'll do everything I can to help you! Fulbright: Wait just one moment! You're not a police officer or a prosecutor! You're not even officially the defendant's lawyer! You have no right to investigate! Phoenix: (I'm not officially Orla's lawyer, huh...? In that case, I know exactly what I have to do!) Leads back to: \"Yes, I can do this!\" Defend Orla in court Leads to: \"I got my badge back now, so I know exactly what I have to do.\" Set Orla free Phoenix: ...I'll set Orla free. Buckler: Okay! I'll go open the water gate! Fulbright: If you think I'll just let you set the suspect free, you've got another thing coming! Buckler: Pollocks to you, punk! Phoenix: (I guess until I can actually try to prove Orla's innocence... ...I can't truly set her free... Which means...) Leads back to: \"Yes, I can do this!\" Phoenix: (I got my badge back now, so I know exactly what I have to do.) ...I'll defend Orla in court. Fulbright: Huh? Phoenix: Even an orca deserves a fair trial. If the one responsible for Orla is dead... then I'll take responsibility for her! Athena: You'll what?! I guess doing crazy things just once in your career wasn't enough, huh? But what the heck! I'll take responsibility for her, too! Fulbright: Are you two insane?! This is a case of accidental death caused by an animal! It's not a murder case! With no evidence of foul play, this case will never go to court! Phoenix: Then let us investigate the crime scene. If we can prove this was a murder, we might be able to take it to trial. And then Orla would certainly need the help of a few good lawyers! Fulbright: Hmm... I guess so... But who's ever heard of a trial for a killer whale?! Athena: Just because it's never been done before doesn't mean we can't do it now! Fulbright: But... Hmmmmmmmmm... Athena: Please, Detective Fulbright! For justice's sake! Fulbright: ............ The police have determined that an animal that has harmed a human should be put down. But I don't know for sure whether that was a just decision... If your sense of justice compels you to take on the defense of this animal... ...then my sense of justice tells me to let this case be reexamined for possible merit! Phoenix: Y-You mean it?! Athena: Really?! That's fantastic! You're not such a bad guy after all, Detective Fulbright! Fulbright: Just remember, this case hasn't been officially recognized as a homicide yet. I'll get in touch with the prosecutor's office, but I'm not making any promises. Anyway, I'd better be off! Buckler: You two are our lifeboat! I'll be right here if you need me! Phoenix: Thanks. I've got a feeling we'll really need your help with this investigation. Athena: We're still not sure if it'll go to trial, but as Orla's lawyers, we'll do everything we can! Phoenix: To get this case into court, we'll need a prosecutor to make an indictment... ...so we have to find enough evidence to prove it's a criminal case. Athena: There just has to be something that shows the culprit was somebody other than Orla! Phoenix: Hmm... Detective Fulbright said there were no weapons in the area, other than her... ...so we'd better look for something to prove him wrong. I'd better make a note of that so I don't forget. Athena: You sure are organized, Boss! Maybe I should get a notebook of my own! Phoenix: I just like to jot down Notes on the case in the Court Record as I go along. We can use it as a sort of \"To Do\" list. Athena: Great idea! I'll add things, too. And whenever we're stuck, we can just refer to the notes! Phoenix: (To read the Notes, I just open the Court Record ([R / RB / E])... ...and then flip to them with [L / LB / Q] or [R / RB / E]. (Changed from [Then I can switch between the tabs by touching them, or with R and L.] in the original release)) There! Note jotted. Now let's investigate this crime scene. Athena: There has to be some evidence here we can use in court! Examining the crime scene from every angle is the key here! Phoenix: That's right. If we change our perspective, we might come across new evidence. Let's first see what we can find using [left analog stick / WASD]... (Changed from [To change perspectives, I can touch the arrows on the bottom screen or use [D-Pad].] in the original release) ...and when we're ready, we can use [right analog stick left/right / left/right arrow keys] to change our perspective. (Line newly added in the Trilogy release) Athena: Or, if there's a particular spot that's got your attention, get right up to it and look away! Phoenix: (Like that outline of the body in the far right there...?) Athena: Of course, talking to everybody involved is one of the keys to good investigation. Phoenix: Exactly. And if we \"Present\" items to people, we might learn even more. Athena: Right! It all boils down to thorough legwork! Well, let's get started! Examine Front side of Orla Athena: Is that show makeup above Orla's eye? Buckler: That's right. It's a starfish. Kinda makes her look like a punk-rockin' pirate, dont'cha think? Phoenix: (A punk-rock pirate killer whale...? *groan* It's official -- society's on the road to ruin.) Athena: Well, I think Orla is one hot rockfish! Speaking of rockin', how do you get Orla to do what you want during the show? Buckler: I give her signals with this whistle. Phoenix: Oh? But I didn't hear anything just now. Buckler: The sound's out of the range of human hearing, just like a dog whistle. Orcas have better hearing than people do. They can even hear the whistle underwater. Athena: That's so cool! I wish I could give commands to Orla! Buckler: Anybody can do that. All they'd have to do is learn the signals. Here, Athena. You can have one of our whistles. Consider it a present! Whistle added to the Court Record. Athena: Gee, thanks! Buckler: As for the actual commands, I'm afraid I can't teach them to you. They're top-secret. Front side of Orla (subsequent times) Athena: Is that show makeup above Orla's eye? Buckler: That's right. It's a starfish. Kinda makes her look like a punk-rockin' pirate, dont'cha think? Phoenix: (A punk-rock pirate killer whale...? *groan* It's official -- society's on the road to ruin.) Athena: Well, I think Orla is one hot rockfish! Speaking of rockin', how do you get Orla to do what you want during the show? Buckler: I give her signals with this whistle. Phoenix: Oh? But I didn't hear anything just now. Buckler: The sound's out of the range of human hearing, just like a dog whistle. Orcas have better hearing than people do. They can even hear the whistle underwater. Athena: That's so cool! I wish I could give commands to Orla! Buckler: Anybody can do that. All they'd have to do is learn the signals. Left or right side of Orla Phoenix: (Orla's not going to notice me from here. I'd better move around to the front...) Ladder Phoenix: It doesn't look like the ladder goes all the way down to the bottom of the pool. Athena: But there's usually water in the pool, so it doesn't need to. So apparently, the pool spans two whole floors. Ordinarily, visitors only get to see what they can from the first floor... ...but they said on TV that they sometimes give behind-the-scenes tours! Phoenix: Sounds likes that Swashbuckler Spectacular show you recorded is really coming in handy. Octopus Athena: Yikes! Look at that huge octopus! Phoenix: That must be a show prop, too. One of its legs is missing, though. Athena: Wouldn't it be exciting to take on a huge enemy like that?! I'd like to give it a try, myself -- as a lawyer, that is! Phoenix: (You know you have an insufficient number of limbs to out-object it, right...?) Backdrop Phoenix: A setting sun... Sunsets always remind me how quickly the day goes by... Athena: Oh, Boss! It's just a painted backdrop, you know! Phoenix: Down, Athena. Of course I know. I guess they use it for the Swashbuckler Spectacular. Athena: It looks handmade. Ooh, I just got an idea! Why don't we make our own \"not guilty\" backdrop? Phoenix: And present it to the judge when things aren't going our way? Athena: No, we put psychological pressure on the judge by hanging it behind the defendant! Phoenix: I... almost want to see how the judge would respond to that... Hoist Athena: Hey, look! There's an apparatus here to hang from. Phoenix: I don't think it's for people to hang from. It looks more like a crane to move things with. Athena: But Sasha was hanging from it during the Swashbuckler Spectacular. I bet there are all kinds of ways to use it, not just to move things. C'mon, Boss! Try thinking outside the box! Phoenix: (Is she trying to say I have a narrow-minded view of things?) Hoop or piece of meat Phoenix: There's a piece of meat and a plastic hoop suspended from the ceiling. Talk about a clashy décor. Athena: I guess Orla really likes meat. Who knew they fed her such huge chunks, though. Phoenix: Uh, all orcas are carnivores. You knew that, right? Athena: Of course, silly! And I love meat, too! Protein is your body's basic building block, after all! Phoenix: But that meat is made out of rubber. I doubt Orla could really eat it, even if she wanted to. Athena: You mean to tell me she jumps all the way up there and doesn't get her reward? The poor girl! After all that effort! Phoenix: I don't think Orla is as dumb as you think she is... Door Phoenix: The doors are slightly open, and there are police officers standing guard outside. Athena: I guess they're watching to make sure we don't try any funny business. Phoenix: Well, now that you've said it, I suddenly feel the urge to do something. Athena: How about if I suddenly break out some squat exercises? That would be pretty funny. Phoenix: Yeah... that might cause a few raised eyebrows in ways you don't want, Athena... Ball Phoenix: Oh, look. There's a ball in the water. Is that another prop for the show? Buckler: That's one of Orla's toys. She plays volleyball with it. It's usually in the bin. Guess I must've forgotten to put it away yesterday. Athena: Wow, I wish I could play volleyball with Orla! Buckler: You have as much fight in you as a mean, old lobster! I like it! There aren't many people who wanna be on the receiving end of Orla's fast ball! Athena: H-Her fast ball?! Buckler: Yeah. She likes to be naughty and slam the ball into things around the pool. You should hear the sound that ball makes when it crashes into stuff! Athena: U-Uh, well, maybe some other time...! Phoenix: (She suddenly went from \"fighting lobster\" to \"reluctant hermit crab\"...) Shark cannon Athena: Hey, there's a cannon in the shape of a shark! I'd love to try firing that thing! Boom! Phoenix: Are these cannonballs supposed to look like fish eggs or something...? Athena: Hm? But why fish eggs? Why not baby sharks? Think about how crazy it would be to have sharks go flying through the air! Watch the thrilling life-or-death struggle as the little tykes fight to stay alive out of water! I can see it now! The drama! The mayhem! The whirlwind of teeth! Phoenix: (A tornado of sharks? Not even Hollywood could conjure up something that insane.) Control panel Phoenix: Looks like the control panel for that crane apparatus. There sure are a lot of buttons... Athena: When I see this many buttons, I start to get fidgety. Phoenix: I know what you mean. You start itching to push them, right? Athena: Nah, I start itching to make a psychological study of people who want to push buttons! Phoenix: ...Need I remind you that I'm your boss, not your guinea pig? Boxes and props (from far away) Phoenix: (It's too far away to get a good look. I'd better get a little closer first.) Boxes and props (from close up) Athena: What a mess! Was all this stuff knocked over when the victim struggled with his killer? (Changed from [What a mess! Was all this stuff knocked over when the victim struggle [sic] with his killer?] in the original release) Phoenix: It's possible, but it would be hard to prove. Let's take a closer look, shall we? Boxes Athena: Look at all this stuff scattered everywhere! I see some swords! I wonder if they have anything to do with the case?! Phoenix: They're made of rubber. I doubt they could be used as a weapon. Athena: But I still bet if someone got whapped with one, it would sting quite a bit. Phoenix: ...Yeah, I guess it would. Athena: But I think I could stand the pain. Phoenix: Yeah? Good for you... (Oh, look. There's a blow-up dolphin and an anchor, too.) Athena: Mr. Wright! Are you even listening to me? Stop looking at those toys! Phoenix: (Yikes! Guess I've been caught red-faced!) Body outline Athena: Ugh. So this is where the body was found, huh? Phoenix: If they suspect Orla, maybe they found some evidence of an attack on the victim...? Buckler: Orla didn't attack the captain! She loved him! The captain rescued Orla when she was little, after she got beached on the shore. He tried to release her into the ocean, but she kept coming back. I can tell Orla's sad about losing the captain. She's just not her usual chipper self. Athena: Orla must really love this aquarium and the captain. Buckler: She's the only one around here big and strong enough to play with the big, tough captain. Every day, she made a point of head-butting him and stealing his hat. Phoenix: Yikes! I guess you weren't kidding when you said the captain was a really strong guy. Talk Why is Orla accused? Phoenix: Okay, let's run through why Orla is under suspicion one more time, shall we? Buckler: The police think Orla went berserk during practice for the Swashbuckler Spectacular. Phoenix: (No official autopsy has been ordered but the victim's head injury can be seen in the photo. The victim and Orla were the only ones here, and there was no weapon of any kind.) Athena: They think Orla dragged the victim into the pool, which is about sixty-five feet deep... (Changed from [They think Orla dragged the victim into the pool, which is about 65 feet deep...] in the original release) ...and then rammed him in the water. Buckler: But Orla would never do anything like that! You two believe me, don't you?! Phoenix: We do. We agreed to take on your case, and we'll believe in you to the very end. Athena: Great! It's all settled, then. Let's start the investigation! After examining front side of Orla, octopus, and body outline: Phoenix: I guess that's about it. Athena: Under different circumstances, I would've loved to see the Swashbuckler Spectacular... Buckler: The three of us always performed the show together -- me, Orla, and the captain... Today's show has been canceled, but we could put on a little performance for you now! We be Cap'n Orla's Swashbucklers, me buckos! We love to sail the seven seas! We've come to rout that mangy blaggard, Dread Pirate Nostache! Avast! There he be, Nostache himself! Prepare to feed the fish! Phoenix: Um... am I playing the role of \"Nostache\"? Athena: Well, Sasha has a \"stache,\" and you don't, so I guess so... Buckler: Hit 'im with yer water cannon, Cap'n, and spare no quarter! Phoenix: Aaaaaaagh! Orla: Fwe fwe fweet. Fwe fwe fwe fweeet! Fwe fwe fwe fweet fwe fwe fweet! Buckler: We swim through storms and wave all because you see... Grand treasure and adventure's waitin' just for me! Athena: Wow! That was awesome! Your performance packed quite a wallop! Phoenix: Yeah... I, for one, feel like I took quite a beating... Buckler: Sorry 'bout that! Can't have a show without a bad-guy role, right? Phoenix: But a singing orca, huh? It must've been tough to train her to do that. Buckler: That's Orla's best trick. She can only sing one song, though. Phoenix: (Well, she's still got one up on a pianist who can't play even one song...) Well, now that we've had a taste of the show, we'd better do some more investigating. Athena: Good idea. Let's go to the Aqua Tunnel! Present Whistle Buckler: Oh, have you been using the whistle I gave you? Athena: Of course! But I can't get Orla to do any tricks. Phoenix: I can't believe you can command that huge creature. That's pretty impressive, Sasha. Buckler: Pretty cool, huh? I bet there aren't too many people who can say... ...they literally get to \"whistle while they work.\" Phoenix: (That must be pretty nice for you.) Buckler: But Orla is the one who's impressive, really, not me. Athena: It's easy to see how much you care about Orla. Phoenix: You two are a good team. Athena: What...?! But you and I are a great team, right? We can top that! Wright Anything Agency: Present Whistle Apollo: What's this? Something you wear around your neck? Phoenix: It's a whistle they use to make the orca do her tricks. Athena: If I blow it at you, will you do a trick? Apollo: What am I, some kind of circus animal to you two? Phoenix: Well, you ARE one of the talents here at our Wright Anything Agency, after all. The least you could do is learn a trick or two. Apollo: Need I remind I'm a lawyer?! Besides, Athena doesn't know any tricks! Athena: Hee hee! That's what YOU think! I've got a special trick I've been waiting to bust out. I can chug an entire glass of OJ without taking a breath, all while doing squats! Apollo: Well... that's, uh, really something, Athena... Phoenix: (I don't think I want to see Athena do squats...) Anything else Apollo: Evidence...? Does this mean you want me at the defense's bench in court?! Phoenix: No. I just wanted to see what you think. Apollo: Oh. Darn... In that case, I don't think you want to hear what I think. Aqua Tunnel (before examining front side of Orla, octopus, and body outline in Shipshape Aquarium - Orca Pool) Talk What to do Athena: We have to find some evidence that shows the culprit wasn't Orla! Phoenix: You're really fired up for this, aren't you? Athena: Well, I'm getting pretty good at investigating, thanks to that last case. So I want to show you how much I've learned! Vamos a hacer esto! Let's check out the scene! Phoenix: I'm glad to see your enthusiasm, but if you run like that, you're going to fall. Athena: Aaaaaaaaagh! Phoenix: ...Too late. Any ideas? Athena: Well... I have noticed there's an amazing chemistry between Orla and Sasha. Phoenix: Not those kinds of ideas. I mean, any thoughts on the case? Athena: My thoughts are that we don't have enough information yet. That is what my heart is telling me. Phoenix: (In other words, you don't have any ideas. Got it.) Present Attorney's Badge Athena: I'm so glad you got your attorney's badge back, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Me too. I guess I was always meant to be a lawyer. I'm going to polish it up, shinier than it's ever been! Athena: I can top that! I'm going to polish mine until the finish comes off! Phoenix: Never mind. You win. Swashbuckler Flyer Athena: Ooh, the Swashbuckler Spectacular is so exciting! I could watch it a hundred times! The fierce fighting, the graceful moves! Oh, Orla and Sasha are so cool! Phoenix: If you love the show so much, why don't you try auditioning to be in it? Athena: Hey, I know! The whole office could be in it together! We could be the \"Anything Pirate Band\"! You know, from the name of the agency! Phoenix: Sounds like a pretty pathetic pirate band to me. Athena: What are you talking about?! It sounds cutthroat! It means we'd do \"anything\" to get our hands on treasure! Anything, no matter how brutal! Phoenix: Yikes. We're a brutal pirate band?! Whistle Athena: Phwiiiiip! Phwiiip, phwiiip! Phoenix: I didn't ask if you could blow it. It's such a weird whistle, anyway. It doesn't even make a proper \"whistle\" sound. Athena: Most people can't hear it, but I think I can hear it a little bit. It's like a message that only Orla's heart can receive! Aw, that's so sweet! Phoenix: It's the same idea as a dog whistle, so I wonder if dogs can hear it, too? Athena: Grr! Now you ruined it! You don't know anything about girls, do you? Anything else Athena: Oh, I get it. Your current state of mind is: \"Gather all the information we can get.\" But let's concentrate on USEFUL information from now on, okay, Boss? July 20Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel Fulbright: So you all done investigating the pool already? Phoenix: We had a good look around, but now we're moving on to other areas. Athena: How is the police investigation going? Did you -- say, for example -- find any other suspects besides Orla...? Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Wouldn't that be fortunate for you if we did? But no, I'm afraid not. And even more unfortunate for you... ...I'm afraid we found decisive evidence of the orca's guilt. Phoenix: (What?!) P-Please tell us more, Detective! Talk Proof the orca did it Athena: So what's this \"decisive evidence\"?! Don't hold out on us now, Detective Fulbright! Fulbright: I'm very sorry, but I can't share classified information with the defense. Especially not security footage that shows the moment the orca attacked the victim! Yup, I'm to personally see to it that this baby stays safe! It will never leave my side! Policeman: 'Scuse me, but there's a call for you, Detective. Fulbright: I'll be right there! Sorry guys, you know how it is! Athena: Well, he never said that HE wouldn't leave ITS side, I guess... Now, let's sneak a peek! Wh-What the--?! Phoenix: Is this supposed to be the moment Orla attacked the victim...? Security Footage added to the Court Record. Athena: This little bit of footage doesn't prove anything! Phoenix: I agree. I believe in Orla and Sasha. Let's just continue with our investigation. Athena: Good idea! ...Huh? There's a sticker on this camera that says, \"Return to the Pub O' Danger.\" Phoenix: Guess somebody there manages the cameras? Let's check it out later. Fulbright: Sorry about that. Prosecutor Blackquill called to remind me to go feed Taka. So where were we...? Oh, that's right! You two got any more questions for me? Phoenix: No, we're good. Thank you. (For leaking all your info!) Present Attorney's Badge Fulbright: So that's your symbol of justice, is it? Well, this is MINE! Phoenix: (...Wow. He can whip that badge out pretty fast...) Athena: We can top that! Take THIS! Twin attorney's badges! Fulbright: Aaagh! No fair! Two against one! Athena: No fair! Your police badge is bigger and flashier! Fulbright: What?! You dare to call me... \"unfair\"?! Me, the very model of justice itself?! Athena: Boss! I'd say we won this round! Phoenix: Athena, in this battle there are no winners... Photo of the Body Fulbright: The poor victim... It's heart-wrenching! Crime cannot go unpunished! Phoenix: We don't want crime to go unpunished, either. Athena: But we'll do our utmost to defend our client. Fulbright: Hmm. Your form of justice or mine... Which is true justice? I guess we'll see how it plays out. Athena: In other words, he doesn't have enough information right now to make up his mind. Phoenix: Thank you for the translation, Athena. Anything else Fulbright: Ha ha ha! I have NOTHING to say about that! If you're lawyers of any mettle, you'll find the answers for yourselves! After clearing \"Proof the orca did it\" Talk option in Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel: July 20Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' Danger Athena: This looks like one of those hands-on exhibits. It has a real air of danger, don't you think?! Phoenix: Well, the banner does say it's the \"PUB O' DANGER\"... Athena: Let's see. According to the description, this room is... ...\"A pub where pirates gather. Explore and interact with sea creatures! Actually feel the electricity of electric eels and feed real piranhas! Experience the terror of the seas with these dangerous experiments!\" Phoenix: All of those sounds less like \"terror\" and more like \"torture\" to me! ???: Ahem! I'd thank you to keep it down there, blue boy. I'm conducting an experiment! Do not disturb me, unless you wish to be zapped with an electric eel! Phoenix: M-My apologies, ma'am. (Wow. She seems intense...) Athena: Excuse me, but who are you? ???: Before you ask others, shouldn't you give YOUR name first? Basic manners, young lady. Athena: O-Oh, yes! Of course! My name is-- ???: Never mind. I will simply call you \"yellow girl.\" It's easier that way. DePlume: I am Norma DePlume. I am very interested in Shipshape Aquarium, and am a frequent visitor here. Athena: B-But... I don't want to be \"yellow girl\"! Phoenix: You think I want to be called \"blue boy\"? ...*sigh* Let's just see what she has to say. Talk Norma DePlume Athena: You say you're interested in the aquarium, but you don't look like a staff member. Hmm... Let's see... I got it! You're someone completely unrelated to this aquarium! Phoenix: (That's some deductive reasoning there, champ.) DePlume: I am a visitor, a patron, a customer, a guest... And what might you be? Athena: I'm not a \"what\"! I'm a lawyer! Phoenix: (Hey, that's what I was going to say!) A-And I run a law office! DePlume: Well, whatever you are, I don't have the slightest interest. Athena: Grr! Just who does she think she is, Boss?! Phoenix: \"A visitor, a patron, a customer, a guest,\" remember? Why you're here (appears after \"Norma DePlume\") Athena: I thought they closed the aquarium and weren't letting members of the public in? DePlume: Oh ho ho! But I have special permission, you see. Phoenix: And why exactly is that, if I may ask? DePlume: Well, because of the incide-- Heavens! I've said too much. 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: I-I remember this...! Psyche-Locks! Athena: Huh? Psychedelic rock? Cyborg clocks? What?! Phoenix: No, no. \"Psyche-Locks.\" It's the power of this magatama. It gives me the ability to see the secrets locked away in somebody's heart. If I can remove the locks, I can uncover their secrets. Athena: I didn't know you had a magical item like that! Phoenix: It looks like this lady knows something about what happened. I'll just use my magatama and undo her Psyche-Locks. (Huh? I can't see the locks anymore!) Athena: Huh? The color of that stone looks different from before. Phoenix: That's funny. Maybe it's just out of juice...? Athena: I-It can do that? Phoenix: Yeah. A certain girl I know poured her spiritual power into it for me. Without that power, I can't undo the Psyche-Locks. Athena: No way! DePlume: Hmph! Why do I have to keep quiet about it, anyway?! I've never been any good at keeping secrets. But I did promise after all, so I guess I had better keep my mouth shut... Phoenix: Who did you promise what to? DePlume: No comment. Now, go away! Phoenix: *sigh* Just when I thought we could find out more about the case... Athena: Let's go try to find some other way! I'm sure we'll find something! Why you're here (subsequent times) Athena: I thought they closed the aquarium and weren't letting members of the public in? DePlume: Oh ho ho! But I have special permission, you see. Phoenix: And why exactly is that, if I may ask? DePlume: Well, because of the incide-- Heavens! I've said too much. Phoenix: (Without some spiritual power, the Magatama can't help me unlock Ms. DePlume's secret. I guess we'll just have to think of some other way.) Present Swashbuckler Flyer DePlume: A Swashbuckler flyer? I have more than enough of those already. Do you have any idea how many times I've visited this aquarium?! Phoenix: (Hey, what are you yelling at me for?) Don't you ever get tired of coming here? DePlume: Hmph! You obviously don't know anything about Shipshape Aquarium. They feature different marine creatures each month, so visitors never get bored. Athena: So you're a fan of Shipshape Aquarium, like me? DePlume: Oh, please! I'm here to gather information-- the fundamental work of a great writer. But I don't suppose that's something you common folk would understand... Athena: Grr! That woman makes me so mad! Phoenix: Now, now. Why don't we \"common folk\" just get back to our investigation? Security Footage DePlume: Don't thrust that under my nose! I won't watch it! Phoenix: Are you usually pretty photogenic, Ms. DePlume? DePlume: Of course I am! I've been compared to a movie star! It's little wonder, with my perfect makeup and stylish figure. Wouldn't you agree? Phoenix: (She wants me to agree?!) Let's get a woman's opinion on this one. Athena: What? You're asking me?! Well, uh, let's see. I DO think you're very pretty, Ms. DePlume. DePlume: Hmm? I get the distinct impression your words are full of hidden meaning... Athena: Well... I wouldn't say \"full\" so much as \"full-figured\"... Phoenix: A-Athena! I'd stop right there if I were you. Anything else DePlume: I have no interest in looking at meaningless trifles. As a matter of fact, I have no interest in looking at you, blue boy. Phoenix: (What, so now I'm a \"meaningless trifle,\" too?) After clearing \"Why you're here\" Talk option in Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' Danger: July 20Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel Athena: Hey, Detective Fulbright's gone. It looks like the police investigation is over, too. Phoenix: That's too bad. I was hoping to get a little more out of him. ???: Yo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo! Cleaner? Nuh uh. Feeder? That's right! Yo girl why you hidin' from me? I'm searching all 'round like this be a bad dream. Phoenix: (Is that somebody... rapping?) ???: Rifle yo sometimes you make me so mad. But now that you're gone I'm just so sad. Yo Rifle just come back to me. We can be together and sing kree kree kree! Phoenix: What's with this guy, rapping and making strange bird sounds...? ???: Yikes! W-Who's there?! ...You didn't hear me rappin', did ya?! Phoenix: Yeah, well... Maybe... ???: Arrrrrrr! Look, just do me a favor and pretend ya didn't hear nothin'! Phoenix: Fine by us. And who might you be? Rimes: I'm Marlon Rimes. I'm an animal keeper here. But the aquarium is already closed today. Um, at least, I'm pretty sure it is... Athena: Pretty sure? You don't sound too certain... Oh! Are you new here or something? Rimes: Wow! Yeah, that's right! Pretty good guess! So who are you guys? Phoenix: I'm Phoenix Wright. Athena: And I'm Athena Cykes. We're lawyers, and we're going to represent Orla... ...by taking her case to court and proving she's innocent! Rimes: A-Are ya serious?! You wanna defend an orca in COURT?! ...Oh! But if you're here for Orla, that must make ya friends of Sasha's... Sorry if I came across rude. Phoenix: (Sounds like he's friends with Sasha.) Rimes: Sometimes when I'm by myself, I like to rap to pass the time. Especially when I'm around the animals I love. Athena: Ooh, I love animals, too! Especially marine creatures, like dolphins! Phoenix: I like marine creatures, too. (But just the ones you can eat.) Rimes: Yeah? Well, people who like animals are good people. That's what I always say! If there's anything I can do for you two, just say the word! I just started workin' here, though, so I dunno how much help I can be. Athena: Mr. Rimes seems pretty friendly. Phoenix: Yeah, friendly and agreeable. Talk Marlon Rimes Athena: So, what exactly do you do here as an animal keeper? Rimes: Mainly, I clean the place and feed the animals. Wiping all this glass takes forever! Phoenix: (I can imagine... This tunnel alone must take most of the day.) Rimes: I also prep the food the animals eat. That's the hardest part of all. Athena: You mean, it's really difficult to get the hang of? Rimes: Nah, I mean, I'm a vegetarian, so cuttin' fish and meat and stuff up creeps me out. Phoenix: Now there's something I never expected to hear from a pirate. About the murder Phoenix: Do you know anything about the incident that took place this morning? Rimes: Yeah. One of our guests saw what happened and started screamin'. I came runnin', but by the time I got there, I couldn't see the orca or the captain. Athena: Speaking of the captain... what was he like? Rimes: Like a strong captain who can turn a wild bunch of ruffians into some great pirates... He always treated us fairly and equally, human and fishes alike. The real deal, man. ...Hey! Wh-what are YOU cryin' for?! Athena: I-I'm not crying! It's just, I can feel your heart crying, that's all. Rimes: G-Girl, whatchu talkin' about?! I'm not cryin', either! Phoenix: (I guess I won't mention that his eyes are puffier than a pair of pufferfish...) Rimes: I bet Sasha and our vet Dr. Crab are even more upset by his death. Phoenix: Vet? This aquarium has a resident vet? Rimes: Yeah... Yo, hold up! I haven't seen Dr. Crab this morning. Staff are supposed to stay put. The night shift has been on duty since last night, but they won't let us go home. Sasha even had to get special permission to go out looking for a lawyer this morning. Athena: Hmm... We haven't seen anybody who looks like a vet. Rifle Athena: Were you rapping something about looking for a weapon earlier? A rifle or something...? Rimes: Ha ha ha! No, not a weapon! \"Rifle\" is the name of one of our penguins. Athena: A penguin? Why would you name a penguin something like that? Rimes: Ahoy! Yo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo! Prep for the battle, prep for the war! Little lady Rifle gon' even da score! Y'all think you can escape with your pride? Nuh uh, you just gon' be straight up denied! (Changed from [Ya'll [sic] think you can escape with your pride? Nuh uh, you just gon' be straight up denied!] in the original release) Yo! Yo! Yo ho ho! Yo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo! Anyway, that's what she's like, so we named her \" Rifle.\" Phoenix: ...Okay, but did you have to rap it? Rimes: That's just how I roll. Athena: Does Rifle wear a backpack, by any chance? Rimes: Yeah, that's the one! So you've seen her, huh? She's always runnin' away! She's such a good runner, we decided to put her to work deliverin' flyers. Phoenix: Do you really want a dangerous penguin like that running loose?! Rimes: Aw, Rifle's not dangerous. She only attacks people she doesn't like. Athena: When we ran into her earlier, she didn't attack us. She straight up ignored us, actually. Rimes: Hey, I have an idea! If you run into Rifle again, would ya mind feedin' her for me? She didn't come back to the pool at feedin' time like usual, so I've been lookin' for her. She loves the smell of fish, so she might come over to you if you have some. Athena: Ooh, I would LOVE to feed a penguin! That'd be okay, right, Boss? Phoenix: I don't mind, as long as YOU carry the fish. Fish handed over to Athena. Athena: P-U! It smells so... fishy! Phoenix: (Really? What a shocker...) Rifle (subsequent times) Athena: Were you rapping something about looking for a weapon earlier? A rifle or something...? Rimes: Ha ha ha! No, not a weapon! \"Rifle\" is the name of one of our penguins. Athena: A penguin? Why would you name a penguin something like that? Rimes: Ahoy! Yo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo! Prep for the battle, prep for the war! Little lady Rifle gon' even da score! Y'all think you can escape with your pride? Nuh uh, you just gon' be straight up denied!

Athena: Ooh, I would LOVE to feed a penguin! That'd be okay, right, Boss? Phoenix: I don't mind, as long as YOU carry the fish. Athena: P-U! It smells so... fishy! Phoenix: (Really? What a shocker...) Present Swashbuckler Flyer Rimes: With this flyer, you can get a penguin sleep mask the next time you come in. Phoenix: Oh, yeah? That would be nice, especially if it's free. Athena: That'd be perfect for taking a nap at the office after going for a run or something! Phoenix: I prefer you DIDN'T take naps at the office, actually. Rimes: Yeah, I feel ya! Sometimes I fall asleep when I'm feedin' the animals. Athena: I guess only a newbie can truly understand the feelings of another newbie! Rimes: Heh heh. We're kindred spirits, my sister. Kindred spirits. Athena: Two peas in a pod! Birds of a feather! Phoenix: I suddenly feel so alone. Fish Phoenix: Mr. Rimes, about this fish... Rimes: I'm the master keeper! No way you can beat me! You're a pro lawyer, but an amateur feeder! Ya'll [sic] ready for a feeding throw-down? Rifle c'mon! Time to defend da crown! Phoenix: ............ Uh, it doesn't look like Rifle's coming... Rimes: ............I guess not, huh? Sorry about all that \"throw-down\" stuff, then... I just wanted to show ya the inner secrets of animal feedin'. Phoenix: There are \"inner secrets\"? Rimes: You know, stuff like how to debone a fish. Great care goes into each animal's food. Then of course there's the way of tossin' the food to 'em. It's different for each one. Phoenix: ...I see. Sorry to have bothered you with mundane questions from the uninitiated. Anything else Rimes: I'm new here, so I dunno. Phoenix: (I don't really think being \"new here\" has anything to do with it in this instance...) After clearing all Talk options: Rimes: Oh, yeah. Besides Rifle, I've been lookin' for Small Fry, too. Phoenix: \"Small Fry\"? Is that another penguin? Rimes: Nah, she's a friend I made, a high-school girl. She went off lookin' for Rifle somewhere and hasn't been back. Athena: Is she... your girlfriend? Rimes: What?! Nah, no way! Sasha is the one I-- Athena: So you like Ms. Buckler, do you! Rimes: Well, I-I really respect her, ya know? We have different tastes in music, but I admire the way she lives her life! It's not like I \"like\" her. It's more complicated than that... Phoenix: (I'm pretty sure that all adds up to \"like\"...) Rimes: She tries to put on a brave face... ...but I think the captain's death is hittin' her hardest of all. After all, it was her human show partner that got killed by that orca. Athena: So you think Orla really did it? Rimes: Well, I can understand how Sasha feels... ...but she's the only one of us who doesn't think the orca did it. Athena: Oh, I see... Phoenix: (I guess it isn't easy to believe in somebody who can't even speak up for herself...) Rimes: Anyway, let me know if you see Rifle or Small Fry, okay? Small Fry said she was gonna go check the orca pool. Phoenix: Maybe we'll head back there, then. Orca Pool (before clearing all Talk options with Marlon Rimes in Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel) Present Fish Buckler: You be givin' me a fish?! So you be challengin' me to a fight, eh?! Arr! Phoenix: What?! No! What kind of rule is that?! Athena: That's how it goes in the Swashbuckler Spectacular! Present a fish. Start fighting. The gauntlet--I mean, the fish--is thrown down, and the glorious battle begins! Ooh, you're so cool when you're up there jumping and slashing! Buckler: Arr! Belay that talk, li'l lassie! Compliments will get ye naught! Athena: Ooh! You sound just exactly like a real pirate! Hee hee! Phoenix: (Athena just eats this stuff up.) July 20Shipshape Aquarium - Orca Pool Phoenix: (Huh? There's something on the left side of the pool that wasn't here before...) It looks like an electronic sword...? Buckler: Hey, you're back! Phoenix: Hi, Sasha. What's with this strange sword here? Buckler: Oh, that's a walkie-talkie. It's probably Rifle's. Athena: R-Rifle can use a walkie-talkie?! Buckler: She's always running away, so we attached a walkie-talkie to her. If we can hear the sounds around her, we can usually guess where she is. Phoenix: (But not if she drops the walkie-talkie on the floor.) Buckler: Every member of the crew has one, too, so we can communicate back and forth. We can even use them to broadcast to specific parts of the aquarium. Cool, huh? Walkie-Talkie added to the Court Record. Athena: Well, if Rifle's walkie-talkie is here, then Rifle might still be here, too! Rifle! Come out, come out, wherever you are! *SPLASH!* Athena: Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeek! Orla: Fweet? Buckler: Are you okay? You have to be careful around pools, or you might slip right in! Athena: I'm more afraid of my heart jumping right out! Phoenix: Hey, who's that riding on Orla? Isn't that Rifle? Athena: Hey, you're right! C'mere, Rifle! Rifle: ............ *kree* Athena: Argh! She ignored mem again! Why doesn't that penguin like me?! Graaaaagh! Phoenix: Now you've scared Rifle away with all that yelling... Athena: Well, I'm not giving up! I'll MAKE that penguin like me if it's the last thing I do! Anime cutscene Athena: Hey! Get back here, you little pipsqueak! Rifle: *kree!* Pearl: Oh! Sorry, Rifle. But at least you seem alright. Phoenix: (Hey... It's... It's...) Pearls?! Pearl: Oh! Mr. Nick! I haven't seen you in ages! Phoenix: (Could Pearls be the \"Small Fry\" Mr. Rimes was talking about?) Pearl: Congratulations on your return to lawyering! I've been thinking about stopping by your office for a visit to congratulate you. Phoenix: (This is Pearl Fey. I call her \"Pearls.\" She may dress a little funny... ...but that's because she's a spirit medium -- a real prodigy with great power, at that. I've known her since she was little, and she sometimes comes to the office to visit. She's just a little older than Trucy, so she's been like a big sister to her.) Pearl: I guess everyone here knows Mr. Nick, then? He's such a nice guy, don't you think? Phoenix: (...Is she trying to be MY big sister too, now?!) Talk Pearl Fey Phoenix: What are you doing here, Pearls? Pearl: My summer camp is here on a field trip. I've never been to such a big aquarium before, so I was really looking forward to it! But then that incident happened... and the police just finished questioning me. Phoenix: Oh, I see. Pearl: Um...Mr. Nick...? Who is that lady next to you...? Athena: I'm Athena Cykes! I'm a new lawyer at the Wright Anything Agency! Pearl: Oh, how do you do! My name is Pearl Fey. My cousin and my friends call me \"Pearly.\" Athena: \"Pearly\" it is, then! Nice to meet you! Pearl: So... how did the two of you meet...? Phoenix: Well, you know how I used to travel to Europe to study their legal systems, Pearls? I met Athena on one of those trips. Meeting Athena (appears after \"Pearl Fey\") Pearl: So, tell me more about how the two of you met in Europe. Phoenix: (Hey, I thought I was supposed to be asking the questions here!) Athena: A long time ago, Mr. Wright helped me out of a difficult jam. That's when I started thinking about becoming a lawyer like him. Pearl: So you're like her mentor, huh, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Yeah, something like that, I guess. Athena: Mr. Wright is the whole reason I am who I am today! He was the one who told me my knowledge of psychology could help people in court! Pearl: Gee, Mr. Nick, it looks like you've become a real adult since the last time I saw you! Phoenix: (I've always been an adult the entire time I've known you, Pearls!) Rifle: *kreeeee* Athena: Well, would you look at that! Rifle loves you! Phoenix: She sure does seem to be attracted to Pearls... Pearl: Hee hee! I'm so glad she likes me! Penguins are so adorable, aren't they! I even bought myself a little penguin calendar here at the aquarium gift shop. I have it hanging from my bag already! Athena: Oh, how cute! A calendar in the shape of a penguin! Buckler: That calendar is a real hit with all our female visitors. I even have one myself! But the rest of the staff thinks it's... too cutesy. Phoenix: I guess it doesn't really fit the whole \"rough-and-tumble pirate\" image very well... But, hmm... why does this calendar smell kind of like fish...? Pearl: Wh-What do you mean, Mr. Nick?! Please don't be rude! Phoenix: (Uh-oh. I got Pearls mad...) Calendar added to the Court Record. Meeting Athena (subsequent times) Pearl: So, tell me more about how the two of you met in Europe. Phoenix: (Hey, I thought I was supposed to be asking the questions here!) Athena: A long time ago, Mr. Wright helped me out of a difficult jam. That's when I started thinking about becoming a lawyer like him. Pearl: So you're like her mentor, huh, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Yeah, something like that, I guess. Athena: Mr. Wright is the whole reason I am who I am today! He was the one who told me my knowledge of psychology could help people in court! Pearl: Gee, Mr. Nick, it looks like you've become a real adult since the last time I saw you! Phoenix: (I've always been an adult the entire time I've known you, Pearls!) Rifle (appears after \"Meeting Athena\") Phoenix: So you were looking for Rifle, too? Pearl: That's right. I was trying to help Mr. Marlon, the animal keeper. Athena: C'mere, Rifle! C'mon! Rifle: *kree!* Phoenix: She went towards Orla instead. Athena: Grrrrr! Why can't I get Rifle to like me?! Phoenix: Maybe you should quit chasing after her with that scowl of yours... Pearl: Mr. Nick! How could you speak to a lady so rudely?! Phoenix: (Uh-oh. I got Pearls mad... again.) Why don't you try to get Rifle to take some food from you? Athena: Oh, great idea! And I have just the thing to present her, too! (Changed from [Oh, great idea! And I have just the thing to offer her, too!] in the original release) Present Attorney's Badge Pearl: Oh, I'm so happy you get to be a lawyer again, Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Ha ha. Thanks. I let our friends know I was back, too. Pearl: I wish we could all get together. It's been quite a while! Maybe we should throw you a surprise party to celebrate your comeback. Phoenix: That would be really nice. But if you tell me about it, it won't be a surprise, you know. Pearl: Oh! B-But we could spring it on you after you had forgotten, and still surprise you! Swashbuckler Flyer Pearl: I was really looking forward to seeing the Swashbuckler Spectacular... It's such a shame. Phoenix: Yeah. I bet you would've really enjoyed it. Pearl: But I was really happy to see such a large marine animal! It was quite an experience! ...I still have yet to see a blue whale, though, the largest marine animal of them all! Phoenix: Yeah, uh... I doubt there are any blue whales at the aquarium. Fish Pearl: Oh my! Did you go fishing, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: No, this is for Rifle. We were asked to feed her. Pearl: Ooh, that sounds like fun! Do you think she would take food from me? Phoenix: Oh, I'm sure she would--from you. Athena: ...So what you're really trying to say is that Rifle wouldn't take food from ME, right?! Phoenix: No, that's not what I meant. (That IS what I meant, though.) Athena: Grr! I won't be bested! Pearly, it's ON! Pearl: Wh-What? What's \"on\"? Phoenix: Now, now, Athena. Let's be adults about this. You've got poor Pearls here all confused. Fish (after clearing \"Rifle\" Talk option) Leads to: \"Rifle! I have a present for you! It's chock-filled with love! Here you go!\" Calendar Pearl: Isn't it cute? I really love this calendar. Phoenix: It's shaped like a penguin. It is pretty cute, isn't it? Maybe I should buy a calendar for the office before I leave. I always run out of room to write appointments in my planner. Athena: Why don't you just put your appointments on your phone? Phoenix: I'm not very good at using electronic devices... Pearl: Oh, neither am I. Hee hee! We have something in common! Athena: Aw, now I feel left out. Anything else Pearl: You know I'd do anything I could to help you! ...But I'm afraid I don't really know anything about that... Phoenix: That's all right, Pearls. No worries. Athena: Rifle! I have a present for you! It's chock-filled with love! Here you go! Orla: Fwee, fweet! Athena: Hey! Orla ate my love-filled fish! At least it looks like she enjoyed it, though. Orla: Fwee, fweet! Athena: I think Orla and I just had a bonding moment! Pearl: Friendship blossoming with the exchange of some food! Oh, isn't it moving, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I think \"moving\" might be going a bit far... Anyway, how did you get Rifle to come to you so easily, Pearls? I heard Rifle was attracted to the smell of fish... Pearl: M-Mr. Nick! Are you saying I smell like fish?! Phoenix: Uh, maybe just a little, yes... Pearl: Hmm... I guess I need to change my clothes... Phoenix: (That's odd... I wonder why Pearls smells like she's holding a bucket of fish...?) Buckler: Hmm... Orla doesn't usually want to eat at this time of day... And we've even been giving her more food than normal at her regular meal times lately... Talk Orla's feeding habits (Changed from [Orla's eating] in the original release) Phoenix: Is there something wrong with Orla's feeding habits lately? Buckler: Yeah, something's weird. The new guy, Marlon, feeds all the other animals besides Orla. But the captain and I, her trainer, are responsible for feeding Orla. It was the captain's turn to feed Orla this morning. Athena: But Orla keeps coming to me and signaling she's still hungry. She wants my fish, chock-filled with love! Phoenix: How long are you going to keep saying that? (She sure is excited to make a new friend.) Buckler: But I don't think the captain would've forgotten to feed Orla... Orla and Rifle Pearl: Rifle and that big creature there certainly seem to love each other! Buckler: This is Orla the orca. Rifle and Orla are best friends! They belong together like a clownfish and a sea anemone! Phoenix: (Care to phrase that in a way us non-biology majors can understand...?) Pearl: Oh! So this orca is the suspect. I-I read in a book once that orcas eat penguins...! Buckler: Don't you worry about that. Orla here's really gentle, and she never eats anything but fish. Rifle: *kree!* *kreeeee!* Orla: Fwee... Fwee, fwee... Buckler: She's an ol' sweetheart. As a matter of fact, she even tolerates Rifle picking on her! Phoenix: It's true, she does seem very gentle. She hardly seems like a \"killer\" whale... Athena: As lawyers, we have to do everything we can to save this beautiful, gentle creature! Pearl: Wow, you're going to defend her in court? She's... quite the defendant, isn't she...? Phoenix: She's the biggest defendant we've ever had. (Literally!) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: Oh, Pearls. I have a big favor to ask. Pearl: What is it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: It's about my magatama... Its spiritual power seems to have vanished. Pearl: Oh! That magatama brings back memories! I remember pouring my spiritual power into it. That was so many years ago... I guess that's why it's almost out now. ...There you go, Mr. Nick. It should be fine now. Phoenix: Thank you, Pearls! Now I can break Psyche-Locks again. Pearl: Hee hee. I'm glad I could help! Well, I think I'll go find Mr. Marlon now. I have to bring Rifle to him. Athena: Pearly sure seems right at home at this aquarium. Phoenix: Hmm, you're right. But didn't she say this was her first time here...? Buckler: Apparently, that girl was in the staff corridor earlier this morning. That's why the detective was questioning her. Phoenix: What was Pearls doing in the staff corridor? Buckler: I dunno. I thought she was Marlon's friend or something. Phoenix: The staff corridor, huh...? Something about that doesn't sit well with me... Orca Pool Diagram updated in the Court Record. Athena: Well, if it bothers you, why don't you just ask her about it? Phoenix: Yeah, good idea. Let's go catch up with her. Wright Anything Agency Present Fish Phoenix: Hey, Apollo. Think you could whip us up a little meal with these? Apollo: Fish? I haven't had fish for a while, come to think of it... ...The obvious question, though, is \"What are you doing with a bunch of raw fish?!\" Athena: It's to feed the penguin with! Apollo: Penguin?! So why are you giving it to me to cook?! Phoenix: Oh, I dunno. I just happened to think of it, and I was hungry. Apollo: Then why don't we all go out for sushi when you wrap up the investigation? Athena: Oh, you're going to treat us?! How sweet of you! I'll start with tuna! Phoenix: That's really generous of you, Apollo. Don't forget to invite Trucy, too. Apollo: ...Why did I even open my mouth? Aqua Tunnel (before clearing all Talk options with Pearl Fey and Sasha Buckler in Shipshape Aquarium - Orca Pool) Talk What to do Athena: Checking out the scene is important, but we can't forget to question people, too! We need to get some insight on how people are feeling. Phoenix: But we should give the scene another look, too, though. We might've missed something. Athena: Of course! That's one of the basic rules of investigating! \"The lawyer always returns to the scene of the investigation.\" Phoenix: Wasn't that \"The criminal always returns to the scene of the crime\"? Any ideas? Athena: There sure are a lot of interesting characters at Shipshape Aquarium! Phoenix: I'll say. It's like a wild pirate ship. Athena: I guess they really wanted to give the place an authentic piratey flavor. Like the sea-bottom Aqua Tunnel, and the Exploration Corner, \"where pirates gather\"! Widget: Arr! Let's have some fun, me hearties! Athena: Y-Yikes! Widget, you scared me! Phoenix: ...Let's save the pirate fun for AFTER the investigation, shall we? Present Fish Athena: Ugh. That smells awful! Please keep it away from me! Phoenix: But you're the one who wanted it. Why do I have to carry it? Athena: Orla sure eats a lot, doesn't she? I used to eat a lot when I was a kid. Took lots of naps, too! Phoenix: And you still take lots of naps, right here at the office. Athena: What?! You knew about that?! I-It's this new thing I'm trying out! Um... sleep learning! Yeah, that's the ticket! Phoenix: (Not buying it.) July 20Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel Phoenix: (Looks like Mr. Rimes and Pearls are talking.) Rimes: Ahoy! Based Small Fry was so clutch with the assist! Rimes n' Rifle reunion, a tale endin' in bliss! Now animal keeper Rimes ain't gonna get cut! Mad props, Small Fry, this case is now shut! Yo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo! Pearl: Hee hee. It was my pleasure. See you again sometime, Rifle! Rifle: Kree... Rimes: Okay, let's go Rifle. See ya, Small Fry! Pearl: Oh, Mr. Nick! I didn't see you there. Talk Relation to Rimes Athena: Hey, Pearly, you and Mr. Rimes seem to be really good friends. Phoenix: Could you tell us more about your relationship? Pearl: ! W-Well, I... 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Phoenix: Um, Pearls, why do I see a Psyche-Lock? Pearl: Um... I'm sorry, Mr. Nick... But I really shouldn't talk about it... Phoenix: (Hmm... I don't really feel right about digging into Pearls's affairs... But she was here at the aquarium at the time of the incident... Whatever she's hiding could help us in court! Sorry Pearls, but I'll have to use my magatama ([X / Y / R]) on you.) Present Magatama Phoenix: 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Phoenix: (A Psyche-Lock... A lock on a person's heart that only I can see... The deeper the secret is hidden, the more locks there will be. Pearls only has one lock, so I should be able to undo it fairly easily. But if I make a mistake, I'll be locked in a loop and won't be able to move forward. Okay, time to give it a try.) -- Relation to Rimes -- Phoenix: Pearls, you have to tell me about your relationship with Mr. Rimes. Pearl: \"Relationship\"? There is no \"relationship\" between Mr. Marlon and me. We're just a visitor to the aquarium and an animal keeper at the aquarium, that's all. Phoenix: But there are areas where ordinary \"visitors to the aquarium\" don't get to go... You were here before the incident occurred, weren't you? Present Staff Corridor Phoenix: Leads to: \"Yes! That's right...\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Pearl: Do you have any proof I was there? Phoenix: Proof...? No, can't say that I do... (Hmm... I'd better give it another try...) Leads back to: \"You were here before the incident occurred, weren't you?\" Pearl: Yes! That's right... ...But how did you know? Phoenix: Someone told me you were there. Pearl: I got confused and went the wrong way. I didn't know it was a corridor just for the staff. But that's all it was, Mr. Nick! It didn't have anything to do with Mr. Marlon. Phoenix: (Sounds reasonable. I guess I'd better move on to my next topic.) Actually, there's something else I've been wondering about, Pearls... Why do you smell like fish? Pearl: F-Fish? Wh-What makes you think I smell like fish? Phoenix: Well, there's a certain someone who convinced me it wasn't my imagination. Present Rifle profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"R-Rifle...?!\" Present anyone else Phoenix: Pearl: Is there something you want to say about that person...? Phoenix: Huh? Oh, I guess not... (When it comes to sniffing out the smell of fish, there's only one nose that I can rely on!) Pearls, I want you to be honest with me. Leads back to: \"Why do you smell like fish?\" Pearl: R-Rifle...?! Phoenix: She's apparently very attracted to the smell of fish. Rifle didn't want anything to do with Athena, even though she had a bunch of fish. So why then, was Rifle so attracted to you, Pearls? Pearl: Errr... I don't know... Phoenix: (Hmm... Looks like she's still not ready to talk about it.) You had an object with you that smelled fishy, too. In fact, I think this has something to do with your secret. Present Calendar Phoenix: Leads to: \"The fishy smelling calendar has something to do with your secret, doesn't it, Pearls?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Pearl: I'm sorry, Mr. Nick... ...but I don't see how that relates to me. Phoenix: (I guess that wasn't it. The key here is something that smells fishy.) Let me try that again, Pearls. Leads back to: \"In fact, I think this has something to do with your secret.\" Phoenix: The fishy-smelling calendar has something to do with your secret, doesn't it, Pearls? Pearl: A-Aaaaaaah! I... I can't lie to you, Mr. Nick... I'll tell you about me and Mr. Marlon, and about the calendar. 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Phoenix: (Whew. It was only one lock, but it sure took some work!) Relation to Rimes (after breaking Psyche-Lock) Phoenix: Please tell me about your relationship with Mr. Rimes. Pearl: I became distracted by the gift shop almost as soon as we got to the aquarium. Before I knew it, everyone else had moved on, and I got lost. I was so embarrassed to be lost at my age! Phoenix: Oh, Pearls. I know big, crowded places are hard for you. Pearl: I sort of panicked... and went down the wrong corridor. I ended up in the food prep room, and that's where I met Mr. Marlon. I really startled him when I called out to him. He jumped so much, he startled me, too, and I lost my balance and fell down. Oh, Mr. Nick! I spilled so many fish all over the floor! Phoenix: I guess that explains why you smell fishy, pardon the pun. Pearl: Yes. And my calendar fell off my bag and got buried in all the fish, too. Phoenix: (But it doesn't explain why Pearls wanted to keep it a secret.) Why did you hide it? (appears after \"Relation to Rimes\") Phoenix: Why did you want to hide your meeting with Mr. Rimes? Pearl: Well, I didn't want him to get in trouble over feed sanitation regulations because of me. And Mr. Marlon said he didn't want anyone to know he was in the food prep room. Phoenix: Huh? Why not? What was he doing in there? Pearl: Before I spoke to him, he was staring at a calendar. But, because of me, he dropped his calendar, too. We had to search for it among the fish. Athena: Wait a minute... This calendar of yours... It already has writing in it! Pearl: It does? But I didn't write anything in it yet! Athena: There's something written here under today's date. \"Meet the captain at the orca pool at 7 AM.\" Pearl: Maybe my calendar and Mr. Marlon's got mixed up? Phoenix: Pearls, about what time did you run into Mr. Rimes? Pearl: I think it was about 10:15 when he had the info desk announce that I was lost... So I must have first gone into the prep room at about 10:10. Phoenix: I see... Do you mind if I hang on to this calendar for a while? It might be a clue to the victim's movements before he was killed. Pearl: ...All right. But be sure to give it back to Mr. Marlon later, okay? Calendar updated in the Court Record. Phoenix: (Good. Now maybe I'm ready to remove Ms. DePlume's Psyche-Locks, too.) Why did you hide it? (subsequent times) Phoenix: Why did you want to hide your meeting with Mr. Rimes? Pearl: Well, I didn't want him to get in trouble over feed sanitation regulations because of me. And Mr. Marlon said he didn't want anyone to know he was in the food prep room. Phoenix: Huh? Why not? What was he doing in there? Pearl: Before I spoke to him, he was staring at a calendar. But, because of me, he dropped his calendar, too. We had to search for it among the fish. Athena: Wait a minute... This calendar of yours... It already has writing in it! Pearl: It does? But I didn't write anything in it yet! Athena: There's something written here under today's date. \"Meet the captain at the orca pool at 7 AM.\" Pearl: Maybe my calendar and Mr. Marlon's got mixed up? Phoenix: Pearls, about what time did you run into Mr. Rimes? Pearl: I think it was about 10:15 when he had the info desk announce that I was lost... So I must have first gone into the prep room at about 10:10. Phoenix: I see... Do you mind if I hang on to this calendar for a while? It might be a clue to the victim's movements before he was killed. Pearl: ...All right. But be sure to give it back to Mr. Marlon later, okay? Phoenix: (Good. Now maybe I'm ready to remove Ms. DePlume's Psyche-Locks, too.) After clearing \"Why did you hide it?\" Talk option in Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel: July 20Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' Danger DePlume: You people again? You're becoming quite the nuisance. If that veterinarian won't come out, then I might just have to give up and leave. Athena: Veterinarian...? Is that the \"Dr. Crab\" Mr. Rimes was talking about? DePlume: You are correct. He likes to shut himself up in that back room there and won't come out. But I don't think he's even in there today, so I'm about ready to go home. Phoenix: (She sure seems to know a lot about the workings of this aquarium. And maybe a little something about the incident this morning, too.) Athena: Mr. Wright! This is no time to be standing there thinking to yourself! It's time to put your psychedelic clock skills to work and uncover her secret! Phoenix: That's \"Psyche-Lock,\" Athena. \"Psyche-Lock.\" Talk Why you're here Athena: I thought they closed the aquarium and weren't letting members of the public in? DePlume: Oh ho ho! But I have special permission, you see. Phoenix: And why exactly is that, if I may ask? DePlume: Well, because of the incide-- Heavens! I've said too much. 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (All right. Now that I can see her Psyche-Locks again... ...I just have to tap my Magatama to start removing them!) Present Magatama Phoenix: 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Why You're Here -- Phoenix: Ms. DePlume, I want you to tell me the secret you're hiding. DePlume: I'll do nothing of the sort! It would mean breaking my promise. Phoenix: I don't know who you made this promise to... but you WILL tell me. You're not an aquarium employee, and yet, here you are, after the place has closed. That must mean you're connected to the incident involving the owner somehow. DePlume: Oh ho ho! I don't know anything about any \"incident\" involving the owner. Phoenix: No, I think you do. I have a piece of evidence here that suggests you DO know something. Present Security Footage Phoenix: Leads to: \"According to Detective Fulbright, this shows the orca attacking the victim.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: You won't be able to evade my question once you've seen this! DePlume: ...What is the point of showing me that, blue boy? Phoenix: Er... (I guess this wasn't it. I know I have something here somewhere that shows Ms. DePlume knows something.) ...All right, then. Let me try one more time. Leads back to: \"I have a piece of evidence here that suggests you DO know something.\" Phoenix: According to Detective Fulbright, this shows the orca attacking the victim. And the person in this footage... is wearing an outfit just like yours, Ms. DePlume. DePlume: Oh! I suppose there is no hiding this bombshell figure, is there? Yes, it is I. 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: And I think I can guess why you're here at the aquarium. You aren't simply a visitor to the aquarium; what you really are is... A police investigator Phoenix: You are a police investigator. DePlume: Oh ho ho! You're completely off the mark. I think you know full well that I am NOT a police investigator. Phoenix: (I full well did NOT know that.) Leads back to: \"You aren't simply a visitor to the aquarium; what you really are is...\" A witness to the murder Leads to: \"You are a visitor who also happened to witness the death of owner Jack Shipley.\" A Shipshape employee Phoenix: I've got it! You are... (Now, what did they call them here again...?) You're a \"crew member\" of Shipshape Aquarium! DePlume: Oh ho ho! What amusing jokes you tell, blue boy. Even a child could tell you I am NOT an employee here. And please don't call them \"crew members.\" Have you no self-respect at all? Phoenix: (Ack! All right, fine. It's not like I wanted to call them that in the first place!) Leads back to: \"You aren't simply a visitor to the aquarium; what you really are is...\" Phoenix: You are a visitor who also happened to witness the death of owner Jack Shipley. DePlume: That is cor-- Oh, I want to say it! But I promised the police... Phoenix: It's not good for you to keep things inside, you know. I'm sure you'll feel much better once you get it all out. DePlume: I-I-I... I give up! I'll tell you everythiiiiiiiiiiiiiing! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Phoenix: (If she wanted to tell me this badly, why couldn't she have just done so from the top?) DePlume: I think anyone would agree that I held it in for as long as I could! But I couldn't be expected to withstand this commoner's badgering any longer! Phoenix: P-Please calm yourself, Ms. DePlume! (And that's \"top-class badgering\" to you!) DePlume: You are correct. I witnessed the killer whale's crime with my own eyes! You got a problem with that, blue boy?! Athena: Boss, Ms. DePlume's anger is so powerful... ...even I feel like I'm about to explode! You have to do something! Quick! Phoenix: (Please don't explode on me...) Why you're here (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: Could you start with telling me what you saw? DePlume: I witnessed the very moment the killer whale attacked the victim. I told the police what I saw as well. I'm the sort of person who simply can't rest until the truth is known. Phoenix: (Hmm... So both Ms. DePlume's statement and the footage point to Orla's guilt...) Athena: Hm? Pardon me, but you seem pretty pleased that you witnessed this incident... DePlume: What? \"Pleased\"? Shame on you! Are you implying that I am happy about an innocent man's death?! Athena: N-No, of course not! I... I just don't get the sense that you were afraid of Orla. It's more like you were... interested in her. DePlume: Are you...? You know, I wasn't sure, but I was thinking that maybe... Are you perhaps one of my fans? Is that how you knew... ...that I am THE nonfiction writer, Norma DePlume?! Athena: Oh! THAT Norma DePlume! Phoenix: So... big fan, huh? Athena: No! I've never even heard of her! DePlume: Well, now that you've figured me out, there's no sense in trying to hide who I am, I suppose. Talking to fans is part of a writer's duty, after all! Oh ho ho! Athena: B-But I'm not a fan, I tell you... Nonfiction writer (appears after \"Why you're here\") Phoenix: So what exactly have you written, Ms. DePlume? DePlume: Oh, my. You mean to say you truly aren't familiar with my work? I write the truth. I take great pride in my craft, you know. I've been gathering information on Orla the killer whale for a year now. I've been very worried about Orla's violent tendencies... And today, my concern was proven to be well justified! Athena: Orla isn't violent! She's a sweet and gentle soul! DePlume: Oh ho ho! The moment you let your guard down with that killer whale... CHOMP! Shipshape Aquarium has always denied the killer whale's violent streak. But it has been rumored to attack people... Athena: But rumors are just rumors! They aren't necessarily true! DePlume: Yes, I realize that. But I only write the truth. That is why I questioned the owner directly. But he refused to allow my research, and he even had the audacity to say to me: \"You're nothing but a nuisance, coming here day after day. Don't ever come back again!\" Phoenix: (It sounds like her \"research\" was a bit too much to take...) Athena: But then... how did you get in here if you've been blacklisted? DePlume: I have my methods. Oh ho ho! Phoenix: (This lady is shameless.) Orla's violent streak (appears after \"Nonfiction writer\") Leads to: \"We won't let you speak badly of Orla! We're going to defend her!\" Athena: We won't let you speak badly of Orla! We're going to defend her! DePlume: I'm only stating what I saw with my very own eyes. I came to the aquarium today to observe the killer whale. But on my way to that thing's tank, I heard its cries. Athena: You can hear Orla from the visitor's corridor? DePlume: There are speakers there in the corridor, up near the ceiling. Apparently, that speaker is there so visitors can hear the killer whale's sounds. In any case, as I approached the killer whale's tank, I heard its cries. And when I arrived, I saw something terrifying. Phoenix: What did you see? DePlume: The killer whale stealing the Swashbuckler Spectacular hat the owner was wearing... ...and then, the moment it bit him and shook him mercilessly to death within its jaws! Athena: Wh-Whaaaaaaat?! Phoenix: Orla... bit the owner to death...?! Fulbright: In justice we trust! So I take it Ms. DePlume's just finished telling you what she saw? Phoenix: D-Detective Fulbright! I guess you've already heard it, too? Fulbright: Yup, when we took her statement earlier. As you heard, I'm afraid that accidental death is really the only thing it could be. DePlume: Yes! And a dangerous creature like that cannot be allowed to harm anyone ever again! Phoenix: B-But she's not dangerous! Fulbright: Sorry, but the Prosecutor's Office said the case didn't have enough merit to go to trial. There was one prosecutor, though, who expressed an interest in the case... Phoenix: Really?! Then could we have that prosecutor take a look at the investigation reports? Fulbright: Unfortunately, I doubt even he'd take action without evidence of a homicide... Look, I understand how you feel, Mr. Lawyer, but maybe you should give up on this one? Phoenix: Not a chance. We'll just re-examine the crime scene and strengthen our case. Fulbright: Well, if that's your version of justice, I won't stop you. Athena: And we won't rest until we find proof it wasn't \"accidental death,\" Detective! You'll see! Let's go, Mr. Wright! Time to check out that crime scene one more time! July 20Shipshape Aquarium - Orca Pool Athena: All right, then! Let's start the re-examination! Pronto! I'm going to go check out that mess in the back one more time! Phoenix: Athena! Wait! No running! Athena: Aaaaaaaaagh! Phoenix: A-Are you okay? (It didn't look like she tripped, but...) Athena: *groan* I slipped. Orla: Fweet! Phoenix: Huh? Orla? What is it, girl? Athena: Aaaaaaah! Phoenix: Athena! Are you all right?! (She crashed into all that stuff behind her.) Athena: *groan* I tried to get out of the way, but all I did was slip and fall... again... Phoenix: That was a pretty amazing wipeout. Are you hurt? Athena: I'm okay... But why did Orla spike that ball at me? After all the fish I gave her, I thought she liked me... Phoenix: Maybe she thought you were the main entrée? Athena: Very funny, Boss! Phoenix: Ha ha ha. In any case, let's give the ball back to Orla. Athena: Huh? Looks like everything got shifted around when I fell on it. Phoenix: Hey, you're right. There are things now that we couldn't see before. (Like another ball. I guess Orla really likes them.) Athena: Look! There's something new by the outline of the body, too! Phoenix: We'd better take a good look around. Examine Boxes and props Ball Phoenix: Orla sure can hit that ball hard! Athena: I didn't think she was gonna spike it at me like that. I guess that must mean she likes me! I gladly accept her expression of affection! Phoenix: ...Not how I would've interpreted that, but whatever floats your boat. Octopus leg Phoenix: Looks like we just found that giant octopus prop's missing leg. Athena: Wow. I bet you could get a whole lot of Carpaccio from a giant leg like that! Ooh, let's go to the ocean and try and catch a giant octopus of our own! Phoenix: Yeah, but even if we did catch one, how are you planning to slice it up? Athena: Kein Problem! That's what man invented chainsaws for! Phoenix: (I've never seen anyone so hell-bent on chomping down some giant octopus...)    Well, I doubt we could catch one that big anywhere near the shore, anyway... Athena: The more roadblocks you throw up, the more I want to do it, you know. Ooh, I can't wait to get started! Phoenix: (It would appear that Operation Discourage Insanity has backfired...) Footstep icons Athena: Hey, look at this mark on the floor. What do you suppose it is? Buckler: That's where we stand when we want to play volleyball with Orla. Phoenix: Volleyball, huh? Buckler: Yeah. If we stand there, she'll spike the ball right at us. Athena: So when Orla spiked the ball at me earlier... ...that was one of her tricks?! It doesn't mean she hates me?! Buckler: Nah! She wanted to play with you! She loves volleyball. She used to play with the captain all the time... Athena: Aw... Sasha looks so sad... Buckler: Okay, time to snap out of it! This is no time to be all dejected and mopey like a blobfish! Athena: That's right! Time to put on a smile and stay strong, right? Phoenix: (What's a blobfish? ...Or do I not want to know...) Bloody coin Phoenix: What's this? A coin...? Athena: M-Mr. Wright! There's blood on it! Phoenix: You're right! But it's dried. Athena: Do you think it could be the victim's? And what was it doing all the way over here in the first place? Phoenix: Hmm... I'm not sure, but now that we've found blood outside the pool... ...it just might help us prove that there's more to this case than just \"accidental death.\" Athena: Hey, you're right! Orla certainly can't leave the pool, after all! Bloodstained Coin added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Speaking of coins, take a look at this. There are a few coins around the body here, too. Athena: You're right, Boss! But where did they go? They aren't here anymore. You don't think somebody picked them up, do you? Bloody coin (subsequent times) Phoenix: What's this? A coin...? Athena: M-Mr. Wright! There's blood on it! Phoenix: You're right! But it's dried. Athena: Do you think it could be the victim's? And what was it doing all the way over here in the first place? Phoenix: Hmm... I'm not sure, but now that we've found blood outside the pool... ...it just might help us prove that there's more to this case than just \"accidental death.\" Athena: Hey, you're right! Orla certainly can't leave the pool, after all! Phoenix: Speaking of coins, take a look at this. There are a few coins around the body here, too. Athena: You're right, Boss! But where did they go? They aren't here anymore. You don't think somebody picked them up, do you? Broken sword Phoenix: There's a broken sword here. Athena: Hmm... The tip of the blade is missing. Guess it just broke off. Phoenix: (Don't tell me it happened when Athena fell over...?) Athena: You'd better not be trying to pin the blame on me, Boss! Phoenix: What?! N-No! Of course not! Athena: No use trying to hide it. It's written all over your face! Besides, the broken part isn't even here. How could it have been my fault?! Phoenix: (I'd better watch what I think or I'll get every little thing thrown back in my face.) Dummy Athena: Oh no! That child is hurt! Phoenix: What?! Call an ambulance-- Hey, it's just a dummy. Athena: I-It is?! Oh, I mean, of course it is! I was just testing your response to an emergency. Phoenix: Well, I guess we just found that you don't bluff well under pressure. Athena: Grr! I guess I'll just have to keep practicing, then! I wonder what the dummy is for, anyway? Buckler: Oh, that? We use it to train Orla. It's smaller than a human, but it does the job. Some of our tricks can be pretty dangerous, so Orla practices them on the dummy first. Phoenix: (Forget the tricks, those bite marks look pretty dangerous...) After examining footstep icons, bloody coin, and dummy: Phoenix: Hey, Sasha? Would you happen to know anything about this coin? Buckler: Oh, I guess I missed one. I just finished cleaning up the rest of them. Phoenix: You picked up all of the coins already? Buckler: That's right. After the police finished their investigation, they gave me the go-ahead. I haven't found them all yet, though. I'm still missing a few. Athena: Well, if they aren't beside the pool, maybe they're IN the pool. Let's go to that ladder over there and take a peek at the bottom of the pool, Boss! Examine Left or right side of ladder Phoenix: (I can't see anything from here. I'll have to take a look when I'm by the ladder...) Front side of ladder Bottom of pool Leads to: \"Look! I think I see something on the bottom of the pool.\" Phoenix: Look! I think I see something on the bottom of the pool. Athena: Hee hee! I knew it! Want me to go down and check? Phoenix: You can't jump in dressed like that! You'll drown under the weight of your clothes! Athena: No, I won't! I'm a pretty good swimmer, you know! Phoenix ...Be that as it may, that pool's really deep. I doubt you can hold your breath that long. But maybe Sasha can...? Buckler: Whew! Phoenix! Look at all these coins I found at the bottom! Phoenix: Thanks, Sasha. So there really were more of them down there, huh? Athena: We seem to be finding them all over. I wonder how many there are all together? Buckler: Including the ones I put away, there are three hundred of them. They're for the show. (Changed from [Including the ones I put away, there are 300 of them. They're for the show.] in the original release) Phoenix: Hmm... Sounds like they'd be heavy. Buckler: About seven pounds, I'd say. A little lighter than a stringfish. Well, I'd better go put these coins away where they belong! Athena: So, seven pounds of coins, scattered around the scene, one of them with blood on it... They have to be related to the case! Phoenix: (I wonder how the blood got on that one coin? Wait a minute. Could it be...?) Remember how Detective Fulbright said that they couldn't find a murder weapon? Well, what if these coins were the weapon? Athena: Huh? How could a little coin kill a grown man? Phoenix: Well, one coin by itself isn't much of a threat, but... Three hundred coins together could definitely be used as a weapon. All you'd have to do is... (Changed from [300 coins together could definitely be used as a weapon. All you'd have to do is...] in the original release) Freeze them Phoenix: I bet a frozen lump of coins would make for a pretty good weapon. Athena: But wouldn't it make more sense to freeze just the water into a block of ice? That way, there'd be no evidence of it ever existing once it melted. Phoenix: ...I guess you're right. (But, wait a minute. There IS another way to bundle coins together!) Leads back to: \"Three hundred coins together could definitely be used as a weapon. All you'd have to do is...\" Put them in a bag Leads to: \"If you put seven pounds of coins in a bag and swung it at somebody...\" Throw them Phoenix: I bet you could kill a man if you threw them hard enough. Athena: Hmm... I dunno about that. I think they'd just bounce off. Besides, how could you throw them that hard all at once? Phoenix: Yeah... (Wait a minute...! Maybe there IS a way to bundle them all together...) Leads back to: \"Three hundred coins together could definitely be used as a weapon. All you'd have to do is...\" Phoenix: If you put seven pounds of coins in a bag and swung it at somebody... ...it would make a pretty formidable blunt instrument, wouldn't it? It would explain how blood got on this coin. Athena: Oh, I get it! If that bag of coins is the weapon, then we can use it to prove Orla's innocence! Bloodstained Coin updated in the Court Record. Phoenix: But I don't see anything resembling a coin bag around here. Athena: Maybe the killer took it with them. Phoenix: Yeah, it would certainly make it look like Orla did it if they did... Athena: You know what I think, Mr. Wright?! The bloody coin alone should be enough to prove this might have been a murder! Phoenix: I agree. It shows the possibility of a human killer rather than Orla. Athena: Yes! This is just what we needed! Let's go show this coin to Detective Fulbright and Ms. DePlume right away! Phoenix: Good idea. Let's hope they're still at the Pub O' Danger. July 20Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' Danger Fulbright: Oh, you're back! So did you find anything? DePlume: Of course he didn't! Fulbright: Remember, even if you don't succeed, it's the effort you make that's important! Phoenix: (Is he trying to console me?) Athena: Let's show them the evidence we found! The one that points to a human culprit! Phoenix: Right. Because we won't let Orla be put down. Talk Orla's violent streak Athena: We won't let you speak badly of Orla! We're going to defend her! DePlume: I'm only stating what I saw with my very own eyes. I came to the aquarium today to observe the killer whale. But on my way to that thing's tank, I heard its cries. Athena: You can hear Orla from the visitor's corridor? DePlume: There are speakers there in the corridor, up near the ceiling. Apparently, that speaker is there so visitors can hear the killer whale's sounds. In any case, as I approached the killer whale's tank, I heard its cries. And when I arrived, I saw something terrifying. Phoenix: What did you see? DePlume: The killer whale stealing the Swashbuckler Spectacular hat the owner was wearing... ...and then, the moment it bit him and shook him mercilessly to death within its jaws! Athena: Wh-Whaaaaaaat?! Phoenix: Orla... bit the owner to death...?! Present Bloodstained Coin Leads to: \"Please take a look at this bloodstained coin.\" Phoenix: Please take a look at this bloodstained coin. DePlume: Eeeeeeeeeeeeek! C-Cease and desist, at once! Wh-What kind of a man shows a lady blood? Phoenix: Urk. (She doesn't have to get so worked up...) Fulbright: What are you terrorizing this lady with?! Come on, now. Let's see it. Phoenix: We found this coin beside the orca pool. Fulbright: We did see a large number of coins beside the pool, but not one with blood on it! Phoenix: We just learned that there's three hundred of these, weighing about seven pounds in total. (Changed from [We just learned that there's 300 of these, weighing about seven pounds all together.] in the original release) Now, what do you suppose would happen if a person was assaulted with that many coins? Fulbright: What?! So you're saying the coins might've been used like some kind of blunt weapon?! Phoenix: If the blood belongs to the victim, then yes, it's entirely possible! Fulbright: Hmm... But I wouldn't call it decisive proof that the real culprit was human... Phoenix: Y-You wouldn't?! Why not?! Fulbright: Because there'd have to be something to put the coins in to make them into a weapon. Without that \"something\", it's just not going to be enough to pass muster. But I will say that your theory does seem to warrant further investigation. I'll call the Prosecutor's Office and ask to reinvestigate from a possible criminal angle. Phoenix: ...You will?! Thank you very much! Athena: I really hope Detective Fulbright can convince them... Fulbright: Hmmmm... You won't believe the answer I got. When I explained your passion for this case, and the police's investigation... ...they said that the prosecutor I mentioned earlier would be willing to take this to court. Phoenix: Really?! So does that mean a new suspect has emerged? Fulbright: No, I'm afraid not... To be frank... ...Prosecutor Blackquill said he just wants to prove that orca's guilt in court! Athena: WHAAAAAAAT?! It's Prosecutor Blackquill that wants to prosecute Orla?! Phoenix: ...That's fine, Detective. Thanks for arranging this for us. Fulbright: Well, I must say you're taking this rather calmly. Phoenix: Defending Orla in court was my idea from the start. And I'll do whatever it takes to save her. Fulbright: Hmm... In that case, I'll do whatever I can as well to see that justice is served. Ms. DePlume, will you be a witness for the prosecution? DePlume: A trial for a killer whale? I've never heard of such recklessness before in my life! But I will reveal the truth about this killer whale, and then write all about it! Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Sounds like a plan! Now, if you'll just come along with me... We have to prepare for tomorrow, and I still have to arrange for an autopsy. DePlume: Oh ho ho! I look forward to tomorrow! Until then, blue lawyer and yellow fan. Athena: I AM NOT A FAN! Phoenix: ...Well, at least we managed to get the case to go to trial. Athena: But how in the world do we defend an orca in court, anyway? Phoenix: To be honest, I'm not really sure myself. Athena: Plus, Ms. DePlume said Orla bit the victim... This trial sure isn't going to be easy... ...but I love a challenge! Phoenix: Ha ha ha. Then we ought to be just fine. Guess I should go over that Swashbuckler Spectacular you were watching this morning. Athena: Yeah! We can have a formal viewing back at the office! Phoenix: (There's nothing decisive against Orla in the security tape, but that doesn't mean much. I'll just have to find a more concrete way to save Orla at tomorrow's trial or else!) To be continued Orca Pool (before correctly presenting Bloodstained Coin in Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' Danger) Examine Ladder Phoenix: (I guess I've seen enough of the inside the pool... [sic] but maybe just one more look.) Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: (Nothing much to see here.) Area already examined Phoenix: (I guess we already checked this out, but no harm in giving it another look.) Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I think I have enough evidence, but maybe I should do a bit more thinking first...)\nTurnabout Reclaimed Image Gallery TranscriptPart 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4July 21, 9:21 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3Athena: Good morning, Mr. Wright!Phoenix: Good morning. Chipper as ever this morning, I see.Athena: I'm just thankful we actually get to have a trial for Orla. As a matter of fact, I just ran a few laps around the courthouse to get extra pumped!Phoenix: (And I just splashed my face with some water to get the sleep out of my eyes...)Athena: Oh, I also cued the Swashbuckler video so we can watch it any time.Swashbuckler Video added to the Court Record.Phoenix: Thanks. It just might help our case. By the way, you have some serious dark circles. Did you stay up late watching this?Athena: What?! M-Me? No, I, uh, just woke up early, that's all. ...Guess I need to cover them up. I get ragged on enough as it is by Prosecutor Blackquill.Phoenix: Speaking of being pumped, I'm pretty fired up for this trial, too. It's been a while.Athena: Hee hee. That explains why your hair is spikier than usual. I mean, look at it! It's all super pokey and prickly and stuff. It's amazing!Phoenix: (...That was a compliment... right?)Pearl: Good luck, Mr. Nick! I'll be cheering you on from the gallery.Phoenix: Thanks, Pearls. It's been so long, I'm actually a little nervous.Rimes: Good morning, Mr. Lawyer!Athena: Oh, Mr. Rimes! You came to watch the trial?Rimes: Yeah. Sasha is back at the aquarium with the orca... ...so I thought I'd better come here to watch for her.Athena: Well, don't you worry! We're going to win for Orla! Isn't that right, Boss?!Phoenix: (Right. One unprecedented trial, coming right up!)July 21, 9:30 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 4Day 1Court Is Now In SessionAll RiseJudge: Court is now in session for the trial of Orla Shipley.Phoenix: The defense is ready, Your Honor.Blackquill: Hmph............ Must we waste words on this?Phoenix: (Prosecutor Simon Blackquill... Known as the \"Twisted Samurai,\" he's a prosecutor who's also a convicted felon. They say he never conducts a trial without his loyal hawk Taka by his side.)Judge: ...Mr. Wright, it's been quite a while since I've seen you like that. The lawyer image suits you. You look younger somehow.Phoenix: Thank you, Your Honor. And you look as young as ever yourself.Judge: Ha ha ha. Well, I have to keep up with you folks, after all. By the way, has the defendant arrived in court yet?Blackquill: ...Surely you jest, Your Baldness. Did you not receive the memo? The defendant, Ora Shipley, is an orca at Shipshape Aquarium.Judge: A-An orcaaaaaaaaaaaaa?! Arrangements for this trial were made only yesterday, so I didn't have time to review. But an orca as a defendant? It's patently absurd!Blackquill: Hmph......... Direct your comments to the defense. He's the absurd fellow who insisted on defending the orca in court in the first place.Phoenix: Absurd or not, I will carry out my duty to defend my client.Judge: Your duty to defend your \"crying ant\"? Don't you mean your \"crying orca,\" Mr. Wright?Blackquill: If we are to proceed, we must treat the orca as we would any other defendant. Every soul -- be it of man or beast -- is of equal value. The question is whether that soul is painted in black or white. Take Taka for example. He is as human in spirit as you or I.Taka: Screech!Phoenix: (The real question is, am I in for more pain... as always?)Judge: Hmm... Orca or not, I suppose the defendant is still a defendant. And I vow to render my verdict fairly and impartially! *ahem* Now then, Prosecutor Blackquill, your opening statement, if you would.Blackquill: I suppose I can hardly leave it to someone who knew nothing of the defendant... Very well. Listen carefully. The orca murdered the owner of Shipshape Aquarium in the aquarium's orca pool. The orca apparently toyed with the victim mercilessly as he died.Judge: A sadistic orca... What a chilling thought. And where exactly is this defendant now?Blackquill: Inside this.Judge: A-A cell phone, Prosecutor Blackquill?Blackquill: Hmph... Time marches on, Your Baldness -- with or without us. I borrowed this TV phone from the aquarium, which will allow us to interact with the orca.Judge: A \"TV phone\"? Very well. The court accepts it into evidence.TV Phone added to the Court Record.Blackquill: We will be able to view the defendant in question on this large monitor. Fool Bright, prepare for transmission.Fulbright: Ha ha ha! You've got it, Prosecutor Blackquill!Blackquill: We will proceed with the defendant on telecast.Judge: Hmm... So that is the orca that stands accused, is it?Orla: Fwee, fweet!Phoenix: (Aw. She's waving her flipper at us. Maybe she's cheering us on?)Buckler: Orla, wish Phoenix and Athena luck!Orla: Fweeeet!Judge: Oh, it's quite cute, isn't it? And this adorable creature is suspected of killing a man...?Athena: Orla's really pouring on the charm, huh!Blackquill: She is far from \"cute.\" She is a violent, reckless animal.Fulbright: That's right! The name's Bobby Fulbright, and I'll take over the explaining from here. Now, if I could direct your attention to this diagram of the crime scene. Following the report of an orca attack, we the police raced on over to Shipshape Aquarium. There, we found a guest who says she saw the orca and the victim from the visitor's corridor. As the witness was watching, the orca suddenly went crazy and attacked the victim. The orca was the only one there; therefore, no one else could have committed the crime. It's not quite finished, but I have a portion of the autopsy report here.Shipley's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record.Judge: I can't imagine the terror of being attacked underwater by such a large creature...Blackquill: But attack it did. Prepare yourself for the grisly details, Your Baldness. The prosecution moves to introduce our witness. ...Fool Bright.Fulbright: You got it, Prosecutor Blackquill! In justice we trust! One brave lady whose fine sense of justice compelled her to speak, coming right up!DePlume: How dare you make me wait? Don't you know I'm a busy woman?! I could have written an entire book for all the time I spent in that lobby!Judge: Um... Prosecutor Blackquill?Blackquill: ............Well?DePlume: I am Norma DePlume, and I'm a nonfiction writer.Phoenix: (Am I the only one who isn't telepathic here?)Athena: Looks like she can read into people's words just as well as I can read into people's hearts.Phoenix: Not everything needs to be a competition, Athena...Judge: What?! Norma DePlume?! The great nonfiction writer, Ms. Norma DePlume herself?! I've read all of your works and enjoyed them immensely. Your million seller, \"The Great Grief of the Great Thief,\" is one of my favorites.DePlume: Oh, are you a fan, Your Honor? I could give you my autograph, if you'd like.Judge: Wait a second... I could swear you looked much different in the photos in your book......DePlume: Well, I use ones from ten years ago in my books so that paparazzi won't harass me.Judge: ...!Athena: The judge seems so shocked.Phoenix: The visual disconnect must really be doing a number on His Honor's head...DePlume: Could we get started, please? If I find you to be lacking as a judge... ...you will see your debut in my books!Judge: Such harsh comments...! You really MUST be the real Norma DePlume.Phoenix: (Who knew Ms. DePlume was so famous?)Blackquill: Enough jabbering. Tell the court what you saw, and keep it brief.DePlume: I would thank you to not order me around. I am perfectly willing to tell everyone what I witnessed. It was the moment of the murder!Judge: ...Very well, then. Please proceed with your testimony.Witness Testimony-- The Moment of the Murder --DePlume: I went to Shipshape Aquarium to see the killer whale. As I was watching the killer whale from the visitor's corridor, it suddenly went crazy! I saw the killer whale bite the victim to death with its huge mouth and deadly teeth! Attempting to remain calm, I reported the incident to the police immediately.Judge: The adorable defendant really did all that?! Hmm... It must be much more vicious than it looks...Blackquill: Now, deliver your judgment so I may carry out the sentence.Phoenix:Phoenix: Umm... the defense would like to do some defending first, if that's all right...Blackquill: Hmph... Must you drag this out with your tomfoolery?Athena:Athena: The defense always has the right to cross-examine the witness, you know!Blackquill: A fellow inmate told me just this morning... \"If you want something signed, all you need is the document and a witness.\"Phoenix: ...Let me guess. They were convicted for contract fraud, right?Blackquill: ............ All we need in this case is the evidence and a witness to convict. It's as simple as that.Phoenix: (Looks like I guessed right.) Sorry, but as Ms. Cykes said... ...the defense has every right to cross-examine. Isn't that correct, Your Honor?Judge: Yes, of course. You may proceed with your cross-examination, Mr. Wright.Blackquill: .........I shall relish the sight of you thrashing around in vain.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Moment of the Murder --DePlume: I went to Shipshape Aquarium to see the killer whale.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why did you want to see the orca? DePlume: Well, it IS the featured attraction of the aquarium, after all.  Blackquill: Hmph. Why waste energy on such tripe? There is but one attraction in Shipshape Aquarium that is worth anyone's time... ...and that is the penguins. Isn't that right, Taka, my friend? Phoenix: (All righty then. I guess Prosecutor Blackquill is for the birds.)  Athena: Guess I should jot that down. Note to self: Prosecutor Blackquill is on Team Rifle. Judge: And so you went to see the orca in its tank? DePlume: Yes, that's right.DePlume: As I was watching the killer whale from the visitor's corridor, it suddenly went crazy!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The orca suddenly went crazy, did she? DePlume: Yes. It took a look at me, and then, all at once, it started going berserk! Phoenix: Did you do anything to make her angry? DePlume: I did nothing more than simply glare at it from the visitor's corridor! Phoenix: (She glared at Orla?) And that's what caused her to go berserk? Blackquill: Blackquill: The reason the defendant went mad is not the issue here. Only what she did once she entered that state. DePlume: In any case, the killer whale began behaving wildly in front of my very eyes. And then...DePlume: I saw the killer whale bite the victim to death with its huge mouth and deadly teeth!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you're saying you saw the very moment of the victim's death? DePlume: That is exactly what I'm saying! Oh, it was simply dreadful! It was as frightening as losing one's manuscript just before a deadline! Phoenix: (I suppose for a writer, that would be pretty terrifying...)  DePlume: I witnessed the killer whale's horrific act, and I knew I had to do something, so...Present Shipley's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"It would seem that you are mistaken, Ms. DePlume.\"DePlume: Attempting to remain calm, I reported the incident to the police immediately.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why were the police the first ones you contacted? DePlume: I was afraid if I told aquarium staff, they might try to cover it up. Of course, I immediately told aquarium security after my call to the police. I believe I deserve praise for my swift decision-making skills under pressure! Phoenix: ...Ms. DePlume is the most assertive witness I've ever seen. Athena: We'd better do our best to look like big-shot lawyers if we want to match her intensity! Phoenix: Ms. DePlume, I praise your swift decision-making skills under pressure! Athena: That was more \"kiss up\" than \"big shot\"... Judge: I suppose it was unrealistic to expect \"big shot\" from Mr. Wright... Blackquill: Hmph. How fitting for a small fry to praise a big shot. Phoenix: (How about cutting this small fry some slack, you big meanies?)Phoenix: (The important thing here is, did she really see the \"moment of the murder\"?)Athena: You're raring to go, aren't you, Mr. Wright? I see it in your eyes... and in your heart!Phoenix: Ha ha ha. I guess I really am a lawyer at heart.\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Athena Cykes\nDescription: A new lawyer at my agency.

Although, I was doing something else entirely for a while there. As for why I decided to formally get back into lawyering... ...let's just say there's unfinished business to take care of. Anyway, I thought I'd reminisce about my first case back on the job. And what a case it was! It happened only a few months after Athena joined our office... Special EpisodeTurnabout Reclaimed Anime cutscene Female pirate: Cap'n Orla! Ye made it just in time! ♪ Oh, we be pirates, we love to sail the seven seas. ♪ ♪ Just a bunch o' scallywags who are as free as free can be. ♪ ♪ We swim through storms and waves, all because, you see ♪ ♪ Grand treasure and adventure's waitin' just for me! ♪ July 20, 12:37 PMWright Anything Agency (Changed from [July 20, 12:37 AM [sic] Wright Anything Agency] in the original release) Phoenix: (Today is my first day back on the job as a lawyer. Putting this attorney's badge on again really makes it hit home. Boy am I pumped! Even Trucy said, \"Looking good, Daddy!\") So Athena, Apollo, what do you think of the ol' attorney's badge? Athena: Wow! This Shipshape Aquarium's show is great! I can't get enough of it! Phoenix: Um... Athena? Athena: I still can't believe they showed the Swashbuckler Spectacular on TV! Good thing I recorded this! ...Now, who's ready for another viewing! Apollo: You've already watched it five times! Let's watch something else now! Athena: How can you even suggest such a thing?! This show is therapeutic! Phoenix: (Uh, boss here, asking you guys a question...) Apollo: What's so \"therapeutic\" about watching a killer whale? Athena: What?! Don't you know anything?! Animal-assisted therapy is an established psychiatric treatment! Apollo: You're kidding. That kind of thing really exists? Athena: It's a real thing! I've been to the aquarium myself to try it, and it really helps. I still go to there every now and then to further my psychology studies. The last time I went, I saw a dolphin and an orca swimming around together! It was so-- Phoenix: Hey, do you two think you could quit goofing off and do some work for a change? Apollo: Work? But we've already cleaned the toilet... Twice. Each. ...Hey, wait a minute. Is that your badge I see? Athena: Wow! Congrats on getting your attorney's badge back, Boss! Phoenix: Thanks. Starting today, I'm officially a lawyer again! (Sheesh. Took 'em long enough to notice...) Apollo: Gee, Mr. Wright... With that badge on, you suddenly look so... capable! Phoenix: Ha ha ha. Um, thanks? (It's not like I was some lazy bum, you know!) Apollo: But what made you suddenly so fired up to get your badge back, anyway? Phoenix: Ah, well... I made a promise to a certain someone... An important promise. Apollo: What could be so important...? Phoenix: Anyway, we have three lawyers now, so we'd better start taking on lots of work! Athena: I'm all for that! Let's get this agency hoppin'! Phoenix: (Well, we have plenty of enthusiasm. All we need now are some clients... It's been eight years since I last wore this badge. I feel like a rookie all over again.) TV: ...And this just in... The owner of Shipshape Aquarium, \"Captain\" Jack Shipley... ...has been murdered. The suspect in the case is reportedly already in custody inside the aquarium. Apollo: Isn't that the aquarium we were just watching, Athena?! Athena: It is! ...I can't believe it! A murder at Shipshape Aquarium...?! But I love that place! We need to get to the bottom of this! ???: R-Really? I guess I'm in luck, then! I need Phoenix Wright to save my friend! Phoenix: (Wh-Who in the world is this?!) Um... are you a client...? Athena: Wait... That costume... It looks just like... I've got it! You must work at Shipshape Aquarium! Buckler: That's right! You min-now it! I'm Sasha Buckler! I perform like an agile catfish in our pirate show! It'll blowfish your mind! Phoenix: (\"Minnow\"? \"Blowfish\"? Those puns floundered a bit...) Athena: Hee hee! I figured out the client's identity! Chalk one up for analytical psychology! Buckler: My friend is under suspicion of murder, so I really need some help. That's why I've gotta find this \"Phoenix Wright\" guy... Phoenix: Well, I'm Phoenix Wright... And this is Apollo Justice and Athena Cykes. They're lawyers, too. Apollo: If there's anything you need, all you have to do is ask! Athena: The same goes for me too, Ms. Buckler! Buckler: Ha ha! Just call me \"Sasha.\" And I'll call you all by your first names, too, if that's all right. Phoenix, Apollo, Athena, you have to help me! Please save my friend! Phoenix: (Guess we'd better start by asking her more about her defense request.) Talk Your defense request Phoenix: Ms. Buckler-- Sasha, could you tell us more about why you need our help? Buckler: My friend is suspected of murdering the captain of Shipshape Aquarium. Phoenix: \"Captain\"? I thought the victim was the owner of the aquarium? Buckler: Yeah, well, our aquarium has a pirate ship theme. That's why we call the owner our \"captain.\" We call the employees \"crew,\" too. Phoenix: That's a pretty unusual aquarium you've got there. Buckler: Anyway, one of the crew members, my friend, is being suspected of the captain's murder. They've already decided she's guilty. I think they're going to give her the death penalty! Phoenix: Wh-What?! (What happened to \"due process\"!?) Buckler: But my friend is as sweet and gentle as a whale shark! She wouldn't hurt a guppy! I know there's no way she murdered anyone, but they won't believe me! But with a name like \"Wright,\" I figured you'd be able to help me set them straight! Apollo: Wait a minute... Don't tell me she picked you all because of a bad pun... Phoenix: Ouch. I see my reputation doesn't precede me... (But seriously. My name can't be the real reason she's here...) Why request me? (appears after \"Your defense request\") Leads to: \"What's the real reason you picked me, Sasha?\" Present Anything Buckler: Sorry. Sea creatures are the only things I know anything about... Phoenix: That's all right. Don't worry about it. (Gee, I didn't mean to put her in a funk.) Phoenix: What's the real reason you picked me, Sasha? Buckler: ...Well, to be honest, I asked a whole slew of lawyers, but they all refused. They said stuff like, \"There's no merit to taking your case,\" or \"I'm not sure I can help.\" They're all as cruel as sharks, with hearts punier than whitebait! Athena: Ooh! I can really feel Sasha's frustration! Phoenix: (With nobody on her side, she must feel all alone... But helping people like her is the whole reason I became a lawyer in the first place.) Buckler: And then I heard about a lawyer named \"Phoenix Wright.\" They say he defends clients to the end, no matter how bleak the circumstances. Phoenix: Hmm, guess my reputation DOES precede me. ...Not sure how well-deserved it is, though. Buckler: I thought to myself, if anybody can save my friend, it's you, Phoenix. Phoenix: (Quite a tall order there for a man who just got his badge back... But I don't want to let Sasha down... or her friend!) Athena: Let's help her, Mr. Wright! Let's save her friend! Phoenix: That's just what I was thinking. Sasha, we'll accept your case. Buckler: Y-You will?! Oh, thank you! You're a lifesaver, literally! Well, no time to stand around and mullet over things! I want you to meet my friend right away! Come to Shipshape Aquarium with me! Athena: You got it! Apollo: And I'll go, too! Phoenix: Sorry, but I need you to stay here and keep an eye on the office until Trucy gets back. You never know when a new client might stop by. Apollo: How come I'M the one who has to stay behind?! Phoenix: Thanks a million, Apollo. Well, ladies, let's move to the aquarium, shall we? Talk What to do Phoenix: So what do you think about this case, Apollo? Apollo: The murder of the owner of Shipshape Aquarium? ............Gah. I can't think with you looking at me so expectantly. I don't really have any ideas. Sorry I'm not any help. Athena: But you ARE a help! As long as you're the one playing officesitter, you're \"fine\"! Phoenix: Hey, there's Apollo's favorite word! I think I'll say it a few times, too. I'm fine! I'm fine! Apollo: Are you two making fun of me? Phoenix: Who, us? Of course not. (Just yanking your chain a little.) Any ideas? Phoenix: So, any ideas for us? Apollo: Well, I think you should give that Swashbuckler video a glance. Athena: Starting to become a fan, too, huh? I knew you'd like it if you gave it a chance! Apollo: It's not so much that... I just thought it might give you some leads, seeing as it's the scene of the crime and all. Phoenix: That's a good idea. I'll take a look when I get a second. Apollo: I've got nothing better to do, so maybe I'll watch it a few times myself. Phoenix: Apollo... Please try to find something better to do... Present Attorney's Badge Apollo: The return of a legendary lawyer! It's kind of exciting. Phoenix: (\"Kind of\"?) So how do I look with it? Apollo: Wow! You present that thing like a real pro! You must've done it a thousand times. Phoenix: It never really seems like enough to just have it pinned to my lapel, for some reason. Apollo: I get wanting to show it off. When I first became a lawyer, I flashed that badge left and right! Phoenix: (Uh, you still do that, actually.) July 20Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel Athena: Wow, this is gorgeous! It's just like being under the sea! Buckler: Yeah, this is the Aqua Tunnel, our pride and joy. I'm r-EEL-y glad you like it! I'm going to go on ahead and fill the detective in on your arrival. Take a look around the tunnel, and then come meet me at the pool up ahead on the right. Athena: Hey, Boss! Look at this cute little fish! Phoenix: Mmm... I bet it would be delicious grilled. Athena: Seriously? Is that really all you can think of? Phoenix: Well, I didn't get to eat lunch today-- Ooh! And here comes some grilled chicken! Athena: That's not a chicken! It's a penguin! C'mere, little cutie! ............*kree* Athena: .........It ignored me... Phoenix: Maybe it was hungry, too... Oh, look. It dropped something. Athena: Ah! It's an ad for the Swashbuckler Spectacular show! Phoenix: That penguin had a whole bunch of these stuffed in its backpack. Athena: So it's passing out flyers, huh? How cute! Phoenix: A carrier penguin that distributes flyers? ...We could use one of those for our office. Swashbuckler Flyer added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Well, can't keep the client waiting! We'd better get going. Athena: Yeah, you're right. Time to roll up our sleeves! July 20Shipshape Aquarium - ??? Phoenix: Huh? I don't see Sasha... ???: Ah! Are you two the lawyers Ms. Buckler mentioned? Athena: Detective Fulbright! Are you the lead detective on this case?! Fulbright: That's right. As long as evil exists in this world, there'll be no rest for me! And who is your sea urchin-like friend there? I don't believe we've met...? Phoenix: (Is he talking about me?) I'm the defendant's lawyer, Phoenix Wright. Fulbright: Well, I'm Detective Bobby Fulbright! People don't usually get to see this area. It's only open now because of the investigation. You two are pretty lucky to get this peek behind the scenes of an aquarium! Phoenix: Lucky... Right... (This guy is even louder than Apollo...) So, where is the suspect being questioned? And where is Ms. Buckler? ???: Here I be, me buckos! Athena: Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeek! Phoenix: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Buckler: Shiver me timbers! There be one of Dread Pirate Nostache's scurvy swabs! Fulbright: I beg your pardon?! I'm not anyone's \"swab,\" \"scurvy\" or otherwise! Buckler: More shameless than a sea lion ye be, tryin' to make off with me best bucko! If ye want to pick a fight with us, ye'd best bring along an army o' great white sharks! ???: *squeek*... Fweeeeeeet! Phoenix: S-Sasha, what's going on here...? Buckler: Let me introduce you! This is the friend I was telling you about! Her name is Ora Shipley... ...but she only responds to \"Orla,\" so that's what people call her. I'm her trainer. She's the suspect in the murder, but she'd never hurt anybody. Orla: Fweet! Phoenix: SHE'S the suspect...?! Buckler: Yeah, and thank goodness you came before they put her down! I'm r-EEL-y grateful to the two of you. I just know you'll save Orla! Phoenix: ...WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?! Fulbright: Don't tell me you didn't even know who your client was? Athena: A-An orca is the suspect? Our client is an orca?! Is this for real?! Buckler: Oh, did I forget to mention that? Oopsie! Phoenix: (That's one VERY BIG OOPSIE!) By the way, what was with that mustache earlier...? Buckler: Oh, this be part of me costume for the Swashbuckler Spectacular! When I be wearin' the mustache, I be one of Cap'n Orla's Swashbucklers! A transformation as dramatic as a puffer fish's, wouldn't you say? Phoenix: (I don't think I would ever say that.) Athena: It's a pirate-themed aquarium, so that's why Orla is wearing a pirate hat, right? Buckler: Yup! She really loves wearing hats. She puts them on all the time. But her fake mustache keeps falling off, so that's a problem... Phoenix: I-I see... Well, why don't we start with you telling us a bit more about Orla? Talk Orla the orca Phoenix: So you're really serious about me defending Orla? Buckler: Of course I am! You're the only one who can do it, Phoenix! I heard you once questioned an animal during a trial, and that got your client off the hook! Athena: No way! You did that?! Phoenix: I, ah... might've tried something like that at one point in my career... Athena: Ooh, you're gonna have to tell me all about this later, or I'll ask Apollo for all the juicy details! Buckler: When I heard you didn't discriminate against animals, I knew you'd hear me out. Phoenix: I have to warn you, though. I don't know anything about orcas. I mean, they don't... eat people, do they...? Orla: Fweet! FWEEEEEEET! Phoenix: YIKES! (I think I made her mad!) Buckler: I won't have you talk that way in front of Orla! Orcas have feelings too, you know! Athena: Yeah, Boss! They have emotions just like we do! Phoenix: S-Sorry! (Is anger the only feeling I inspire in women?) Buckler: Don't worry. She says she forgives you! Besides, orcas are very picky eaters. Orla here only eats fish. The captain went to feed Orla this morning, and then he was found dead in this very room. Phoenix: Could you tell us more about his death? About the murder (appears after \"Orla the orca\") Phoenix: So the owner of the aquarium, Jack Shipley, was discovered murdered... Buckler: Yeah... It was about 10:10 this morning, just after the aquarium opened. A visitor was viewing the orca pool from the visitor's corridor and screamed. Phoenix: The orca pool is this tank here? Buckler: Yeah, that's right. This pool is built so that guests can see into it from the corridor on the first floor. The security guard and I heard the scream and came running into this pool room... ...where we found the captain dead at the side of the pool in his Swashbuckler costume. He was as big and tough as an ol' crocodile, the captain. I still can't believe he's dead... Athena: Mr. Shipley was very important to you, wasn't he? Buckler: Sorry. I didn't mean to get all sad goldfish on you... Phoenix: (Sad goldfish...?) Buckler: Okay. Time to snapper out of it! When it's showtime, it's time to smile! That's what the captain always said. Athena: ...By the way, do you know why exactly Orla is being accused of the crime? Why is Orla accused? (appears after \"About the murder\") Leads to: \"Can you think of any reason why Orla would come under suspicion?\" Present Swashbuckler Flyer Sasha: Do you two want to be in the Swashbuckler Spectacular? Phoenix: You have regular people participate? Buckler: Of course! We even have a special tour for people who want to be in it! Athena: What roles would we play if we said yes? Buckler: Let's see... The roles of a blue seahorse and a yellow sea slug are available! Phoenix: Judging by the colors, I must be the seahorse. Athena: A-And I'm the sea slug?! No way! I won't do it! Buckler: But sea slugs are all fluttery and beautiful, Athena! Athena: They're... beautiful? In that case, I'll do it! Phoenix: (Her mind is pretty much an open book.) Buckler: Ha ha ha! I hope we can do a show together someday! Phoenix: Can you think of any reason why Orla would come under suspicion? Buckler: The police think Orla went berserk during practice for the Swashbuckler Spectacular. But Orla would never do anything like that! Right, Orla? Orla: Fweeeeeeet! Fwee, fwee! Athena: Aw, just look at that face! Isn't she adorable! The charges just HAVE to be false! Phoenix: Hate to break it to you, but the police don't usually base its decisions on \"cuteness.\" Fulbright: That's right! We base them on facts! Take a look at this. Phoenix: (A photo of the victim, huh?) He's got a wound on his head. Fulbright: Very perceptive! The victim and the orca were the only ones here. What's more, we couldn't find a weapon of any kind around. Photo of the Body added to the Court Record. Athena: So what's the theory on how Orla supposedly killed the victim? Fulbright: They say orcas sometimes kill their prey by ramming into them underwater. We believe this orca did just that by pulling the victim into this sixty-five-foot pool... (Changed from [We believe this orca did just that by pulling the victim into this 65-foot pool...] in the original release) ...and then ramming into him while they were in the water! Phoenix: (Hmm... Without any suspects besides Orla, this could be one tough case...) Orca Pool Diagram added to the Court Record. Fulbright: No official autopsy has been ordered, but an orca attack makes sense. Phoenix: Why hasn't one been ordered? Fulbright: Accidental death due to a failure to exercise proper oversight over an animal. The medical examiner said it wasn't a homicide, so we don't need an autopsy. Athena: So Orla's going to be put down without a proper investigation?! That isn't fair! That's nothing short of police negligence, Detective Fulbright! Fulbright: The incident wasn't determined a homicide, so there's nothing we can do, Ms. Cykes! Ordinarily, the owner of the aquarium would be held responsible for the oversight failure... ...but the owner is the victim himself, so all we can do is hold the orca responsible. Buckler: Phoenix! Isn't there anything you can do?! They're going to put Orla down! Phoenix: (Sasha and Orla are depending on me. I want to do everything I can to help them! But how do I help an orca? Wait... Yes, I can do this!) Find the real killer Phoenix: ...I'll find the real killer! Buckler: Oh, thank you, Phoenix! And I'll do everything I can to help you! Fulbright: Wait just one moment! You're not a police officer or a prosecutor! You're not even officially the defendant's lawyer! You have no right to investigate! Phoenix: (I'm not officially Orla's lawyer, huh...? In that case, I know exactly what I have to do!) Leads back to: \"Yes, I can do this!\" Defend Orla in court Leads to: \"I got my badge back now, so I know exactly what I have to do.\" Set Orla free Phoenix: ...I'll set Orla free. Buckler: Okay! I'll go open the water gate! Fulbright: If you think I'll just let you set the suspect free, you've got another thing coming! Buckler: Pollocks to you, punk! Phoenix: (I guess until I can actually try to prove Orla's innocence... ...I can't truly set her free... Which means...) Leads back to: \"Yes, I can do this!\" Phoenix: (I got my badge back now, so I know exactly what I have to do.) ...I'll defend Orla in court. Fulbright: Huh? Phoenix: Even an orca deserves a fair trial. If the one responsible for Orla is dead... then I'll take responsibility for her! Athena: You'll what?! I guess doing crazy things just once in your career wasn't enough, huh? But what the heck! I'll take responsibility for her, too! Fulbright: Are you two insane?! This is a case of accidental death caused by an animal! It's not a murder case! With no evidence of foul play, this case will never go to court! Phoenix: Then let us investigate the crime scene. If we can prove this was a murder, we might be able to take it to trial. And then Orla would certainly need the help of a few good lawyers! Fulbright: Hmm... I guess so... But who's ever heard of a trial for a killer whale?! Athena: Just because it's never been done before doesn't mean we can't do it now! Fulbright: But... Hmmmmmmmmm... Athena: Please, Detective Fulbright! For justice's sake! Fulbright: ............ The police have determined that an animal that has harmed a human should be put down. But I don't know for sure whether that was a just decision... If your sense of justice compels you to take on the defense of this animal... ...then my sense of justice tells me to let this case be reexamined for possible merit! Phoenix: Y-You mean it?! Athena: Really?! That's fantastic! You're not such a bad guy after all, Detective Fulbright! Fulbright: Just remember, this case hasn't been officially recognized as a homicide yet. I'll get in touch with the prosecutor's office, but I'm not making any promises. Anyway, I'd better be off! Buckler: You two are our lifeboat! I'll be right here if you need me! Phoenix: Thanks. I've got a feeling we'll really need your help with this investigation. Athena: We're still not sure if it'll go to trial, but as Orla's lawyers, we'll do everything we can! Phoenix: To get this case into court, we'll need a prosecutor to make an indictment... ...so we have to find enough evidence to prove it's a criminal case. Athena: There just has to be something that shows the culprit was somebody other than Orla! Phoenix: Hmm... Detective Fulbright said there were no weapons in the area, other than her... ...so we'd better look for something to prove him wrong. I'd better make a note of that so I don't forget. Athena: You sure are organized, Boss! Maybe I should get a notebook of my own! Phoenix: I just like to jot down Notes on the case in the Court Record as I go along. We can use it as a sort of \"To Do\" list. Athena: Great idea! I'll add things, too. And whenever we're stuck, we can just refer to the notes! Phoenix: (To read the Notes, I just open the Court Record ([R / RB / E])... ...and then flip to them with [L / LB / Q] or [R / RB / E]. (Changed from [Then I can switch between the tabs by touching them, or with R and L.] in the original release)) There! Note jotted. Now let's investigate this crime scene. Athena: There has to be some evidence here we can use in court! Examining the crime scene from every angle is the key here! Phoenix: That's right. If we change our perspective, we might come across new evidence. Let's first see what we can find using [left analog stick / WASD]... (Changed from [To change perspectives, I can touch the arrows on the bottom screen or use [D-Pad].] in the original release) ...and when we're ready, we can use [right analog stick left/right / left/right arrow keys] to change our perspective. (Line newly added in the Trilogy release) Athena: Or, if there's a particular spot that's got your attention, get right up to it and look away! Phoenix: (Like that outline of the body in the far right there...?) Athena: Of course, talking to everybody involved is one of the keys to good investigation. Phoenix: Exactly. And if we \"Present\" items to people, we might learn even more. Athena: Right! It all boils down to thorough legwork! Well, let's get started! Examine Front side of Orla Athena: Is that show makeup above Orla's eye? Buckler: That's right. It's a starfish. Kinda makes her look like a punk-rockin' pirate, dont'cha think? Phoenix: (A punk-rock pirate killer whale...? *groan* It's official -- society's on the road to ruin.) Athena: Well, I think Orla is one hot rockfish! Speaking of rockin', how do you get Orla to do what you want during the show? Buckler: I give her signals with this whistle. Phoenix: Oh? But I didn't hear anything just now. Buckler: The sound's out of the range of human hearing, just like a dog whistle. Orcas have better hearing than people do. They can even hear the whistle underwater. Athena: That's so cool! I wish I could give commands to Orla! Buckler: Anybody can do that. All they'd have to do is learn the signals. Here, Athena. You can have one of our whistles. Consider it a present! Whistle added to the Court Record. Athena: Gee, thanks! Buckler: As for the actual commands, I'm afraid I can't teach them to you. They're top-secret. Front side of Orla (subsequent times) Athena: Is that show makeup above Orla's eye? Buckler: That's right. It's a starfish. Kinda makes her look like a punk-rockin' pirate, dont'cha think? Phoenix: (A punk-rock pirate killer whale...? *groan* It's official -- society's on the road to ruin.) Athena: Well, I think Orla is one hot rockfish! Speaking of rockin', how do you get Orla to do what you want during the show? Buckler: I give her signals with this whistle. Phoenix: Oh? But I didn't hear anything just now. Buckler: The sound's out of the range of human hearing, just like a dog whistle. Orcas have better hearing than people do. They can even hear the whistle underwater. Athena: That's so cool! I wish I could give commands to Orla! Buckler: Anybody can do that. All they'd have to do is learn the signals. Left or right side of Orla Phoenix: (Orla's not going to notice me from here. I'd better move around to the front...) Ladder Phoenix: It doesn't look like the ladder goes all the way down to the bottom of the pool. Athena: But there's usually water in the pool, so it doesn't need to. So apparently, the pool spans two whole floors. Ordinarily, visitors only get to see what they can from the first floor... ...but they said on TV that they sometimes give behind-the-scenes tours! Phoenix: Sounds likes that Swashbuckler Spectacular show you recorded is really coming in handy. Octopus Athena: Yikes! Look at that huge octopus! Phoenix: That must be a show prop, too. One of its legs is missing, though. Athena: Wouldn't it be exciting to take on a huge enemy like that?! I'd like to give it a try, myself -- as a lawyer, that is! Phoenix: (You know you have an insufficient number of limbs to out-object it, right...?) Backdrop Phoenix: A setting sun... Sunsets always remind me how quickly the day goes by... Athena: Oh, Boss! It's just a painted backdrop, you know! Phoenix: Down, Athena. Of course I know. I guess they use it for the Swashbuckler Spectacular. Athena: It looks handmade. Ooh, I just got an idea! Why don't we make our own \"not guilty\" backdrop? Phoenix: And present it to the judge when things aren't going our way? Athena: No, we put psychological pressure on the judge by hanging it behind the defendant! Phoenix: I... almost want to see how the judge would respond to that... Hoist Athena: Hey, look! There's an apparatus here to hang from. Phoenix: I don't think it's for people to hang from. It looks more like a crane to move things with. Athena: But Sasha was hanging from it during the Swashbuckler Spectacular. I bet there are all kinds of ways to use it, not just to move things. C'mon, Boss! Try thinking outside the box! Phoenix: (Is she trying to say I have a narrow-minded view of things?) Hoop or piece of meat Phoenix: There's a piece of meat and a plastic hoop suspended from the ceiling. Talk about a clashy décor. Athena: I guess Orla really likes meat. Who knew they fed her such huge chunks, though. Phoenix: Uh, all orcas are carnivores. You knew that, right? Athena: Of course, silly! And I love meat, too! Protein is your body's basic building block, after all! Phoenix: But that meat is made out of rubber. I doubt Orla could really eat it, even if she wanted to. Athena: You mean to tell me she jumps all the way up there and doesn't get her reward? The poor girl! After all that effort! Phoenix: I don't think Orla is as dumb as you think she is... Door Phoenix: The doors are slightly open, and there are police officers standing guard outside. Athena: I guess they're watching to make sure we don't try any funny business. Phoenix: Well, now that you've said it, I suddenly feel the urge to do something. Athena: How about if I suddenly break out some squat exercises? That would be pretty funny. Phoenix: Yeah... that might cause a few raised eyebrows in ways you don't want, Athena... Ball Phoenix: Oh, look. There's a ball in the water. Is that another prop for the show? Buckler: That's one of Orla's toys. She plays volleyball with it. It's usually in the bin. Guess I must've forgotten to put it away yesterday. Athena: Wow, I wish I could play volleyball with Orla! Buckler: You have as much fight in you as a mean, old lobster! I like it! There aren't many people who wanna be on the receiving end of Orla's fast ball! Athena: H-Her fast ball?! Buckler: Yeah. She likes to be naughty and slam the ball into things around the pool. You should hear the sound that ball makes when it crashes into stuff! Athena: U-Uh, well, maybe some other time...! Phoenix: (She suddenly went from \"fighting lobster\" to \"reluctant hermit crab\"...) Shark cannon Athena: Hey, there's a cannon in the shape of a shark! I'd love to try firing that thing! Boom! Phoenix: Are these cannonballs supposed to look like fish eggs or something...? Athena: Hm? But why fish eggs? Why not baby sharks? Think about how crazy it would be to have sharks go flying through the air! Watch the thrilling life-or-death struggle as the little tykes fight to stay alive out of water! I can see it now! The drama! The mayhem! The whirlwind of teeth! Phoenix: (A tornado of sharks? Not even Hollywood could conjure up something that insane.) Control panel Phoenix: Looks like the control panel for that crane apparatus. There sure are a lot of buttons... Athena: When I see this many buttons, I start to get fidgety. Phoenix: I know what you mean. You start itching to push them, right? Athena: Nah, I start itching to make a psychological study of people who want to push buttons! Phoenix: ...Need I remind you that I'm your boss, not your guinea pig? Boxes and props (from far away) Phoenix: (It's too far away to get a good look. I'd better get a little closer first.) Boxes and props (from close up) Athena: What a mess! Was all this stuff knocked over when the victim struggled with his killer? (Changed from [What a mess! Was all this stuff knocked over when the victim struggle [sic] with his killer?] in the original release) Phoenix: It's possible, but it would be hard to prove. Let's take a closer look, shall we? Boxes Athena: Look at all this stuff scattered everywhere! I see some swords! I wonder if they have anything to do with the case?! Phoenix: They're made of rubber. I doubt they could be used as a weapon. Athena: But I still bet if someone got whapped with one, it would sting quite a bit. Phoenix: ...Yeah, I guess it would. Athena: But I think I could stand the pain. Phoenix: Yeah? Good for you... (Oh, look. There's a blow-up dolphin and an anchor, too.) Athena: Mr. Wright! Are you even listening to me? Stop looking at those toys! Phoenix: (Yikes! Guess I've been caught red-faced!) Body outline Athena: Ugh. So this is where the body was found, huh? Phoenix: If they suspect Orla, maybe they found some evidence of an attack on the victim...? Buckler: Orla didn't attack the captain! She loved him! The captain rescued Orla when she was little, after she got beached on the shore. He tried to release her into the ocean, but she kept coming back. I can tell Orla's sad about losing the captain. She's just not her usual chipper self. Athena: Orla must really love this aquarium and the captain. Buckler: She's the only one around here big and strong enough to play with the big, tough captain. Every day, she made a point of head-butting him and stealing his hat. Phoenix: Yikes! I guess you weren't kidding when you said the captain was a really strong guy. Talk Why is Orla accused? Phoenix: Okay, let's run through why Orla is under suspicion one more time, shall we? Buckler: The police think Orla went berserk during practice for the Swashbuckler Spectacular. Phoenix: (No official autopsy has been ordered but the victim's head injury can be seen in the photo. The victim and Orla were the only ones here, and there was no weapon of any kind.) Athena: They think Orla dragged the victim into the pool, which is about sixty-five feet deep... (Changed from [They think Orla dragged the victim into the pool, which is about 65 feet deep...] in the original release) ...and then rammed him in the water. Buckler: But Orla would never do anything like that! You two believe me, don't you?! Phoenix: We do. We agreed to take on your case, and we'll believe in you to the very end. Athena: Great! It's all settled, then. Let's start the investigation! After examining front side of Orla, octopus, and body outline: Phoenix: I guess that's about it. Athena: Under different circumstances, I would've loved to see the Swashbuckler Spectacular... Buckler: The three of us always performed the show together -- me, Orla, and the captain... Today's show has been canceled, but we could put on a little performance for you now! We be Cap'n Orla's Swashbucklers, me buckos! We love to sail the seven seas! We've come to rout that mangy blaggard, Dread Pirate Nostache! Avast! There he be, Nostache himself! Prepare to feed the fish! Phoenix: Um... am I playing the role of \"Nostache\"? Athena: Well, Sasha has a \"stache,\" and you don't, so I guess so... Buckler: Hit 'im with yer water cannon, Cap'n, and spare no quarter! Phoenix: Aaaaaaagh! Orla: Fwe fwe fweet. Fwe fwe fwe fweeet! Fwe fwe fwe fweet fwe fwe fweet! Buckler: We swim through storms and wave all because you see... Grand treasure and adventure's waitin' just for me! Athena: Wow! That was awesome! Your performance packed quite a wallop! Phoenix: Yeah... I, for one, feel like I took quite a beating... Buckler: Sorry 'bout that! Can't have a show without a bad-guy role, right? Phoenix: But a singing orca, huh? It must've been tough to train her to do that. Buckler: That's Orla's best trick. She can only sing one song, though. Phoenix: (Well, she's still got one up on a pianist who can't play even one song...) Well, now that we've had a taste of the show, we'd better do some more investigating. Athena: Good idea. Let's go to the Aqua Tunnel! Present Whistle Buckler: Oh, have you been using the whistle I gave you? Athena: Of course! But I can't get Orla to do any tricks. Phoenix: I can't believe you can command that huge creature. That's pretty impressive, Sasha. Buckler: Pretty cool, huh? I bet there aren't too many people who can say... ...they literally get to \"whistle while they work.\" Phoenix: (That must be pretty nice for you.) Buckler: But Orla is the one who's impressive, really, not me. Athena: It's easy to see how much you care about Orla. Phoenix: You two are a good team. Athena: What...?! But you and I are a great team, right? We can top that! Wright Anything Agency: Present Whistle Apollo: What's this? Something you wear around your neck? Phoenix: It's a whistle they use to make the orca do her tricks. Athena: If I blow it at you, will you do a trick? Apollo: What am I, some kind of circus animal to you two? Phoenix: Well, you ARE one of the talents here at our Wright Anything Agency, after all. The least you could do is learn a trick or two. Apollo: Need I remind I'm a lawyer?! Besides, Athena doesn't know any tricks! Athena: Hee hee! That's what YOU think! I've got a special trick I've been waiting to bust out. I can chug an entire glass of OJ without taking a breath, all while doing squats! Apollo: Well... that's, uh, really something, Athena... Phoenix: (I don't think I want to see Athena do squats...) Anything else Apollo: Evidence...? Does this mean you want me at the defense's bench in court?! Phoenix: No. I just wanted to see what you think. Apollo: Oh. Darn... In that case, I don't think you want to hear what I think. Aqua Tunnel (before examining front side of Orla, octopus, and body outline in Shipshape Aquarium - Orca Pool) Talk What to do Athena: We have to find some evidence that shows the culprit wasn't Orla! Phoenix: You're really fired up for this, aren't you? Athena: Well, I'm getting pretty good at investigating, thanks to that last case. So I want to show you how much I've learned! Vamos a hacer esto! Let's check out the scene! Phoenix: I'm glad to see your enthusiasm, but if you run like that, you're going to fall. Athena: Aaaaaaaaagh! Phoenix: ...Too late. Any ideas? Athena: Well... I have noticed there's an amazing chemistry between Orla and Sasha. Phoenix: Not those kinds of ideas. I mean, any thoughts on the case? Athena: My thoughts are that we don't have enough information yet. That is what my heart is telling me. Phoenix: (In other words, you don't have any ideas. Got it.) Present Attorney's Badge Athena: I'm so glad you got your attorney's badge back, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Me too. I guess I was always meant to be a lawyer. I'm going to polish it up, shinier than it's ever been! Athena: I can top that! I'm going to polish mine until the finish comes off! Phoenix: Never mind. You win. Swashbuckler Flyer Athena: Ooh, the Swashbuckler Spectacular is so exciting! I could watch it a hundred times! The fierce fighting, the graceful moves! Oh, Orla and Sasha are so cool! Phoenix: If you love the show so much, why don't you try auditioning to be in it? Athena: Hey, I know! The whole office could be in it together! We could be the \"Anything Pirate Band\"! You know, from the name of the agency! Phoenix: Sounds like a pretty pathetic pirate band to me. Athena: What are you talking about?! It sounds cutthroat! It means we'd do \"anything\" to get our hands on treasure! Anything, no matter how brutal! Phoenix: Yikes. We're a brutal pirate band?! Whistle Athena: Phwiiiiip! Phwiiip, phwiiip! Phoenix: I didn't ask if you could blow it. It's such a weird whistle, anyway. It doesn't even make a proper \"whistle\" sound. Athena: Most people can't hear it, but I think I can hear it a little bit. It's like a message that only Orla's heart can receive! Aw, that's so sweet! Phoenix: It's the same idea as a dog whistle, so I wonder if dogs can hear it, too? Athena: Grr! Now you ruined it! You don't know anything about girls, do you? Anything else Athena: Oh, I get it. Your current state of mind is: \"Gather all the information we can get.\" But let's concentrate on USEFUL information from now on, okay, Boss? July 20Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel Fulbright: So you all done investigating the pool already? Phoenix: We had a good look around, but now we're moving on to other areas. Athena: How is the police investigation going? Did you -- say, for example -- find any other suspects besides Orla...? Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Wouldn't that be fortunate for you if we did? But no, I'm afraid not. And even more unfortunate for you... ...I'm afraid we found decisive evidence of the orca's guilt. Phoenix: (What?!) P-Please tell us more, Detective! Talk Proof the orca did it Athena: So what's this \"decisive evidence\"?! Don't hold out on us now, Detective Fulbright! Fulbright: I'm very sorry, but I can't share classified information with the defense. Especially not security footage that shows the moment the orca attacked the victim! Yup, I'm to personally see to it that this baby stays safe! It will never leave my side! Policeman: 'Scuse me, but there's a call for you, Detective. Fulbright: I'll be right there! Sorry guys, you know how it is! Athena: Well, he never said that HE wouldn't leave ITS side, I guess... Now, let's sneak a peek! Wh-What the--?! Phoenix: Is this supposed to be the moment Orla attacked the victim...? Security Footage added to the Court Record. Athena: This little bit of footage doesn't prove anything! Phoenix: I agree. I believe in Orla and Sasha. Let's just continue with our investigation. Athena: Good idea! ...Huh? There's a sticker on this camera that says, \"Return to the Pub O' Danger.\" Phoenix: Guess somebody there manages the cameras? Let's check it out later. Fulbright: Sorry about that. Prosecutor Blackquill called to remind me to go feed Taka. So where were we...? Oh, that's right! You two got any more questions for me? Phoenix: No, we're good. Thank you. (For leaking all your info!) Present Attorney's Badge Fulbright: So that's your symbol of justice, is it? Well, this is MINE! Phoenix: (...Wow. He can whip that badge out pretty fast...) Athena: We can top that! Take THIS! Twin attorney's badges! Fulbright: Aaagh! No fair! Two against one! Athena: No fair! Your police badge is bigger and flashier! Fulbright: What?! You dare to call me... \"unfair\"?! Me, the very model of justice itself?! Athena: Boss! I'd say we won this round! Phoenix: Athena, in this battle there are no winners... Photo of the Body Fulbright: The poor victim... It's heart-wrenching! Crime cannot go unpunished! Phoenix: We don't want crime to go unpunished, either. Athena: But we'll do our utmost to defend our client. Fulbright: Hmm. Your form of justice or mine... Which is true justice? I guess we'll see how it plays out. Athena: In other words, he doesn't have enough information right now to make up his mind. Phoenix: Thank you for the translation, Athena. Anything else Fulbright: Ha ha ha! I have NOTHING to say about that! If you're lawyers of any mettle, you'll find the answers for yourselves! After clearing \"Proof the orca did it\" Talk option in Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel: July 20Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' Danger Athena: This looks like one of those hands-on exhibits. It has a real air of danger, don't you think?! Phoenix: Well, the banner does say it's the \"PUB O' DANGER\"... Athena: Let's see. According to the description, this room is... ...\"A pub where pirates gather. Explore and interact with sea creatures! Actually feel the electricity of electric eels and feed real piranhas! Experience the terror of the seas with these dangerous experiments!\" Phoenix: All of those sounds less like \"terror\" and more like \"torture\" to me! ???: Ahem! I'd thank you to keep it down there, blue boy. I'm conducting an experiment! Do not disturb me, unless you wish to be zapped with an electric eel! Phoenix: M-My apologies, ma'am. (Wow. She seems intense...) Athena: Excuse me, but who are you? ???: Before you ask others, shouldn't you give YOUR name first? Basic manners, young lady. Athena: O-Oh, yes! Of course! My name is-- ???: Never mind. I will simply call you \"yellow girl.\" It's easier that way. DePlume: I am Norma DePlume. I am very interested in Shipshape Aquarium, and am a frequent visitor here. Athena: B-But... I don't want to be \"yellow girl\"! Phoenix: You think I want to be called \"blue boy\"? ...*sigh* Let's just see what she has to say. Talk Norma DePlume Athena: You say you're interested in the aquarium, but you don't look like a staff member. Hmm... Let's see... I got it! You're someone completely unrelated to this aquarium! Phoenix: (That's some deductive reasoning there, champ.) DePlume: I am a visitor, a patron, a customer, a guest... And what might you be? Athena: I'm not a \"what\"! I'm a lawyer! Phoenix: (Hey, that's what I was going to say!) A-And I run a law office! DePlume: Well, whatever you are, I don't have the slightest interest. Athena: Grr! Just who does she think she is, Boss?! Phoenix: \"A visitor, a patron, a customer, a guest,\" remember? Why you're here (appears after \"Norma DePlume\") Athena: I thought they closed the aquarium and weren't letting members of the public in? DePlume: Oh ho ho! But I have special permission, you see. Phoenix: And why exactly is that, if I may ask? DePlume: Well, because of the incide-- Heavens! I've said too much. 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: I-I remember this...! Psyche-Locks! Athena: Huh? Psychedelic rock? Cyborg clocks? What?! Phoenix: No, no. \"Psyche-Locks.\" It's the power of this magatama. It gives me the ability to see the secrets locked away in somebody's heart. If I can remove the locks, I can uncover their secrets. Athena: I didn't know you had a magical item like that! Phoenix: It looks like this lady knows something about what happened. I'll just use my magatama and undo her Psyche-Locks. (Huh? I can't see the locks anymore!) Athena: Huh? The color of that stone looks different from before. Phoenix: That's funny. Maybe it's just out of juice...? Athena: I-It can do that? Phoenix: Yeah. A certain girl I know poured her spiritual power into it for me. Without that power, I can't undo the Psyche-Locks. Athena: No way! DePlume: Hmph! Why do I have to keep quiet about it, anyway?! I've never been any good at keeping secrets. But I did promise after all, so I guess I had better keep my mouth shut... Phoenix: Who did you promise what to? DePlume: No comment. Now, go away! Phoenix: *sigh* Just when I thought we could find out more about the case... Athena: Let's go try to find some other way! I'm sure we'll find something! Why you're here (subsequent times) Athena: I thought they closed the aquarium and weren't letting members of the public in? DePlume: Oh ho ho! But I have special permission, you see. Phoenix: And why exactly is that, if I may ask? DePlume: Well, because of the incide-- Heavens! I've said too much. Phoenix: (Without some spiritual power, the Magatama can't help me unlock Ms. DePlume's secret. I guess we'll just have to think of some other way.) Present Swashbuckler Flyer DePlume: A Swashbuckler flyer? I have more than enough of those already. Do you have any idea how many times I've visited this aquarium?! Phoenix: (Hey, what are you yelling at me for?) Don't you ever get tired of coming here? DePlume: Hmph! You obviously don't know anything about Shipshape Aquarium. They feature different marine creatures each month, so visitors never get bored. Athena: So you're a fan of Shipshape Aquarium, like me? DePlume: Oh, please! I'm here to gather information-- the fundamental work of a great writer. But I don't suppose that's something you common folk would understand... Athena: Grr! That woman makes me so mad! Phoenix: Now, now. Why don't we \"common folk\" just get back to our investigation? Security Footage DePlume: Don't thrust that under my nose! I won't watch it! Phoenix: Are you usually pretty photogenic, Ms. DePlume? DePlume: Of course I am! I've been compared to a movie star! It's little wonder, with my perfect makeup and stylish figure. Wouldn't you agree? Phoenix: (She wants me to agree?!) Let's get a woman's opinion on this one. Athena: What? You're asking me?! Well, uh, let's see. I DO think you're very pretty, Ms. DePlume. DePlume: Hmm? I get the distinct impression your words are full of hidden meaning... Athena: Well... I wouldn't say \"full\" so much as \"full-figured\"... Phoenix: A-Athena! I'd stop right there if I were you. Anything else DePlume: I have no interest in looking at meaningless trifles. As a matter of fact, I have no interest in looking at you, blue boy. Phoenix: (What, so now I'm a \"meaningless trifle,\" too?) After clearing \"Why you're here\" Talk option in Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' Danger: July 20Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel Athena: Hey, Detective Fulbright's gone. It looks like the police investigation is over, too. Phoenix: That's too bad. I was hoping to get a little more out of him. ???: Yo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo! Cleaner? Nuh uh. Feeder? That's right! Yo girl why you hidin' from me? I'm searching all 'round like this be a bad dream. Phoenix: (Is that somebody... rapping?) ???: Rifle yo sometimes you make me so mad. But now that you're gone I'm just so sad. Yo Rifle just come back to me. We can be together and sing kree kree kree! Phoenix: What's with this guy, rapping and making strange bird sounds...? ???: Yikes! W-Who's there?! ...You didn't hear me rappin', did ya?! Phoenix: Yeah, well... Maybe... ???: Arrrrrrr! Look, just do me a favor and pretend ya didn't hear nothin'! Phoenix: Fine by us. And who might you be? Rimes: I'm Marlon Rimes. I'm an animal keeper here. But the aquarium is already closed today. Um, at least, I'm pretty sure it is... Athena: Pretty sure? You don't sound too certain... Oh! Are you new here or something? Rimes: Wow! Yeah, that's right! Pretty good guess! So who are you guys? Phoenix: I'm Phoenix Wright. Athena: And I'm Athena Cykes. We're lawyers, and we're going to represent Orla... ...by taking her case to court and proving she's innocent! Rimes: A-Are ya serious?! You wanna defend an orca in COURT?! ...Oh! But if you're here for Orla, that must make ya friends of Sasha's... Sorry if I came across rude. Phoenix: (Sounds like he's friends with Sasha.) Rimes: Sometimes when I'm by myself, I like to rap to pass the time. Especially when I'm around the animals I love. Athena: Ooh, I love animals, too! Especially marine creatures, like dolphins! Phoenix: I like marine creatures, too. (But just the ones you can eat.) Rimes: Yeah? Well, people who like animals are good people. That's what I always say! If there's anything I can do for you two, just say the word! I just started workin' here, though, so I dunno how much help I can be. Athena: Mr. Rimes seems pretty friendly. Phoenix: Yeah, friendly and agreeable. Talk Marlon Rimes Athena: So, what exactly do you do here as an animal keeper? Rimes: Mainly, I clean the place and feed the animals. Wiping all this glass takes forever! Phoenix: (I can imagine... This tunnel alone must take most of the day.) Rimes: I also prep the food the animals eat. That's the hardest part of all. Athena: You mean, it's really difficult to get the hang of? Rimes: Nah, I mean, I'm a vegetarian, so cuttin' fish and meat and stuff up creeps me out. Phoenix: Now there's something I never expected to hear from a pirate. About the murder Phoenix: Do you know anything about the incident that took place this morning? Rimes: Yeah. One of our guests saw what happened and started screamin'. I came runnin', but by the time I got there, I couldn't see the orca or the captain. Athena: Speaking of the captain... what was he like? Rimes: Like a strong captain who can turn a wild bunch of ruffians into some great pirates... He always treated us fairly and equally, human and fishes alike. The real deal, man. ...Hey! Wh-what are YOU cryin' for?! Athena: I-I'm not crying! It's just, I can feel your heart crying, that's all. Rimes: G-Girl, whatchu talkin' about?! I'm not cryin', either! Phoenix: (I guess I won't mention that his eyes are puffier than a pair of pufferfish...) Rimes: I bet Sasha and our vet Dr. Crab are even more upset by his death. Phoenix: Vet? This aquarium has a resident vet? Rimes: Yeah... Yo, hold up! I haven't seen Dr. Crab this morning. Staff are supposed to stay put. The night shift has been on duty since last night, but they won't let us go home. Sasha even had to get special permission to go out looking for a lawyer this morning. Athena: Hmm... We haven't seen anybody who looks like a vet. Rifle Athena: Were you rapping something about looking for a weapon earlier? A rifle or something...? Rimes: Ha ha ha! No, not a weapon! \"Rifle\" is the name of one of our penguins. Athena: A penguin? Why would you name a penguin something like that? Rimes: Ahoy! Yo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo! Prep for the battle, prep for the war! Little lady Rifle gon' even da score! Y'all think you can escape with your pride? Nuh uh, you just gon' be straight up denied! (Changed from [Ya'll [sic] think you can escape with your pride? Nuh uh, you just gon' be straight up denied!] in the original release) Yo! Yo! Yo ho ho! Yo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo! Anyway, that's what she's like, so we named her \" Rifle.\" Phoenix: ...Okay, but did you have to rap it? Rimes: That's just how I roll. Athena: Does Rifle wear a backpack, by any chance? Rimes: Yeah, that's the one! So you've seen her, huh? She's always runnin' away! She's such a good runner, we decided to put her to work deliverin' flyers. Phoenix: Do you really want a dangerous penguin like that running loose?! Rimes: Aw, Rifle's not dangerous. She only attacks people she doesn't like. Athena: When we ran into her earlier, she didn't attack us. She straight up ignored us, actually. Rimes: Hey, I have an idea! If you run into Rifle again, would ya mind feedin' her for me? She didn't come back to the pool at feedin' time like usual, so I've been lookin' for her. She loves the smell of fish, so she might come over to you if you have some. Athena: Ooh, I would LOVE to feed a penguin! That'd be okay, right, Boss? Phoenix: I don't mind, as long as YOU carry the fish. Fish handed over to Athena. Athena: P-U! It smells so... fishy! Phoenix: (Really? What a shocker...) Rifle (subsequent times) Athena: Were you rapping something about looking for a weapon earlier? A rifle or something...? Rimes: Ha ha ha! No, not a weapon! \"Rifle\" is the name of one of our penguins. Athena: A penguin? Why would you name a penguin something like that? Rimes: Ahoy! Yo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo! Prep for the battle, prep for the war! Little lady Rifle gon' even da score! Y'all think you can escape with your pride? Nuh uh, you just gon' be straight up denied! (Changed from [Ya'll [sic] think you can escape with your pride? Nuh uh, you just gon' be straight up denied!] in the original release) Yo! Yo! Yo ho ho! Yo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo! Anyway, that's what she's like, so we named her \" Rifle.\" Phoenix: ...Okay, but did you have to rap it? Rimes: That's just how I roll. Athena: Does Rifle wear a backpack, by any chance? Rimes: Yeah, that's the one! So you've seen her, huh? She's always runnin' away! She's such a good runner, we decided to put her to work deliverin' flyers. Phoenix: Do you really want a dangerous penguin like that running loose?! Rimes: Aw, Rifle's not dangerous. She only attacks people she doesn't like. Athena: When we ran into her earlier, she didn't attack us. She straight up ignored us, actually. Rimes: Hey, I have an idea! If you run into Rifle again, would ya mind feedin' her for me? She didn't come back to the pool at feedin' time like usual, so I've been lookin' for her. She loves the smell of fish, so she might come over to you if you have some. Athena: Ooh, I would LOVE to feed a penguin! That'd be okay, right, Boss? Phoenix: I don't mind, as long as YOU carry the fish. Athena: P-U! It smells so... fishy! Phoenix: (Really? What a shocker...) Present Swashbuckler Flyer Rimes: With this flyer, you can get a penguin sleep mask the next time you come in. Phoenix: Oh, yeah? That would be nice, especially if it's free. Athena: That'd be perfect for taking a nap at the office after going for a run or something! Phoenix: I prefer you DIDN'T take naps at the office, actually. Rimes: Yeah, I feel ya! Sometimes I fall asleep when I'm feedin' the animals. Athena: I guess only a newbie can truly understand the feelings of another newbie! Rimes: Heh heh. We're kindred spirits, my sister. Kindred spirits. Athena: Two peas in a pod! Birds of a feather! Phoenix: I suddenly feel so alone. Fish Phoenix: Mr. Rimes, about this fish... Rimes: I'm the master keeper! No way you can beat me! You're a pro lawyer, but an amateur feeder! Ya'll [sic] ready for a feeding throw-down? Rifle c'mon! Time to defend da crown! Phoenix: ............ Uh, it doesn't look like Rifle's coming... Rimes: ............I guess not, huh? Sorry about all that \"throw-down\" stuff, then... I just wanted to show ya the inner secrets of animal feedin'. Phoenix: There are \"inner secrets\"? Rimes: You know, stuff like how to debone a fish. Great care goes into each animal's food. Then of course there's the way of tossin' the food to 'em. It's different for each one. Phoenix: ...I see. Sorry to have bothered you with mundane questions from the uninitiated. Anything else Rimes: I'm new here, so I dunno. Phoenix: (I don't really think being \"new here\" has anything to do with it in this instance...) After clearing all Talk options: Rimes: Oh, yeah. Besides Rifle, I've been lookin' for Small Fry, too. Phoenix: \"Small Fry\"? Is that another penguin? Rimes: Nah, she's a friend I made, a high-school girl. She went off lookin' for Rifle somewhere and hasn't been back. Athena: Is she... your girlfriend? Rimes: What?! Nah, no way! Sasha is the one I-- Athena: So you like Ms. Buckler, do you! Rimes: Well, I-I really respect her, ya know? We have different tastes in music, but I admire the way she lives her life! It's not like I \"like\" her. It's more complicated than that... Phoenix: (I'm pretty sure that all adds up to \"like\"...) Rimes: She tries to put on a brave face... ...but I think the captain's death is hittin' her hardest of all. After all, it was her human show partner that got killed by that orca. Athena: So you think Orla really did it? Rimes: Well, I can understand how Sasha feels... ...but she's the only one of us who doesn't think the orca did it. Athena: Oh, I see... Phoenix: (I guess it isn't easy to believe in somebody who can't even speak up for herself...) Rimes: Anyway, let me know if you see Rifle or Small Fry, okay? Small Fry said she was gonna go check the orca pool. Phoenix: Maybe we'll head back there, then. Orca Pool (before clearing all Talk options with Marlon Rimes in Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel) Present Fish Buckler: You be givin' me a fish?! So you be challengin' me to a fight, eh?! Arr! Phoenix: What?! No! What kind of rule is that?! Athena: That's how it goes in the Swashbuckler Spectacular! Present a fish. Start fighting. The gauntlet--I mean, the fish--is thrown down, and the glorious battle begins! Ooh, you're so cool when you're up there jumping and slashing! Buckler: Arr! Belay that talk, li'l lassie! Compliments will get ye naught! Athena: Ooh! You sound just exactly like a real pirate! Hee hee! Phoenix: (Athena just eats this stuff up.) July 20Shipshape Aquarium - Orca Pool Phoenix: (Huh? There's something on the left side of the pool that wasn't here before...) It looks like an electronic sword...? Buckler: Hey, you're back! Phoenix: Hi, Sasha. What's with this strange sword here? Buckler: Oh, that's a walkie-talkie. It's probably Rifle's. Athena: R-Rifle can use a walkie-talkie?! Buckler: She's always running away, so we attached a walkie-talkie to her. If we can hear the sounds around her, we can usually guess where she is. Phoenix: (But not if she drops the walkie-talkie on the floor.) Buckler: Every member of the crew has one, too, so we can communicate back and forth. We can even use them to broadcast to specific parts of the aquarium. Cool, huh? Walkie-Talkie added to the Court Record. Athena: Well, if Rifle's walkie-talkie is here, then Rifle might still be here, too! Rifle! Come out, come out, wherever you are! *SPLASH!* Athena: Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeek! Orla: Fweet? Buckler: Are you okay? You have to be careful around pools, or you might slip right in! Athena: I'm more afraid of my heart jumping right out! Phoenix: Hey, who's that riding on Orla? Isn't that Rifle? Athena: Hey, you're right! C'mere, Rifle! Rifle: ............ *kree* Athena: Argh! She ignored mem again! Why doesn't that penguin like me?! Graaaaagh! Phoenix: Now you've scared Rifle away with all that yelling... Athena: Well, I'm not giving up! I'll MAKE that penguin like me if it's the last thing I do! Anime cutscene Athena: Hey! Get back here, you little pipsqueak! Rifle: *kree!* Pearl: Oh! Sorry, Rifle. But at least you seem alright. Phoenix: (Hey... It's... It's...) Pearls?! Pearl: Oh! Mr. Nick! I haven't seen you in ages! Phoenix: (Could Pearls be the \"Small Fry\" Mr. Rimes was talking about?) Pearl: Congratulations on your return to lawyering! I've been thinking about stopping by your office for a visit to congratulate you. Phoenix: (This is Pearl Fey. I call her \"Pearls.\" She may dress a little funny... ...but that's because she's a spirit medium -- a real prodigy with great power, at that. I've known her since she was little, and she sometimes comes to the office to visit. She's just a little older than Trucy, so she's been like a big sister to her.) Pearl: I guess everyone here knows Mr. Nick, then? He's such a nice guy, don't you think? Phoenix: (...Is she trying to be MY big sister too, now?!) Talk Pearl Fey Phoenix: What are you doing here, Pearls? Pearl: My summer camp is here on a field trip. I've never been to such a big aquarium before, so I was really looking forward to it! But then that incident happened... and the police just finished questioning me. Phoenix: Oh, I see. Pearl: Um...Mr. Nick...? Who is that lady next to you...? Athena: I'm Athena Cykes! I'm a new lawyer at the Wright Anything Agency! Pearl: Oh, how do you do! My name is Pearl Fey. My cousin and my friends call me \"Pearly.\" Athena: \"Pearly\" it is, then! Nice to meet you! Pearl: So... how did the two of you meet...? Phoenix: Well, you know how I used to travel to Europe to study their legal systems, Pearls? I met Athena on one of those trips. Meeting Athena (appears after \"Pearl Fey\") Pearl: So, tell me more about how the two of you met in Europe. Phoenix: (Hey, I thought I was supposed to be asking the questions here!) Athena: A long time ago, Mr. Wright helped me out of a difficult jam. That's when I started thinking about becoming a lawyer like him. Pearl: So you're like her mentor, huh, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Yeah, something like that, I guess. Athena: Mr. Wright is the whole reason I am who I am today! He was the one who told me my knowledge of psychology could help people in court! Pearl: Gee, Mr. Nick, it looks like you've become a real adult since the last time I saw you! Phoenix: (I've always been an adult the entire time I've known you, Pearls!) Rifle: *kreeeee* Athena: Well, would you look at that! Rifle loves you! Phoenix: She sure does seem to be attracted to Pearls... Pearl: Hee hee! I'm so glad she likes me! Penguins are so adorable, aren't they! I even bought myself a little penguin calendar here at the aquarium gift shop. I have it hanging from my bag already! Athena: Oh, how cute! A calendar in the shape of a penguin! Buckler: That calendar is a real hit with all our female visitors. I even have one myself! But the rest of the staff thinks it's... too cutesy. Phoenix: I guess it doesn't really fit the whole \"rough-and-tumble pirate\" image very well... But, hmm... why does this calendar smell kind of like fish...? Pearl: Wh-What do you mean, Mr. Nick?! Please don't be rude! Phoenix: (Uh-oh. I got Pearls mad...) Calendar added to the Court Record. Meeting Athena (subsequent times) Pearl: So, tell me more about how the two of you met in Europe. Phoenix: (Hey, I thought I was supposed to be asking the questions here!) Athena: A long time ago, Mr. Wright helped me out of a difficult jam. That's when I started thinking about becoming a lawyer like him. Pearl: So you're like her mentor, huh, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: Yeah, something like that, I guess. Athena: Mr. Wright is the whole reason I am who I am today! He was the one who told me my knowledge of psychology could help people in court! Pearl: Gee, Mr. Nick, it looks like you've become a real adult since the last time I saw you! Phoenix: (I've always been an adult the entire time I've known you, Pearls!) Rifle (appears after \"Meeting Athena\") Phoenix: So you were looking for Rifle, too? Pearl: That's right. I was trying to help Mr. Marlon, the animal keeper. Athena: C'mere, Rifle! C'mon! Rifle: *kree!* Phoenix: She went towards Orla instead. Athena: Grrrrr! Why can't I get Rifle to like me?! Phoenix: Maybe you should quit chasing after her with that scowl of yours... Pearl: Mr. Nick! How could you speak to a lady so rudely?! Phoenix: (Uh-oh. I got Pearls mad... again.) Why don't you try to get Rifle to take some food from you? Athena: Oh, great idea! And I have just the thing to present her, too! (Changed from [Oh, great idea! And I have just the thing to offer her, too!] in the original release) Present Attorney's Badge Pearl: Oh, I'm so happy you get to be a lawyer again, Mr. Nick! Phoenix: Ha ha. Thanks. I let our friends know I was back, too. Pearl: I wish we could all get together. It's been quite a while! Maybe we should throw you a surprise party to celebrate your comeback. Phoenix: That would be really nice. But if you tell me about it, it won't be a surprise, you know. Pearl: Oh! B-But we could spring it on you after you had forgotten, and still surprise you! Swashbuckler Flyer Pearl: I was really looking forward to seeing the Swashbuckler Spectacular... It's such a shame. Phoenix: Yeah. I bet you would've really enjoyed it. Pearl: But I was really happy to see such a large marine animal! It was quite an experience! ...I still have yet to see a blue whale, though, the largest marine animal of them all! Phoenix: Yeah, uh... I doubt there are any blue whales at the aquarium. Fish Pearl: Oh my! Did you go fishing, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: No, this is for Rifle. We were asked to feed her. Pearl: Ooh, that sounds like fun! Do you think she would take food from me? Phoenix: Oh, I'm sure she would--from you. Athena: ...So what you're really trying to say is that Rifle wouldn't take food from ME, right?! Phoenix: No, that's not what I meant. (That IS what I meant, though.) Athena: Grr! I won't be bested! Pearly, it's ON! Pearl: Wh-What? What's \"on\"? Phoenix: Now, now, Athena. Let's be adults about this. You've got poor Pearls here all confused. Fish (after clearing \"Rifle\" Talk option) Leads to: \"Rifle! I have a present for you! It's chock-filled with love! Here you go!\" Calendar Pearl: Isn't it cute? I really love this calendar. Phoenix: It's shaped like a penguin. It is pretty cute, isn't it? Maybe I should buy a calendar for the office before I leave. I always run out of room to write appointments in my planner. Athena: Why don't you just put your appointments on your phone? Phoenix: I'm not very good at using electronic devices... Pearl: Oh, neither am I. Hee hee! We have something in common! Athena: Aw, now I feel left out. Anything else Pearl: You know I'd do anything I could to help you! ...But I'm afraid I don't really know anything about that... Phoenix: That's all right, Pearls. No worries. Athena: Rifle! I have a present for you! It's chock-filled with love! Here you go! Orla: Fwee, fweet! Athena: Hey! Orla ate my love-filled fish! At least it looks like she enjoyed it, though. Orla: Fwee, fweet! Athena: I think Orla and I just had a bonding moment! Pearl: Friendship blossoming with the exchange of some food! Oh, isn't it moving, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: I think \"moving\" might be going a bit far... Anyway, how did you get Rifle to come to you so easily, Pearls? I heard Rifle was attracted to the smell of fish... Pearl: M-Mr. Nick! Are you saying I smell like fish?! Phoenix: Uh, maybe just a little, yes... Pearl: Hmm... I guess I need to change my clothes... Phoenix: (That's odd... I wonder why Pearls smells like she's holding a bucket of fish...?) Buckler: Hmm... Orla doesn't usually want to eat at this time of day... And we've even been giving her more food than normal at her regular meal times lately... Talk Orla's feeding habits (Changed from [Orla's eating] in the original release) Phoenix: Is there something wrong with Orla's feeding habits lately? Buckler: Yeah, something's weird. The new guy, Marlon, feeds all the other animals besides Orla. But the captain and I, her trainer, are responsible for feeding Orla. It was the captain's turn to feed Orla this morning. Athena: But Orla keeps coming to me and signaling she's still hungry. She wants my fish, chock-filled with love! Phoenix: How long are you going to keep saying that? (She sure is excited to make a new friend.) Buckler: But I don't think the captain would've forgotten to feed Orla... Orla and Rifle Pearl: Rifle and that big creature there certainly seem to love each other! Buckler: This is Orla the orca. Rifle and Orla are best friends! They belong together like a clownfish and a sea anemone! Phoenix: (Care to phrase that in a way us non-biology majors can understand...?) Pearl: Oh! So this orca is the suspect. I-I read in a book once that orcas eat penguins...! Buckler: Don't you worry about that. Orla here's really gentle, and she never eats anything but fish. Rifle: *kree!* *kreeeee!* Orla: Fwee... Fwee, fwee... Buckler: She's an ol' sweetheart. As a matter of fact, she even tolerates Rifle picking on her! Phoenix: It's true, she does seem very gentle. She hardly seems like a \"killer\" whale... Athena: As lawyers, we have to do everything we can to save this beautiful, gentle creature! Pearl: Wow, you're going to defend her in court? She's... quite the defendant, isn't she...? Phoenix: She's the biggest defendant we've ever had. (Literally!) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: Oh, Pearls. I have a big favor to ask. Pearl: What is it, Mr. Nick? Phoenix: It's about my magatama... Its spiritual power seems to have vanished. Pearl: Oh! That magatama brings back memories! I remember pouring my spiritual power into it. That was so many years ago... I guess that's why it's almost out now. ...There you go, Mr. Nick. It should be fine now. Phoenix: Thank you, Pearls! Now I can break Psyche-Locks again. Pearl: Hee hee. I'm glad I could help! Well, I think I'll go find Mr. Marlon now. I have to bring Rifle to him. Athena: Pearly sure seems right at home at this aquarium. Phoenix: Hmm, you're right. But didn't she say this was her first time here...? Buckler: Apparently, that girl was in the staff corridor earlier this morning. That's why the detective was questioning her. Phoenix: What was Pearls doing in the staff corridor? Buckler: I dunno. I thought she was Marlon's friend or something. Phoenix: The staff corridor, huh...? Something about that doesn't sit well with me... Orca Pool Diagram updated in the Court Record. Athena: Well, if it bothers you, why don't you just ask her about it? Phoenix: Yeah, good idea. Let's go catch up with her. Wright Anything Agency Present Fish Phoenix: Hey, Apollo. Think you could whip us up a little meal with these? Apollo: Fish? I haven't had fish for a while, come to think of it... ...The obvious question, though, is \"What are you doing with a bunch of raw fish?!\" Athena: It's to feed the penguin with! Apollo: Penguin?! So why are you giving it to me to cook?! Phoenix: Oh, I dunno. I just happened to think of it, and I was hungry. Apollo: Then why don't we all go out for sushi when you wrap up the investigation? Athena: Oh, you're going to treat us?! How sweet of you! I'll start with tuna! Phoenix: That's really generous of you, Apollo. Don't forget to invite Trucy, too. Apollo: ...Why did I even open my mouth? Aqua Tunnel (before clearing all Talk options with Pearl Fey and Sasha Buckler in Shipshape Aquarium - Orca Pool) Talk What to do Athena: Checking out the scene is important, but we can't forget to question people, too! We need to get some insight on how people are feeling. Phoenix: But we should give the scene another look, too, though. We might've missed something. Athena: Of course! That's one of the basic rules of investigating! \"The lawyer always returns to the scene of the investigation.\" Phoenix: Wasn't that \"The criminal always returns to the scene of the crime\"? Any ideas? Athena: There sure are a lot of interesting characters at Shipshape Aquarium! Phoenix: I'll say. It's like a wild pirate ship. Athena: I guess they really wanted to give the place an authentic piratey flavor. Like the sea-bottom Aqua Tunnel, and the Exploration Corner, \"where pirates gather\"! Widget: Arr! Let's have some fun, me hearties! Athena: Y-Yikes! Widget, you scared me! Phoenix: ...Let's save the pirate fun for AFTER the investigation, shall we? Present Fish Athena: Ugh. That smells awful! Please keep it away from me! Phoenix: But you're the one who wanted it. Why do I have to carry it? Athena: Orla sure eats a lot, doesn't she? I used to eat a lot when I was a kid. Took lots of naps, too! Phoenix: And you still take lots of naps, right here at the office. Athena: What?! You knew about that?! I-It's this new thing I'm trying out! Um... sleep learning! Yeah, that's the ticket! Phoenix: (Not buying it.) July 20Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel Phoenix: (Looks like Mr. Rimes and Pearls are talking.) Rimes: Ahoy! Based Small Fry was so clutch with the assist! Rimes n' Rifle reunion, a tale endin' in bliss! Now animal keeper Rimes ain't gonna get cut! Mad props, Small Fry, this case is now shut! Yo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo! Pearl: Hee hee. It was my pleasure. See you again sometime, Rifle! Rifle: Kree... Rimes: Okay, let's go Rifle. See ya, Small Fry! Pearl: Oh, Mr. Nick! I didn't see you there. Talk Relation to Rimes Athena: Hey, Pearly, you and Mr. Rimes seem to be really good friends. Phoenix: Could you tell us more about your relationship? Pearl: ! W-Well, I... 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Phoenix: Um, Pearls, why do I see a Psyche-Lock? Pearl: Um... I'm sorry, Mr. Nick... But I really shouldn't talk about it... Phoenix: (Hmm... I don't really feel right about digging into Pearls's affairs... But she was here at the aquarium at the time of the incident... Whatever she's hiding could help us in court! Sorry Pearls, but I'll have to use my magatama ([X / Y / R]) on you.) Present Magatama Phoenix: 1 PSYCHE-LOCK Phoenix: (A Psyche-Lock... A lock on a person's heart that only I can see... The deeper the secret is hidden, the more locks there will be. Pearls only has one lock, so I should be able to undo it fairly easily. But if I make a mistake, I'll be locked in a loop and won't be able to move forward. Okay, time to give it a try.) -- Relation to Rimes -- Phoenix: Pearls, you have to tell me about your relationship with Mr. Rimes. Pearl: \"Relationship\"? There is no \"relationship\" between Mr. Marlon and me. We're just a visitor to the aquarium and an animal keeper at the aquarium, that's all. Phoenix: But there are areas where ordinary \"visitors to the aquarium\" don't get to go... You were here before the incident occurred, weren't you? Present Staff Corridor Phoenix: Leads to: \"Yes! That's right...\" Present anywhere else Phoenix: Pearl: Do you have any proof I was there? Phoenix: Proof...? No, can't say that I do... (Hmm... I'd better give it another try...) Leads back to: \"You were here before the incident occurred, weren't you?\" Pearl: Yes! That's right... ...But how did you know? Phoenix: Someone told me you were there. Pearl: I got confused and went the wrong way. I didn't know it was a corridor just for the staff. But that's all it was, Mr. Nick! It didn't have anything to do with Mr. Marlon. Phoenix: (Sounds reasonable. I guess I'd better move on to my next topic.) Actually, there's something else I've been wondering about, Pearls... Why do you smell like fish? Pearl: F-Fish? Wh-What makes you think I smell like fish? Phoenix: Well, there's a certain someone who convinced me it wasn't my imagination. Present Rifle profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"R-Rifle...?!\" Present anyone else Phoenix: Pearl: Is there something you want to say about that person...? Phoenix: Huh? Oh, I guess not... (When it comes to sniffing out the smell of fish, there's only one nose that I can rely on!) Pearls, I want you to be honest with me. Leads back to: \"Why do you smell like fish?\" Pearl: R-Rifle...?! Phoenix: She's apparently very attracted to the smell of fish. Rifle didn't want anything to do with Athena, even though she had a bunch of fish. So why then, was Rifle so attracted to you, Pearls? Pearl: Errr... I don't know... Phoenix: (Hmm... Looks like she's still not ready to talk about it.) You had an object with you that smelled fishy, too. In fact, I think this has something to do with your secret. Present Calendar Phoenix: Leads to: \"The fishy smelling calendar has something to do with your secret, doesn't it, Pearls?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Pearl: I'm sorry, Mr. Nick... ...but I don't see how that relates to me. Phoenix: (I guess that wasn't it. The key here is something that smells fishy.) Let me try that again, Pearls. Leads back to: \"In fact, I think this has something to do with your secret.\" Phoenix: The fishy-smelling calendar has something to do with your secret, doesn't it, Pearls? Pearl: A-Aaaaaaah! I... I can't lie to you, Mr. Nick... I'll tell you about me and Mr. Marlon, and about the calendar. 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Phoenix: (Whew. It was only one lock, but it sure took some work!) Relation to Rimes (after breaking Psyche-Lock) Phoenix: Please tell me about your relationship with Mr. Rimes. Pearl: I became distracted by the gift shop almost as soon as we got to the aquarium. Before I knew it, everyone else had moved on, and I got lost. I was so embarrassed to be lost at my age! Phoenix: Oh, Pearls. I know big, crowded places are hard for you. Pearl: I sort of panicked... and went down the wrong corridor. I ended up in the food prep room, and that's where I met Mr. Marlon. I really startled him when I called out to him. He jumped so much, he startled me, too, and I lost my balance and fell down. Oh, Mr. Nick! I spilled so many fish all over the floor! Phoenix: I guess that explains why you smell fishy, pardon the pun. Pearl: Yes. And my calendar fell off my bag and got buried in all the fish, too. Phoenix: (But it doesn't explain why Pearls wanted to keep it a secret.) Why did you hide it? (appears after \"Relation to Rimes\") Phoenix: Why did you want to hide your meeting with Mr. Rimes? Pearl: Well, I didn't want him to get in trouble over feed sanitation regulations because of me. And Mr. Marlon said he didn't want anyone to know he was in the food prep room. Phoenix: Huh? Why not? What was he doing in there? Pearl: Before I spoke to him, he was staring at a calendar. But, because of me, he dropped his calendar, too. We had to search for it among the fish. Athena: Wait a minute... This calendar of yours... It already has writing in it! Pearl: It does? But I didn't write anything in it yet! Athena: There's something written here under today's date. \"Meet the captain at the orca pool at 7 AM.\" Pearl: Maybe my calendar and Mr. Marlon's got mixed up? Phoenix: Pearls, about what time did you run into Mr. Rimes? Pearl: I think it was about 10:15 when he had the info desk announce that I was lost... So I must have first gone into the prep room at about 10:10. Phoenix: I see... Do you mind if I hang on to this calendar for a while? It might be a clue to the victim's movements before he was killed. Pearl: ...All right. But be sure to give it back to Mr. Marlon later, okay? Calendar updated in the Court Record. Phoenix: (Good. Now maybe I'm ready to remove Ms. DePlume's Psyche-Locks, too.) Why did you hide it? (subsequent times) Phoenix: Why did you want to hide your meeting with Mr. Rimes? Pearl: Well, I didn't want him to get in trouble over feed sanitation regulations because of me. And Mr. Marlon said he didn't want anyone to know he was in the food prep room. Phoenix: Huh? Why not? What was he doing in there? Pearl: Before I spoke to him, he was staring at a calendar. But, because of me, he dropped his calendar, too. We had to search for it among the fish. Athena: Wait a minute... This calendar of yours... It already has writing in it! Pearl: It does? But I didn't write anything in it yet! Athena: There's something written here under today's date. \"Meet the captain at the orca pool at 7 AM.\" Pearl: Maybe my calendar and Mr. Marlon's got mixed up? Phoenix: Pearls, about what time did you run into Mr. Rimes? Pearl: I think it was about 10:15 when he had the info desk announce that I was lost...

It might be a clue to the victim's movements before he was killed. Pearl: ...All right. But be sure to give it back to Mr. Marlon later, okay? Phoenix: (Good. Now maybe I'm ready to remove Ms. DePlume's Psyche-Locks, too.) After clearing \"Why did you hide it?\" Talk option in Shipshape Aquarium - Aqua Tunnel: July 20Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' Danger DePlume: You people again? You're becoming quite the nuisance. If that veterinarian won't come out, then I might just have to give up and leave. Athena: Veterinarian...? Is that the \"Dr. Crab\" Mr. Rimes was talking about? DePlume: You are correct. He likes to shut himself up in that back room there and won't come out. But I don't think he's even in there today, so I'm about ready to go home. Phoenix: (She sure seems to know a lot about the workings of this aquarium. And maybe a little something about the incident this morning, too.) Athena: Mr. Wright! This is no time to be standing there thinking to yourself! It's time to put your psychedelic clock skills to work and uncover her secret! Phoenix: That's \"Psyche-Lock,\" Athena. \"Psyche-Lock.\" Talk Why you're here Athena: I thought they closed the aquarium and weren't letting members of the public in? DePlume: Oh ho ho! But I have special permission, you see. Phoenix: And why exactly is that, if I may ask? DePlume: Well, because of the incide-- Heavens! I've said too much. 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (All right. Now that I can see her Psyche-Locks again... ...I just have to tap my Magatama to start removing them!) Present Magatama Phoenix: 2 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Why You're Here -- Phoenix: Ms. DePlume, I want you to tell me the secret you're hiding. DePlume: I'll do nothing of the sort! It would mean breaking my promise. Phoenix: I don't know who you made this promise to... but you WILL tell me. You're not an aquarium employee, and yet, here you are, after the place has closed. That must mean you're connected to the incident involving the owner somehow. DePlume: Oh ho ho! I don't know anything about any \"incident\" involving the owner. Phoenix: No, I think you do. I have a piece of evidence here that suggests you DO know something. Present Security Footage Phoenix: Leads to: \"According to Detective Fulbright, this shows the orca attacking the victim.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: You won't be able to evade my question once you've seen this! DePlume: ...What is the point of showing me that, blue boy? Phoenix: Er... (I guess this wasn't it. I know I have something here somewhere that shows Ms. DePlume knows something.) ...All right, then. Let me try one more time. Leads back to: \"I have a piece of evidence here that suggests you DO know something.\" Phoenix: According to Detective Fulbright, this shows the orca attacking the victim. And the person in this footage... is wearing an outfit just like yours, Ms. DePlume. DePlume: Oh! I suppose there is no hiding this bombshell figure, is there? Yes, it is I. 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: And I think I can guess why you're here at the aquarium. You aren't simply a visitor to the aquarium; what you really are is... A police investigator Phoenix: You are a police investigator. DePlume: Oh ho ho! You're completely off the mark. I think you know full well that I am NOT a police investigator. Phoenix: (I full well did NOT know that.) Leads back to: \"You aren't simply a visitor to the aquarium; what you really are is...\" A witness to the murder Leads to: \"You are a visitor who also happened to witness the death of owner Jack Shipley.\" A Shipshape employee Phoenix: I've got it! You are... (Now, what did they call them here again...?) You're a \"crew member\" of Shipshape Aquarium! DePlume: Oh ho ho! What amusing jokes you tell, blue boy. Even a child could tell you I am NOT an employee here. And please don't call them \"crew members.\" Have you no self-respect at all? Phoenix: (Ack! All right, fine. It's not like I wanted to call them that in the first place!) Leads back to: \"You aren't simply a visitor to the aquarium; what you really are is...\" Phoenix: You are a visitor who also happened to witness the death of owner Jack Shipley. DePlume: That is cor-- Oh, I want to say it! But I promised the police... Phoenix: It's not good for you to keep things inside, you know. I'm sure you'll feel much better once you get it all out. DePlume: I-I-I... I give up! I'll tell you everythiiiiiiiiiiiiiing! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Phoenix: (If she wanted to tell me this badly, why couldn't she have just done so from the top?) DePlume: I think anyone would agree that I held it in for as long as I could! But I couldn't be expected to withstand this commoner's badgering any longer! Phoenix: P-Please calm yourself, Ms. DePlume! (And that's \"top-class badgering\" to you!) DePlume: You are correct. I witnessed the killer whale's crime with my own eyes! You got a problem with that, blue boy?! Athena: Boss, Ms. DePlume's anger is so powerful... ...even I feel like I'm about to explode! You have to do something! Quick! Phoenix: (Please don't explode on me...) Why you're here (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: Could you start with telling me what you saw? DePlume: I witnessed the very moment the killer whale attacked the victim. I told the police what I saw as well. I'm the sort of person who simply can't rest until the truth is known. Phoenix: (Hmm... So both Ms. DePlume's statement and the footage point to Orla's guilt...) Athena: Hm? Pardon me, but you seem pretty pleased that you witnessed this incident... DePlume: What? \"Pleased\"? Shame on you! Are you implying that I am happy about an innocent man's death?! Athena: N-No, of course not! I... I just don't get the sense that you were afraid of Orla. It's more like you were... interested in her. DePlume: Are you...? You know, I wasn't sure, but I was thinking that maybe... Are you perhaps one of my fans? Is that how you knew... ...that I am THE nonfiction writer, Norma DePlume?! Athena: Oh! THAT Norma DePlume! Phoenix: So... big fan, huh? Athena: No! I've never even heard of her! DePlume: Well, now that you've figured me out, there's no sense in trying to hide who I am, I suppose. Talking to fans is part of a writer's duty, after all! Oh ho ho! Athena: B-But I'm not a fan, I tell you... Nonfiction writer (appears after \"Why you're here\") Phoenix: So what exactly have you written, Ms. DePlume? DePlume: Oh, my. You mean to say you truly aren't familiar with my work? I write the truth. I take great pride in my craft, you know. I've been gathering information on Orla the killer whale for a year now. I've been very worried about Orla's violent tendencies... And today, my concern was proven to be well justified! Athena: Orla isn't violent! She's a sweet and gentle soul! DePlume: Oh ho ho! The moment you let your guard down with that killer whale... CHOMP! Shipshape Aquarium has always denied the killer whale's violent streak. But it has been rumored to attack people... Athena: But rumors are just rumors! They aren't necessarily true! DePlume: Yes, I realize that. But I only write the truth. That is why I questioned the owner directly. But he refused to allow my research, and he even had the audacity to say to me: \"You're nothing but a nuisance, coming here day after day. Don't ever come back again!\" Phoenix: (It sounds like her \"research\" was a bit too much to take...) Athena: But then... how did you get in here if you've been blacklisted? DePlume: I have my methods. Oh ho ho! Phoenix: (This lady is shameless.) Orla's violent streak (appears after \"Nonfiction writer\") Leads to: \"We won't let you speak badly of Orla! We're going to defend her!\" Athena: We won't let you speak badly of Orla! We're going to defend her! DePlume: I'm only stating what I saw with my very own eyes. I came to the aquarium today to observe the killer whale. But on my way to that thing's tank, I heard its cries. Athena: You can hear Orla from the visitor's corridor? DePlume: There are speakers there in the corridor, up near the ceiling. Apparently, that speaker is there so visitors can hear the killer whale's sounds. In any case, as I approached the killer whale's tank, I heard its cries. And when I arrived, I saw something terrifying. Phoenix: What did you see? DePlume: The killer whale stealing the Swashbuckler Spectacular hat the owner was wearing... ...and then, the moment it bit him and shook him mercilessly to death within its jaws! Athena: Wh-Whaaaaaaat?! Phoenix: Orla... bit the owner to death...?! Fulbright: In justice we trust! So I take it Ms. DePlume's just finished telling you what she saw? Phoenix: D-Detective Fulbright! I guess you've already heard it, too? Fulbright: Yup, when we took her statement earlier. As you heard, I'm afraid that accidental death is really the only thing it could be. DePlume: Yes! And a dangerous creature like that cannot be allowed to harm anyone ever again! Phoenix: B-But she's not dangerous! Fulbright: Sorry, but the Prosecutor's Office said the case didn't have enough merit to go to trial. There was one prosecutor, though, who expressed an interest in the case... Phoenix: Really?! Then could we have that prosecutor take a look at the investigation reports? Fulbright: Unfortunately, I doubt even he'd take action without evidence of a homicide... Look, I understand how you feel, Mr. Lawyer, but maybe you should give up on this one? Phoenix: Not a chance. We'll just re-examine the crime scene and strengthen our case. Fulbright: Well, if that's your version of justice, I won't stop you. Athena: And we won't rest until we find proof it wasn't \"accidental death,\" Detective! You'll see! Let's go, Mr. Wright! Time to check out that crime scene one more time! July 20Shipshape Aquarium - Orca Pool Athena: All right, then! Let's start the re-examination! Pronto! I'm going to go check out that mess in the back one more time! Phoenix: Athena! Wait! No running! Athena: Aaaaaaaaagh! Phoenix: A-Are you okay? (It didn't look like she tripped, but...) Athena: *groan* I slipped. Orla: Fweet! Phoenix: Huh? Orla? What is it, girl? Athena: Aaaaaaah! Phoenix: Athena! Are you all right?! (She crashed into all that stuff behind her.) Athena: *groan* I tried to get out of the way, but all I did was slip and fall... again... Phoenix: That was a pretty amazing wipeout. Are you hurt? Athena: I'm okay... But why did Orla spike that ball at me? After all the fish I gave her, I thought she liked me... Phoenix: Maybe she thought you were the main entrée? Athena: Very funny, Boss! Phoenix: Ha ha ha. In any case, let's give the ball back to Orla. Athena: Huh? Looks like everything got shifted around when I fell on it. Phoenix: Hey, you're right. There are things now that we couldn't see before. (Like another ball. I guess Orla really likes them.) Athena: Look! There's something new by the outline of the body, too! Phoenix: We'd better take a good look around. Examine Boxes and props Ball Phoenix: Orla sure can hit that ball hard! Athena: I didn't think she was gonna spike it at me like that. I guess that must mean she likes me! I gladly accept her expression of affection! Phoenix: ...Not how I would've interpreted that, but whatever floats your boat. Octopus leg Phoenix: Looks like we just found that giant octopus prop's missing leg. Athena: Wow. I bet you could get a whole lot of Carpaccio from a giant leg like that! Ooh, let's go to the ocean and try and catch a giant octopus of our own! Phoenix: Yeah, but even if we did catch one, how are you planning to slice it up? Athena: Kein Problem! That's what man invented chainsaws for! Phoenix: (I've never seen anyone so hell-bent on chomping down some giant octopus...)    Well, I doubt we could catch one that big anywhere near the shore, anyway... Athena: The more roadblocks you throw up, the more I want to do it, you know. Ooh, I can't wait to get started! Phoenix: (It would appear that Operation Discourage Insanity has backfired...) Footstep icons Athena: Hey, look at this mark on the floor. What do you suppose it is? Buckler: That's where we stand when we want to play volleyball with Orla. Phoenix: Volleyball, huh? Buckler: Yeah. If we stand there, she'll spike the ball right at us. Athena: So when Orla spiked the ball at me earlier... ...that was one of her tricks?! It doesn't mean she hates me?! Buckler: Nah! She wanted to play with you! She loves volleyball. She used to play with the captain all the time... Athena: Aw... Sasha looks so sad... Buckler: Okay, time to snap out of it! This is no time to be all dejected and mopey like a blobfish! Athena: That's right! Time to put on a smile and stay strong, right? Phoenix: (What's a blobfish? ...Or do I not want to know...) Bloody coin Phoenix: What's this? A coin...? Athena: M-Mr. Wright! There's blood on it! Phoenix: You're right! But it's dried. Athena: Do you think it could be the victim's? And what was it doing all the way over here in the first place? Phoenix: Hmm... I'm not sure, but now that we've found blood outside the pool... ...it just might help us prove that there's more to this case than just \"accidental death.\" Athena: Hey, you're right! Orla certainly can't leave the pool, after all! Bloodstained Coin added to the Court Record. Phoenix: Speaking of coins, take a look at this. There are a few coins around the body here, too. Athena: You're right, Boss! But where did they go? They aren't here anymore. You don't think somebody picked them up, do you? Bloody coin (subsequent times) Phoenix: What's this? A coin...? Athena: M-Mr. Wright! There's blood on it! Phoenix: You're right! But it's dried. Athena: Do you think it could be the victim's? And what was it doing all the way over here in the first place? Phoenix: Hmm... I'm not sure, but now that we've found blood outside the pool... ...it just might help us prove that there's more to this case than just \"accidental death.\" Athena: Hey, you're right! Orla certainly can't leave the pool, after all! Phoenix: Speaking of coins, take a look at this. There are a few coins around the body here, too. Athena: You're right, Boss! But where did they go? They aren't here anymore. You don't think somebody picked them up, do you? Broken sword Phoenix: There's a broken sword here. Athena: Hmm... The tip of the blade is missing. Guess it just broke off. Phoenix: (Don't tell me it happened when Athena fell over...?) Athena: You'd better not be trying to pin the blame on me, Boss! Phoenix: What?! N-No! Of course not! Athena: No use trying to hide it. It's written all over your face! Besides, the broken part isn't even here. How could it have been my fault?! Phoenix: (I'd better watch what I think or I'll get every little thing thrown back in my face.) Dummy Athena: Oh no! That child is hurt! Phoenix: What?! Call an ambulance-- Hey, it's just a dummy. Athena: I-It is?! Oh, I mean, of course it is! I was just testing your response to an emergency. Phoenix: Well, I guess we just found that you don't bluff well under pressure. Athena: Grr! I guess I'll just have to keep practicing, then! I wonder what the dummy is for, anyway? Buckler: Oh, that? We use it to train Orla. It's smaller than a human, but it does the job. Some of our tricks can be pretty dangerous, so Orla practices them on the dummy first. Phoenix: (Forget the tricks, those bite marks look pretty dangerous...) After examining footstep icons, bloody coin, and dummy: Phoenix: Hey, Sasha? Would you happen to know anything about this coin? Buckler: Oh, I guess I missed one. I just finished cleaning up the rest of them. Phoenix: You picked up all of the coins already? Buckler: That's right. After the police finished their investigation, they gave me the go-ahead. I haven't found them all yet, though. I'm still missing a few. Athena: Well, if they aren't beside the pool, maybe they're IN the pool. Let's go to that ladder over there and take a peek at the bottom of the pool, Boss! Examine Left or right side of ladder Phoenix: (I can't see anything from here. I'll have to take a look when I'm by the ladder...) Front side of ladder Bottom of pool Leads to: \"Look! I think I see something on the bottom of the pool.\" Phoenix: Look! I think I see something on the bottom of the pool. Athena: Hee hee! I knew it! Want me to go down and check? Phoenix: You can't jump in dressed like that! You'll drown under the weight of your clothes! Athena: No, I won't! I'm a pretty good swimmer, you know! Phoenix ...Be that as it may, that pool's really deep. I doubt you can hold your breath that long. But maybe Sasha can...? Buckler: Whew! Phoenix! Look at all these coins I found at the bottom! Phoenix: Thanks, Sasha. So there really were more of them down there, huh? Athena: We seem to be finding them all over. I wonder how many there are all together? Buckler: Including the ones I put away, there are three hundred of them. They're for the show. (Changed from [Including the ones I put away, there are 300 of them. They're for the show.] in the original release) Phoenix: Hmm... Sounds like they'd be heavy. Buckler: About seven pounds, I'd say. A little lighter than a stringfish. Well, I'd better go put these coins away where they belong! Athena: So, seven pounds of coins, scattered around the scene, one of them with blood on it... They have to be related to the case! Phoenix: (I wonder how the blood got on that one coin? Wait a minute. Could it be...?) Remember how Detective Fulbright said that they couldn't find a murder weapon? Well, what if these coins were the weapon? Athena: Huh? How could a little coin kill a grown man? Phoenix: Well, one coin by itself isn't much of a threat, but... Three hundred coins together could definitely be used as a weapon. All you'd have to do is... (Changed from [300 coins together could definitely be used as a weapon. All you'd have to do is...] in the original release) Freeze them Phoenix: I bet a frozen lump of coins would make for a pretty good weapon. Athena: But wouldn't it make more sense to freeze just the water into a block of ice? That way, there'd be no evidence of it ever existing once it melted. Phoenix: ...I guess you're right. (But, wait a minute. There IS another way to bundle coins together!) Leads back to: \"Three hundred coins together could definitely be used as a weapon. All you'd have to do is...\" Put them in a bag Leads to: \"If you put seven pounds of coins in a bag and swung it at somebody...\" Throw them Phoenix: I bet you could kill a man if you threw them hard enough. Athena: Hmm... I dunno about that. I think they'd just bounce off. Besides, how could you throw them that hard all at once? Phoenix: Yeah... (Wait a minute...! Maybe there IS a way to bundle them all together...) Leads back to: \"Three hundred coins together could definitely be used as a weapon. All you'd have to do is...\" Phoenix: If you put seven pounds of coins in a bag and swung it at somebody... ...it would make a pretty formidable blunt instrument, wouldn't it? It would explain how blood got on this coin. Athena: Oh, I get it! If that bag of coins is the weapon, then we can use it to prove Orla's innocence! Bloodstained Coin updated in the Court Record. Phoenix: But I don't see anything resembling a coin bag around here. Athena: Maybe the killer took it with them. Phoenix: Yeah, it would certainly make it look like Orla did it if they did... Athena: You know what I think, Mr. Wright?! The bloody coin alone should be enough to prove this might have been a murder! Phoenix: I agree. It shows the possibility of a human killer rather than Orla. Athena: Yes! This is just what we needed! Let's go show this coin to Detective Fulbright and Ms. DePlume right away! Phoenix: Good idea. Let's hope they're still at the Pub O' Danger. July 20Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' Danger Fulbright: Oh, you're back! So did you find anything? DePlume: Of course he didn't! Fulbright: Remember, even if you don't succeed, it's the effort you make that's important! Phoenix: (Is he trying to console me?) Athena: Let's show them the evidence we found! The one that points to a human culprit! Phoenix: Right. Because we won't let Orla be put down. Talk Orla's violent streak Athena: We won't let you speak badly of Orla! We're going to defend her! DePlume: I'm only stating what I saw with my very own eyes. I came to the aquarium today to observe the killer whale. But on my way to that thing's tank, I heard its cries. Athena: You can hear Orla from the visitor's corridor? DePlume: There are speakers there in the corridor, up near the ceiling. Apparently, that speaker is there so visitors can hear the killer whale's sounds. In any case, as I approached the killer whale's tank, I heard its cries. And when I arrived, I saw something terrifying. Phoenix: What did you see? DePlume: The killer whale stealing the Swashbuckler Spectacular hat the owner was wearing... ...and then, the moment it bit him and shook him mercilessly to death within its jaws! Athena: Wh-Whaaaaaaat?! Phoenix: Orla... bit the owner to death...?! Present Bloodstained Coin Leads to: \"Please take a look at this bloodstained coin.\" Phoenix: Please take a look at this bloodstained coin. DePlume: Eeeeeeeeeeeeek! C-Cease and desist, at once! Wh-What kind of a man shows a lady blood? Phoenix: Urk. (She doesn't have to get so worked up...) Fulbright: What are you terrorizing this lady with?! Come on, now. Let's see it. Phoenix: We found this coin beside the orca pool. Fulbright: We did see a large number of coins beside the pool, but not one with blood on it! Phoenix: We just learned that there's three hundred of these, weighing about seven pounds in total. (Changed from [We just learned that there's 300 of these, weighing about seven pounds all together.] in the original release) Now, what do you suppose would happen if a person was assaulted with that many coins? Fulbright: What?! So you're saying the coins might've been used like some kind of blunt weapon?! Phoenix: If the blood belongs to the victim, then yes, it's entirely possible! Fulbright: Hmm... But I wouldn't call it decisive proof that the real culprit was human... Phoenix: Y-You wouldn't?! Why not?! Fulbright: Because there'd have to be something to put the coins in to make them into a weapon. Without that \"something\", it's just not going to be enough to pass muster. But I will say that your theory does seem to warrant further investigation. I'll call the Prosecutor's Office and ask to reinvestigate from a possible criminal angle. Phoenix: ...You will?! Thank you very much! Athena: I really hope Detective Fulbright can convince them... Fulbright: Hmmmm... You won't believe the answer I got. When I explained your passion for this case, and the police's investigation... ...they said that the prosecutor I mentioned earlier would be willing to take this to court. Phoenix: Really?! So does that mean a new suspect has emerged? Fulbright: No, I'm afraid not... To be frank... ...Prosecutor Blackquill said he just wants to prove that orca's guilt in court! Athena: WHAAAAAAAT?! It's Prosecutor Blackquill that wants to prosecute Orla?! Phoenix: ...That's fine, Detective. Thanks for arranging this for us. Fulbright: Well, I must say you're taking this rather calmly. Phoenix: Defending Orla in court was my idea from the start. And I'll do whatever it takes to save her. Fulbright: Hmm... In that case, I'll do whatever I can as well to see that justice is served. Ms. DePlume, will you be a witness for the prosecution? DePlume: A trial for a killer whale? I've never heard of such recklessness before in my life! But I will reveal the truth about this killer whale, and then write all about it! Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Sounds like a plan! Now, if you'll just come along with me... We have to prepare for tomorrow, and I still have to arrange for an autopsy. DePlume: Oh ho ho! I look forward to tomorrow! Until then, blue lawyer and yellow fan. Athena: I AM NOT A FAN! Phoenix: ...Well, at least we managed to get the case to go to trial. Athena: But how in the world do we defend an orca in court, anyway? Phoenix: To be honest, I'm not really sure myself. Athena: Plus, Ms. DePlume said Orla bit the victim... This trial sure isn't going to be easy... ...but I love a challenge! Phoenix: Ha ha ha. Then we ought to be just fine. Guess I should go over that Swashbuckler Spectacular you were watching this morning. Athena: Yeah! We can have a formal viewing back at the office! Phoenix: (There's nothing decisive against Orla in the security tape, but that doesn't mean much. I'll just have to find a more concrete way to save Orla at tomorrow's trial or else!) To be continued Orca Pool (before correctly presenting Bloodstained Coin in Shipshape Aquarium - Pub O' Danger) Examine Ladder Phoenix: (I guess I've seen enough of the inside the pool... [sic] but maybe just one more look.) Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: (Nothing much to see here.) Area already examined Phoenix: (I guess we already checked this out, but no harm in giving it another look.) Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I think I have enough evidence, but maybe I should do a bit more thinking first...)\n-- The Moment of the Murder --DePlume: I went to Shipshape Aquarium to see the killer whale.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why did you want to see the orca? DePlume: Well, it IS the featured attraction of the aquarium, after all.  Blackquill: Hmph. Why waste energy on such tripe? There is but one attraction in Shipshape Aquarium that is worth anyone's time... ...and that is the penguins. Isn't that right, Taka, my friend? Phoenix: (All righty then. I guess Prosecutor Blackquill is for the birds.)  Athena: Guess I should jot that down. Note to self: Prosecutor Blackquill is on Team Rifle. Judge: And so you went to see the orca in its tank? DePlume: Yes, that's right.DePlume: As I was watching the killer whale from the visitor's corridor, it suddenly went crazy!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The orca suddenly went crazy, did she? DePlume: Yes. It took a look at me, and then, all at once, it started going berserk! Phoenix: Did you do anything to make her angry? DePlume: I did nothing more than simply glare at it from the visitor's corridor! Phoenix: (She glared at Orla?) And that's what caused her to go berserk? Blackquill: Blackquill: The reason the defendant went mad is not the issue here. Only what she did once she entered that state. DePlume: In any case, the killer whale began behaving wildly in front of my very eyes. And then...DePlume: I saw the killer whale bite the victim to death with its huge mouth and deadly teeth!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you're saying you saw the very moment of the victim's death? DePlume: That is exactly what I'm saying! Oh, it was simply dreadful! It was as frightening as losing one's manuscript just before a deadline! Phoenix: (I suppose for a writer, that would be pretty terrifying...)  DePlume: I witnessed the killer whale's horrific act, and I knew I had to do something, so...Present Shipley's Autopsy Report Phoenix: Leads to: \"It would seem that you are mistaken, Ms. DePlume.\"DePlume: Attempting to remain calm, I reported the incident to the police immediately.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Why were the police the first ones you contacted? DePlume: I was afraid if I told aquarium staff, they might try to cover it up. Of course, I immediately told aquarium security after my call to the police. I believe I deserve praise for my swift decision-making skills under pressure! Phoenix: ...Ms. DePlume is the most assertive witness I've ever seen. Athena: We'd better do our best to look like big-shot lawyers if we want to match her intensity! Phoenix: Ms. DePlume, I praise your swift decision-making skills under pressure! Athena: That was more \"kiss up\" than \"big shot\"... Judge: I suppose it was unrealistic to expect \"big shot\" from Mr. Wright... Blackquill: Hmph. How fitting for a small fry to praise a big shot. Phoenix: (How about cutting this small fry some slack, you big meanies?)Phoenix: (The important thing here is, did she really see the \"moment of the murder\"?)Athena: You're raring to go, aren't you, Mr. Wright? I see it in your eyes... and in your heart!Phoenix: Ha ha ha. I guess I really am a lawyer at heart.Phoenix: It would seem that you are mistaken, Ms. DePlume.DePlume: I beg your pardon?!Phoenix: The autopsy report does indeed say, \"Death thought to be result of orca attack\"... ...but the actual cause of death is \"contusion from head trauma,\" not \"being bitten\"!DePlume: What?! B-But...! But... I'm sure the victim was bitten!Phoenix: I don't believe that can be true. The security footage doesn't show anything of the kind.Blackquill:Blackquill: Hmph............ Just as I suspected. I knew you would peek at the footage behind Fool Bright's back.Phoenix: (Well, what did you expect when he wouldn't play nice and share?)Blackquill: But, unfortunately for you... ...the footage you saw was only one small part.Phoenix: Huh?Blackquill: Yesterday, after I decided to take this case to trial, I re-reviewed all of the evidence. Taka, the evidence I gave to you for safekeeping.Taka: Screech!Phoenix: (Guess that hawk is higher up on the pecking order than Fulbright in Blackquill's book.)Judge: Hmm... Very well. Let's view the footage. Wh-What's this?! The orca is biting the victim!Phoenix: N-No waaaaaay!Judge: I have to say that this appears to be very damning evidence.Security Footage updated in the Court Record.Athena: No... I can't believe Orla really bit him!Blackquill: And there is more... Look at this. This photograph was taken while the body was being examined.Judge: Hmm... There seems to be a strange bruise on the victim's right wrist.Blackquill:  I'll have the crime lab examine the bruise and calculate its relevance to the case at hand. What's important right now is evidence that points to the orca as the killer. Look at the left side of the body. See the orca's tooth marks in the victim's clothes?Judge: Yes! They do appear to suggest that she did, in fact, bite the victim.Phoenix: ...!Photo of the Body updated in the Court Record.DePlume: I told you so! And then the killer whale swam up toward the surface with the victim in its mouth!Phoenix:Phoenix: H-However! In the autopsy report, the cause of death is \"contusion from head trauma\"!Blackquill:Blackquill: You are much too impetuous, Wright-dono. Granted, the orca biting the victim was not the cause of death. The witness was mistaken about that.Judge: Then what explanation is there for what the witness saw?!Blackquill:  Did I not say in the beginning, \"The orca toyed with the victim mercilessly\"?Judge: M-My goodness!Blackquill:  After killing the victim, the defendant swam around with his dead body in her mouth. Just like any other predator toying with its prey!Phoenix: (Nrgh...!)Athena: M-Mr. Wright! The hearts of the people in the gallery are suddenly filled with fear -- fear of Orla!Judge: So the defendant bit the victim after she had killed him... But if that's the case, then we must still figure out how the defendant killed the victim. Prosecutor Blackquill, do you have a sound theory to give to this court?Blackquill:  I wouldn't be standing here if I couldn't prove whether the orca's heart was black or white.Athena: But Orla is black AND white! ...Her body, I mean.Phoenix: Athena, please try not to provoke Prosecutor Blackquill.Blackquill: The witness also observed the actual moment of the murder. Think back, Word Mistress. Think back to what you observed before the orca bit the victim.DePlume: ...Ah, I see what you're driving at. So that was the true moment of the murder, was it?Blackquill: Now, explain it in a way that even these simpletons can understand.DePlume: There you go again, ordering me around! Stop that this instant! But whatever... I don't mind telling my story. I saw the killer whale before it toyed with the body as well. I saw it the moment it killed the victim by head-butting him!Phoenix: O-Orla killed the victim by head-butting him?!DePlume: That's right. It rammed the victim over and over again.Blackquill: Recall that the autopsy report stated that there were bruises all over his body. Recall as well, how persistent the defendant can be when she's attacking her prey.DePlume: And we all just saw the killer whale head-butting the victim in the footage, don't forget.Phoenix: (Hmm... That footage backs up Ms. DePlume's testimony... But there's also something very important it does NOT show...!)DePlume: Now do you see what a menace this killer whale is?Phoenix:Phoenix: I'm sorry, but I can't allow your testimony to stand unchallenged. Looking at this footage, the orca certainly seems to be head-butting something... ...but you'll note that the \"something\" is not the victim!DePlume: Oh! ...Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!Phoenix: (I want to look away... but I can't...) Even if it was the victim, you couldn't have seen him from where you were, could you?DePlume: ............What? O-Oh. Well... I suppose not...Phoenix: Ms. DePlume, did you actually witness the victim getting head-butted by the defendant?DePlume: Ah, let's see... Oh, I remember now! As I recall, a rock in the shape of a skull was obstructing my view.Judge: So are you admitting that you couldn't see the victim?DePlume: Yes... Yes, I suppose I am. However! Immediately after the head-butting, the victim came floating up! He came up from behind the skull-shaped rock, and his body was all limp. What else could I think except that the killer whale was head-butting the victim?!Phoenix:Phoenix: But if you didn't actually see the moment of attack itself, then it's pure conjecture!Blackquill:Blackquill: *sigh* Must I do everything around here?DePlume: H-How dare you speak so rudely to me?!Blackquill: There's no need for hysterics. Clear your mind and recall how you reached your conclusion. Though you couldn't see what the orca was attacking, you didn't need to, did you? Because you knew she was behaving exactly as she had only one year prior.DePlume: Oh!Phoenix: (One year ago...?)DePlume: That's right! Yes, that's it! That's how I knew the killer whale was head-butting the victim!Phoenix: I'm sorry, but could someone explain exactly what happened a year ago?Blackquill: If you must know, a very similar incident occurred only last year, in which... ...the defendant murdered her trainer.Judge: Wh-Whaaaaaaat?! The orca murdered her trainer, you say?!Phoenix: What?! Is this really true?! (This is not looking good for us!)Blackquill: It's all in this book.Judge: That book... \"The Killer Killer Whale\"...! That's Ms. DePlume's latest work! I was just thinking of picking that up.\"The Killer Killer Whale\" added to the Court Record.Blackquill: Last year, the defendant killed her trainer in the middle of a show. The orca head-butted and bit the victim.Phoenix: (The same thing she's accused of in this case!)Woman:That orca killed two people?!Man:That thing is a menace! Guilty! Guilty, I say!Man:I never want to go to the beach again!Athena: No! Now everyone's even more convinced that Orla did it!Phoenix: (We were doing so well, but now... Now everyone in the room has a bad impression of Orla. I don't want to think she did it... ...but it's hard to keep on believing in somebody who can't even tell me her side...)Orla: Fwee, fweet?Buckler: Phoenix! Athena! You gotta believe in Orla! There's no way she killed anybody! You gotta save her! Please, I'm begging you!Phoenix: Sasha... (What am I doing, doubting my client like this? This is the time to be strong!)Athena: I believe in Orla! And I'm ready to fight for our clients! I'll take everybody in this courtroom on if I have to!Phoenix: Don't you worry, Sasha. We won't give up on Orla. We'll defend her to the very end!Buckler: Thank you! Thank you, both of you!Orla: Fweet, fweet!Phoenix: (We are Orla's lawyers. Who else but us can save her?! We can't give up on her now!)Blackquill: Hmph... For an instant there, you were afraid of the orca, weren't you, Wright-dono. When you saw the photograph of the victim from a year ago, you turned paler than me.Phoenix: ! (He saw right through me!)Blackquill: It's obvious you have neither the guts nor the determination to defend the orca.Phoenix: It's true that Orla can't speak, and I don't know her thoughts... ...but there's a certain someone who believes in Orla with all her heart. I respect the trust she has in Orla, so I'm willing to believe in Orla, too.Blackquill: Hmph. And what do you know about orcas? Nothing, that's what. So, allow me to fill you in. Do you have any idea why orcas are also called \"killer whales\"? Because they are cunning and merciless predators that hunt and kill even true whales.Judges: So \"killer whales\" really are \"killers\"! What terrifying creatures indeed...Blackquill: I can't bear to hear any more of such rubbish as \"trusting a killer.\" Can you, Your Baldness?Phoenix: No matter what you say, I will continue to believe. I don't give up that easily, you know.Blackquill: ............Dullard. You don't know when to give up, do you? Very well. I shall give you a chance to prove just how determined you are. Witness, spare no quarter and lay the full truth on them.DePlume: Oh ho ho! But of course! That is what I do, after all.Judge: Prosecutor Blackquill, what will you have the witness testify about?Blackquill: I shall have her testify about what she saw, and what she heard.Phoenix: What she heard...?Judge: Very well. Ms. DePlume, please tell the court what you saw and what you heard.Witness Testimony-- What I Saw and What I Heard --DePlume: The killer whale's behavior was exactly the same as a year ago.  As I approached the pool, the killer whale suddenly started singing. I was calm when I saw it start to head-butt. But when the pirate hat and victim came floating up, I let out a scream!Judge: Hmm... So the orca displayed the same behavior as during the incident a year ago...DePlume: That's right! Those weren't just simple cries. It was singing! As I approached the pool, the killer whale suddenly started singing! It kept head-butting while it sang the Swashbuckler Spectacular song! That's right. It was singing the same song it sang in the aquarium's stage show back then. It was singing while it was head-butting! Oh, it was perfectly horrible!Phoenix: (Hmm... I don't see a single obvious inconsistency in this testimony. It's clear I won't be able to take her apart her statements with evidence alone.)Athena: Mr. Wright! Now would be a good time for me to put my skills to work! It's time to show what analytical psychology can really do!Phoenix: You seem pretty confident. Let me guess. You noticed a contradiction between the testimony and her emotions?Athena: You bet I did! And once we expose it, we just might be able to crack her. No, scratch that. Make it, \"we'll definitely be able to\"!Phoenix: Then let's give your knowledge of analytical psychology a try!Athena: You got it, Boss! A complete analysis of Ms. DePlume's heart, coming right up!DePlume: The killer whale's behavior was exactly the same as a year ago.DePlume: As I approached the pool...DePlume: ...the killer whale suddenly started singing.DePlume: I was calm when I saw it start to head-butt.Pinpoint Sad marker Phoenix: Leads to: \"Ms. DePlume, Orla really frightened you with her head-butting, didn't she?\"DePlume: But when the pirate hat and victim came floating up, I let out a scream!Athena: Do you see any emotions that seem odd or out of place? Pay attention to not only which emotions you see, but how strong they are, too. An emotion might suddenly get stronger, for example, or you might see it grow weaker.Phoenix: (Okay. Let me listen to her testimony again.)Phoenix: Ms. DePlume, Orla really frightened you with her head-butting, didn't she?DePlume: Don't be absurd! I certainly was NOT frightened by the likes of any killer whale!Athena: It must've been something else that scared her, then, Boss.DePlume: However... I do remember being very afraid for some reason while it was doing that.Athena: It sounds like maybe you saw something we haven't discussed yet. Take your time and try to remember what it was... What did you see?Phoenix: (This is practically turning into a counseling session.)DePlume: ............ I... saw something...? ...Oh! Aaaaaaaaaaaagh! I-I remember now!NOISE LEVEL50%Athena: Okay, good! Now, if you could please tell the court what you saw!DePlume: I saw... I saw... I saw... bright red blood! The killer whale's ramming caused the victim to bleed. There was a great cloud of blood!Phoenix: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!DePlume: Yes, that's it! That's why I was so sure! That's when I knew that killer whale had killed a person for a second time!Judge: Well! That was a very compelling statement indeed. Looking at this again, there does appear to be something that could be a cloud of blood.Phoenix: (So her terror was a reaction to blood, was it? That would certainly explain what happened yesterday...)Phoenix: Please take a look at this bloodstained coin.DePlume: Eeeeeeeeeeeeek! C-Cease and desist, at once! Wh-What kind of man shows a lady blood?Phoenix: Urk. (She doesn't have to get so worked up...)DePlume: I was badly injured during an interview once. Ever since then, I've been terrified of blood. The very sight of it dreadfully upsets my delicate sensibilities.Phoenix: (This is a bad turn... If Ms. DePlume saw blood... ...then does that mean Orla really did attack the victim...?)Blackquill: It would appear that orcas are even more vicious than I am. So, how does it feel to be thoroughly rammed by your own cross-examination, Wright-dono?Athena: Wh-What do we do now, Boss?!Phoenix: Argh... That testimony was not at all what I expected to hear...Athena: Wait a minute... There's still some discord left in Ms. DePlume's heart.Phoenix: What? You mean there's more?Athena: Yes, but there's no telling what it is. It could be something even more damaging...Phoenix: (Ugh... Is there even anything left of our case to damage...? Well, whatever it is, we have to face it head-on.) Athena, you believe in Orla, right? If so, there's no reason for us to shy away from the truth.Athena: ...Yeah, you're right!Phoenix: I know we can handle the truth, whatever it is, so let's delve a little deeper!Athena: You've got it, Boss!DePlume: The killer whale's behavior was exactly the same as a year ago.DePlume: As I approached the pool...DePlume: ...the killer whale suddenly started singing.DePlume: After it started head-butting, I saw that awful blood and was terrified.DePlume: But when the pirate hat and victim came floating up, I let out a scream!Pinpoint Sad marker Phoenix: Leads to: \"Huh? Her fear appears to lessen here at this statement.\"Athena: Do you see any emotions that seem odd or out of place? Pay attention to not only which emotions you see, but how strong they are, too. An emotion might suddenly get stronger, for example, or you might see it grow weaker.Phoenix: (Okay. Let me listen to her testimony again.)Phoenix: (Huh? Her fear appears to lessen here at this statement.) Ms. DePlume, weren't you afraid when you saw the victim with blood coming out of him?DePlume: My, that's a very good question. I was shaken after witnessing a murder, yes, but then... the blood seemed to disappear...Phoenix: Disappear? And why do you suppose that was?DePlume: Simple! It was because of the pirate hat! After the killer whale put the hat on, the cloud of blood disappeared!Phoenix:Phoenix: And how exactly does that work...?DePlume: How should I know?! I'm just telling you what I remember, blue boy!Phoenix: (Wait a minute... From whom was this blood that Ms. DePlume saw actually coming from?)Present Ora Shipley profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Consider this.\"Present anyone else Phoenix: Phoenix: Maybe somebody else was bleeding in the orca pool, somebody such as this! Blackquill: Do you see an injury anywhere on that individual?! And when exactly was this individual supposed to have entered the pool?! Judge: I don't think you're ready to play in the deep end just yet, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: I-I'll be right back with some floaties, Your Honor... (Hold on... \"Entered the pool\"...? What if this individual didn't \"enter\" the pool, but was already \"in\" the pool...? Who else was in the pool besides the victim?)  Leads back to: \"From whom was this blood that Ms. DePlume saw actually coming from?\"Phoenix: Consider this. Maybe the one who was bleeding wasn't the victim.DePlume: I beg your pardon? What kind of ridiculous nonsense is that? There was no one else in that pool beside the victim!Phoenix: Oh, I wouldn't say there was no one else. It IS an orca pool, after all.Blackquill: What?! Then where is this alleged injury on the defendant?!Phoenix: I'm not sure. But if simply wearing the pirate hat made the blood \"disappear\"... ...then the blood must've been coming from somewhere on Orla's head!DePlume: Wh-Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?!Blackquill: The orca's head? What are you prattling on about now?!Athena: Please think about it again, Ms. DePlume! Think back to what you really saw!DePlume: Errr... I... That is... Th-The one who was bleeding was not the victim, but the killer whale...? Ngh... I remember now! There wasn't any blood coming from the victim after all!NOISE LEVEL0%BYE BYEAthena: We did it! Analytical psychology got us what we needed from her!Phoenix: That was a huge help, Athena. (It was also pretty dicey for a while, though.)Judge: Well! This is a surprise! The blood the witness saw was the defendant's, not the victim's!Phoenix: That is correct. And since there was no blood coming from the victim... ...there's only one thing we can conclude. That what Ms. DePlume witnessed was not the \"moment of the murder,\" as she claims!Blackquill:Blackquill: I thought you were unarmed, but it turns out you were concealing a sword all along. Nevertheless... it is far too dull to cut to the bone.Phoenix: Meaning...?Blackquill: I grant that what the witness saw was not the victim's blood, but it proves nothing. After all, being rammed doesn't always result in a wound that bleeds, does it? Death from internal hemorrhaging is also a possibility.Phoenix: ...! (He has a point there.)Blackquill: If you wish to challenge me to a duel, you'll need a sharper blade than that, Wright-dono. I demand evidence that proves the witness did not see the moment of the murder!Phoenix: Ack! (There must be something. Think, Phoenix! If I'm correct, then the victim's death occurred...)Before DePlume saw it Leads to: \"If the victim was already dead when Orla started her head-butting...\"After DePlume saw it Phoenix: (If the victim was alive when Orla started her head-butting... ...then that would basically make Orla the one who killed him. But since I don't think she did it, then we must be wrong about when it took place.)          Leads to: \"If the victim was already dead when Orla started her head-butting...\"Phoenix: (If the victim was already dead when Orla started her head-butting... ...then that would mean he died sometime before Ms. DePlume was watching her. The events Ms. DePlume witnessed took place at around 10:10 AM. I must have something that can tell us about what happened before 10:10 AM!)Present Security Footage Phoenix: Leads to: \"We've only seen the footage from 10:09 to 10:10 AM.\"Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: This is the evidence that proves Ms. DePlume did not see the moment of the murder! Athena: Huh? I'm not sure that's really related to what Ms. DePlume did or didn't witness. Phoenix: ............But you're not sure, right...? Blackquill: No, we can be quite sure it's unrelated. Judge: Yes, quite. Phoenix: (Ouch. I guess we can be...)          Leads back to: \"The events Ms. DePlume witnessed took place at around 10:10 AM.\"Phoenix: (We've only seen the footage from 10:09 to 10:10 AM. Which means... there's still footage going further back that we need to check!) Your Honor, I request that ALL of the security footage be played for the court.Judge: All of the footage?Phoenix: Ms. DePlume witnessed the cloud of blood at around 10:10 AM. But I believe the victim was already dead by that time.Judge: So your assertion is that the murder took place before Ms. DePlume arrived?Phoenix: Exactly. The security camera footage starts at 10:00 AM when the aquarium opened. And I believe there is vital evidence in the ten minutes before!Blackquill: Hmph............ You are quite the gambling man, Wright-dono. Are you honestly willing to risk everything on those mere ten minutes?Phoenix: (I've bet on slimmer chances before, but when he puts it that way...)Athena:Athena: My boss is no coward, Prosecutor Blackquill, so I suggest you get ready to eat humble pie!Phoenix: (Uh-oh. I can't back down now...)Judge: Well, if the defense is that confident in its importance... Prosecutor Blackquill, the security footage.Blackquill: ............Fool Bright.Fulbright: Roger! I have the rest of the security footage right here!Judge: Very well. Please play it for the court.Phoenix: (Please, PLEASE have something for me!)Fulbright: This is what it looked like at 10:10 AM. The witness can be seen here. All right. I'll just back the footage up to the beginning now!Judge: Hmm... It appears Ms. DePlume hasn't arrived yet at this point.Phoenix: (Now to see if I can find something from before this point in time!)Judge: ............Blackquill: ............Phoenix: ............ Is that it?Fulbright: Yep! That's all the footage there is!Judge: Well, Mr. Wright? Did you see what you were looking for?Athena: W-We got nothin'...Blackquill: Hmph............ Well, Wright-dono? Those were the ten minutes you placed your bet on. Did you see anything of significance?Phoenix: (...Did I see anything important? I'd better think about this carefully...) In the footage, we see...!Something important Phoenix: This is the important thing the footage shows! Present anywhere Phoenix: Judge: Hmm? And what is so vital about that point, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Different things are important to different people. \"Importance\" is a subjective thing! Judge: Yes, just as my decision to assign a penalty is a \"subjective thing.\" Phoenix: Urk. (Wait a minute... What if something that SHOULD be in the footage isn't there...?) P-Please wait, Your Honor! Um... That footage... Leads back to: \"In the footage, we see...!\"Nothing important Leads to: \"We can see nothing of importance in that footage.\"Phoenix: We can see nothing of importance in that footage.Blackquill: Hmph. Just as I thought.Fulbright: Ha ha ha! You're right about that! That section was completely meaningless! It doesn't show a thing. That's why I didn't submit it as evidence!Phoenix:Phoenix: No. It's just the opposite.Fulbright: Huh? What do you mean by that?Phoenix: In this ten minutes of footage, something important that SHOULD be there isn't there! Detective Fulbright, this footage should have been submitted as evidence.Fulbright: What? Are you questioning the way I carry out my duty to justice?!Judge: Mr. Wright! Explain yourself, please! What is this important thing that you say should be in the footage, but isn't?Present Photo of the Body Phoenix: Leads to: \"The important thing we should see in the footage is the victim himself, Jack Shipley.\"Present anything else Phoenix: Blackquill: And what is the problem you perceive if that particular object isn't in the footage? Phoenix: There is no problem, which is exactly why it is a problem, right?! Judge: While I admire your enthusiasm, please don't think you can wing it on enthusiasm alone. I would further like to suggest that your attitude is a problem, Mr. Wright.  Phoenix: ...My apologies, Your Honor. (If the victim was alive, there's something we should see in the footage...) I still content that there is something important that is not in this footage. Judge: If that is your contention, please back it up with evidence. Leads back to: \"What is this important thing that you say should be in the footage, but isn't?\"Phoenix: The important thing we should see in the footage is the victim himself, Jack Shipley. I don't know about you, but I didn't see him get in the pool in that footage.Judge: Oh!Blackquill: ............!Fulbright: Aaaaagh! That's right!Phoenix: If the victim is not shown entering the pool in this footage... ...it means that he must have been there by the skull rock during those ten minutes. But no human being can hold their breath underwater for that long.Fulbright: W-Wait a minute... Are you saying...?!Phoenix: When the security camera started up at 10 AM, the victim was already dead!Fulbright: WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT?!Judge: Order! Order in the court! If that's the case, then when was the victim murdered?!Phoenix: I don't know, Your Honor, but we now know it had to have been sometime before 10 AM. Therefore, this footage can no longer be called decisive evidence against my client!Blackquill: Hmph. But there is no one else who could have killed the victim.Phoenix: Not necessarily. The defense believes that the true culprit may have been human. And we have evidence to back up our theory as well!Blackquill: Do you, now? I would be very interested in seeing this evidence.Phoenix: (The defense's trump card -- that thing we found during our investigation yesterday... I wouldn't go so far as to call it \"decisive,\" but... ...now's the time to play it!)Judge: Very well, Mr. Wright. Please submit your evidence. What evidence shows that the crime may have been committed by a human?Present Bloodstained Coin Phoenix: Leads to: \"What's this? A coin...?\"Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: And that substantiates your claim how...? Athena: What are you doing?! That's not the right piece at all, Boss! Phoenix: ...That's what I was just thinking myself, judging by the judge's expression... Judge: Mr. Wright! You will refrain from presenting evidence you're not sure about just to feel me out! Phoenix: (Ugh... I must still be rusty, but this time, I'll present our real trump card!)         Judge: Let's try again, Mr. Wright. Leads back to: \"What evidence shows that the crime may have been committed by a human?\"Judge: What's this? A coin...?Phoenix: Yes, a fake coin used in the aquarium's pirate show. We found it beside the pool. This coin is quite possibly the real murder weapon.Judge: This tiny little coin... is the murder weapon? Mr. Wright! If this is another one of your bluffs...!Blackquill: Hmph. As they say, the bolder the presentation, the less confident the solicitor.Phoenix: This is no bluff, and this isn't the only coin. There are three hundred of these coins in all, weighing a total of about seven pounds. (Changed from [There are 300 of these coins all together, weighing a total of about seven pounds.] in the original release) This one just happens to have blood on it.Blackquill: ...Did you have the blood analyzed to see whose it is?Phoenix: Not yet... ...but there were coins scattered all around the body, and the victim had a head wound. Taking these things into account, I believe it has to be the victim's blood. So, to put it together, we have about seven pounds of coins by the side of the pool... ...one of them with a bloodstain on it. I think the answer is pretty clear here. Your Honor! The defense proposes that the victim was killed beside the pool!Judge: The side of the pool?! But if the murder took place there, it would be difficult to say the orca did it...DePlume: I realize you are trying to defend your client, but that theory is preposterous! How could three hundred coins possibly be made to hit someone all at once?! (Changed from [How could 300 coins possibly be made to hit someone all at once?!] in the original release)Phoenix: It'd be pretty easy if they were in a bag or something of that nature.Judge: And so where is this bag the coins were in?Phoenix: Unfortunately, Your Honor, we recovered nothing of the sort from the scene. It's possible the culprit took it with them.Judge: They took it...?Phoenix: The true culprit used the coins as a blunt instrument to commit murder. They then threw the body into the pool before the security cameras started up. And then they left, taking the bag the coins were in with them. They got rid of the evidence that points to a human culprit to pin the blame on Orla!Athena: That was brilliant, Mr. Wright! You found a way to introduce the possibility of a human perpetrator!Phoenix: Yeah, somehow... (Let's hope my luck holds out... Hmm... I wonder why Prosecutor Blackquill hasn't said anything...)Judge: The possibility of a perpetrator other than the defendant has now been suggested. But if we hold this possibility to be true, then what did Ms. DePlume witness?DePlume: Th-That's right! I saw the killer whale attack the victim! Just like it did a year ago, singing a song!Athena: Hmm... I guess there still is that... Even with somebody else as the culprit, Orla's behavior still seems pretty bizarre. (Chhanged from [Even with somebody else as the culprit, Orla's behavior still seem [sic] pretty bizarre.] in the original release) I wonder why she was doing the same things she did a year ago? (Changed from [I wonder why did she [sic] was doing the same things she did a year ago?] in the original release)Phoenix: But is it REALLY that bizarre...? (Changed from [But are they REALLY that bizarre...?] in the original release)Athena: What do you mean?Phoenix: To explain the inexplicable, all we have to do is turn our thinking around.Athena: Turn our thinking around, huh? Sounds good to me!Phoenix: (Time to give the ol' \"turn my thinking around\" method a try! Instead of trying to figure out WHY Orla did the same things she did a year ago... ...I should consider the results that were produced by her behavior this time around. Orla sang a song, did some head-butts, and bit the victim. If the real culprit wanted to shift the suspicion onto Orla... ...then they would've needed to give people a reason to think Orla did it in the first place!)Judge: Mr. Wright, as her lawyer, how do you explain your client's actions?Phoenix: I believe we should think of it in this way, Your Honor: What kind of effect did Orla's actions have on the case?Judge: Hmm... Very well. Then why don't you explain it for the court. How did the defendant's actions affect the case?They created a witness Leads to: \"Ms. DePlume focused her attention on the orca pool because she heard the song.\"They killed the victim Phoenix: The defendant's actions may have killed the victim. Judge: So your assertion is that... the defendant is guilty...? Phoenix: Oh! What?! No...! I retract my statement, Your Honor! Judge: You may retract your statement, but you will first contract a penalty. Phoenix: (Instead of trying to figure out WHY Orla did the same things she did a year ago... ...I should consider what the result was of her doing the same things as a year ago. That's what I have to focus on now!) Your Honor! Please let me try again! Judge: Very well. Please explain to the court... Leads back to: \"How did the defendant's actions affect the case?\"They got rid of evidence Phoenix: The defendant's actions may have gotten rid of evidence!  Judge: Hmm... And what evidence might that be, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Vital evidence that would prove who the true culprit is! ...At least, that is what I hope. Judge: ...I am not asking about your hopes and dreams, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: (Instead of trying to figure out WHY Orla did the same things she did a year ago... ...I should consider what the result was of her doing the same things as a year ago. That's what I have to focus on now!) Your Honor! Please let me try again! Judge: Very well. Please explain to the court... Leads back to: \"How did the defendant's actions affect the case?\"Phoenix: Ms. DePlume focused her attention on the orca pool because she heard the song. The orca's act of singing a song created a witness.Judge: Created a witness...?Phoenix: Isn't it possible... ...that fabricating a witness was the real culprit's true intention? After all, Ms. DePlume witnessed two things: She saw Orla head-butt something over and over, and she saw the orca bite the victim. Those two actions of Orla's might have been... ...the true culprit's plot to make the witness think the orca was attacking the victim!Judge: Are you saying... that the defendant was being manipulated by the true perpetrator?!Phoenix: Exactly. And that would explain Orla's actions perfectly.Judge: But the defendant is an orca. Is it even possible to manipulate her?Phoenix: Yes, there is a way to manipulate Orla's behavior, with this!Present Whistle Phoenix: Leads to: \"Is this... a whistle?\"Present anything else Phoenix: Judge: THAT can be used to manipulate Orla's behavior? Phoenix: ...Sure, maybe it could be, if one knew how! Judge: I wish someone would manipulate YOU into presenting relevant evidence, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: M-My apologies, Your Honor... (Hmm... I know I have something that can be used to control Orla's behavior...)  Judge: So, Mr. Wright, is it really possible to manipulate Orla's behavior? Leads back to: \"Yes, there is a way to manipulate Orla's behavior, with this!\"Judge: Is this... a whistle?Phoenix: Yes, Your Honor. Trainers at the aquarium use whistles to issues commands to Orla. But in truth, anyone can do it, provided they know the right signals.Judge: Ah, that must be how they get Orla to do tricks for their pirate shows.Phoenix: The true culprit hid the body in a spot that couldn't be seen from the visitor's corridor. Then, when Ms. DePlume appeared, they gave Orla the commands! In other words, Orla was manipulated by the culprit to perform a series of \"tricks\"!DePlume: Wh-Whaaat...?Phoenix: And, as for you, Ms. DePlume... ...you were manipulated by the true culprit to play the part of the witness!DePlume: I-I, Norma DePlume, was set up...?! I, Norma DePlume, writer extraordinaire, was used...? N-No... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!Judge: M-Ms. DePlume...! Please do something about your attire!Phoenix: (Ugh... That was one wardrobe malfunction I did NOT want to see...)Judge: I-It would appear we need to shift our suspicion toward someone other than Orla. Prosecutor Blackquill, please have the bloodstained coin analyzed.Blackquill: ...Hmph. You waste your breath.Phoenix: (I guess even Prosecutor Blackquill can't refute the possibility of a human suspect.)Athena: You did it, Boss! If the crime happened beside the pool, there's no way an orca could have done it!Phoenix: Now, if only we could find the bag the coins were in...Judge: Hmm... In light of the new discovery, it would appear that the orca couldn't have done it.Phoenix: Exactly, Your Honor. If the blood on the coin proves to be that of the victim... ...we can unequivocally overturn Orla's accusation.Blackquill:Blackquill: Overturn the defendant's accusation...? Hmph. I think not.Phoenix: ACK! (M-My hair! My beautiful hair!)Blackquill: Yesterday, a new inmate was brought into the prison. He said, \"The moment you relax is when you're most vulnerable.\"Judge: Hmm... And what did this man go in for?Blackquill: ...He is merely a sneaky thief who enjoys a spot of fishing now and again. But Wright-dono here would be easier to hook than any fish...Taka: Screech!Phoenix: (That hawk sure does love the judge's head.)Judge: What's this? That coin from before and... some sort of bag?Phoenix: A b-bag...? (I don't think I'm gonna like this...)Blackquill: This is the coin bag the three hundred coins were in. (Changed from [This is the coin bag the 300 coins were in.] in the original release) I believe you were looking for this?Phoenix: H-How did you get that?!Blackquill: I never said we didn't find it at the crime scene. The bag had blood on it, so naturally, I had it sent to the crime lab.Phoenix: And... does the blood belong to the victim?Blackquill: It does indeed, as does the blood on the coin.Phoenix: (I knew it! So the blood on the coin DID belong to the victim!)Blackquill: The bag was open and the coins had all spilled out. But the bag alone wasn't proof enough to say that it was used as the murder weapon. ...However, thanks to the defense and their coin, I am more than satisfied that it was.Judge: Prosecutor Blackquill! Are you conceding that the true culprit committed the murder with the bag of coins?Blackquill: I shall concede that the victim was put into the pool after his death. However, even with the bag... ...it doesn't change the fact it was the orca that killed the victim!Phoenix: What?! How can you still suspect Orla?!Blackquill: You said that the true culprit manipulated Orla's behavior. But Orla isn't the kind of orca that would let someone control her. If anything, Orla used the victim's behavior against him to murder him!Phoenix: What?! But--Judge: A-Are you arguing that the orca manipulated a human being?!Blackquill: Hmph... To prove it, I have summoned another witness. Marlon Rimes, take the stand!Phoenix: (M-Marlon Rimes?! Is a witness...?!)Blackquill: ...Well, don't just stand there. State your name.Rimes: ............I told ya I didn't wanna be a witness.Blackquill: I thought one witness would be quite enough to prove the defendant's guilt... ...but apparently Wright-dono won't be satisfied until every stone is turned.Rimes: Well, son of a... All right, fine! If I gotta talk, then let's get this over with!Athena: Mr. Rimes doesn't seem like a willing witness.Phoenix: (I wonder what Prosecutor Blackquill is going to have him testify about?)Judge: Um... So could we have your name and occupation for the record, witness?Rimes: ............ Ahoy! Yo! Yo! Yo ho hooooo! People of da law! Time to testify! Chillin' with my crew at the Shipshape. Orcas, penguins, and da seascape. Cleanin' n' feedin', there ain't no end. But dem bratty kid's tours, I shall transcend. Noob animal keeper, from the house of Rimes! I'm da master keeper, Marlon with the rhymes!Judge: Oh, my... I'm afraid I couldn't understand a word you said! Is that that \"flip-flop\" music young people nowadays like?Phoenix: (...So close, Your Honor, so close... and yet so far.)Judge: Please proceed with your testimony, witness. Without the flip-flop.Rimes: Okay, fine. But I don't wanna do this, I tell ya. I feel like I'm sellin' Sasha out.Witness Testimony-- The Man-Manipulating Orca --Rimes: At about 10:10 AM, I was in the staff room. I heard a loud noise from the pool room, so I went to the door to look in. I couldn't see the captain or the orca, but I saw a bunch of coins scattered around. The orca knows there's a certain spot people stand to play volleyball with her. I think maybe she knocked down the stuff that was piled up there and hit the captain.Phoenix: (Hmm... So that gives us a little more info about the area around the orca pool.)Orca Pool Diagram updated in the Court Record.Phoenix: The defendant made the stuff fall down...?Blackquill: Overturned crates and assorted props were scattered all over the pool room floor. There is no doubt that it was the orca that caused the mess.Judge: But could she really have done that from within the pool?Blackquill: Hmph. As I said, the orca is the only one that could've performed such a feat. (Changed from [Hmph. As I said, the orca is the only one that could've perform [sic] such a feat.] in the original release) The pool and its room were tidied the night before, including its various odds and ends. But when our rhyming marlin took a look-see, over four hundred pounds of props had fallen. (Changed from [But when our rhyming marlin checked on the scene, over 400 pounds of props had fallen.] in the original release) To move it all in one go would challenge even the brawny prisoner in the cell next to mine.Phoenix: (...What is he? The jail gossip?)Blackquill: So, how did 400 pounds of items fall all at once? I'll tell you how. The orca pulled on the cloth that was underneath them. A weight that would be all but impossible for a human to move... ...was child's play to an orca. During a friendly game of volleyball, the defendant made the crates fall... ...and the bag of coins that was among the items fell on the victim's head and killed him! The orca then toyed with the victim's body underwater, which is what Ms. DePlume saw.Phoenix:Phoenix: But the witness only said he \"heard a loud noise.\" That doesn't automatically make it the sound of Orla making the items fall! Also, why did you only \"look in\" on the pool room, anyway, Mr. Rimes?Rimes: That orca sometimes makes a loud noise to summon her trainer. But I'm still a newbie, so I don't have a security card to get into the pool room yet. So even if she tries to summon somebody, there isn't much I can do about it.Judge: I see. So the witness couldn't enter the crime scene...Phoenix:Phoenix: If Mr. Rimes couldn't enter the room, there's at least one thing he can't be sure about! His statement that the orca was playing volleyball is purely speculation!Blackquill:Blackquill: Whether the orca was actually playing volleyball or not is not the issue. Traces of the orca's saliva were found on the cloth that was underneath the crates. The important point is that the orca is the only one that could have moved the items!Phoenix: (Argh! I have to discredit that statement somehow! If I don't, it'd mean that Orla was the culprit, even if the victim died beside the pool!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Man-Manipulating Orca --Rimes: At about 10:10 AM, I was in the staff room.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you sure about the time you were in the staff room? Rimes: What?! Y-Yes, I'm sure! I'm pretty good with time. I've never been late to work once.  Phoenix: (Hmm... If he's sure about the time, then there's something wrong with that statement. I'd better take another look through the Court Record...)  Judge: All right. Please continue with your testimony, Mr. Rimes.Present Calendar Phoenix: Leads to: \"You say you were in the staff room...\"Rimes: I heard a loud noise from the pool room, so I went to the door to look in.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You heard the noise all the way in the staff room? Rimes: That's right. The orca pool room and the staff room are pretty close to each other. Anyway, I heard the noise, so I went to the door of the pool room. But I don't have a security card, so all I could do was look through the door crack. Phoenix: What kind of noise did you hear? Rimes: Want me to describe it? Awww yiiiiis! Yo word up Courtroom Numbah Fouuuuurrr! Da crash, boom, bowing to relativity! Everything fallin' with sweet simplicity! This testimony yo, it ain't got no fallacies! Things fallin' n' breakin', was pure insanity! ...Kinda like that. Phoenix: (Okay... But why the need to rap it...?)  Judge: Well, I didn't really get all of that, but, in any case, I gather it was a very loud noise... Very well. Please describe what you saw at the scene.Rimes: I couldn't see the captain or the orca, but I saw a bunch of coins scattered around.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You couldn't see the victim? Rimes: I was just lookin' through the door crack. I guess all that stuff was blockin' my view. I did notice a whole bunch of coins scattered all over the place, though... But, at the time, I had no idea the captain was dead. Blackquill: Hmph... Killed by gold coins. Ironic, isn't it? Perhaps the orca wanted to be paid for her labor, paid in coins raining from the skies. Athena: Coins raining from the skies? He makes it sound... almost poetic.  Phoenix: But the hard truth is that those coins were actually the murder weapon... Blackquill: We all deserve to be paid for our work, do we not? I shall have a fine meal tonight...  Phoenix: If you find our client guilty, that is. Mr. Rimes, do you have a theory on how the things got knocked down? Rimes: Of course I do.Rimes: The orca knows there's a certain spot people stand to play volleyball with her.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: She uses this ball and does a spike, right? We had a nice little demonstration of Orla's spike for ourselves just yesterday. Rimes: If you stand on the mark on the floor, the orca spikes the ball at you.  Blackquill: Hmph. Taka is good at flying straight at his target as well. And I see plenty of targets right here in this room. Judge: ? Phoenix: ? Rimes: ? Athena: Everyone's so busy protecting their head, they forgot about the trial... Phoenix: Including you.  Blackquill: Tell them what the defendant caused to happen.  Rimes: Well, the orca knows people stand in a certain spot for volleyball...Rimes: I think maybe she knocked down the stuff that was piled up there and hit the captain.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Are you saying you think she knocked down the items on purpose? Rimes: I don't wanna believe it, myself, but that orca's pretty smart... It'd be easy for her to pull the cloth the stuff was on while she was playin' volleyball. Orcas are really strong. One good pull and all those things would come crashin' down. Phoenix: (I guess maybe an orca could be strong enough to make that much stuff fall...)  Blackquill: I've never seen an orca play tug of war, myself. But the fact is, this one did. The traces of the orca's saliva found on the cloth prove it. How long do you plan to walk tightrope on those shaky theories of yours? Phoenix: (Wait until you see me do acrobatics! Moments like these are what I became a lawyer again for!)Phoenix: (I don't know why, but Mr. Rimes is lying. I'm afraid I have to expose that secret he and Pearls were keeping to resolve this...)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Athena Cykes\nDescription: A new lawyer at my agency.

However, the penguin-shaped calendar (Evidence 8), which was switched with Pearls's at 10:10 AM in the food prep room (as established during Pearl Fey's Psyche-Lock), proves that Rimes was not in the staff room at 10:10 AM but was actually in the food prep room. Therefore, he couldn't have witnessed or inferred Orla's volleyball-related actions, contradicting his testimony.\n",

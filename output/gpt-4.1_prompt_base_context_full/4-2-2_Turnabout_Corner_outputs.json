Spinning big crimes and little crimes together. And when the Wheel stops... You die. June 15, 9:12 AMWright & Co. Law Offices Examine evidence Attorney's Badge Back side Apollo: There's a number inscribed on the back of the badge. There are many numbers like it, but this one is mine. Proof that I'm an attorney. To tell the truth, I get a happy feeling inside just looking at it. Apollo: (Two months have passed since Mr. Gavin's arrest. My first trial, and I lost both my mentor and my job. Yeah, I'll admit it. I was screwed. But even when I hit bottom, I told myself I'd never come here. Honest. Here being the legendary Wright & Co. Law Offices. OK, Justice, time to stop trembling.) ???: Ah! You must be here for the interview. Right this way. Apollo: Huh? ???: Hello there! You've found the Wright place! Welcome! Apollo: Uh... Ah... (What's with this girl!?) ???: Well now, shall we begin? Apollo: Begin... what? ???: Right, first things first... Any special talents? Apollo: Erm, talents? ???: Yes, well, you must have at least one! Apollo: Well... Uh... I guess... Defending? ???: \"Defending\"... An unusual talent, but it'll do. With a little jazzing up, of course. Apollo: Y-You think so...? ???: Let's give it a go, shall we? Apollo: Huh? ???: Go ahead! Show me! Defend! Just give it all you've got. Don't hold back now! Apollo: Wh-What are you talking about? I can't just \"defend\" here! ???: First lesson: A professional can perform anywhere! Apollo: ...Thanks. ???: We want people to be laughing with us... ...not at us! Apollo: ...Thanks. But I'm not sure why they should be laughing at all. ???: What...? What exactly do you think you came here to do? Apollo: What? Um, defend... No? ???: ... Excuse me, but do you know where you are? Apollo: Huh!? The Wright & Co. Law Offices, right? ???: ...Oh. I was afraid of that. Don't worry, you're not the first. Apollo: Look, what's going on here? Who are you? I came here to meet with the person in charge... ???: Well, you've apparently made no fewer than two mistakes. Apollo: Mistakes? But I got a call from Mr. Wright this morning! ???: Perhaps you should go read the sign out front again? Apollo: What's there to read!? Look, it says right there... ...Oh. Why does it say \"Wright Talent Agency\"...? ???: Welcome to the Wright Talent Agency, where you've \"always come to the Wright place!\" Trucy: I'm Trucy Wright, CEO. I'm a magician. Apollo: (It all came flooding back... The trial... That girl...) ???: Hello, sir. Please, pick a card. Phoenix: That's right. She's my daughter. Apollo: Trucy... Wright. Trucy: Here, check out our flyer! So... what's your name? Apollo: Apollo... Apollo Justice, attorney at law. Examine Bookshelf Apollo: All these legal books must be Mr. Wright's leftovers... ...There's a lot of unrelated books in here, too. \"One Trick a Day\"... \"Magic for Idiots\"... You'd think a pro magician would aim a bit higher. Charley the plant Trucy: Ack! Don't touch Mr. Charley! Apollo: \"Mister\" Charley...? Trucy: He's been in this office much longer than I have! Daddy's mentor had a great fondness for Mr. Charley. He's lived here since Daddy was a rookie attorney! Apollo: Huh.  (Mr. Charley... riiight.) Trucy: Now I take care of him! Hula hoop Apollo: That's one of those hula hoop things everyone was crazy about way back when. Trucy: Really? I had no idea these were that popular! Apollo: I'm not so bad with one myself, actually. Trucy: Eh!? I-I'm still learning... So you can really make someone levitate with it? Show me! Apollo: Huh!? I-I have no idea how! (It's just a normal hula hoop, isn't it?) Magic split box Apollo: A strange, split box leers at me from the wall. Um, is this one of those boxes for cutting people in half? Trucy: That's right! This cabinet is used for an illusion called the \"Zig-Zag\"! Apollo: I've seen one on TV... But why is one just sitting here in your office? Trucy: Oh, it's a little big for me, you see. So I'm using it as furniture. Hats in the top, shirts in the middle, and pants down below! I think it's a nice touch... don't you? Apollo: (It's not exactly what I'd call a \"welcoming\" decor.) Photograph Apollo: An old, sepia-tinted photo of a man in a silk top hat. Trucy: That's my favorite magician! I want to be just like him someday! Apollo: (Sure, nice... Guess it's good to have a role model. Even if he's gotta be well over 100.) Trucy: How rude! Piano Apollo: There are all sorts of strange paraphernalia sitting on top of the piano. Trucy: Those are my magic props! Practice, practice, practice! A professional never leaves their weapons far from reach! Apollo: But you can't play the piano with all this junk on it. Trucy: Oh, no one plays here anyway. And the neighbors complain. Apollo: (I guess Mr. Wright really can't play...) Silk hat Apollo: A blue silk hat, just like the one Trucy is wearing. Trucy: Oh, that's just for show. Don't wear it, please! Apollo: (Last thought from my mind, honest.) Trucy: I put it there so clients can see it and know who I am. Nothing says \"magician\" like a silk top hat! Spaghetti Apollo: Whoa! That fork is floating! ...Not. Why do you have a plate of plastic spaghetti here? Trucy: That right there is the whole reason I became a magician! Apollo: Do tell. Trucy: I saw a plate just like that in a restaurant once. The floating fork looked so real! That's when I knew... Someday, I'd make magic more amazing than that spaghetti! Table Apollo: That table... doesn't look very sturdy. Trucy: You've never seen one of these? It's a magic table! Apollo: So, like, you make this teapot disappear? Trucy: So you might think! But that's not it... Before your very eyes, the contents of the pot change! ...From Earl Grey to Darjeeling! Apollo: Kinda hard to see the difference, I'd think... Move Apollo: (What's up with this \"Wright Talent Agency\"? Guess I'll talk to her and find out what I can.) Talk Wright Talent Agency Apollo: So... Is this really a talent agency? Trucy: You bet! Daddy started it seven years ago, when he quit law. Of course, we only have two people signed up right now. Apollo: Two people... Does that include you? Trucy: Trucy Wright, Magician Extraordinaire! I've done a lot of stage shows! Paid, too! I am a professional, you know. Apollo: Er... right. Trucy: Promise you'll come to one of my shows, OK? Let's see... Oh, and the other person our agency represents is... Phoenix Wright, Pianist Extra Ordinaire! Apollo: Your dad, in other words. Didn't he say he couldn't play the piano? Trucy: Our agency doesn't see that as a problem. Why, there are many magicians who can't do magic! Apollo: At least you're optimistic, I'll give you that. Trucy Wright Apollo: So you're his, er... you're Phoenix Wright's daughter? Trucy: That's right! After Daddy quit law seven years ago... ...I promised I would keep him fed! So I'm kind of his sugar daddy! Get it? Apollo: No. Trucy: I'm in charge of this whole office, too. Pretty amazing for a young lass of fifteen, wouldn't you agree!? Apollo: F-Fifteen? Uh, how old is Mr. Wright? Trucy: Daddy? Oh... he's 33 this year. Apollo: ...I'm sure there's a good explanation. (I hope...) Trucy: ? Phoenix Wright Apollo: Um, about Mr. Wright giving up law... It was because of that incident seven years ago, wasn't it...? Trucy: Eh? You know about that!? Apollo: Not the details. I remember the news, though. It was a big deal. Trucy: So I hear. I was too young to understand what was going on. I'll ask Daddy about it next time I get a chance. Apollo: Daddy, right... That reminds me. About Mr. Wright... He gave me a call this morning to come in. Trucy: Daddy's not here right now. He's in the hospital. Apollo: The hospital!? Trucy: Yeah. He's on strict bed rest until he gets better. Apollo: Wh... What!? Present Attorney's Badge Trucy: Oh, I've seen one of those before! That's an attorney's badge. It looks just like the one Daddy used to have. Now if I take this badge... And do this, and this... See! It's gone! Apollo: H-Hey! My badge! What'd you do with my badge!? Trucy: No need to worry! Just look in your pocket! Apollo: Huh! No way... My pocket? (Wait a second... There's something in there!) ... It's a flyer for your agency! Trucy: And here's your badge. You can have it back now. Apollo: (That's the last time I let her touch anything of mine. Period.) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: OK... Which hospital is Mr. Wright in? I'll pay him a visit. Trucy: Oh, the Hickfield Clinic. It's quite close. Apollo: Right. Well, I'll be going now. And I'll, uh... give this showbiz gig some thought, OK? Trucy: Wait! I'll go with you! June 15, 9:45 AMHickfield Clinic Apollo: (So... this is Mr. Wright's hospital...) ???: Eh? Visitors are ya? Hrmm? Apollo: Uh, yeah. Are you the... doctor? Hickfield: Ayup. Dr. Hickfield's the name. Eh he he. Trucy: Good morning, Doctor! Hickfield: Oh, hiya there, Trucy. Cute as ever! Eh he he. Trucy: Is... this Daddy's room? Hickfield: Oh yah. 'Cept he's gone for a mornin' checkup. Be back soon. How're you, Miss Trucy? Got any places you'd like... examined? Eh heh... Phoenix: Doctor... the nurse was looking for you. Hickfield: Why, if it isn't the Daddy o' the cutest lil' thing in town! Hrm. Hrmm. Guess I'll be off then. Eh he? Later, Trucy. Apollo: Wow, what an odd bird that guy was. Phoenix: Good morning. Didn't expect you so soon, Apollo. Apollo: Mr. Wright... Examine Bottle Trucy: Aaaah! Daddy! You snuck some grape juice in again!? The doctor said you weren't supposed to drink that here! Phoenix: Trucy. Look at the label. Trucy: ... Oh. \"Deep Sea Mineral Water\". That's fine, I guess. Phoenix: I switched the labels. Don't tell Trucy, 'kay? Apollo: (What can I say, the man loves his grape juice.) DVD stack Apollo: A swaying, spiraling stack of DVD cases. \"The Steel Samurai\", \"The Nickel Samurai\"... \"The Pink Princess\", \"The Zappy Samurai: Electric Bugaboo\"... They're all children's action hero shows... Phoenix: This \"kid\" I know keeps sending them to me. Apollo: Huh. Like a niece or nephew? Phoenix: ...Something like that. Apollo: Quite the collection. This kid's parents must be really generous with their allowance. (Funny, Mr. Wright doesn't seem the type that kids would like.) Hospital bed Apollo: Mr. Wright's bed... It's really messy. Trucy: Look how messy this is! You're just hopeless without me, aren't you, Daddy? Apollo: (Yikes! She's attempting to clean up! Look out!) Phoenix: Ah ha ha. You got me. What can I say? I was raised in a barn. Try not to let word get out, Apollo. If you don't mind. Apollo: (Yeah, it might ruin your illustrious career pretending to play the piano.) Piano Apollo: This looks like a child's toy piano. Phoenix: Gotta practice. Wouldn't want my fingers to get stiff. A pro always keeps his weapon close at hand. Shall I play you a tune? Apollo: Uh... no thanks. Phoenix: Ah, how unfortunate. I so rarely get a chance to play. Television Apollo: What's that on TV? Looks like some sort of action hero show... Trucy: Oh, I know that one! That's the Sniffling Samurai! His \"Booger Flick\" attack is a big hit with the grade school crowd. Apollo: I had no idea you liked this kind of stuff, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Well, what else is there to do when you're stuck in bed? Besides, the episodes will just keep piling up if I don't keep up, you know? Apollo: Um... yeah. (Try not buying them.) Phoenix: Now's the only time I get to watch and write up my reports. Apollo: Your... reports? Phoenix: It's a long story. Like a lot of things, actually. Talk What happened? Apollo: So... what happened? Phoenix: ...Who could have imagined it? Me, victim of a hit and run... Apollo: A hit and... You were hit by a car!? Phoenix: Oh, he tried to swerve, I'll give him that. Picture me tossed thirty feet through the air... ...only stopping when my head hit that telephone pole. Apollo: You hit a telephone pole with your head!? Are you OK!? Phoenix: Thankfully, my only injury was a sprained ankle. Apollo: (He really is as lucky as they say...) About Trucy... Apollo: There's something that, well, it just doesn't sit right. I just can't believe you have a daughter, Mr. Wright! And... she's so big! Not fat, but, er, you know what I mean. Phoenix: Oh, Trucy's still a child. Trucy: Daddy! How many times do I have to remind you! I'm not a child anymore! Phoenix: Ah ha ha! But you'll always be Daddy's little baby girl to me, Trucy. Apollo: (Ah ha ha, my foot. I'm not buying it.) Phoenix: Oh, something you should know about Trucy... Apollo: She's a magician, right? She told me. Phoenix: Not a mere stage magician... She's a genius. Trucy: Tee hee! Aw, Daddy! Phoenix: You'll soon come to appreciate her \"talent\". Apollo: You could just tell me things instead of insinuating them. Wright Talent Agency Apollo: So, why did you contact me? What could the Wright Talent Agency possibly want with me? Phoenix: No need to get prickly, now. Apollo: Hey, I didn't ask to be dragged in like this! Trucy: Huh? But didn't you come into the office of your own free will anyway? Apollo: Well, yeah, of course. \"Help! We're in big trouble here at the office! Big!\" ...I thought someone was dying. Phoenix: So you don't think this is big trouble? My talent agency represents only two people... and one of them is in the hospital. Trucy: That's right, Daddy! How are we going to pay this month's rent!? And the groceries!? Phoenix: Yeah... That's the problem with such a tight operation. It's a symbiotic relationship. When one of us falls, the other, too, must fall... Apollo: Hey! This isn't exactly a suitable conversation to be having with a 15-year-old kid! Phoenix: In any case, if Apollo here can't help you... ...you'll have to transfer to a new school. Again. Trucy: No! I can't! I only just made friends... How could you do this to me... to us!? Polly! Apollo: Huh? What? Now it's my fault? Phoenix: On that note, how about you come work for us? I've got the perfect client for you already lined up. Apollo: A... A client? (You mean I get to do my job? I get to defend in court!?) ...Alright. I'll hear what you have to say. Trucy: You got him, Daddy! Hook, line, and sinker! Phoenix: Ah ha. Now it's time to reel him in! Apollo: (It's official: I'm scared.) Our client (appears after \"Wright Talent Agency\") Apollo: Alright, so who's the client? Phoenix: Ah, yes. Here, take a look at the map and I'll explain. Last night, I left the office just before nine o'clock... I was going to that Indochine pasta joint, Alden Tae's. I play piano there, of course. ...That's when it happened! The car sent me flying, nicked a telephone pole... ...and zoomed away. Creepy, huh? Apollo: Just a tad. It's almost as creepy as hearing you tell the story like it was no big deal. Phoenix: The car sped off in this direction... ...So, good luck! Apollo: ...Huh? Phoenix: You wanted a client, didn't you? Well, I'm your client! Find the guy who knocked me into that telephone pole! Apollo: Whoa, hold on! I'm a defense attorney, not a detective! Phoenix: Don't worry. Once you've found the guy, I intend to sue him. Then you can stick it to him in court! Apollo: ...I'm not a prosecutor either! I'm sorry, but... this is crazy. I'm going home. Phoenix: Don't get so worked up. It was just a joke. Apollo: Huh? Trucy: Oh, Daddy. Sorry, Apollo. He just loves jokes, you know. Even the ones that aren't very funny. Phoenix: Your real client should be stopping by the office any time now. Apollo: The office... You mean the talent agency? (No harm in going. It's not like I have anything else to do.) Phoenix: ...One more thing. Do look into my accident too, would you? I marked the scene of the tragedy on this map. It's right in front of this park. Should be easy to find. Apollo: (So, he's going to make me investigate this after all...) Map added to the Court Record. Our client (subsequent times) Apollo: Alright, so who's the client? Phoenix: Ah, yes. Here, take a look at the map and I'll explain. Last night, I left the office just before nine o'clock... I was going to that Indochine pasta joint, Alden Tae's. I play piano there, of course. ...That's when it happened! The car sent me flying, nicked a telephone pole... ...and zoomed away. Creepy, huh? Apollo: Just a tad. It's almost as creepy as hearing you tell the story like it was no big deal. Phoenix: The car sped off in this direction... ...So, good luck! Apollo: ...Huh? Phoenix: You wanted a client, didn't you? Well, I'm your client! Find the guy who knocked me into that telephone pole! Apollo: Whoa, hold on! I'm a defense attorney, not a detective! Phoenix: Don't worry. Once you've found the guy, I intend to sue him. Then you can stick it to him in court! Apollo: ...I'm not a prosecutor either! I'm sorry, but... this is crazy. I'm going home. Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: What's that? Looks strangely familiar... Apollo: How could you not recognize an attorney's badge!? Phoenix: It's been seven years. I've forgotten... a lot of things. Apollo: (I guess some seven years are longer than others.) Map Phoenix: I've marked the location of the accident on your map. Find the criminal who knocked me into that telephone pole! After clearing \"Our client\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic: June 15, 10:05 AMWright Talent Agency ???: Hey hey hey! How long you planning on making me wait, eh!? Trucy: Ah! Good morning! ???: Hey there, Trucy-doll. Sounds like your pops had a bit of a rough spot, eh? Trucy: All's well that ends well, I guess... Apollo: (This... is our client?) ???: Hey! So this is that Pollo fellow, eh? Apollo: Oh, uh, y-yes? (The name's \"Apollo\".) ???: Look at 'im there, arms all crossed-like. Ready to fight! Apollo: Yes, sir! ...You don't mean that literally, do you? ???: The boss told you what I need, right? Don't let me down now, Pollo! Apollo: Don't worry about your defense sir, I'm on it! ???: Defense...? Your noodle half-cooked? It's too late for defense! My castle's been stormed! My keep's been kept! My noodle stand's been stolen! Apollo: N-Noodle...? Trucy: You know Mr. Eldoon from the noodle stand, don'cha, Polly? Apollo: No nicknames, please. And no, of course I don't know him! ???: You new in these parts? Apollo: Not really... ???: Then you know the best noodles in town: Eldoon's Noodles! Apollo: Uh, whose noodles? ???: My noodles! Er, help me out here, Trucy-doll. Trucy: This is Mr. Guy Eldoon... our client! Maybe you can tell us what the problem is, Mr. Eldoon? Guy: Anything for you, Trucy-doll! Talk Who's this guy? Apollo: So... You run a noodle stand, Mr.... Guy: Eldoon. Guy Eldoon's the name! And noodles are my game. The secret's in the soup! I've been searching for the perfect soup for a year 'n' a half. Apollo: Oh. That's... not that long, really. Guy: My family's been noodle men for generations. Got a lot of expectation on my shoulders. Fifteen fathers passing the noodle to fifteen sons. Trucy: That's a pretty old noodle! Guy: Aye, and fool that I was, I pushed it away. I rebelled against my pops, and picked another livelihood. But... that didn't turn out so well. Apollo: Oh. Guy: There was no denying it... Salty broth runs through these veins, boy! Trucy: So, it was like destiny that you became what you are. Guy: Right, destiny's the word! Oh, I fought it... ...but in the end I was bound by the twisted noodle of fate! Apollo: (Not a mental image I care to linger on.) Guy: So, last year, I started my noodle stand. The 15th generation of Eldoon's Noodles! Eldoon's Noodles Apollo: Um... So tell me more about Eldoon's Noodles. Guy: You don't know the genius that are my noodles!? I make 'em so salty, why, they're saltier than... salt! Apollo: (Now I really don't want to find out.) Trucy: Daddy's a regular at his noodle stand. Guy: He frequented my pops's stand back during his attorney days, too. Yep, him and his assistant. Apollo: I'm sorry... I'll be sure to drop by your stand soon. Guy: Wish you could, sonny! Apollo: Eh? Guy: Heck, I wish I could! I'd give anything for a bowl 'bout now. Trucy: What do you mean? Guy: It was stolen! My stand! Gone! Apollo: Stolen...? Stolen stand (appears after \"Eldoon's Noodles\") Guy: It was last night... I was doing my rounds, blowin' my whistle. Trucy: It's like an ice-cream truck's bell but louder! He even gets complaints! Guy: Eh heh, now you're just trying to butter me up. Apollo: (That sounded more like the blues than a whistle...) Guy: I closed up my stand for the night and parked by the house. Then, this morning, dark 'n' early... It was gone! My keep! My castle! Oooooh! Apollo: Maybe some bum carted it off? ...Just guessing here. Guy: Well, I don't care who did it! Without that stand, I'm finished! All my noodle bowls were in there, too. Trucy: That's the saddest thing I've heard all day. Guy: You know it. Anyhows, that's the deal. Good luck! Apollo: Good... huh? Wait... What exactly is your request? Guy: My noodle stand! Find it! And the day you bring my baby back is the day you feast on as many noodles as you want! Course I make it so hot 'n' salty, two bowls'd kill a man. Then I'd really need defense! Apollo: Speaking of defense, that's what I do. I'm a lawyer. Not a detective... Guy: This is where I live, you drop by if you need any info, 'kay? Get it back today if you can, Pollo! I got noodles to make! Apollo: Things have certainly taken a turn for the bizarre. Traffic accidents... and noodle stand thieves. Trucy: Um, actually... There was something I wanted to ask you about, too, Apollo. Apollo: Huh? (I have a bad feeling about this.) Guy: Ah, listen to the lady's problem now. Don't be cruel! Trucy: I lost something last night. That is, something was stolen. Guy: Hey, what's this? More thieving and skullduggery!? Trucy: Well, um... Someone stole a pair of my panties. Apollo: ...Panties? Stolen stand (subsequent times) Guy: It was last night... I was doing my rounds, blowin' my whistle. Trucy: It's like an ice-cream truck's bell but louder! He even gets complaints! Guy: Eh heh, now you're just trying to butter me up. Apollo: (That sounded more like the blues than a whistle...) Guy: I closed up my stand for the night and parked by the house. Then, this morning, dark 'n' early... It was gone! My keep! My castle! Oooooh! Apollo: Maybe some bum carted it off? ...Just guessing here. Guy: Well, I don't care who did it! Without that stand, I'm finished! All my noodle bowls were in there, too. Trucy's request (appears after \"Stolen stand\") Leads to: \"Erm, so they were, um, stolen, your, er...\" Present Attorney's Badge Guy: Yee haw! Attaboy! Way to flash 'em! Ol' Phoenix used to do that to my pops all the time. Trucy: Your father...? Guy: Yup, he'd whip that bad boy out 'n' say \"Put it on my tab, you know I'm good for it.\" Apollo: (A tab at a noodle joint?) Anything else Guy: Sorry, fellah, but the only business I'm concerned with is my business. You gotta help me out! Get my business back! Apollo: Erm, so they were, um, stolen, your, er... Trucy: My panties, yes. Apollo: Ah, er, right. Panties. Guy: That's a cryin' shame, that is, Trucy-doll. Trucy: I was alone in the office last night. I had hung my panties out the window there to dry... ...when a thief came and took them! My favorite panties! I ran after him. \"Give those back!\" I shouted. \"Wait!\" Apollo: Well, that was certainly brave of you. Trucy: ...But I lost him. Without those panties, I don't know what I'll do... Guy: A darn cryin' shame, yup. Trucy: Well, at least the scene of the crime is convenient. I'll mark it on your map! Guy: I'll be headin' home now. Remember, find my stand or there's an empty bowl in yer future, Pollo! Apollo: Er, right. Guy: And you help out Trucy-doll here, too, y'hear? Trucy: Things have certainly picked up, haven't they! We had no work yesterday, and now we have three cases! Apollo: I... I guess. Trucy: Let's see where we stand! Apollo: (Not in a courtroom, that's where.) Well, the first item on our list... Trucy: Phoenix Wright... Daddy's hit and run accident. We have to find the one who hit him! Apollo: ...Who's going to pay us for this again? Trucy: And the second item... Mr. Eldoon's request.. to find his stolen stand. Apollo: For which we stand to gain... a bowl of salty noodles... Trucy: And the last request is mine! To find my stolen panties! Apollo: ...That bowl of noodles is looking better and better. Trucy: Let's go, Polly! To the streets! Apollo: Aren't you enthusiastic. Trucy: How could I not be!? Let's crack these cases, you and me! Apollo: (*sigh* Guess we might as well get started... Let's see. A hit and run... a stolen stand... And last but not least... stolen panties.) After clearing \"Our client\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic, then visiting Wright Talent Agency: June 15Hickfield Clinic Apollo: Huh? Mr. Wright's gone. Trucy: Maybe he's gone for an examination? Apollo: He'll probably be back soon. Let's wait. Trucy: I think it might take some time. Daddy always loves his examinations! Apollo: (Don't ask, Justice. You don't want to know.) Trucy: Why don't we come back later? Apollo: Yeah, I guess you're right. Examine Bottle Apollo: A bottle of Mr. Wright's favorite brand of grape juice. After that trial, I'll never drink grape juice again. Clearly not a problem for Mr. Wright, however. DVD stack Apollo: A swaying, spiraling stack of DVD cases. It looks ready to collapse. Better keep my distance. Hospital bed Apollo: Mr. Wright's bed. Wow, what a mess. Trucy must be in charge of cleaning at home. Piano Apollo: A small, children's piano. I guess the man likes pink. Television Apollo: The television's been left on... to an episode of the Steel Samurai. That's the same episode as before. Must be his favorite. Wright Talent Agency Talk Panty-snatcher Apollo: (Maybe I should ask her more about her... uh... This is going to be difficult--) Trucy: Apollo! Apollo: Yeah? Trucy: Your [sic] going to have to press me for information! Go ahead, do your worst! Apollo: Uh, no thanks, I pass. Trucy: You can't \"pass\"! This is your job! Look, I had hung them outside the window there to dry... ...when a thief came and took them! My favorite panties! I ran after him. \"Give those back!\" I shouted. \"Wait!\" ...But I lost him. I can't live without those panties! Please find them! Any leads? Apollo: Well? Do we have any leads? Trucy: Hmm... One moment... ... Allakazam! Allakazing! Apollo: (Whoa! Where'd all this evidence come from?) Trucy: ... Apollo: Um... So what happens next? Trucy: That's it! Pretty neat, huh? Apollo: ...Yeah. Neat. (*sigh*) Present Anything Trucy: What's that, Polly? Oh, I know! You want to see a magic trick! Well, you've come to the right girl! Watch as I make that evidence disappear, forever! Apollo: Whoa! No, don't! Sorry, my bad! June 15Accident Scene Apollo: So this is where Mr. Wright got hit by that car? Trucy: According to the map, this is the place! Apollo: What a huge mansion... (Changed from [What a huge mansion... Feels like Chinatown.] in the original release) Trucy: Apollo! There's a nice-looking lady over there. Let's question her! Apollo: Um, OK. (I'm a little curious about the park over there, too...) Trucy: Excuse me! Um, can we have a few words with you? ???: You want something? Apollo: (Whoa! That husky voice... Why am I suddenly sweating?) Trucy: That's quite a house you've got there! You must have a lot of money... ???: Whoooh. \"Money\" sounds like something my son would call his friends. This is the Kitaki Family mansion, little girl. Apollo: Eh. ???: You, kid with the hair. You want something? Apollo: Urk! M-M-Me? No, not a thing! Bye! Trucy: Apollo! We can't leave without questioning her! What if she knows something! Apollo: B-But th-the Kitaki Family...! (They're the biggest organized crime syndicate in town!) ???: If you're going to ask something, ask it. If you're man enough. Apollo: Waaaaugh! R-Right! Trucy: Yay! Way to whip him into shape, ma'am! Apollo: (Does she know no fear!?) Plum: I'm Plum. Plum Kitaki. Wife of the fourth head of the Kitaki Family business. Friends call me Little Plum. Apollo: I-I'm l-little Apollo Justice, attorney at law. *gulp* (If looks could kill, this woman would be a mass-murderer by now...) Examine Mansion front gate Trucy: Wow, what a big house! And the gate is so big... Apollo: The Kitaki Family is pretty big around these parts. Trucy: I like the fox! It's so cute! Plum: Ah, that. That's our family crest... from the old country. Trucy: Your family \"crest\"? Plum: We're clever as the fox... and our teeth are sharp. Trucy: So it's like a motto! You need a crest, too, Apollo! Ooh! How about the scales of justice? Or a lunar lander! Apollo: (...I'll pass, thanks.) Mansion gate wall Apollo: A brightly painted dragon. Why do I get the feeling he's glaring at me? Those paints must have been to repaint this wall. Plum: That's right. I called in an artist to do the job right. ...He's the third so far. Apollo: The... third? Plum: The first spilled paint all over the entrance here, the second on my kimono... So I... Apollo: N-No, don't tell me. It's better that I don't know. Spilled paint Apollo: There's paint splashed all over this gate. (What a mess...) Trucy: Was this paint knocked over by the car that hit my Daddy? Plum: That's right. Feh. And I'm left to clean up the mess. If you find whoever did this, bring the scoundrel by, would you? Trucy: Of course! Then you can make them clean up their own mess! Plum: Ah ha ha ha! You're cute. Naïve, but cute. When I find whoever did this, you can bet I'll be doing some \"cleaning\". There's nothing I dislike so much... as a mess. Trucy: Ooh! I wish I could say cool things like that! Plum: I'll bet you do! Wa ha ha ha ha!!! Apollo: (I'd laugh if my teeth weren't chattering so hard.) Talk The Kitakis Trucy: Little Plum? That's a really cute name for someone so... Plum: Yes...? Apollo: Wh-Whoa! Trucy: What is it, Apollo? Apollo: How about you go through me when talking to her, OK, Trucy? Trucy: Huh? That seems like a bit of a needless procedure. Apollo: I'm a lawyer. I live for needless procedures. Plum: Oh little girl, you should know... We're gangsters. Trucy: Gangst... Oh! That means you're the bad guys! Apollo: Trucy! Through me! Please! I'm begging you here! Plum: Wa ha ha ha ha!!! The bad guys... I like the sound of that! Apollo: (...I'm going to need some warm tea after this.) Plum: It takes a lot of hard work to protect a family fortune. Things aren't as easy as they used to be for us \"bad guys\". Trucy: So, you're saying that business is in a slump? Apollo: (Let's not ask about \"business if we can help it, please?) Last night's accident Apollo: So, there was supposedly a car accident here last night. (Changed from [There was a car accident here last night?] in the original release) Plum: Last night... Apollo: Of c-course you wouldn't know about it! S-Sorry to bother you! Plum: Wait. Apollo: Y-Yes? Plum: You're talking about that man, aren't you? The one who flew thirty feet and just walked away? Trucy: That's my daddy! Plum: Ah ha ha! I should've known! One of our Capos thought he'd make a great point man... Trucy: Capo? Point man...? Apollo: Um, could you avoid using too much, er, industry lingo? Plum: In any case, it's been nothing but trouble. I've been cleaning up this mess since morning! Bah! Apollo: Cleaning up this... paint? Splattered paint (appears after \"Last night's accident\") Apollo: Was this paint spilled at the time of the accident? Plum: It was around 9 last night. I heard a crashing noise... ...and found your father drowning in a sea of paint. Trucy: So you came to his rescue? Plum: You've my husband... the Boss to thank for that. The car that hit your father knocked over this paint... ...then turned the corner, and sped away. We're in the middle of repainting our wall, you see. Apollo: (I'm sure that dragon is glaring at me.) Trucy: But, why are you out here cleaning it up? Plum: What do you mean? Trucy: I mean, aren't you a gangster? Don't you have any \"goons\" to do your dirty work for you? Apollo: Please! Go through me when you want to... Plum: Wa ha ha ha ha!!! Don't be such a stiff, lawyer-boy. I suppose we gangsters do have a certain image... Apollo: Urm, yes. Plum: But we're community-oriented gangsters, you see. ...The Boss likes to give back to the people, see? Apollo: (How noble of him...) Plum: I availed myself of the public facilities to get rid of all the garbage... Now there's just the paint on the street to deal with. Apollo: (Public facilities...? I wonder if she means that trash can...) Present Anything Plum: Sorry, kid. I got no idea what you're talking about. After switching to right side view: Apollo: Who's that!? She's looking at the park. Trucy: She's pretty. I bet she has a story, you know? Apollo: (There is something about her... Too bad she seems to be in a bit of a rush.) Examine Old lady Apollo: ...Looks like there's some trouble by the park gate. Trucy: I smell an incident! Officer: Ma'am! There's no entry to the park! Old Lady: Now don't you tell me where I can't go, young fella! I always walk through this park on my way home! Officer: Please, get down from there! You'll hurt yourself, ma'am! Apollo: (That's quite the determined old lady.) People Park sign Apollo: People Park... Huh, kind of an odd name for such an empty place. Trucy: I wonder why it's named that? Hey! There's something written on the gate post... Apollo: Huh? Oh yeah... It says, \"Donated by Big Wins Kitaki\". Trucy: You mean the Kitaki Family built this park? It's so nice of them to give to the community like that! Apollo: ...Let's not get too friendly with them, shall we? (A gangster building a park...? Odd move for a crime boss.) Police officer below People Park sign Apollo: Personally, I'm a little more interested in this park. Trucy: You know what I think? I bet they're filming a movie. Let's go take a look! Maybe we'll see someone famous! Officer: Hey, Miss! Stay out of the park! Trucy: ...He got mad at me. Apollo: Um, did something happen here, officer? Officer: Huh? Uh, no, move along, nothing to see. Why don't you kids go play someplace else? Apollo: We're not kids and we're not playing! I'm an attorney! ???: ...Something wrong? Officer: Ah, Detective Skye! We're fine ma'am, nothing to report! Apollo: (Detective...?) Trucy: Why's she wearing a lab coat? Apollo: You're hardly one to comment on how people are dressed. ???: And... these kids are? Officer: Curiosity seekers, ma'am. They claim to be \"lawyers\". ???: Ah. Why don't you kids run along and play someplace else? Apollo: Look, we're not... ???: Or I might spill something on that pretty face of yours. Want a dose of experimental Hydroxyacelunodosetrase? Trucy: ...Come again? What's Hydroxy... stuff? Apollo: Whatever it is, it doesn't sound good. Let's go, Trucy! ???: Try to keep out the riff-raff, if you would. Officer: Yes ma'am! Apollo: Grr... How are we going to get more information like this? Trucy: Why don't we ask that nice woman across the street? Apollo: (Oh yes, that nice woman... *gulp*) Police officer below People Park sign (subsequent times) Apollo: I gotta say, I'd really like to know what happened here... Officer: Hey, I said no one goes in! Unless you want a face-full of hydroxyadayadawhatzit! Apollo: (Hmm... No dice.) Trash can Apollo: There's a big trash can on the way into the park. I guess we could check it out... Trucy: A detective's life sure is a hard one! Apollo: I'm an attorney, actua... Huh? Trucy: Hmm. Two pieces of garbage with paint on them. Apollo: These... are slippers. They look like those slippers you get at the hospital... Trucy: Look at this, Apollo! Doesn't this go on a car...? Apollo: It's a side-view mirror! Looks like it was torn off when it smacked into something... or someone. Trucy: Wait, you don't think... Apollo: I do. This could be from the car that hit Mr. Wright! Trucy: Wow, and he took off its mirror? I never knew Daddy was so strong. I only have room in my pocket for one of these, though. Which do you want to take? Slippers Slippers crammed into pocket. Leads back to examination Mirror Mirror slipped into pocket. Leads back to examination Trash can (subsequent times, if Slippers is added to the Court Record) Apollo: There's a side-view mirror with some paint on it in this trash can. Trucy: I can only carry one thing at a time in my pocket, you know. Apollo: (Should I swap the slippers for the mirror?) Swap Apollo: Sure, let's swap the evidence. Trucy, if you would. Trucy: I'm on it! Mirror slipped into pocket. Leads back to examination No need Apollo: ...On second thought, let's not and say we did. Leads back to examination Trash can (subsequent times, if Mirror is added to the Court Record) Apollo: There's some paint on the slippers in this trash can. Trucy: I can only carry one thing at a time in my pocket, you know. Apollo: (Should I swap the mirror for the slippers?) Swap Apollo: Sure, let's swap the evidence. Trucy, if you would. Trucy: Right-o! Slippers crammed into pocket. Leads back to examination No need Apollo: Actually... let's not and say we did. Leads back to examination Talk People Park (appears after examining police officer below People Park sign) Apollo: ...Can I ask you a question? Plum: What? Apollo: ...What happened in the park across the street? Plum: Oh, yes, quite the commotion. \"Chicago Lightning\", as the Boss would say. Trucy: Chicago... huh? Plum: Gunfire. Someone was killed. Strange circumstances, too. Apollo: You're kidding! Plum: What a morning! Trouble everywhere. The park, the gate, even our house... Trucy: Did something happen at your house, too? Plum: A crime without honor! Without remorse! It's a private matter... Wanna hear about it? Trucy: Somehow I don't think \"no\" is an acceptable answer, Polly. A private matter (appears after \"People Park\") Apollo: So... what happened at your house? Plum: Bloomers. Last night. Apollo: Eh. (I got a bad feeling about this...) Plum: Me, Little Plum Kitaki, the victim of a panty-snatcher! Trucy: Whaaaaaaat? So it wasn't just my panties that were stolen!? Plum: Got you too, did they? Poor thing. Like I said, whoever did this is a hardened criminal. It wasn't you, was it!? Apollo: N-No! Of course not! Mercy! Plum: I've heard word that panties have been disappearing lately. ...And the missing panties all have something in common. Apollo: (It's hard to imagine Trucy's and Mrs. Kitaki's panties having much in common... I just imagined Mrs. Kitaki's panties... *gulp*) Trucy: I know! We'll find your bloomers, too! Plum: Great! Show me what you're made of. Apollo: (What have you gotten me into this time, Trucy?) Present Mirror Apollo: Can you tell me anything about this mirror? Plum: That's probably from the car that knocked that fellow across the street. Apollo: (Right! That makes this a valuable clue!) Plum: Let me know if you find that car, would you? You splash Kitaki paint, you pay the price. Examine evidence Slippers Toeprint Apollo: Huh? This spot here is black. Trucy: I wonder what that is...? It doesn't look like paint... Leaf indentation on paint on left sole Trucy: The bottom is covered with paint! Apollo: Huh? What's this weird shape here? Trucy: It looks like a leaf was stuck to the bottom when the wearer stepped in some yellow paint. Apollo: So the outline was left when the leaf was removed! Ack! I got paint on my hand! Trucy: ...... Apollo! I saw you try to wipe your hand on my cape! Mirror Severed wires Trucy: It's cut clean off! I wonder what's in there...? Apollo: Don't. There are bare wires hanging out. Trucy: Let's see... Zzzzzzaaaaap! Eeek! Apollo: Wha--!? A-Are you OK!? Trucy: Hee hee! Just a little joke! Apollo: ...... Don't scare me like that! Trucy: You mean, don't \"shock\" you? Zzzzzzaaaaap! Hee hee! After clearing all Talk options: ???: ... Apollo: (...That girl from before!) Plum: Oh! Welcome home, sweetie. ???: Ah, uh... hello, m-mother. Apollo: (She's a Kitaki, too!?) Trucy: Uh, um, Miss! Miss! ???: ...? Trucy: Here, our flyer. ???: The... Wright Anything Agency? Apollo: A-Anything Agency? Trucy: Yeah! Do you like the new flyer? So, um, this is our defense attorney, Mr. Apollo Justice! ???: Attorney...? Trucy: Drop by our office! We'll be waiting! ???: Ah... Good-bye. Apollo: Why did you give her our flyer? Trucy: I dunno. She seemed like she could use some help. Apollo: She's the heiress to a gangster dynasty! She doesn't need our help! Trucy: ...I wouldn't be so sure! Apollo: ...? June 15Scene of the Stand Theft Apollo: So... what's this place? Trucy: This would be Mr. Eldoon's house, silly. Apollo: Oh, so this is where his stand was stolen from. I can see a piece of evidence lying on the ground already. Trucy: ...Hey! Look, there's a police car parked over there. Apollo: You're right... What's with the sparkly... entrance? What is this place? A hospital? There's a sign... \"Meraktis Clinic\". Trucy: Hmm... Oh! That's where the thief went! Apollo: The thief...? Trucy: The one who snatched my panties! He ran into this clinic last night! Wait, maybe that police car is here to find my panties! Apollo: I doubt it. Trucy: Well, there's only one way to be sure! Let's investigate! Guy: Ah, there you are, sonny! Well, you find anything yet!? Apollo: Er, um, no. Not yet. Guy: The longer you loaf around here the saltier your victory bowl gets, just remember that! Apollo: (This bowl of noodles is sounding less like payment and more like punishment...) Examine Clinic front door Trucy: That doorway sure is sparkly! Apollo: The \"Meraktis Clinic\", huh. Looks more like a casino parlor than a hospital. They must be quite profitable. Trucy: Funny, it looks closed. Maybe they're on vacation today? Green banner Apollo: Looks like they have a special offer going on... Trucy: \"Three shots for the price of one!\" Ooh, now's our chance, Apollo! Apollo: Chance for what!? I don't need any shots, thank you. Whoever runs this clinic, they seem pretty business-minded. Police car Apollo: I'd understand if there was an ambulance outside... But a police car? Trucy: Maybe they're tax evaders! Officer: Ah, sorry miss. No going into the clinic today. Trucy: Did something happen? Officer: Huh? Oh, no. Nothing to see here. Move along. You'll have to find someplace else to play doctor. Apollo: (Do we look like the right age to be playing doctor!?) We need a little more info on this Meraktis Clinic. Trucy: We could ask Mr. Eldoon. He is their neighbor and all. And we should check out that garage! What if the thief who stole my panties is still in there!? Apollo: ...*sigh* Blue tarp Guy: That's the place! Right there! That's where I kept my stand. Covered all nice 'n' purty with that blue tarp there! Apollo: So you used this plastic sheet to cover your stand at night? ...I see. Trucy: You see? What? Did you figure out why it was stolen!? Apollo: Well no, but it does suggest that the thief knew what he or she was looking for. They clearly knew what was under that sheet. Guy: So it wasn't one of those casual drive-by stand snatchers, you mean? Not bad, sonny-boy. Not bad at all! Bowl Apollo: Is this yours, Mr. Eldoon? Guy: Hey! That there's the heart and soul of Eldoon's Noodles! The bowl absorbs my salty soup... Pretty soon it's gonna taste just like noodles! Trucy: Wow! It does smell like noodles! Guy: All my other bowls got taken away with my stand! Get it back for me, sonny-boy, I'm beggin' ya! Bowl added to the Court Record. Bowl (subsequent times) Apollo: Is this yours, Mr. Eldoon? Guy: Hey! That there's the heart and soul of Eldoon's Noodles! The bowl absorbs my salty soup... Pretty soon it's gonna taste just like noodles! Trucy: Wow! It does smell like noodles! Guy: All my other bowls got taken away with my stand! Get it back for me, sonny-boy, I'm beggin' ya! House Trucy: This house is... well, it's old! Guy: It's been well-loved, that's for sure. I've lived here with my wife for many years now. It's got character, though, just like my soup! Apollo: (I always thought character was a positive thing.) \"NOO\" sign Apollo: ...That's quite a sign. I take it that's \"NOO\" as opposed to \"OLD\"? Guy: Ah, you like it? Made it myself, I did. I meant to write \"Noodles\" but ran outta space. Trucy: Prior planning prevents poor performance! Guy: Lucky for me it spells a word all by itself! And spruces up my image, it does! Apollo: (It does have a certain power of willful denial thing going for it.) Oil drum Apollo: It looks like the oil drum is connected to that sink over there... Trucy: Collecting rainwater to do the dishes! How environmentally conscious! Apollo: You... don't think he uses rainwater to cook his noodles and to make the broth, do you? Trucy: Oh I'm sure he finds the best water money can buy! Taste is his business, you know. Look, that sign over there! \"Eldoon's only uses water from all-natural sources!\" Apollo: ... (I think I'll take a rain check on eating here.) Sign under oil drum Apollo: There's a hand-written sign here... \"Save the light!\" Trucy: \"Save the light!\" indeed! Mr. Eldoon's house is practically in the dark here! Apollo: I guess the hospital clinic next door blocks the sunlight. Guy: Everything's gone wrong since they built this monstrosity! Broth needs sun or it rots! What's a man to do? They just want my customers to get food poisoning so they can turn a pretty profit... Apollo: (That seems like a lot of trouble to go through for a few extra patients...) Dog Trucy: Look! A doggy! Good boy, good boy, Salty! Apollo: I'm sure the dog has a real name, Trucy. Guy: Yup, sure does! Name's Spoon. And it's a she, by the way. Trucy: Spoon doesn't seem so lively. Guy: She didn't get her bowl of salty broth this mornin', that's why. Poor lil' thing. *sniff* Trucy: Apollo! Let's find that stand soon! For Spoon's sake! Apollo: (I'm pretty sure dogs aren't supposed to eat noodles...) Talk Eldoon's Noodles Apollo: So, your stand... \"Eldoon's Noodles\", was it? Guy: Aye! Passed down from father to son. That stand's seen its share o' salt, mmm-hmm. Salt runs in the family, you might say. Apollo: (I bet high blood pressure does too.) So... your stand, Eldoon's Noodles, was stolen... Guy: Oh, it wasn't just the stand that was stolen, sonny-boy! I lost those wobbly wheels, my salt-crusted stewpot, my stained sign... I didn't just lose a stand, I lost a legend! Trucy: No one steals a legend and gets away with it on my watch! Let's find that legend, Apollo! Apollo: (Isn't it about time he bought a new one anyway?) Stolen stand Apollo: Are there any more details you could give me about the stand? Guy: You bet, sonny-boy! It happened last night... I was blowing my whistle like always, crying the town, I was. The smell of broth filled the streets... thick 'n' salty. I got home, well, right before 10 PM, I reckon. Apollo: (Guess he's not aiming for that late-night market.) Guy: I washed my bowls and gave the wheels a squirt of grease. Then I went inside. Apollo: When did you notice it had been stolen? Guy: Early this morning. Before the sun rose. Work starts early! Apollo: (Do that many people eat noodles for breakfast!?) Guy: I'm washed up on the salty shores of ruination! That stand had my whole life in it... nay, my whole being! Trucy: They took everything? Guy: All my soup stock, my noodles, my bowls... and my dreams! Trucy: At least they left one bowl. Look, there, on the ground. Guy: If you don't find that stand today... Then I'll be forced to walk the streets, peddling that bowl... my last bowl. Apollo: Please, I'm under enough pressure here as it is. The garage Trucy: That's it! That's where the thief who snatched my panties ran to! Guy: It's a crying shame, that is. If they have to steal, make it my loincloth! Not some pretty girl's panties! Apollo: The garage, right. You don't think the thief lives here, do you? Guy: Feh! I wouldn't put it past that good-for-nothing doctor! Apollo: (Hmm... Do I detect a little animosity here?) Trucy: Let's make sure to check out that garage thoroughly! Meraktis Clinic (appears after examining police car) Trucy: Hey, do you think something happened next door? There's a police car out front... Guy: Feh! Probably gave someone food poisoning, I'll bet! Apollo: (If anyone's at risk of giving someone food poisoning...) Guy: That police car got here this mornin', actually. I asked what they were up to, but they wouldn't even tell me, the neighbor! Feh! Trucy: Hmm... Guy: Not that I was surprised much. That doctor works for the wrong crowd. It was just a matter of time 'fore he got what was coming to him. Feh! Apollo: The \"wrong crowd\"...? Guy: ...Never you mind about that. Present Bowl Guy: You can tell my bowls by the Mr. Salty logo! Trucy: The mascot of Eldoon's Noodles! Guy: They come to the stand, they sit, they drink deep from that bowl... ...and when they see the  bottom, their face looks jus' like Mr. Salty's! Genius, no!? Trucy: Very high-concept. Guy: You can't ply a trade if you don't love the tools. Remember that! Trucy: Yes sir! Apollo: (Trucy has a thing for professionals, clearly.) Anything else Guy: Sorry, sonny-boy. My interest is for my stand and precious little else. Get cracking on that case! Find my stand, I'm beggin' ya! Examine evidence Bowl Inside of bowl Trucy: It's the Eldoon's Noodle's mascot! Mr. Salty! He's so cute! Apollo: It's not a very endearing mascot, is it? Trucy: You know... Come to think of it... ...It looks a lot like you, Apollo. Especially the red parts. Apollo: Can I help if I like red? Bottom of bowl Trucy: Ooh, look! I love these little personal touches! Apollo: Seems a shame to hide it on the bottom of the bowl. ...Huh? When I touched it the paint flaked off. Trucy: He must have painted it on by hand with warm, professional care! Apollo: After buying the cheapest paint he could find with cold professional thrift. June 15Meraktis ClinicGarage Trucy: This is the place! This is where that panty-snatcher ran! Apollo: Are you sure? Trucy: Maybe! Let's look for clues! Clues... to a panty-snatching! Clues... like a pair of panties! Apollo: ...Um, Trucy? Could you try not saying \"panties\" so many times? Examine Car Apollo: There's something about this car... Trucy: Let's take a closer look! Cell phone Apollo: Look... a cell phone. Trucy: Someone dropped it beneath this tire! If the car moved, it would be crushed for sure! Apollo: Hmm... I wonder if it belongs to the doctor here? Trucy: We should bring it to him later! Cell Phone added to the Court Record. Stub on driver's door Trucy: Hey! Look at that! Apollo: The mirror's been broken off! (Now THIS is a clue!) Trucy: What!? You're smiling like you know something I don't... You aren't keeping a clue from me, are you, Polly? Apollo: (A clue? Let's see...) Show evidence Apollo: I think I do have just the clue you've got in mind... Present Mirror Apollo: Apollo: My clue is... this! Trucy: Whoa! It's the same color and size and everything! A perfect match! Apollo: I guess we could check it out... Trucy: Hmm. Two pieces of garbage with paint on them. Look at this, Apollo! Doesn't this go on a car...? Apollo: It's a side-view mirror! Looks like it was torn off when it smacked into something... or someone. Apollo: Well... looks like we've just solved a case. Trucy: So the car that hit Daddy last night... Apollo: ...Is sitting right in front of us, yep. Trucy: Wow. You put the \"pro\" in \"professional\", Apollo! Apollo: Gee, thanks, Trucy. Leads back to examination Present anything else Apollo: Trucy: ... That's your clue? Sorry, but that leaves me feeling kind of... clueless. Apollo: (Like father like daughter with the humor, apparently.) Trucy: There's no need to bluff here, Apollo! Save that for the court! Apollo: (Thanks for the advice...) Leads back to examination No evidence Apollo: Hmm. Not that I can think of. Trucy: No? Then what were you smiling about? Apollo: Oh, I wasn't smiling. It was the dust in here. I thought I was going to sneeze... Ah... ah... ah... WAACHOOO! Trucy: Well, don't make faces that ah... AH-CHOO! ...are so misleading then. Apollo: (I know yawns are contagious, but sneezes...?) Trucy: Mmm. Well, I'm sure there's gotta be a clue somewhere! Let's keep checking things out! Leads back to examination Stub on driver's door (after correctly presenting Mirror) Apollo: This mirror fits this car door perfectly... Trucy: So the car that hit Daddy last night... Apollo: ...Is sitting right in front of us, yep. Trucy: Wow. You put the \"pro\" in \"professional\", Apollo! Tailpipe (before examining cell phone and stub on driver's door) Apollo: That reminds me... I once read a record of a case that Mr. Wright worked on many years ago. Trucy: ...? Apollo: Apparently, there was this car with a piece of cloth shoved into the tailpipe! That piece of cloth turned out to be a vital clue to solving the case! Trucy: Wow! Apollo: I remember that case record whenever I'm checking out a car... And I always check the tailpipe! Trucy: Everyone's gotta have a hobby, I guess. Apollo: Wouldn't it be funny if... ...Hey! There's something in there! Trucy: What!? Apollo: W-Wait a second... Are these your... Trucy: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! My panties!!! Apollo: Whaaaat!? Already!? Trucy: Wow, thank you, Apollo! You're a genius! Amazing! Apollo: No, no, really, don't mention it. Trucy: No, I'm serious, I'm really impressed! You must have a nose for finding girls' panties! Apollo: ... Um, what are those? Trucy: My little panties, of course! They've come home to mama! I can't wait to use them! Apollo: Y-You're going to put them on? N-Now!? Trucy: Watch closely now... See? Nothing in the panties... ...Ta-da!!! Apollo: Whoa! Wh-Where'd that come from!? How did that bowl get in your panties!? Trucy: My panties are an extra-dimensional space... Anything can fit in there! ...They're my Magic Panties! It's one of my best tricks. Apollo: Magic... panties? Trucy: They love them over at the Wonder Bar. I do shows there nightly. Apollo: ...You mean those panties are a prop!? You could have told me a little sooner! Trucy's Panties put discreetly away in Trucy's pocket. Apollo: Well, that's once case closed, at least. Trucy: What are you saying!? We still have to catch the sly devil that ran off with the tool of my trade! Apollo: Oh, right. (Something tells me we're not finished searching this garage, anyway...) Tailpipe (after examining cell phone and stub on driver's door) Apollo: That reminds me... I once read a record of a case that Mr. Wright worked on many years ago. Trucy: ...?

Trucy: What are you saying!? We still have to catch the sly devil that ran off with the tool of my trade! Apollo: Oh, right. Tailpipe (subsequent times, before examining cell phone and stub on driver's door) Apollo: Still, I'm glad. If I hadn't picked up that habit of looking up tailpipes... ...I might never have seen your panties. I mean, found your panties. Magic panties. Trucy: I know, it was amazing how you slyly peeked up there! I think you have a successful career in peeking up tailpipes ahead of you! Apollo: (I'm so glad all of this makes sense in context.) Trucy: You gotta wonder why my panties were here, though. Apollo: That is a mystery... (Something tells me we're not finished searching this garage, anyway...) Tailpipe (subsequent times, after examining cell phone and stub on driver's door) Apollo: Still, I'm glad.

Trucy: You gotta wonder why my panties were here, though. Apollo: That is a mystery... Cat Trucy: Hey! A kitty-cat! Here, kitty kitty kitty. Meow. Trucy: ...It's not coming down. Apollo: We do look kind of suspicious, you have to admit. Trucy: It's OK kitty-cat! His hair won't hurt you! Apollo: It's OK kitty-cat! She won't make you disappear in her hat! (Step)ladder Apollo: Look, it's a folding ladder. Trucy: Polly! That's called a \"stepladder\"! C'mon! Apollo: ...A stepladder? How is that different from a regular ladder then? Trucy: It's a much more complex piece of machinery. It's like two ladders stuck together! Apollo: ...So you admit that basically it's a ladder, right? Trucy: Wait... Huh? Apollo: You have to look past the form... at the essence of the thing. Trucy: Er... Can we talk about something else? Skeleton Trucy: Eeeeeeek! Someone's there! ... Oh, it's just a gold-painted human skeleton. Apollo: (Just a human skeleton!? ...And painted gold?) Trucy: There's a mannequin hand waving to us from the box behind the skeleton. This place just screams \"hospital storage\", don't you think? Apollo: It screams something, that's for sure. Examine evidence Cell Phone Strap Trucy: Look at this cute little watch-strap! I want one! Apollo: ...It's kind of odd, though. Trucy: What is? Apollo: I mean, if you wanted to know the time, you could just look at the phone itself. Trucy: Hey, you're right! Sharp, Apollo! Apollo: Th-Thanks. (Finally, some respect!) Trucy: So, what does that tell you? Apollo: Well, the owner of this phone doesn't think through the details, for one. Trucy: They did drop their phone, after all. I kinda figured they were a little spacey already. Apollo: Oh... good point. Trucy's Panties Ribbon Apollo: ...... Trucy: Something the matter? Apollo: Uh... I was just wondering if there was, like, a switch on these... Trucy: Of course not! Apollo: ...Huh. Mysterious. Trucy: Oh? Do you want to know the secret of my panties? Apollo: Ack! N-No! No thanks! (Who uses magic panties in a stage show anyway...?) After examining cell phone and tailpipe and correctly presenting Mirror upon examining stub on driver's door: Trucy: Apollo! Apollo: Huh? What is it? Trucy: Now that we've solved this case, we should go report to Daddy! He'll mope if we leave him alone too long, knowing him. Apollo: Um, OK. ...He doesn't seem the type to mope, though. (And this is hardly a case worth reporting...) Examine Car Apollo: This car belongs to someone at the Meraktis Clinic... and it hit Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright sprained his ankle, and the car lost a side-view mirror. This car vs. Mr. Wright... Not quite the match of the century. Wright Anything Agency Talk Panty-snatcher (after Trucy's Panties is added to the Court Record) Trucy: What, you want to see them again? Well, if you must... Apollo: No no no, I'm fine, really. Let's just put them away, shall we? Case closed. Trucy: What are you talking about!? The case isn't closed until we have our thief! Just find him on the side while you work on the other cases! Apollo: If it were that easy we wouldn't need the police. Trucy: If we don't need the police... then we don't need defense attorneys, either, right? Apollo: (Fine, fine. I'll look for your panty-snatcher...) Present Trucy's Panties Trucy: I'm so glad we found my panties! Apollo: I had no idea they were so important to you. Trucy: And in time for tonight's show, too! A lot of people come just to see my panties, you know! Apollo: You... might not want to advertise it like that. Trucy: ? Kitaki Mansion Examine Trash can (after Mirror is updated in the Court Record) Apollo: There's a big waste basket by the park entrance. Trucy: ...? You aren't going to search through the trash? Apollo: I don't think we need to. Trucy: Oh, no, please, knock yourself out. Don't mind me, I'll be waiting over here. Apollo: Just so we're clear, searching through trash isn't a hobby of mine, OK? Present Mirror (after Mirror is updated in the Court Record) Apollo: I found out who this mirror belongs to. Plum: Ooh. You're tougher than you look. Spit it out. Who was it? Where do they live? Apollo: Urk! I j-just forgot! Heh! Trucy: I remember, Apollo! It was the Meraktis Clinic! Apollo: Shhhh! Trucy: Why? I'm right, aren't I? Plum: ...Meraktis, eh? Apollo: Um, yes. (Why's she so quiet all of a sudden?) ... Is something wrong? Plum: Erm, no. Pay me no mind. And thanks for the info. After clearing all Talk options in Accident Scene, clearing all Talk options and examining bowl in Scene of the Stand Theft, and examining cell phone and tailpipe and correctly presenting Mirror upon examining stub on driver's door in Meraktis Clinic - Garage: June 15Hickfield Clinic Phoenix: Yo! How goes it? Trucy: Daddy! How do you feel? Phoenix: Not bad, Trucy, not bad. It's good to have you young'uns on the case. Lets ol' Daddy-o get some well-deserved R&R. Trucy: The elderly need their rest! Apollo: (Uh... isn't he only 33?) ...Um, we've cleared up most of the cases... Phoenix: I was right about you. Competent. Capable. Tell me what you found out. If you want to. Apollo: (Your enthusiasm is over-whelming...) Talk Progress report Phoenix: Well, I certainly didn't expect you back this early. Trucy: Polly's amazing! He found my panties so quick! Almost like he was the one who stole them! Apollo: ...You have an interesting concept of praise. Phoenix: ...And? Did you find the mad driver who gave me that 30-foot toss? Apollo: Apparently... it was a doctor. From the Meraktis Clinic. Phoenix: Hmm... Meraktis, eh? I've heard of him. Nothing good, mind you. Apollo: That reminds me, a police car was parked outside the clinic. Trucy: Maybe something happened? Apollo: What is this Meraktis Clinic anyway? Meraktis Clinic Phoenix: All I've heard are the rumors. That clinic's been making good money... in a bad way. Apollo: Bad...? Phoenix: Ties to organized crime... The Kentucky Family. Apollo: Um... the Kitaki Family? (He did that on purpose!) Phoenix: Some injuries you can't take to a public hospital, see. They use the Meraktis Clinic for their patch-up jobs. Apollo: Interesting... People Park Trucy: It looked like something had happened in that park. Phoenix: Ah. A body was found there in unusual circumstances... Apollo: Something more unusual than being dead? Phoenix: ...It's not our concern, in any case. Trucy: Right! Let's ignore that and find that noodle stand! Apollo: (What ever happened to professional curiosity?) Present Mirror Phoenix: So this was the thing that led you to the car. Apollo: Yes, sir! The mirror you knocked off was just the clue we needed! Phoenix: Good work, Apollo. Of course you might say... ...I was the one who made solving that case possible. Apollo: (...You don't get points for knocking off a car mirror.) Trucy's Panties Trucy: Look! My panties! They came home to mama! Phoenix: Thanks, Apollo. I was worried about them, too. Trucy special ordered those... Apollo: (A startling display of parental concern!) Phoenix: I'd hate to have to buy a  new pair... *shudder* Apollo: (Make that a not-so-startling display of cheapskatedness.) Anything else Phoenix: ... Apollo: (It's actually a relief to be so thoroughly ignored.) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ...Thanks, really. If I get tired of sleeping, maybe I'll head down to this Meraktis place. Maybe hit 'em up for some reparations... A little legal action would do me some good. Apollo: Um... I was wondering when I get paid? We solved the case of your accident, and um, found a missing article of clothing. Trucy: My panties! Phoenix: That leaves the noodle stand. Apollo: Eh. Phoenix: Feel free to drop in if you get stuck. I'd be happy to help with anything not involving money. Apollo: (Good-bye, quid pro quo. Hello pro bono. *sigh*) Trucy: Right! Back to the office to plan our next move! After clearing all Talk options in Accident Scene, clearing all Talk options and examining bowl in Scene of the Stand Theft, and examining cell phone and tailpipe and correctly presenting Mirror upon examining stub on driver's door in Meraktis Clinic - Garage: June 15Kitaki Mansion Trucy: Little Plum's not here. She's not finished cleaning, huh. Apollo: Maybe she went to get a paint scraper? Plum: OK! Who's the wise guy who spit gum out on the street!? Apollo: (Her voice carries all the way out to the street from inside the mansion...) Trucy: She's a neat freak! How cute! Plum: You there! It was you, wasn't it!? Fess up! I hope you've said your prayers. You're gonna need them... Apollo: Tr-Trucy? Let's leave. Now. Trucy: ...? Examine Mansion front gate Apollo: An impressive gate befitting the Kitaki Mansion. Trucy: Look at the name plate! \"Kitaki\"...! That's so cool! Short and blunt, like any good gangster! Ooh! Let's change our name! How about... \"W. A. A.\"! ... Maybe that's too short and blunt. What do you think? Apollo: No comment. Mansion gate wall Apollo: A colorful dragon turns its baleful gaze in my direction. As if to say, \"Abandon all hope ye who enter here.\" Don't worry, Mr. Dragon. Me and hope haven't been on speaking terms for a while. Spilled paint Apollo: Several colors of paint have been splashed across the gate. It's almost all dry. This is going to be tough to clean. Old lady Apollo: It looks like that woman's still causing trouble... Officer: Look, no one goes in! That means you! Old Lady: Oh, what's the difference? Let... me... go! Ow! Ow ow ow ow ow ow!!! Officer: Ah! S-Sorry! Old Lady: That's it, I'm suing! ...But I might change my mind for five bucks... Apollo: (What is she, some kind of con artist?) People Park sign Apollo: Apparently, this park was the gift of the Kitaki Family. The friendly \"People Park\", brought to you by organized crime... A very naughty part of me is tempted to write \"We Kill\" on the left side of the sign. Police officer below People Park sign Apollo: They're not letting anyone into the crime scene. The guard at the entrance is humming a song. He's got rhythm, actually. Maybe he plays in a band. June 15Wright Anything Agency Apollo: You... You're the woman from the Kitaki place! ???: Y-Yes... Trucy: I knew it! Something's the matter and you want our help, right? Well, you've come to the Wright place! This way, please... ???: Um... Thank you. Alita: My name is Alita Tiala. I... have a request. Talk Your request Apollo: Your request... let me guess, something's been stolen? Alita: Um, your flyer... It says \"now defending\" so I thought... Apollo: Whaaaat!? You mean, you mean you want me to defend you? Me? Trucy: Maybe you can tell us what happened? Were you hit by a car? Did someone steal your stand? Or your panties? Alita: No! No... I'm not the client, actually. The client would be my... well, my fiancé, I suppose you'd call him. Apollo: Fiancé...? What happened to him, then? Alita: He was arrested this morning. The charge... was murder. Trucy: Murder... Alita: Have you heard about what happened at the park? Tiala's story Apollo: So, what's your story? You frequent the Kitaki Mansion, yes? Are you a member of their, um, organization? Alita: No... Not yet. Trucy: Not yet? Alita: You see, I'm to be married next month. To the boss's son. Apollo: The boss's son...? So he's a, uh... *gulp* (A gangster...) Alita: Yes, but the Kitakis are locally responsible gangsters. I thought it'd be nice for a change... Quit my boring job, live the good, gangster life. Trucy: I think you're on to something! \"Mrs. Kitaki\"... I like the sound of that! Apollo: (I'm not sure your daddy would care much for that...) Murder in the park (appears after \"Your request\") Apollo: Wh-What happened!? Alita: I haven't been told all the details. But I do know a body was found in the park. Near the Kitaki Mansion. Trucy: There were a lot of police cars there. Alita: Apparently, the victim was shot with a pistol... But I hear the circumstances of the shooting were... rather unusual. Apollo: And your fiancé was arrested for this? Trucy: Um... what sort of person is your fiancé? Your fiancé (appears after \"Tiala's story\" and \"Murder in the park\") Apollo: Your fiancé is the Kitaki Family's only son, correct? Alita: His name's Wocky. Wocky Kitaki... I brought a photo. Apollo: Well. That's... quite the photo. Alita: I know! Oh, he can be powerful and menacing, but so cute! Apollo: But, if he's the boss's only son... Alita: Yes, I'm sure he'll take his father's place some day. Trucy: Say, I'm a boss already! Of this agency! Alita: Please help my Wocky! Please! Apollo: (...Right! My first solo defense case! Crime boss's son or not, I'll prove he's innocent!) Alita: I... prepared a letter of request. I know you need those. Letter of Request added to the Court Record. Trucy: Right! Let's go check out the scene of the crime! Your fiancé (subsequent times) Apollo: Your fiancé is the Kitaki Family's only son, correct? Alita: His name's Wocky. Wocky Kitaki... I brought a photo. Apollo: Well. That's... quite the photo. Alita: I know! Oh, he can be powerful and menacing, but so cute! Apollo: But, if he's the boss's only son... Alita: Yes, I'm sure he'll take his father's place some day. Trucy: Say, I'm a boss already! Of this agency! Alita: Please help my Wocky! Please! Apollo: (...Right! My first solo defense case! Crime boss's son or not, I'll prove he's innocent!) Present Attorney's Badge Alita: An attorney's badge... So you really are a defense attorney. Please, I'm counting on you. I need your help. Letter of Request Alita: I hope that's OK? I've never written a letter of request before. Apollo: Oh, it's fine. (I should hope it's your first...) Trucy: If we take this we'll be able to investigate the scene! Anything else Alita: I'm not sure I understand... I'm sorry. Apollo: No, no, it's me who's sorry, really! Sorry! Examine evidence Letter of Request Writing Trucy: Why does this envelope say \"Hit Request\"? Apollo: Um... it's a bit of lingo. Like \"call in a hit\", or a \"hit man\"... Trucy: Ooh, you mean gangster-talk!? So does \"hit\" mean \"to defend\" in gangster-ese? Well, \"hit man\"? Apollo: I certainly hope not... (Something tells me she used the wrong envelope...) June 15Hickfield Clinic Apollo: Huh...? Where's Mr. Wright? Trucy: Maybe he's getting an examination again? Apollo: How many does he need!? (Wasn't it just a sprain?) Trucy: Too bad, Polly! You wanted to show off your request to Daddy, didn't you! Apollo: What? Me? No! Trucy: Oh? That's a surprise. Apollo: L-Let's just come back later, shall we? After clearing \"Your fiancé\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency: June 15Detention CenterVisitor's Room Trucy: Polly! You look as happy as a clam in its shell. Apollo: For a lawyer this is it, the place where the battle begins! Guard: ...Ahem. You need something? Apollo: Aaah! Yes, we're attorneys. I was hoping we could see Mr. Wocky Kitaki? Guard: Sorry, he's in questioning right now. Could take a while. Trucy: Drat. Oh well, guess we'll have to come back later then. Apollo: So much for that battle... Examine Security camera Apollo: That security camera is looking at me. I wonder if they tape all of this. Security guard Apollo: A security guard. He stands here, watching this room. I have no idea if he's listening to us talk. I'm not even sure he's breathing. After clearing \"Your fiancé\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency: June 15Kitaki Mansion Apollo: (So this is it... My first murder crime scene!) Officer: Ah, it's you kids again. Look, can't you find some other place to play... Trucy: We're not playing! We're um, \"investigating\"! Aren't we, Apollo? Apollo: Sir, I have a letter of request here. Officer: Letter of... huh? Why does it say \"Hit Request\" on it? Apollo: (Ms. Tiala must have used the Kitaki's stationery...) ???: Excuse me, coming through. Officer: Ah! It's you! Mr. Gavin! Apollo: ...! (Who's this guy...?) ???: I must say I'm used to being inspected by the ladies... But this is the first time I've felt this way with a man. Apollo: Mr.... Gavin? ???: Ah, Fräulein. What is a sweet morsel like you doing in such a dismal place? Can I help? Trucy: ... Y-Yes! The police man officer fellow here won't let us in! We even have a letter of request! ???: You must be exhausted, standing out here! I will take you to the scene of the crime. Trucy: Oooh! R-Really!? ???: ...By your leave, Officer. Officer: Ya... Yes sir! Of course, sir! ???: Ah ha. Very well. This way, Fräulein... Trucy: Whee! Apollo: ... Hey! What about me!? June 15People Park ???: ...On that note, enjoy your investigation! Trucy: Thank you! Will we see you again...? ???: Ask the wind, Fräulein. I'll be riding on it! Apollo: ...Who was that? Trucy: Eeeeeeeeeek! Apollo! Look! A c-corpse! Apollo: Whaaaat!? ...Hey, it's just a mannequin. Trucy: Wow. It sure got me. ???: Ahem. Might I ask exactly what it is you're doing here? Oh, it's you. How did you kids get in here? Trucy: Oh! This guy, well, he was more like a prince really. He let us in... ???: Him again. That glimmerous fop, always getting in my way... Anyway! This scene is off-limits. Apollo: Excuse me? We have a letter of request! ???: ...Hmm. One moment. Apollo: (Why is she holding that big magnifying glass...?) ???: .............................. I'd recognize that handwriting anywhere. Scientific analysis says this was written by Alita Tiala. Apollo: ...Thanks. (It took you thirty minutes to figure that out!?) So... what's up with the mannequin there? ???: It's taking the place of the body, preserving the scene of the crime as it was found. Apollo: (The body... was pulling the stand!?) ???: So, you're a defense attorney, are you? Ema: Detective Ema Skye. I'm in charge of this crime scene. Trucy: She doesn't seem that happy about it. Apollo: ...She doesn't seem that happy about many things. Ema: I trust you know how to stay out of the way. I always carry two pairs of handcuffs... just in case. Examine Noodle stand Ema: Hey there! No messing with the crime scene! Apollo: B-But we need to investigate! Trucy: Apollo! Look! That stand! ... It says \"Eldoon\"! Apollo: ...I've noticed. Well, we've solved the case of the missing stand at least. ...Though the circumstances could stand to be better. Anywhere else Ema: Hey there! No messing with the crime scene! Apollo: B-But we need to investigate! Ema: Investigations are to be carried out by professionals, scientifically! Apollo: (She's not going to let us check out the crime scene, is she...) Trucy: Hey, Apollo. My very un-scientific analysis tells me something here is very suspicious... Apollo: ...I think I know what you mean. It's kind of hard not to notice. (I'd better check out what we came here to find at least.) Talk Any option Apollo: Um, Detective Skye...? Ema: Quiet, please. It's snack time. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. Trucy: We're not making much progress here. Apollo: (She must not be very busy...) Ema: *sigh* I never seem to get a lucky break. Back after nine years, and they won't give me the position I requested... ...And then I hear he gave up the defense attorney life... Apollo: (He? Who's he? An ex-defense attorney...?) Present Anything Apollo: Um, if you could spare a moment to take a look at this? Ema: ...Can't you see that I am extremely, extremely busy? Apollo: (...Eating snacks, yes.) Trucy: Busy eating snacks, I'd say. Apollo: (This is going nowhere fast.) After clearing any Talk option and examining noodle stand in People Park: June 15Eldoon's House Trucy: Oh, Mr. Eldoon...! Hello? Apollo: Looks like he left. Trucy: And we found his stand and everything! What about our free bowl!? Apollo: Oh, too bad, looks like we'll have to wait a little longer for that bowl. So sorry. Trucy: Aw, what a bummer. Examine Clinic front door Apollo: The front entrance to the Meraktis Clinic. The walls and posts are so highly polished I can see my face in them. ... Hot dang, my hair looks good. Green banner Apollo: Looks like this is a banner for some campaign. \"Three shots for the price of one\"... Somehow I don't see people lining up for that. Police car Apollo: A police car is parked in front of the Meraktis Clinic. It's empty. The police must be inside investigating. Blue tarp Apollo: The blue tarp Mr. Eldoon used to cover his noodle stand. Robbed of its purpose, it blows in the wind... alone. Bowl Apollo: A lone Eldoon's Noodles bowl lies on the ground. The lone bowl, tipped on its side... It's kind of surreal. House Apollo: Mr. Eldoon's house has seen better days. And I'm betting I've eaten better noodles. \"NOO\" sign Apollo: This must be his business sign. It reads \"NOO\". Maybe that's how the kids are spelling \"new\" these days. Another failed attempt at hipster marketing. Oil drum Apollo: An oil drum for catching rainwater. ...Ack! A sparrow just flew over and... Aw man, that was just disgusting! Something tells me this wasn't the first time. Sign under oil drum Apollo: There's a hand-written sign here... \"Save the light!\" It's hard to make out the sign in the shade from the clinic next door. Spoon the dog Apollo: Guy Eldoon's dog doesn't look too lively. They say dogs and their owners resemble each other... I guess there are exceptions. After clearing any Talk option and examining noodle stand in People Park: June 15Hickfield Clinic Phoenix: Ah, you're back! Run into some problems? Trucy: Oh, Polly, didn't you want to tell Daddy something? Apollo: Who? Me? No! I'm fine. Really. Phoenix: What's this? So there is a problem? Apollo: No, no problem. Actually, I got a defense request. Phoenix: A defense request! That is a problem. Apollo: Huh...? Phoenix: I've given up the court. I'm not a lawyer anymore. Apollo: ... The request was for me! Phoenix: Oh, right. You're a lawyer, aren't you? Apollo: (He's doing that on purpose! I know it!) Talk Murder Phoenix: So, what about this defense request? Apollo: It's related to the murder in People Park, actually. Trucy: Guess what! We found Mr. Eldoon's noodle stand at the scene of the crime! Phoenix: Did you now. That's unusual indeed. Never heard of a noodle stand being used as a murder weapon. Apollo: ...Uh, I think the murder weapon was something else. Phoenix: You mean you don't know what the murder weapon was? Trucy: That funny detective lady won't let us on the scene! What kind of detective wears a lab coat, anyway!? Phoenix: A lab coat? Hmm. Didn't think she'd be involved with this... Apollo: ...You know her? Phoenix: You could say that. Skye connection (appears after \"Murder\") Apollo: So... you know her, don't you? Phoenix: I met her on a case... this was about ten years ago. She was still a high school student at the time. Apollo: (That would make her about the same age as me!) Trucy: That's my daddy! He knows all the police types. Oh, wait! Maybe you know that other guy, too! Apollo: That other guy...? Trucy: That shining prince on the motorcycle! Phoenix: ...Prince? Mysterious Prince (appears after \"Skye connection\") Phoenix: Apollo. Tell me about this \"prince\" of Trucy's. Indulge a concerned father... Apollo: He was at the crime scene... He looked just like Mr. Gavin! Phoenix: ... Did he now. Apollo: ...You know him? Phoenix: My guess is he's Kristoph Gavin's younger brother... Apollo: His brother!? Phoenix: We're acquaintances, after a fashion. Klavier Gavin... rock 'n' roll god incarnate. Trucy: Klavier... What a lovely name! He's so dreamy! Apollo: (I didn't know Mr. Gavin had a brother! And what was he doing out there?) Phoenix: I have a feeling you'll be crossing paths again soon. ...Now, what was the problem again? Having trouble investigating the crime scene in the park? Trucy: Yeah. That detective woman won't let us! Phoenix: ...Go to the office. Under the silk top hat you'll find a bottle of white powder. Try taking that to this detective. Apollo: \"White powder\"...? (I hope it's not what I think it is.) Phoenix: Just take it to her. It'll be fine, you'll see. Oh, and tell her I said hi. Mysterious Prince (subsequent times) Phoenix: Apollo. Tell me about this \"prince\" of Trucy's. Indulge a concerned father... Apollo: He was at the crime scene... He looked just like Mr. Gavin! Phoenix: ... Did he now. Apollo: ...You know him? Phoenix: My guess is he's Kristoph Gavin's younger brother... Apollo: His brother!? Phoenix: We're acquaintances, after a fashion. Klavier Gavin... rock 'n' roll god incarnate. Trucy: Klavier... What a lovely name! He's so dreamy! Apollo: (I didn't know Mr. Gavin had a brother! And what was he doing out there?) Phoenix: I have a feeling you'll be crossing paths again soon. Wright Anything Agency (after clearing \"Mysterious Prince\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic) Examine Silk hat Leads to: \"So this must be the \"silk top hat\" Mr. Wright mentioned.\" Talk The case Trucy: Hmm... I think we should focus on finding more information about the case. Apollo: You seem to be having fun. Trucy: Of course! This is my first criminal investigation! And it's so mysterious! A noodle stand pushing a dead man along... Apollo: ...Uh, I think it was the other way around. The dead man was pulling the stand. But you're right about it being mysterious. Trucy: I knew it! More information, that's what we need! Apollo: So this must be the \"silk top hat\" Mr. Wright mentioned. Let's take a closer look... Huh? Trucy: Whoa! Apollo: You know what this is, Trucy? Trucy: I... remember finding some in Daddy's dresser when I was little. I thought it was sugar, so I licked it... He got mad at me. Apollo: (This is getting more and more suspicious...) White powder placed gingerly into pocket. Trucy: Let's go talk to that detective! She's sure to know what that white powder is! Examine evidence White Powder Label Apollo: Hmm. The bottle has a label on it. Trucy: Can you read it? Apollo: Uh, not a word. I'm not sure I speak whatever language this is written in. Trucy: That's too bad. I guess we're stuck with this mysterious bottle of white powder... People Park (after clearing \"Mysterious Prince\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic, then examining silk hat in Wright Anything Agency) Present White Powder Leads to: \"Um... Does this ring any bells?\" Apollo: Um... Does this ring any bells? Ema: Ah! Is that--!? It couldn't!? Where'd you get that? Apollo: I brought it from the office. Ema: You... work at the Wright & Co. Law Offices, yes? Apollo: Er, yeah, sort of... Trucy: Detective Skye! How do you know my daddy? Ema: D-D-Daddy!? I'm sorry, who did you say you were? Trucy: Trucy Wright. Phoenix Wright's daughter. Ema: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Mr. Wright has a daughter!? Trucy: You seem shocked. Ema: W-Well, if you're Mr. Wright's daughter and you're his apprentice... ...then I'm available to help you in any way I can! Apollo: Oh, uh, thanks. (You can start by not calling me Mr. Wright's apprentice!) Ema: This powder is used for detecting fingerprints. Apollo: Fingerprints...? Ema: I guess you might call it a memento... from the time I spent with Mr. Wright. Apollo: (White powder memories...) Ema: If you find any evidence with fingerprints on it, please let me know! We'll dust for prints! Apollo: (Well, she's quite the eager beaver all of a sudden...) Examine Benches Apollo: Benches line the river running through the park. Trucy: Ahh, a little urban oasis. I bet children come here to splash around in the water. Apollo: That river's a little deep for splashing... and a little dirty. Trucy: Well, they could listen to the water and pretend they were playing. Blue tarps Apollo: Blue tarps have been placed on the ground around the stand. Trucy: Apollo! I bet the victim was going to have a picnic here! Apollo: ...I guess he could have eaten all the noodles he wanted. Ema: Don't touch those! Those are preserving the crime scene! Apollo: (Oh, I guess the police put these tarps here after all.) Knife Apollo: It's... a knife! Ema: A \"shiv\" to be precise. Trucy: Ooh... lingo! Ema: The defendant, Wocky Kitaki, is the son of known gangsters. The police are assuming this belongs to him. Apollo: (Wait, but wasn't the murder weapon a pistol...?) Huh? Look at this, there's a handprint on this shiv... Ema: A handprint? Then there might be a fingerprint. Let's investigate! Right! First, choose the fingerprint you want to examine. Apollo: ...Choose a fingerprint? Ema: Look closely at the handle. See? There's more than one fingerprint there. Trucy: Those black spots? Ema: That's right. Pick the one you want to analyze. Examine darkest fingerprint Leads to: \"Right! Let's get detecting!\" Ema: Right! Let's get detecting! Apollo: (Wow, she's practically glowing with excitement...) Ema: First, sprinkle some aluminum powder over the print. With a press of [A / Space], like this. See? (Changed from [Just touch the screen, like this. See?] in the original release) The oil left by the print absorbs the aluminum powder, so you just dust it on... ...and blow it off! Trucy: B-Blow? Ema: It's like whistling. You know how to whistle, don't you? Just use [X / Y / R] and... (Changed from [It's like whistling. You know how to whistle, don't you? Just put your lips together...] in the original release) Trucy: Wow! Amazing! It's like magic! Ema: Heh heh. Isn't it though? Apollo: (Right, let's give it a shot!) Ema: Incidentally, it's important that you cover the entire fingerprint with the powder. Obtain fingerprint Leads to: \"Hmm, good... clear... Quite impressive!\" Ema: Hmm, good... clear... Quite impressive! Next, to match the print. The police office has samples so you can tell whose finger this print belongs to. Apollo: Hmm... That doesn't sound like as much fun as actually finding the print. Ema: OK, pick the person whose print you think this is. You probably have a good idea whose knife this is already. Compare Wocky Kitaki profile Comparing...Comparison complete. Match found Leads to: \"So... the fingerprints do belong to the defendant.\" Compare anyone else Comparing...Comparison complete. No Match found Leads back to profile selection Apollo: So... the fingerprints do belong to the defendant. Ema: Yes! Isn't it amazing? Ah, the power of science. It's my life. Trucy: Apollo, she's... sparkling. Apollo: And I'm dimming. Ema: Look sharp, spirits up. The real fight is yet to come! Trucy: Chin up, Polly! Apollo: (The trial hasn't even started and I'm already losing...) Knife added to the Court Record. Knife (subsequent times) Apollo: A knife is sticking straight into the ground. Trucy: With the defendant's fingerprints on it... Which means... You think he stuck it into the victim? Apollo: (I don't know what he did with it but I don't like it.) Mannequin Apollo: This mannequin is dressed up to look like a police officer. I've seen one at the station. (A mannequin in place of a body...) Ema: The body of the victim has already been removed. Trucy: Do you think the victim was the noodle stand thief? Apollo: What, you think someone killed him because he stole it? Trucy: Yeah! Taking care of business, Little Plum Kitaki style! Apollo: (Try not to sound too eager about that, please...) Noodle stand Apollo: ...And this is Mr. Eldoon's noodle stand, obviously. Trucy: It does say \"Eldoon\" in big letters, doesn't it! Apollo: And that mark on his paper lantern there looks familiar. Trucy: It's going to be a little weird telling him... what with the corpse and all... Apollo: Anyway, that wraps up three of our cases. Trucy: That's right! Congratulations, Apollo! Apollo: (And leaves us with one case that's worse than all three put together... Murder.) Trash can Apollo: (There's got to be a good clue or two around here...) Trucy: You and your trash cans! Go ahead, knock yourself out. Apollo: Please, can't you see I'm doing my... Huh? L... Look! Another pair of underwear!? Trucy: Wow, Apollo! You're a genius at finding panties! Apollo: Stop saying that. Wait, these aren't...? Trucy: Th-They're not mine! Apollo: (Could these have been stolen, too?) Bloomers added to the Court Record. Trash can (subsequent times) Trucy: I'll always remember this trash can as \"the place where Apollo found those bloomers\"! Apollo: Don't you have more important things to remember? Wait, these aren't...? Trucy: Th-They're not mine! Apollo: (Could these have been stolen, too?) Talk The case Ema: The report came in late last night. The body was found much as you see it now. ...Except it was a real body. Apollo: But... why? Ema: Why was a body pulling a noodle stand? If I knew the answer to that, I wouldn't still be here. Apollo: Well, what was the cause of death...? Ema: A bullet wound, to the temple. ...He was shot by a pistol. Trucy: A pistol? Ema: Not the easiest thing to come by in this day and age. Apollo: (Unless you're a cop... or a gangster.) Ema: Incidentally, the victim's name was Pal Meraktis. I just received the autopsy report, in fact. Meraktis's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Ema: I mean, really! What's up with this case!? It's enough to make me want to run off, pulling a mysterious noodle stand behind me... Trucy: Not so mysterious, actually... We should tell her, Apollo! After all, we know where the stand came from! Ema: A likely story! I didn't come here to play games, you know. Apollo: Actually, we do know where the noodle stand came from. The noodle stand's owner is... Present Guy Eldoon profile Apollo: Ema: ... Who's the old guy? Apollo: This is the proprietor of Eldoon's Noodles, Mr. Eldoon himself! Trucy: He's famous in this part of town. Ema: Not bad. I guess Mr. Wright picked the right kids for the job. That saved me a lot of work. Thanks. Noodle Stand added to the Court Record. Trucy: What sort of person was the victim, anyway? Ema: You mean what did he do? He was a doctor. Apollo: A doctor...? (I'm starting to see a connection here...) Present anyone else Apollo: Ema: ... Look, I have better things to be doing. I'd make more progress eating snacks than listening to this drivel. Apollo: (You could try actually investigating, rather than just standing around.) Leads back to Talk options The case (subsequent times, before correctly presenting Guy Eldoon profile) Ema: The report came in late last night. The body was found much as you see it now. ...Except it was a real body. Apollo: But... why? Ema: Why was a body pulling a noodle stand? If I knew the answer to that, I wouldn't still be here.

Trucy: What sort of person was the victim, anyway? Ema: You mean what did he do? He was a doctor. Apollo: A doctor...? (I'm starting to see a connection here...) Your story Ema: Who? Me? I'm just a supervisor for this crime scene. Apollo: (Detective Skye... Hmm.) Ema: I was out of the country for a while. I came back to be a forensic scientist. Trucy: Ooh! Were you studying abroad? Ema: Something like that. I was studying in Europe. Forensic sciences, mind you. But when I got back here, they threw me in criminal affairs! Just like that! Trucy: Why didn't you just become a forensics expert in Europe? Ema: Well, I suppose that was an option, but... I had a lot of favors to repay to people back here. Apollo: (Favors? Wasn't she in high school when she left?) Ema: What? What's that look for? I was involved in an... incident before I left. But Mr. Wright and his people helped me out. I owed them. Trucy: Really? I had no idea... Apollo: (If she's been out of the country for a while... ...she probably doesn't know about Mr. Wright's current, erm, \"state of affairs\".) The defendant Apollo: Um... Could you tell us a bit about the defendant? He's the only son of the Kitaki Family, yes...? Ema: Wocky Kitaki. I don't know if he is the boss's son, but he's certainly throwing his weight around... ...Violently. In the detention center. Trucy: I see. Apollo: Why was he arrested in the first place? Ema: ... You are a defense attorney, aren't you? You're not his, by any chance? Apollo: Er, a-actually, yes, I am. Ema: Well... We have a witness to the moment of the crime. Apollo: Eh...? Ema: The witness called the police. They'll be testifying during the trial tomorrow. Trucy: Whaaaaaaaa--!? The victim (appears after correctly presenting Guy Eldoon profile upon selecting \"The case\" Talk option) Apollo: Could you tell us a bit more about the victim? Ema: Well, let's see... Apparently he's the physician at a clinic in the area. Quite well off, too, from the sound of it. The clinic's name is... The Meraktis Clinic. Trucy: Hmm... Maybe that's why the cop car was parked there? Ema: What? You've been to the clinic? Apollo: Yeah... Though on a related issue. Apollo: (I told the detective about the case of the stolen noodle stand.) Ema: ...I see... So that means... ...Dr. Meraktis stole the stand and pulled it all the way here? Apollo: That would seem to be the case. Ema: ... But why? Apollo: Don't ask me! Present Attorney's Badge Ema: Ah, an attorney's badge. It reminds me of when Mr. Wright was still defending. Everything I have now is thanks to him. Remember, help as many people as you can. That's your job! Trucy: She's right, Polly! Let's make a difference! ...Is something wrong? Apollo: Ah! Ah, no! N-Nothing. (I... I actually felt inspired for a moment there.) Fingerprint Powder Ema: Fingerprint analysis is the very basis of modern forensic science! Doesn't just talking about it leave you breathless with excitement? Apollo: Oh yes. Breathless. (Actually, it does sound kinda interesting...) Ema: Let me know if you find any evidence that might have a  print or two, alright? Knife Ema: The defendant's fingerprints were found on that knife. Trucy: Which means that, at the very least, he was here at the scene of the crime...? Ema: It's highly possible, yes. Apollo: Ugh. This doesn't look good. Ema: No use worrying about what's out already! You just worry about what's yet to come! Meraktis's Autopsy Report Ema: Why did Dr. Meraktis die like this...? Trucy: Pulling a noodle stand... Very strange. Ema: Inconceivable! I just don't get it! Some people just can't die normally! Apollo: (He's dead, give him a break.) Anything else Ema: Sorry... I don't think I can help you with that. I think you need more than just scientific help. But ask me anything you like! ...Just ask scientifically. Examine evidence Fingerprint Powder Label Apollo: The label reads \"Fingerprint Powder\" in some strange language. Trucy: How do we know for sure? What if this is really a jar for something else, like jam, or honey? Apollo: Why would anyone go through the trouble? Trucy: Well, so the police don't find out, that's why! Apollo: I hardly think possessing fingerprint powder is a crime. Trucy: Oh, huh, I guess. That's boring. Bloomers Pattern on back side Trucy: These bloomers sure have a... distinct design! Apollo: You certainly know who they belong to at a glance. Trucy: That way, she doesn't have to write her name on them! Genius! Apollo: ...I would think writing your name would be easier than drawing a plum blossom. Knife Fingerprints Trucy: So, the defendant's prints are on this knife... Apollo: That would mean he was here the night of the crime. Trucy: That's what I call irrefutable scientific evidence! Neat! Apollo: Not so neat when it happens to be evidence against our client... Noodle Stand \"NOODLE\" sign Trucy: Huh? Look at this, Apollo! Mr. Eldoon spelled his name backwards on this side! Apollo: Um, I think that says \"Noodle\". As in \"Eldoon's Noodles\". Trucy: Huh... Oh, I get it! So the name of his store is the same whether you read it forward or backwards! Apollo: Yeah... I guess it would be. Well, except for the last \"s\". Trucy: ...... Then, how about a store called \"Team Meat\"? Apollo: Uh, close, but that would be \"Taem Maet\" backwards. And what kind of store is that? Trucy: Why, a store that sells meat! \"It's not meat, useless it's Team Meat!\" After clearing all Talk options and examining trash can and knife: Ema: So... have you met the defendant? Apollo: Ah. Uh... No. Ema: Visiting hours are almost over at the detention center. You might think about wrapping up here and heading over. Apollo: Good idea. (I don't know what good it will do. We have a witness, and a knife with prints... Have I mentioned I've got a bad feeling about this?) Ema: Don't worry, it's like a Wright tradition. Apollo: (Some traditions I can live without.) June 15Detention CenterVisitor's Room Guard: I'm sorry. Meeting hours for the day are all done. Apollo: B-But we still have three minutes! Guard: I'll put in your request, but don't expect anything. The father's talking in the private room with him. Trucy: The father? You mean like a priest? Guard: I mean the suspect's father, Mr. Winfred \"Big Wins\" Kitaki himself. Apollo: (Not someone I care to meet...) ???: ...Die you--!!! ???: ...You're the one on your way out, old--!!! Apollo: ...... Trucy: ......... Guard: Ah. They're here. Apollo: (Whoa! This guy radiates power! Power.. with a cute apron?) ???: You Wocky's lawyer? Apollo: Y-Yes, sir! Big Wins: Well, I'm Big Wins Kitaki, fourth head of the Kitaki family... capice? Apollo: Er... Actually, I came to speak to your son. Big Wins: ... Mr. Justice. Apollo: Yes? Big Wins: My son's innocent. He killed no one. If he were found guilty... it wouldn't be good. ...Capice? Apollo: Y-Yes! I'm all about capicing! Capice'd loud and clear! Big Wins: You gotta do more than just understand to make it. You'll learn, though. Even if the lesson comes at the end of your short life. Apollo: (I don't feel so good...) ???: What's the big idea, old man! Wocky: You can't treat me like a kid no more, not now! You know I... I... I wanted to go to the clink! I like it here! Apollo: You... must be Wocky? Wocky: A G's not a G till he does hard time! Bizzoooy! You'll see. When I get out of here, things'll change! Big Wins: Silence! My apologies, Mr. Justice... He's usually such a nice boy. Apollo: (Forgive me if I have a hard time believing that.) Wocky: Ha! You can't take me under your wing this time, old man! You heard me! I don't need no trial! I did it! Big Wins: ...I think that's enough for today, Mr. Justice. Don't let me down tomorrow. Apollo: So much for talking to our client. Trucy: But we made so much progress today! We even found my panties! I had fun, at least. Apollo: Of course, the biggest mystery of all remains... (How am I supposed to build a case for the trial!?) Trucy: Oh, almost forgot, it's time for my show! Tonight I'm performing at the Wonder Bar! You should come check it out. To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Apollo: No clues here.\n-- Wocky Kitaki's \"Truth\" --Wocky: I'll tell you one thing, that doctor was a quacker!Press Apollo: Apollo: First of all, the word you're looking for is \"quack\". And isn't that a little harsh? He's your family doctor... Wocky: Who asked you, pointy-locks!? Just who do you think you are? Apollo: (Uh... your lawyer?) Wocky: Look, I ain't trying to hear that. He was a quacker, plain and simple.Wocky: Someone had to show him what's what!Press Apollo: Apollo: By \"someone\" you mean...? Was there anyone with a score to settle with this doctor? ...Besides you, I mean. Wocky: You better ask somebody else, homes. What do I care? I made up my own mind and did what had to be done. Straight gangsta-style! Judge: But... why were you so mad at this doctor? Wocky: Yo, sit back and listen while I drop it, J-man.Wocky: I was in his clinic 'bout half a year ago. He messed up my op something bad.Press Apollo: Apollo: So you were a patient at the Meraktis Clinic half a year ago? For what reason? Wocky: I had what you might call a \"mark of honor\". Klavier: Can you explain precisely what was wrong? Wocky: We had a little run-in with the Rivales Family. That's when I pulled a jack move... ...and ran into an ambush. G busted a cap right in me. Klavier: According to my sources... you \"couldn't stand the stress of waiting... ...and ran in 15 minutes before the appointed time.\" ...By yourself. Wocky: Hey, I was more than a match for those guys! Judge: So you were carried to the Meraktis Clinic from there? Klavier: Apparently, he was shot in the heart. Apollo: (Shot in the heart and he's still alive!?) Trucy: I can catch bullets between my teeth! But I never learned how to catch them with my heart! Wocky: The bullet stopped just short of my thumper, you know what I'm saying? I woulda been golden if it weren't for that wack doc! Can't even take out a stupid bullet! Klavier: ...So, as you say, the surgery was a failure. Wocky: That ain't all of it, homes!Wocky: And then he just lets me go, without a word. See ya later, bye!Press Apollo: Apollo: What do you mean, he just let you go without a word? Wocky: What do you think it means!? It's wack, that's what! Judge: I'm not sure what that means, but it sounds bad... Klavier: It sounds as though Herr Doktor wished to hide his mistake... This is why he let the defendant go. Wocky: He's a liar, straight up! He's a badder G than me!Wocky: So I gotta go in, get another doc to patch me up again!Press Apollo: Apollo: So, this bullet is still...? Wocky: You know it! I can still feel it... Right there in my chest, pressin' up against my heart! Klavier: \"Your words are like a bullet shot straight into my heart.\" ...or something to that effect? Incidentally, that's from one of our hit singles. Judge: Well, that sounds like a straightforward case of malpractice! Wocky: Word, J-man. Weren't no accident, that's fo' shizzle.Wocky: That was the day I done figured it out. No O.G.'s gonna let that pass!Press Apollo: Apollo: You figured it out that day? So you had no idea until then? Wocky: For half a year, I didn't notice a thing. Apollo: Whaaaat!? You had a bullet in your chest and you didn't know!? Wocky: Heh! Takes more than a bullet to bring me down, homes! Apollo: (How many bullets does it take!?)Wocky: That's why I went to his pad that night, know what I'm saying!?Press Apollo: Apollo: You \"went to his pad\"...? Did you have an appointment to meet with the victim? In the park, perhaps? Wocky: You out of your mind!? Who makes an appointment to get the drop on someone!? I came ready to fight my way into that clinic of his. Shortest way to the clinic from my place is through that park, know what I'm saying? Apollo: (...He's right. That does seem to be the shortest path.) Wocky: There I was, cold walking through the park... ...when he comes popping up out of nowhere, right before my eyes! I figured someone up on high was looking out for me, know what I'm saying?Apollo: (Unngh... This sounds bad right from the get-go.)Trucy: Well, there won't be any get-go if we don't get some more information!Apollo: (Right. First, gather the facts. Time enough for despair later!)After pressing third, fourth, and fifth statements:Judge: Hmm... It seems that there were issues with this doctor.Wocky: Man, putting him down was like doing the world a favor!Apollo: Wocky! ...Please consult your lawyer before saying things like that...Trucy: Chin up, Apollo! Back straight!Judge: But, why did this mistake only come to light that day?Klavier: It was found during the Family health check-up.Apollo: The F-Family check-up?Wocky: That was the wackest thing of all! All us G's lining up, taking eye exams 'n' all that. Better to die young than fade away, bizzzoy!Klavier: ...A relief to hear.Wocky: Eh? Wh-What's a relief!?Klavier: Oh? Did your father not tell you? That bullet you carry so close to your heart... if not attended to immediately... ...It could kill you.Apollo: Wh-Whaaat!?Klavier: Yes, Herr Doktor Meraktis had knowledge concerning this ticking \"time bomb\" in you. Knowledge... that could have saved your life.Wocky: No way! Th-That's wacked!Klavier: There is proof. Your check-up report.Wocky's Check-Up Report added to the Court Record.Klavier: ...How ironic that you would kill the one man capable of helping you. You're almost as careless as he was! ...Ah ha ha ha.Wocky: ......Apollo: ......Klavier: Well, now that the place is hopping... Let's get this gig started!Judge: S-Started...?Klavier: We've had enough of a warm-up act, ja? Time to hear from the witness!Trucy: ...Wocky sure is quiet all of a sudden.Apollo: I'm a little uneasy myself. (Is this Gavin's strategy...?)Klavier: So. You will tell us your name and occupation.Stickler: My name... is Wesley Stickler. By \"occupation\" I take it you refer to some labor that \"profits\" society at large, and supports a livelihood under which definition I must confess to being \"unemployed\" however, we must acknowledge the meaning of \"identity\" which is commonly attached to this notion of \"occupation\", and once we have accepted this reality, we see that our confusion is not Gestalt, per se, but derives instead from the \"vagueness\" inherent in all representations of thoug--Klavier: By which he means to say that he is a student. A junior at Ivy University if I'm not mistaken?Stickler: Yes, in the Department of Science and Engineering. Filled with curiosity for all things, I spend my days in pursuit of truth, honing my...Klavier: Herr Stickler, please direct said curiosity to the case at hand today.Judge: Very well, Mr. Stickler. Please testify to the court about what you saw on the night of the crime.Stickler: You ask, quite simplistically, \"what I saw\". However, we must understand that homo sapiens possess two eyes, each of these designed to receive and interpret data, sending images in the form of signals to the...Witness Testimony-- A Night in the Park --Stickler: That night, I passed through the park on my way home from shopping... when I saw them! One man, pulling a stand. Another man, facing him. I saw them quite clearly. The man facing the victim was the defendant. In his hand he held... yes, a pistol! It was pointed at the man pulling the stand. A shot! The bullet hit the man pulling the stand from the front, square in the forehead!Judge: Hmm... Was there anyone else in the park at that time?Stickler: I can say with 100% accuracy that there was not.Klavier: The pistol our witness refers to... is this.Judge: The court accepts this into evidence.Pistol added to the Court Record.Examine evidence Pistol Muzzle Apollo: Whoa! Don't point that thing to me! Trucy: Don't worry! I can handle myself around guns. Magic guns, at least. The ones that pigeons come out of. Apollo: ...Very reassuring.Judge: Very well. Mr. Justice, you may cross-examine the witness.Apollo: ...Yes, Your Honor.Trucy: ...Apollo: Uh... Trucy? Why are you staring like that at the witness?Trucy: That man... I can't help but feel I've seen him somewhere before.Apollo: ...?Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- A Night in the Park --Stickler: That night, I passed through the park on my way home from shopping... when I saw them!Press Apollo: Apollo: On the way home from shopping, you say? Why go through the park? Stickler: Ah, a fascinating inquiry. Revealing me culpable of being insufficiently verbose! Let us consider the time saved by passing through the park on the way home from the store: In that time I am capable of solving two GMAT problem sets. On average, it requires me 3 minutes, 24 seconds to complete one such set. Ergo the time to complete two is, on average, 6 minutes 48 seconds. However! In the case that the questions are in the verbal category, admittedly not m... Apollo: Th-That's enough! Enough. I get the idea. Judge: Mr. Justice! The court hopes to finish cross-examination sometime this month. Klavier: Please. I've a recording booked after this trial. Trucy: And I've got a show to perform. Apollo: (Gee, sorry you're all so busy!)Stickler: One man, pulling a stand. Another man, facing him.Press Apollo: Apollo: Were these men talking, by any chance? Stickler: Ah, now that you mention it, they were, though I cannot claim I heard them clearly. Only fragments... such as, \"You lied to me!\" Oh, and... \"I'm gonna give you a taste of your own medicine, pal.\" Klavier: Ah ha ha ha! It's just as our defendant claims! I believe he wished to \"teach\" the victim what it felt like to take a bullet in the heart. Judge: If that's true, then this is a vital piece of testimony! Apollo: (Sounds like he heard them clearly enough to me!) Stickler: Might I be allowed to amend my testimony? Apollo: (Wh... What now!?) Stickler: To be precise, he did not say \"pal\" but \"man\". Yes, that was the way of it. I swear it on my diploma! Apollo: (What's the difference!?) Klavier: And this other man, who was he?Stickler: I saw them quite clearly. The man facing the victim was the defendant.Press Apollo: Apollo: How can you be so sure it was the defendant!? The crime took place at night! It would have been too dark! Stickler: ...Perhaps I was remiss in not mentioning this earlier. Apollo: Huh? Stickler: You see, in class, I always sit in the very backmost seat. Do you know why? Apollo: (...Who cares!?) Stickler: Because I do not wish anyone to copy my perfect notes! Judge: ...And this relates to your testimony how? Stickler: I mention this to illustrate my predisposition to that which is \"perfect\". It was dark, you say? Yet there are lights in the park. If I say the defendant was in the park that night, then he was in the park that night. It is a hard, immutable fact. Trucy: He sure is confident... Apollo: He seems to be telling the truth, too. *sigh*Stickler: In his hand he held... yes, a pistol! It was pointed at the man pulling the stand.Press Apollo: Apollo: Are you sure the pistol you saw is the same as the one just submitted as evidence? Stickler: Am I \"sure\"? Surely... you jest! ...Or so a common witness would be tempted to say. Apollo: ...Huh? Stickler: Yet I am no common witness. I see not only events as they are, but the logical structure governing these events! First, we must consider the fact that it was night in the park, which indeed restricted my field of vision due to insufficient levels of illumination. Now if we consider that the pistol, let us call it \"Object A\", was indeed shrouded in darkness it becomes difficult to say with certainty that Object A was indeed Object A. Trucy: I think he means he couldn't see it that clearly. Apollo: (My badge for a normal witness...) Stickler: Yet the fact that a pistol was fired before my eyes is indisputable. I can still see it when I close my eyes. The defendant raised his weapon...Stickler: A shot! The bullet hit the man pulling the stand from the front, square in the forehead!Press Apollo: Apollo: Are you absolutely certain only one shot was fired? Stickler: Yes. Of course it was one shot. Why do you ask? Apollo: (Ah ha! A contradiction! Finally!) Mr. Stickler. According to the Court Record, the pistol was fired twice. A clear contradiction! Klavier: Klavier: ...Good eyes, Herr Justice. You're cool. Real cool. Apollo: Eh? Y-You really think so? Klavier: Yet, there is no reason why this other shot had to have been fired that night. Judge: Meaning...? Klavier: This pistol came from the Kitaki Family mansion, ja? I think it's not unreasonable to assume the pistol had been fired once before that night. During, perhaps... another altercation? Apollo: (Ugh... He's got a point.) Trucy: Judging from his smug expression... ...I'd say Prosecutor Gavin had that answer ready before you even spotted the problem.Present Meraktis's Autopsy Report Apollo: Leads to: \"Whew... If that's all of it, I think I have a chance.\"Apollo: (He seems pretty confident in his testimony.)Trucy: We always make the biggest mistakes when we're our most confident! He's got a weak point somewhere, Apollo! Find it!Apollo: (...Right!

It was pointed at the man pulling the stand.\" This establishes that the man (the victim, Dr. Meraktis) was being aimed at from the front. However, Evidence 11, Meraktis's Autopsy Report, says the cause of death was a \"Single bullet to the right temple.\" If the shot was fired from the front, it would be unlikely to hit the side (right temple) without some unusual positioning or circumstances, contradicting the witness's claim about how Dr. Meraktis was shot.\n",

Spinning big crimes and little crimes together. And when the Wheel stops... You die. June 15, 9:12 AMWright & Co. Law Offices Examine evidence Attorney's Badge Back side Apollo: There's a number inscribed on the back of the badge. There are many numbers like it, but this one is mine. Proof that I'm an attorney. To tell the truth, I get a happy feeling inside just looking at it. Apollo: (Two months have passed since Mr. Gavin's arrest. My first trial, and I lost both my mentor and my job. Yeah, I'll admit it. I was screwed. But even when I hit bottom, I told myself I'd never come here. Honest. Here being the legendary Wright & Co. Law Offices. OK, Justice, time to stop trembling.) ???: Ah! You must be here for the interview. Right this way. Apollo: Huh? ???: Hello there! You've found the Wright place! Welcome! Apollo: Uh... Ah... (What's with this girl!?) ???: Well now, shall we begin? Apollo: Begin... what? ???: Right, first things first... Any special talents? Apollo: Erm, talents? ???: Yes, well, you must have at least one! Apollo: Well... Uh... I guess... Defending? ???: \"Defending\"... An unusual talent, but it'll do. With a little jazzing up, of course. Apollo: Y-You think so...? ???: Let's give it a go, shall we? Apollo: Huh? ???: Go ahead! Show me! Defend! Just give it all you've got. Don't hold back now! Apollo: Wh-What are you talking about? I can't just \"defend\" here! ???: First lesson: A professional can perform anywhere! Apollo: ...Thanks. ???: We want people to be laughing with us... ...not at us! Apollo: ...Thanks. But I'm not sure why they should be laughing at all. ???: What...? What exactly do you think you came here to do? Apollo: What? Um, defend... No? ???: ... Excuse me, but do you know where you are? Apollo: Huh!? The Wright & Co. Law Offices, right? ???: ...Oh. I was afraid of that. Don't worry, you're not the first. Apollo: Look, what's going on here? Who are you? I came here to meet with the person in charge... ???: Well, you've apparently made no fewer than two mistakes. Apollo: Mistakes? But I got a call from Mr. Wright this morning! ???: Perhaps you should go read the sign out front again? Apollo: What's there to read!? Look, it says right there... ...Oh. Why does it say \"Wright Talent Agency\"...? ???: Welcome to the Wright Talent Agency, where you've \"always come to the Wright place!\" Trucy: I'm Trucy Wright, CEO. I'm a magician. Apollo: (It all came flooding back... The trial... That girl...) ???: Hello, sir. Please, pick a card. Phoenix: That's right. She's my daughter. Apollo: Trucy... Wright. Trucy: Here, check out our flyer! So... what's your name? Apollo: Apollo... Apollo Justice, attorney at law. Examine Bookshelf Apollo: All these legal books must be Mr. Wright's leftovers... ...There's a lot of unrelated books in here, too. \"One Trick a Day\"... \"Magic for Idiots\"... You'd think a pro magician would aim a bit higher. Charley the plant Trucy: Ack! Don't touch Mr. Charley! Apollo: \"Mister\" Charley...? Trucy: He's been in this office much longer than I have! Daddy's mentor had a great fondness for Mr. Charley. He's lived here since Daddy was a rookie attorney! Apollo: Huh.  (Mr. Charley... riiight.) Trucy: Now I take care of him! Hula hoop Apollo: That's one of those hula hoop things everyone was crazy about way back when. Trucy: Really? I had no idea these were that popular! Apollo: I'm not so bad with one myself, actually. Trucy: Eh!? I-I'm still learning... So you can really make someone levitate with it? Show me! Apollo: Huh!? I-I have no idea how! (It's just a normal hula hoop, isn't it?) Magic split box Apollo: A strange, split box leers at me from the wall. Um, is this one of those boxes for cutting people in half? Trucy: That's right! This cabinet is used for an illusion called the \"Zig-Zag\"! Apollo: I've seen one on TV... But why is one just sitting here in your office? Trucy: Oh, it's a little big for me, you see. So I'm using it as furniture. Hats in the top, shirts in the middle, and pants down below! I think it's a nice touch... don't you? Apollo: (It's not exactly what I'd call a \"welcoming\" decor.) Photograph Apollo: An old, sepia-tinted photo of a man in a silk top hat. Trucy: That's my favorite magician! I want to be just like him someday! Apollo: (Sure, nice... Guess it's good to have a role model. Even if he's gotta be well over 100.) Trucy: How rude! Piano Apollo: There are all sorts of strange paraphernalia sitting on top of the piano. Trucy: Those are my magic props! Practice, practice, practice! A professional never leaves their weapons far from reach! Apollo: But you can't play the piano with all this junk on it. Trucy: Oh, no one plays here anyway. And the neighbors complain. Apollo: (I guess Mr. Wright really can't play...) Silk hat Apollo: A blue silk hat, just like the one Trucy is wearing. Trucy: Oh, that's just for show. Don't wear it, please! Apollo: (Last thought from my mind, honest.) Trucy: I put it there so clients can see it and know who I am. Nothing says \"magician\" like a silk top hat! Spaghetti Apollo: Whoa! That fork is floating! ...Not. Why do you have a plate of plastic spaghetti here? Trucy: That right there is the whole reason I became a magician! Apollo: Do tell. Trucy: I saw a plate just like that in a restaurant once. The floating fork looked so real! That's when I knew... Someday, I'd make magic more amazing than that spaghetti! Table Apollo: That table... doesn't look very sturdy. Trucy: You've never seen one of these? It's a magic table! Apollo: So, like, you make this teapot disappear? Trucy: So you might think! But that's not it... Before your very eyes, the contents of the pot change! ...From Earl Grey to Darjeeling! Apollo: Kinda hard to see the difference, I'd think... Move Apollo: (What's up with this \"Wright Talent Agency\"? Guess I'll talk to her and find out what I can.) Talk Wright Talent Agency Apollo: So... Is this really a talent agency? Trucy: You bet! Daddy started it seven years ago, when he quit law. Of course, we only have two people signed up right now. Apollo: Two people... Does that include you? Trucy: Trucy Wright, Magician Extraordinaire! I've done a lot of stage shows! Paid, too! I am a professional, you know. Apollo: Er... right. Trucy: Promise you'll come to one of my shows, OK? Let's see... Oh, and the other person our agency represents is... Phoenix Wright, Pianist Extra Ordinaire! Apollo: Your dad, in other words. Didn't he say he couldn't play the piano? Trucy: Our agency doesn't see that as a problem. Why, there are many magicians who can't do magic! Apollo: At least you're optimistic, I'll give you that. Trucy Wright Apollo: So you're his, er... you're Phoenix Wright's daughter? Trucy: That's right! After Daddy quit law seven years ago... ...I promised I would keep him fed! So I'm kind of his sugar daddy! Get it? Apollo: No. Trucy: I'm in charge of this whole office, too. Pretty amazing for a young lass of fifteen, wouldn't you agree!? Apollo: F-Fifteen? Uh, how old is Mr. Wright? Trucy: Daddy? Oh... he's 33 this year. Apollo: ...I'm sure there's a good explanation. (I hope...) Trucy: ? Phoenix Wright Apollo: Um, about Mr. Wright giving up law... It was because of that incident seven years ago, wasn't it...? Trucy: Eh? You know about that!? Apollo: Not the details. I remember the news, though. It was a big deal. Trucy: So I hear. I was too young to understand what was going on. I'll ask Daddy about it next time I get a chance. Apollo: Daddy, right... That reminds me. About Mr. Wright... He gave me a call this morning to come in. Trucy: Daddy's not here right now. He's in the hospital. Apollo: The hospital!? Trucy: Yeah. He's on strict bed rest until he gets better. Apollo: Wh... What!? Present Attorney's Badge Trucy: Oh, I've seen one of those before! That's an attorney's badge. It looks just like the one Daddy used to have. Now if I take this badge... And do this, and this... See! It's gone! Apollo: H-Hey! My badge! What'd you do with my badge!? Trucy: No need to worry! Just look in your pocket! Apollo: Huh! No way... My pocket? (Wait a second... There's something in there!) ... It's a flyer for your agency! Trucy: And here's your badge. You can have it back now. Apollo: (That's the last time I let her touch anything of mine. Period.) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: OK... Which hospital is Mr. Wright in? I'll pay him a visit. Trucy: Oh, the Hickfield Clinic. It's quite close. Apollo: Right. Well, I'll be going now. And I'll, uh... give this showbiz gig some thought, OK? Trucy: Wait! I'll go with you! June 15, 9:45 AMHickfield Clinic Apollo: (So... this is Mr. Wright's hospital...) ???: Eh? Visitors are ya? Hrmm? Apollo: Uh, yeah. Are you the... doctor? Hickfield: Ayup. Dr. Hickfield's the name. Eh he he. Trucy: Good morning, Doctor! Hickfield: Oh, hiya there, Trucy. Cute as ever! Eh he he. Trucy: Is... this Daddy's room? Hickfield: Oh yah. 'Cept he's gone for a mornin' checkup. Be back soon. How're you, Miss Trucy? Got any places you'd like... examined? Eh heh... Phoenix: Doctor... the nurse was looking for you. Hickfield: Why, if it isn't the Daddy o' the cutest lil' thing in town! Hrm. Hrmm. Guess I'll be off then. Eh he? Later, Trucy. Apollo: Wow, what an odd bird that guy was. Phoenix: Good morning. Didn't expect you so soon, Apollo. Apollo: Mr. Wright... Examine Bottle Trucy: Aaaah! Daddy! You snuck some grape juice in again!? The doctor said you weren't supposed to drink that here! Phoenix: Trucy. Look at the label. Trucy: ... Oh. \"Deep Sea Mineral Water\". That's fine, I guess. Phoenix: I switched the labels. Don't tell Trucy, 'kay? Apollo: (What can I say, the man loves his grape juice.) DVD stack Apollo: A swaying, spiraling stack of DVD cases. \"The Steel Samurai\", \"The Nickel Samurai\"... \"The Pink Princess\", \"The Zappy Samurai: Electric Bugaboo\"... They're all children's action hero shows... Phoenix: This \"kid\" I know keeps sending them to me. Apollo: Huh. Like a niece or nephew? Phoenix: ...Something like that. Apollo: Quite the collection. This kid's parents must be really generous with their allowance. (Funny, Mr. Wright doesn't seem the type that kids would like.) Hospital bed Apollo: Mr. Wright's bed... It's really messy. Trucy: Look how messy this is! You're just hopeless without me, aren't you, Daddy? Apollo: (Yikes! She's attempting to clean up! Look out!) Phoenix: Ah ha ha. You got me. What can I say? I was raised in a barn. Try not to let word get out, Apollo. If you don't mind. Apollo: (Yeah, it might ruin your illustrious career pretending to play the piano.) Piano Apollo: This looks like a child's toy piano. Phoenix: Gotta practice. Wouldn't want my fingers to get stiff. A pro always keeps his weapon close at hand. Shall I play you a tune? Apollo: Uh... no thanks. Phoenix: Ah, how unfortunate. I so rarely get a chance to play. Television Apollo: What's that on TV? Looks like some sort of action hero show... Trucy: Oh, I know that one! That's the Sniffling Samurai! His \"Booger Flick\" attack is a big hit with the grade school crowd. Apollo: I had no idea you liked this kind of stuff, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Well, what else is there to do when you're stuck in bed? Besides, the episodes will just keep piling up if I don't keep up, you know? Apollo: Um... yeah. (Try not buying them.) Phoenix: Now's the only time I get to watch and write up my reports. Apollo: Your... reports? Phoenix: It's a long story. Like a lot of things, actually. Talk What happened? Apollo: So... what happened? Phoenix: ...Who could have imagined it? Me, victim of a hit and run... Apollo: A hit and... You were hit by a car!? Phoenix: Oh, he tried to swerve, I'll give him that. Picture me tossed thirty feet through the air... ...only stopping when my head hit that telephone pole. Apollo: You hit a telephone pole with your head!? Are you OK!? Phoenix: Thankfully, my only injury was a sprained ankle. Apollo: (He really is as lucky as they say...) About Trucy... Apollo: There's something that, well, it just doesn't sit right. I just can't believe you have a daughter, Mr. Wright! And... she's so big! Not fat, but, er, you know what I mean. Phoenix: Oh, Trucy's still a child. Trucy: Daddy! How many times do I have to remind you! I'm not a child anymore! Phoenix: Ah ha ha! But you'll always be Daddy's little baby girl to me, Trucy. Apollo: (Ah ha ha, my foot. I'm not buying it.) Phoenix: Oh, something you should know about Trucy... Apollo: She's a magician, right? She told me. Phoenix: Not a mere stage magician... She's a genius. Trucy: Tee hee! Aw, Daddy! Phoenix: You'll soon come to appreciate her \"talent\". Apollo: You could just tell me things instead of insinuating them. Wright Talent Agency Apollo: So, why did you contact me? What could the Wright Talent Agency possibly want with me? Phoenix: No need to get prickly, now. Apollo: Hey, I didn't ask to be dragged in like this! Trucy: Huh? But didn't you come into the office of your own free will anyway? Apollo: Well, yeah, of course. \"Help! We're in big trouble here at the office! Big!\" ...I thought someone was dying. Phoenix: So you don't think this is big trouble? My talent agency represents only two people... and one of them is in the hospital. Trucy: That's right, Daddy! How are we going to pay this month's rent!? And the groceries!? Phoenix: Yeah... That's the problem with such a tight operation. It's a symbiotic relationship. When one of us falls, the other, too, must fall... Apollo: Hey! This isn't exactly a suitable conversation to be having with a 15-year-old kid! Phoenix: In any case, if Apollo here can't help you... ...you'll have to transfer to a new school. Again. Trucy: No! I can't! I only just made friends... How could you do this to me... to us!? Polly! Apollo: Huh? What? Now it's my fault? Phoenix: On that note, how about you come work for us? I've got the perfect client for you already lined up. Apollo: A... A client? (You mean I get to do my job? I get to defend in court!?) ...Alright. I'll hear what you have to say. Trucy: You got him, Daddy! Hook, line, and sinker! Phoenix: Ah ha. Now it's time to reel him in! Apollo: (It's official: I'm scared.) Our client (appears after \"Wright Talent Agency\") Apollo: Alright, so who's the client? Phoenix: Ah, yes. Here, take a look at the map and I'll explain. Last night, I left the office just before nine o'clock... I was going to that Indochine pasta joint, Alden Tae's. I play piano there, of course. ...That's when it happened! The car sent me flying, nicked a telephone pole... ...and zoomed away. Creepy, huh? Apollo: Just a tad. It's almost as creepy as hearing you tell the story like it was no big deal. Phoenix: The car sped off in this direction... ...So, good luck! Apollo: ...Huh? Phoenix: You wanted a client, didn't you? Well, I'm your client! Find the guy who knocked me into that telephone pole! Apollo: Whoa, hold on! I'm a defense attorney, not a detective! Phoenix: Don't worry. Once you've found the guy, I intend to sue him. Then you can stick it to him in court! Apollo: ...I'm not a prosecutor either! I'm sorry, but... this is crazy. I'm going home. Phoenix: Don't get so worked up. It was just a joke. Apollo: Huh? Trucy: Oh, Daddy. Sorry, Apollo. He just loves jokes, you know. Even the ones that aren't very funny. Phoenix: Your real client should be stopping by the office any time now. Apollo: The office... You mean the talent agency? (No harm in going. It's not like I have anything else to do.) Phoenix: ...One more thing. Do look into my accident too, would you? I marked the scene of the tragedy on this map. It's right in front of this park. Should be easy to find. Apollo: (So, he's going to make me investigate this after all...) Map added to the Court Record. Our client (subsequent times) Apollo: Alright, so who's the client? Phoenix: Ah, yes. Here, take a look at the map and I'll explain. Last night, I left the office just before nine o'clock... I was going to that Indochine pasta joint, Alden Tae's. I play piano there, of course. ...That's when it happened! The car sent me flying, nicked a telephone pole... ...and zoomed away. Creepy, huh? Apollo: Just a tad. It's almost as creepy as hearing you tell the story like it was no big deal. Phoenix: The car sped off in this direction... ...So, good luck! Apollo: ...Huh? Phoenix: You wanted a client, didn't you? Well, I'm your client! Find the guy who knocked me into that telephone pole! Apollo: Whoa, hold on! I'm a defense attorney, not a detective! Phoenix: Don't worry. Once you've found the guy, I intend to sue him. Then you can stick it to him in court! Apollo: ...I'm not a prosecutor either! I'm sorry, but... this is crazy. I'm going home. Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: What's that? Looks strangely familiar... Apollo: How could you not recognize an attorney's badge!? Phoenix: It's been seven years. I've forgotten... a lot of things. Apollo: (I guess some seven years are longer than others.) Map Phoenix: I've marked the location of the accident on your map. Find the criminal who knocked me into that telephone pole! After clearing \"Our client\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic: June 15, 10:05 AMWright Talent Agency ???: Hey hey hey! How long you planning on making me wait, eh!? Trucy: Ah! Good morning! ???: Hey there, Trucy-doll. Sounds like your pops had a bit of a rough spot, eh? Trucy: All's well that ends well, I guess... Apollo: (This... is our client?) ???: Hey! So this is that Pollo fellow, eh? Apollo: Oh, uh, y-yes? (The name's \"Apollo\".) ???: Look at 'im there, arms all crossed-like. Ready to fight! Apollo: Yes, sir! ...You don't mean that literally, do you? ???: The boss told you what I need, right? Don't let me down now, Pollo! Apollo: Don't worry about your defense sir, I'm on it! ???: Defense...? Your noodle half-cooked? It's too late for defense! My castle's been stormed! My keep's been kept! My noodle stand's been stolen! Apollo: N-Noodle...? Trucy: You know Mr. Eldoon from the noodle stand, don'cha, Polly? Apollo: No nicknames, please. And no, of course I don't know him! ???: You new in these parts? Apollo: Not really... ???: Then you know the best noodles in town: Eldoon's Noodles! Apollo: Uh, whose noodles? ???: My noodles! Er, help me out here, Trucy-doll. Trucy: This is Mr. Guy Eldoon... our client! Maybe you can tell us what the problem is, Mr. Eldoon? Guy: Anything for you, Trucy-doll! Talk Who's this guy? Apollo: So... You run a noodle stand, Mr.... Guy: Eldoon. Guy Eldoon's the name! And noodles are my game. The secret's in the soup! I've been searching for the perfect soup for a year 'n' a half. Apollo: Oh. That's... not that long, really. Guy: My family's been noodle men for generations. Got a lot of expectation on my shoulders. Fifteen fathers passing the noodle to fifteen sons. Trucy: That's a pretty old noodle! Guy: Aye, and fool that I was, I pushed it away. I rebelled against my pops, and picked another livelihood. But... that didn't turn out so well. Apollo: Oh. Guy: There was no denying it... Salty broth runs through these veins, boy! Trucy: So, it was like destiny that you became what you are. Guy: Right, destiny's the word! Oh, I fought it... ...but in the end I was bound by the twisted noodle of fate! Apollo: (Not a mental image I care to linger on.) Guy: So, last year, I started my noodle stand. The 15th generation of Eldoon's Noodles! Eldoon's Noodles Apollo: Um... So tell me more about Eldoon's Noodles. Guy: You don't know the genius that are my noodles!? I make 'em so salty, why, they're saltier than... salt! Apollo: (Now I really don't want to find out.) Trucy: Daddy's a regular at his noodle stand. Guy: He frequented my pops's stand back during his attorney days, too. Yep, him and his assistant. Apollo: I'm sorry... I'll be sure to drop by your stand soon. Guy: Wish you could, sonny! Apollo: Eh? Guy: Heck, I wish I could! I'd give anything for a bowl 'bout now. Trucy: What do you mean? Guy: It was stolen! My stand! Gone! Apollo: Stolen...? Stolen stand (appears after \"Eldoon's Noodles\") Guy: It was last night... I was doing my rounds, blowin' my whistle. Trucy: It's like an ice-cream truck's bell but louder! He even gets complaints! Guy: Eh heh, now you're just trying to butter me up. Apollo: (That sounded more like the blues than a whistle...) Guy: I closed up my stand for the night and parked by the house. Then, this morning, dark 'n' early... It was gone! My keep! My castle! Oooooh! Apollo: Maybe some bum carted it off? ...Just guessing here. Guy: Well, I don't care who did it! Without that stand, I'm finished! All my noodle bowls were in there, too. Trucy: That's the saddest thing I've heard all day. Guy: You know it. Anyhows, that's the deal. Good luck! Apollo: Good... huh? Wait... What exactly is your request? Guy: My noodle stand! Find it! And the day you bring my baby back is the day you feast on as many noodles as you want! Course I make it so hot 'n' salty, two bowls'd kill a man. Then I'd really need defense! Apollo: Speaking of defense, that's what I do. I'm a lawyer. Not a detective... Guy: This is where I live, you drop by if you need any info, 'kay? Get it back today if you can, Pollo! I got noodles to make! Apollo: Things have certainly taken a turn for the bizarre. Traffic accidents... and noodle stand thieves. Trucy: Um, actually... There was something I wanted to ask you about, too, Apollo. Apollo: Huh? (I have a bad feeling about this.) Guy: Ah, listen to the lady's problem now. Don't be cruel! Trucy: I lost something last night. That is, something was stolen. Guy: Hey, what's this? More thieving and skullduggery!? Trucy: Well, um... Someone stole a pair of my panties. Apollo: ...Panties? Stolen stand (subsequent times) Guy: It was last night... I was doing my rounds, blowin' my whistle. Trucy: It's like an ice-cream truck's bell but louder! He even gets complaints! Guy: Eh heh, now you're just trying to butter me up. Apollo: (That sounded more like the blues than a whistle...) Guy: I closed up my stand for the night and parked by the house. Then, this morning, dark 'n' early... It was gone! My keep! My castle! Oooooh! Apollo: Maybe some bum carted it off? ...Just guessing here. Guy: Well, I don't care who did it! Without that stand, I'm finished! All my noodle bowls were in there, too. Trucy's request (appears after \"Stolen stand\") Leads to: \"Erm, so they were, um, stolen, your, er...\" Present Attorney's Badge Guy: Yee haw! Attaboy! Way to flash 'em! Ol' Phoenix used to do that to my pops all the time. Trucy: Your father...? Guy: Yup, he'd whip that bad boy out 'n' say \"Put it on my tab, you know I'm good for it.\" Apollo: (A tab at a noodle joint?) Anything else Guy: Sorry, fellah, but the only business I'm concerned with is my business. You gotta help me out! Get my business back! Apollo: Erm, so they were, um, stolen, your, er... Trucy: My panties, yes. Apollo: Ah, er, right. Panties. Guy: That's a cryin' shame, that is, Trucy-doll. Trucy: I was alone in the office last night. I had hung my panties out the window there to dry... ...when a thief came and took them! My favorite panties! I ran after him. \"Give those back!\" I shouted. \"Wait!\" Apollo: Well, that was certainly brave of you. Trucy: ...But I lost him. Without those panties, I don't know what I'll do... Guy: A darn cryin' shame, yup. Trucy: Well, at least the scene of the crime is convenient. I'll mark it on your map! Guy: I'll be headin' home now. Remember, find my stand or there's an empty bowl in yer future, Pollo! Apollo: Er, right. Guy: And you help out Trucy-doll here, too, y'hear? Trucy: Things have certainly picked up, haven't they! We had no work yesterday, and now we have three cases! Apollo: I... I guess. Trucy: Let's see where we stand! Apollo: (Not in a courtroom, that's where.) Well, the first item on our list... Trucy: Phoenix Wright... Daddy's hit and run accident. We have to find the one who hit him! Apollo: ...Who's going to pay us for this again? Trucy: And the second item... Mr. Eldoon's request.. to find his stolen stand. Apollo: For which we stand to gain... a bowl of salty noodles... Trucy: And the last request is mine! To find my stolen panties! Apollo: ...That bowl of noodles is looking better and better. Trucy: Let's go, Polly! To the streets! Apollo: Aren't you enthusiastic. Trucy: How could I not be!? Let's crack these cases, you and me! Apollo: (*sigh* Guess we might as well get started... Let's see. A hit and run... a stolen stand... And last but not least... stolen panties.) After clearing \"Our client\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic, then visiting Wright Talent Agency: June 15Hickfield Clinic Apollo: Huh? Mr. Wright's gone. Trucy: Maybe he's gone for an examination? Apollo: He'll probably be back soon. Let's wait. Trucy: I think it might take some time. Daddy always loves his examinations! Apollo: (Don't ask, Justice. You don't want to know.) Trucy: Why don't we come back later? Apollo: Yeah, I guess you're right. Examine Bottle Apollo: A bottle of Mr. Wright's favorite brand of grape juice. After that trial, I'll never drink grape juice again. Clearly not a problem for Mr. Wright, however. DVD stack Apollo: A swaying, spiraling stack of DVD cases. It looks ready to collapse. Better keep my distance. Hospital bed Apollo: Mr. Wright's bed. Wow, what a mess. Trucy must be in charge of cleaning at home. Piano Apollo: A small, children's piano. I guess the man likes pink. Television Apollo: The television's been left on... to an episode of the Steel Samurai. That's the same episode as before. Must be his favorite. Wright Talent Agency Talk Panty-snatcher Apollo: (Maybe I should ask her more about her... uh... This is going to be difficult--) Trucy: Apollo! Apollo: Yeah? Trucy: Your [sic] going to have to press me for information! Go ahead, do your worst! Apollo: Uh, no thanks, I pass. Trucy: You can't \"pass\"! This is your job! Look, I had hung them outside the window there to dry... ...when a thief came and took them! My favorite panties! I ran after him. \"Give those back!\" I shouted. \"Wait!\" ...But I lost him. I can't live without those panties! Please find them! Any leads? Apollo: Well? Do we have any leads? Trucy: Hmm... One moment... ... Allakazam! Allakazing! Apollo: (Whoa! Where'd all this evidence come from?) Trucy: ... Apollo: Um... So what happens next? Trucy: That's it! Pretty neat, huh? Apollo: ...Yeah. Neat. (*sigh*) Present Anything Trucy: What's that, Polly? Oh, I know! You want to see a magic trick! Well, you've come to the right girl! Watch as I make that evidence disappear, forever! Apollo: Whoa! No, don't! Sorry, my bad! June 15Accident Scene Apollo: So this is where Mr. Wright got hit by that car? Trucy: According to the map, this is the place! Apollo: What a huge mansion... (Changed from [What a huge mansion... Feels like Chinatown.] in the original release) Trucy: Apollo! There's a nice-looking lady over there. Let's question her! Apollo: Um, OK. (I'm a little curious about the park over there, too...) Trucy: Excuse me! Um, can we have a few words with you? ???: You want something? Apollo: (Whoa! That husky voice... Why am I suddenly sweating?) Trucy: That's quite a house you've got there! You must have a lot of money... ???: Whoooh. \"Money\" sounds like something my son would call his friends. This is the Kitaki Family mansion, little girl. Apollo: Eh. ???: You, kid with the hair. You want something? Apollo: Urk! M-M-Me? No, not a thing! Bye! Trucy: Apollo! We can't leave without questioning her! What if she knows something! Apollo: B-But th-the Kitaki Family...! (They're the biggest organized crime syndicate in town!) ???: If you're going to ask something, ask it. If you're man enough. Apollo: Waaaaugh! R-Right! Trucy: Yay! Way to whip him into shape, ma'am! Apollo: (Does she know no fear!?) Plum: I'm Plum. Plum Kitaki. Wife of the fourth head of the Kitaki Family business. Friends call me Little Plum. Apollo: I-I'm l-little Apollo Justice, attorney at law. *gulp* (If looks could kill, this woman would be a mass-murderer by now...) Examine Mansion front gate Trucy: Wow, what a big house! And the gate is so big... Apollo: The Kitaki Family is pretty big around these parts. Trucy: I like the fox! It's so cute! Plum: Ah, that. That's our family crest... from the old country. Trucy: Your family \"crest\"? Plum: We're clever as the fox... and our teeth are sharp. Trucy: So it's like a motto! You need a crest, too, Apollo! Ooh! How about the scales of justice? Or a lunar lander! Apollo: (...I'll pass, thanks.) Mansion gate wall Apollo: A brightly painted dragon. Why do I get the feeling he's glaring at me? Those paints must have been to repaint this wall. Plum: That's right. I called in an artist to do the job right. ...He's the third so far. Apollo: The... third? Plum: The first spilled paint all over the entrance here, the second on my kimono... So I... Apollo: N-No, don't tell me. It's better that I don't know. Spilled paint Apollo: There's paint splashed all over this gate. (What a mess...) Trucy: Was this paint knocked over by the car that hit my Daddy? Plum: That's right. Feh. And I'm left to clean up the mess. If you find whoever did this, bring the scoundrel by, would you? Trucy: Of course! Then you can make them clean up their own mess! Plum: Ah ha ha ha! You're cute. Naïve, but cute. When I find whoever did this, you can bet I'll be doing some \"cleaning\". There's nothing I dislike so much... as a mess. Trucy: Ooh! I wish I could say cool things like that! Plum: I'll bet you do! Wa ha ha ha ha!!! Apollo: (I'd laugh if my teeth weren't chattering so hard.) Talk The Kitakis Trucy: Little Plum? That's a really cute name for someone so... Plum: Yes...? Apollo: Wh-Whoa! Trucy: What is it, Apollo? Apollo: How about you go through me when talking to her, OK, Trucy? Trucy: Huh? That seems like a bit of a needless procedure. Apollo: I'm a lawyer. I live for needless procedures. Plum: Oh little girl, you should know... We're gangsters. Trucy: Gangst... Oh! That means you're the bad guys! Apollo: Trucy! Through me! Please! I'm begging you here! Plum: Wa ha ha ha ha!!! The bad guys... I like the sound of that! Apollo: (...I'm going to need some warm tea after this.) Plum: It takes a lot of hard work to protect a family fortune. Things aren't as easy as they used to be for us \"bad guys\". Trucy: So, you're saying that business is in a slump? Apollo: (Let's not ask about \"business if we can help it, please?) Last night's accident Apollo: So, there was supposedly a car accident here last night. (Changed from [There was a car accident here last night?] in the original release) Plum: Last night... Apollo: Of c-course you wouldn't know about it! S-Sorry to bother you! Plum: Wait. Apollo: Y-Yes? Plum: You're talking about that man, aren't you? The one who flew thirty feet and just walked away? Trucy: That's my daddy! Plum: Ah ha ha! I should've known! One of our Capos thought he'd make a great point man... Trucy: Capo? Point man...? Apollo: Um, could you avoid using too much, er, industry lingo? Plum: In any case, it's been nothing but trouble. I've been cleaning up this mess since morning! Bah! Apollo: Cleaning up this... paint? Splattered paint (appears after \"Last night's accident\") Apollo: Was this paint spilled at the time of the accident? Plum: It was around 9 last night. I heard a crashing noise... ...and found your father drowning in a sea of paint. Trucy: So you came to his rescue? Plum: You've my husband... the Boss to thank for that. The car that hit your father knocked over this paint... ...then turned the corner, and sped away. We're in the middle of repainting our wall, you see. Apollo: (I'm sure that dragon is glaring at me.) Trucy: But, why are you out here cleaning it up? Plum: What do you mean? Trucy: I mean, aren't you a gangster? Don't you have any \"goons\" to do your dirty work for you? Apollo: Please! Go through me when you want to... Plum: Wa ha ha ha ha!!! Don't be such a stiff, lawyer-boy. I suppose we gangsters do have a certain image... Apollo: Urm, yes. Plum: But we're community-oriented gangsters, you see. ...The Boss likes to give back to the people, see? Apollo: (How noble of him...) Plum: I availed myself of the public facilities to get rid of all the garbage... Now there's just the paint on the street to deal with. Apollo: (Public facilities...? I wonder if she means that trash can...) Present Anything Plum: Sorry, kid. I got no idea what you're talking about. After switching to right side view: Apollo: Who's that!? She's looking at the park. Trucy: She's pretty. I bet she has a story, you know? Apollo: (There is something about her... Too bad she seems to be in a bit of a rush.) Examine Old lady Apollo: ...Looks like there's some trouble by the park gate. Trucy: I smell an incident! Officer: Ma'am! There's no entry to the park! Old Lady: Now don't you tell me where I can't go, young fella! I always walk through this park on my way home! Officer: Please, get down from there! You'll hurt yourself, ma'am! Apollo: (That's quite the determined old lady.) People Park sign Apollo: People Park... Huh, kind of an odd name for such an empty place. Trucy: I wonder why it's named that? Hey! There's something written on the gate post... Apollo: Huh? Oh yeah... It says, \"Donated by Big Wins Kitaki\". Trucy: You mean the Kitaki Family built this park? It's so nice of them to give to the community like that! Apollo: ...Let's not get too friendly with them, shall we? (A gangster building a park...? Odd move for a crime boss.) Police officer below People Park sign Apollo: Personally, I'm a little more interested in this park. Trucy: You know what I think? I bet they're filming a movie. Let's go take a look! Maybe we'll see someone famous! Officer: Hey, Miss! Stay out of the park! Trucy: ...He got mad at me. Apollo: Um, did something happen here, officer? Officer: Huh? Uh, no, move along, nothing to see. Why don't you kids go play someplace else? Apollo: We're not kids and we're not playing! I'm an attorney! ???: ...Something wrong? Officer: Ah, Detective Skye! We're fine ma'am, nothing to report! Apollo: (Detective...?) Trucy: Why's she wearing a lab coat? Apollo: You're hardly one to comment on how people are dressed. ???: And... these kids are? Officer: Curiosity seekers, ma'am. They claim to be \"lawyers\". ???: Ah. Why don't you kids run along and play someplace else? Apollo: Look, we're not... ???: Or I might spill something on that pretty face of yours. Want a dose of experimental Hydroxyacelunodosetrase? Trucy: ...Come again? What's Hydroxy... stuff? Apollo: Whatever it is, it doesn't sound good. Let's go, Trucy! ???: Try to keep out the riff-raff, if you would. Officer: Yes ma'am! Apollo: Grr... How are we going to get more information like this? Trucy: Why don't we ask that nice woman across the street? Apollo: (Oh yes, that nice woman... *gulp*) Police officer below People Park sign (subsequent times) Apollo: I gotta say, I'd really like to know what happened here... Officer: Hey, I said no one goes in! Unless you want a face-full of hydroxyadayadawhatzit! Apollo: (Hmm... No dice.) Trash can Apollo: There's a big trash can on the way into the park. I guess we could check it out... Trucy: A detective's life sure is a hard one! Apollo: I'm an attorney, actua... Huh? Trucy: Hmm. Two pieces of garbage with paint on them. Apollo: These... are slippers. They look like those slippers you get at the hospital... Trucy: Look at this, Apollo! Doesn't this go on a car...? Apollo: It's a side-view mirror! Looks like it was torn off when it smacked into something... or someone. Trucy: Wait, you don't think... Apollo: I do. This could be from the car that hit Mr. Wright! Trucy: Wow, and he took off its mirror? I never knew Daddy was so strong. I only have room in my pocket for one of these, though. Which do you want to take? Slippers Slippers crammed into pocket. Leads back to examination Mirror Mirror slipped into pocket. Leads back to examination Trash can (subsequent times, if Slippers is added to the Court Record) Apollo: There's a side-view mirror with some paint on it in this trash can. Trucy: I can only carry one thing at a time in my pocket, you know. Apollo: (Should I swap the slippers for the mirror?) Swap Apollo: Sure, let's swap the evidence. Trucy, if you would. Trucy: I'm on it! Mirror slipped into pocket. Leads back to examination No need Apollo: ...On second thought, let's not and say we did. Leads back to examination Trash can (subsequent times, if Mirror is added to the Court Record) Apollo: There's some paint on the slippers in this trash can. Trucy: I can only carry one thing at a time in my pocket, you know. Apollo: (Should I swap the mirror for the slippers?) Swap Apollo: Sure, let's swap the evidence. Trucy, if you would. Trucy: Right-o! Slippers crammed into pocket. Leads back to examination No need Apollo: Actually... let's not and say we did. Leads back to examination Talk People Park (appears after examining police officer below People Park sign) Apollo: ...Can I ask you a question? Plum: What? Apollo: ...What happened in the park across the street? Plum: Oh, yes, quite the commotion. \"Chicago Lightning\", as the Boss would say. Trucy: Chicago... huh? Plum: Gunfire. Someone was killed. Strange circumstances, too. Apollo: You're kidding! Plum: What a morning! Trouble everywhere. The park, the gate, even our house... Trucy: Did something happen at your house, too? Plum: A crime without honor! Without remorse! It's a private matter... Wanna hear about it? Trucy: Somehow I don't think \"no\" is an acceptable answer, Polly. A private matter (appears after \"People Park\") Apollo: So... what happened at your house? Plum: Bloomers. Last night. Apollo: Eh. (I got a bad feeling about this...) Plum: Me, Little Plum Kitaki, the victim of a panty-snatcher! Trucy: Whaaaaaaat? So it wasn't just my panties that were stolen!? Plum: Got you too, did they? Poor thing. Like I said, whoever did this is a hardened criminal. It wasn't you, was it!? Apollo: N-No! Of course not! Mercy! Plum: I've heard word that panties have been disappearing lately. ...And the missing panties all have something in common. Apollo: (It's hard to imagine Trucy's and Mrs. Kitaki's panties having much in common... I just imagined Mrs. Kitaki's panties... *gulp*) Trucy: I know! We'll find your bloomers, too! Plum: Great! Show me what you're made of. Apollo: (What have you gotten me into this time, Trucy?) Present Mirror Apollo: Can you tell me anything about this mirror? Plum: That's probably from the car that knocked that fellow across the street. Apollo: (Right! That makes this a valuable clue!) Plum: Let me know if you find that car, would you? You splash Kitaki paint, you pay the price. Examine evidence Slippers Toeprint Apollo: Huh? This spot here is black. Trucy: I wonder what that is...? It doesn't look like paint... Leaf indentation on paint on left sole Trucy: The bottom is covered with paint! Apollo: Huh? What's this weird shape here? Trucy: It looks like a leaf was stuck to the bottom when the wearer stepped in some yellow paint. Apollo: So the outline was left when the leaf was removed! Ack! I got paint on my hand! Trucy: ...... Apollo! I saw you try to wipe your hand on my cape! Mirror Severed wires Trucy: It's cut clean off! I wonder what's in there...? Apollo: Don't. There are bare wires hanging out. Trucy: Let's see... Zzzzzzaaaaap! Eeek! Apollo: Wha--!? A-Are you OK!? Trucy: Hee hee! Just a little joke! Apollo: ...... Don't scare me like that! Trucy: You mean, don't \"shock\" you? Zzzzzzaaaaap! Hee hee! After clearing all Talk options: ???: ... Apollo: (...That girl from before!) Plum: Oh! Welcome home, sweetie. ???: Ah, uh... hello, m-mother. Apollo: (She's a Kitaki, too!?) Trucy: Uh, um, Miss! Miss! ???: ...? Trucy: Here, our flyer. ???: The... Wright Anything Agency? Apollo: A-Anything Agency? Trucy: Yeah! Do you like the new flyer? So, um, this is our defense attorney, Mr. Apollo Justice! ???: Attorney...? Trucy: Drop by our office! We'll be waiting! ???: Ah... Good-bye. Apollo: Why did you give her our flyer? Trucy: I dunno. She seemed like she could use some help. Apollo: She's the heiress to a gangster dynasty! She doesn't need our help! Trucy: ...I wouldn't be so sure! Apollo: ...? June 15Scene of the Stand Theft Apollo: So... what's this place? Trucy: This would be Mr. Eldoon's house, silly. Apollo: Oh, so this is where his stand was stolen from. I can see a piece of evidence lying on the ground already. Trucy: ...Hey! Look, there's a police car parked over there. Apollo: You're right... What's with the sparkly... entrance? What is this place? A hospital? There's a sign... \"Meraktis Clinic\". Trucy: Hmm... Oh! That's where the thief went! Apollo: The thief...? Trucy: The one who snatched my panties! He ran into this clinic last night! Wait, maybe that police car is here to find my panties! Apollo: I doubt it. Trucy: Well, there's only one way to be sure! Let's investigate! Guy: Ah, there you are, sonny! Well, you find anything yet!? Apollo: Er, um, no. Not yet. Guy: The longer you loaf around here the saltier your victory bowl gets, just remember that! Apollo: (This bowl of noodles is sounding less like payment and more like punishment...) Examine Clinic front door Trucy: That doorway sure is sparkly! Apollo: The \"Meraktis Clinic\", huh. Looks more like a casino parlor than a hospital. They must be quite profitable. Trucy: Funny, it looks closed. Maybe they're on vacation today? Green banner Apollo: Looks like they have a special offer going on... Trucy: \"Three shots for the price of one!\" Ooh, now's our chance, Apollo! Apollo: Chance for what!? I don't need any shots, thank you. Whoever runs this clinic, they seem pretty business-minded. Police car Apollo: I'd understand if there was an ambulance outside... But a police car? Trucy: Maybe they're tax evaders! Officer: Ah, sorry miss. No going into the clinic today. Trucy: Did something happen? Officer: Huh? Oh, no. Nothing to see here. Move along. You'll have to find someplace else to play doctor. Apollo: (Do we look like the right age to be playing doctor!?) We need a little more info on this Meraktis Clinic. Trucy: We could ask Mr. Eldoon. He is their neighbor and all. And we should check out that garage! What if the thief who stole my panties is still in there!? Apollo: ...*sigh* Blue tarp Guy: That's the place! Right there! That's where I kept my stand. Covered all nice 'n' purty with that blue tarp there! Apollo: So you used this plastic sheet to cover your stand at night? ...I see. Trucy: You see? What? Did you figure out why it was stolen!? Apollo: Well no, but it does suggest that the thief knew what he or she was looking for. They clearly knew what was under that sheet. Guy: So it wasn't one of those casual drive-by stand snatchers, you mean? Not bad, sonny-boy. Not bad at all! Bowl Apollo: Is this yours, Mr. Eldoon? Guy: Hey! That there's the heart and soul of Eldoon's Noodles! The bowl absorbs my salty soup... Pretty soon it's gonna taste just like noodles! Trucy: Wow! It does smell like noodles! Guy: All my other bowls got taken away with my stand! Get it back for me, sonny-boy, I'm beggin' ya! Bowl added to the Court Record. Bowl (subsequent times) Apollo: Is this yours, Mr. Eldoon? Guy: Hey! That there's the heart and soul of Eldoon's Noodles! The bowl absorbs my salty soup... Pretty soon it's gonna taste just like noodles! Trucy: Wow! It does smell like noodles! Guy: All my other bowls got taken away with my stand! Get it back for me, sonny-boy, I'm beggin' ya! House Trucy: This house is... well, it's old! Guy: It's been well-loved, that's for sure. I've lived here with my wife for many years now. It's got character, though, just like my soup! Apollo: (I always thought character was a positive thing.) \"NOO\" sign Apollo: ...That's quite a sign. I take it that's \"NOO\" as opposed to \"OLD\"? Guy: Ah, you like it? Made it myself, I did. I meant to write \"Noodles\" but ran outta space. Trucy: Prior planning prevents poor performance! Guy: Lucky for me it spells a word all by itself! And spruces up my image, it does! Apollo: (It does have a certain power of willful denial thing going for it.) Oil drum Apollo: It looks like the oil drum is connected to that sink over there... Trucy: Collecting rainwater to do the dishes! How environmentally conscious! Apollo: You... don't think he uses rainwater to cook his noodles and to make the broth, do you? Trucy: Oh I'm sure he finds the best water money can buy! Taste is his business, you know. Look, that sign over there! \"Eldoon's only uses water from all-natural sources!\" Apollo: ... (I think I'll take a rain check on eating here.) Sign under oil drum Apollo: There's a hand-written sign here... \"Save the light!\" Trucy: \"Save the light!\" indeed! Mr. Eldoon's house is practically in the dark here! Apollo: I guess the hospital clinic next door blocks the sunlight. Guy: Everything's gone wrong since they built this monstrosity! Broth needs sun or it rots! What's a man to do? They just want my customers to get food poisoning so they can turn a pretty profit... Apollo: (That seems like a lot of trouble to go through for a few extra patients...) Dog Trucy: Look! A doggy! Good boy, good boy, Salty! Apollo: I'm sure the dog has a real name, Trucy. Guy: Yup, sure does! Name's Spoon. And it's a she, by the way. Trucy: Spoon doesn't seem so lively. Guy: She didn't get her bowl of salty broth this mornin', that's why. Poor lil' thing. *sniff* Trucy: Apollo! Let's find that stand soon! For Spoon's sake! Apollo: (I'm pretty sure dogs aren't supposed to eat noodles...) Talk Eldoon's Noodles Apollo: So, your stand... \"Eldoon's Noodles\", was it? Guy: Aye! Passed down from father to son. That stand's seen its share o' salt, mmm-hmm. Salt runs in the family, you might say. Apollo: (I bet high blood pressure does too.) So... your stand, Eldoon's Noodles, was stolen... Guy: Oh, it wasn't just the stand that was stolen, sonny-boy! I lost those wobbly wheels, my salt-crusted stewpot, my stained sign... I didn't just lose a stand, I lost a legend! Trucy: No one steals a legend and gets away with it on my watch! Let's find that legend, Apollo! Apollo: (Isn't it about time he bought a new one anyway?) Stolen stand Apollo: Are there any more details you could give me about the stand? Guy: You bet, sonny-boy! It happened last night... I was blowing my whistle like always, crying the town, I was. The smell of broth filled the streets... thick 'n' salty. I got home, well, right before 10 PM, I reckon. Apollo: (Guess he's not aiming for that late-night market.) Guy: I washed my bowls and gave the wheels a squirt of grease. Then I went inside. Apollo: When did you notice it had been stolen? Guy: Early this morning. Before the sun rose. Work starts early! Apollo: (Do that many people eat noodles for breakfast!?) Guy: I'm washed up on the salty shores of ruination! That stand had my whole life in it... nay, my whole being! Trucy: They took everything? Guy: All my soup stock, my noodles, my bowls... and my dreams! Trucy: At least they left one bowl. Look, there, on the ground. Guy: If you don't find that stand today... Then I'll be forced to walk the streets, peddling that bowl... my last bowl. Apollo: Please, I'm under enough pressure here as it is. The garage Trucy: That's it! That's where the thief who snatched my panties ran to! Guy: It's a crying shame, that is. If they have to steal, make it my loincloth! Not some pretty girl's panties! Apollo: The garage, right. You don't think the thief lives here, do you? Guy: Feh! I wouldn't put it past that good-for-nothing doctor! Apollo: (Hmm... Do I detect a little animosity here?) Trucy: Let's make sure to check out that garage thoroughly! Meraktis Clinic (appears after examining police car) Trucy: Hey, do you think something happened next door? There's a police car out front... Guy: Feh! Probably gave someone food poisoning, I'll bet! Apollo: (If anyone's at risk of giving someone food poisoning...) Guy: That police car got here this mornin', actually. I asked what they were up to, but they wouldn't even tell me, the neighbor! Feh! Trucy: Hmm... Guy: Not that I was surprised much. That doctor works for the wrong crowd. It was just a matter of time 'fore he got what was coming to him. Feh! Apollo: The \"wrong crowd\"...? Guy: ...Never you mind about that. Present Bowl Guy: You can tell my bowls by the Mr. Salty logo! Trucy: The mascot of Eldoon's Noodles! Guy: They come to the stand, they sit, they drink deep from that bowl... ...and when they see the  bottom, their face looks jus' like Mr. Salty's! Genius, no!? Trucy: Very high-concept. Guy: You can't ply a trade if you don't love the tools. Remember that! Trucy: Yes sir! Apollo: (Trucy has a thing for professionals, clearly.) Anything else Guy: Sorry, sonny-boy. My interest is for my stand and precious little else. Get cracking on that case! Find my stand, I'm beggin' ya! Examine evidence Bowl Inside of bowl Trucy: It's the Eldoon's Noodle's mascot! Mr. Salty! He's so cute! Apollo: It's not a very endearing mascot, is it? Trucy: You know... Come to think of it... ...It looks a lot like you, Apollo. Especially the red parts. Apollo: Can I help if I like red? Bottom of bowl Trucy: Ooh, look! I love these little personal touches! Apollo: Seems a shame to hide it on the bottom of the bowl. ...Huh? When I touched it the paint flaked off. Trucy: He must have painted it on by hand with warm, professional care! Apollo: After buying the cheapest paint he could find with cold professional thrift. June 15Meraktis ClinicGarage Trucy: This is the place! This is where that panty-snatcher ran! Apollo: Are you sure? Trucy: Maybe! Let's look for clues! Clues... to a panty-snatching! Clues... like a pair of panties! Apollo: ...Um, Trucy? Could you try not saying \"panties\" so many times? Examine Car Apollo: There's something about this car... Trucy: Let's take a closer look! Cell phone Apollo: Look... a cell phone. Trucy: Someone dropped it beneath this tire! If the car moved, it would be crushed for sure! Apollo: Hmm... I wonder if it belongs to the doctor here? Trucy: We should bring it to him later! Cell Phone added to the Court Record. Stub on driver's door Trucy: Hey! Look at that! Apollo: The mirror's been broken off! (Now THIS is a clue!) Trucy: What!? You're smiling like you know something I don't... You aren't keeping a clue from me, are you, Polly? Apollo: (A clue? Let's see...) Show evidence Apollo: I think I do have just the clue you've got in mind... Present Mirror Apollo: Apollo: My clue is... this! Trucy: Whoa! It's the same color and size and everything! A perfect match! Apollo: I guess we could check it out... Trucy: Hmm. Two pieces of garbage with paint on them. Look at this, Apollo! Doesn't this go on a car...? Apollo: It's a side-view mirror! Looks like it was torn off when it smacked into something... or someone. Apollo: Well... looks like we've just solved a case. Trucy: So the car that hit Daddy last night... Apollo: ...Is sitting right in front of us, yep. Trucy: Wow. You put the \"pro\" in \"professional\", Apollo! Apollo: Gee, thanks, Trucy. Leads back to examination Present anything else Apollo: Trucy: ... That's your clue? Sorry, but that leaves me feeling kind of... clueless. Apollo: (Like father like daughter with the humor, apparently.) Trucy: There's no need to bluff here, Apollo! Save that for the court! Apollo: (Thanks for the advice...) Leads back to examination No evidence Apollo: Hmm. Not that I can think of. Trucy: No? Then what were you smiling about? Apollo: Oh, I wasn't smiling. It was the dust in here. I thought I was going to sneeze... Ah... ah... ah... WAACHOOO! Trucy: Well, don't make faces that ah... AH-CHOO! ...are so misleading then. Apollo: (I know yawns are contagious, but sneezes...?) Trucy: Mmm. Well, I'm sure there's gotta be a clue somewhere! Let's keep checking things out! Leads back to examination Stub on driver's door (after correctly presenting Mirror) Apollo: This mirror fits this car door perfectly... Trucy: So the car that hit Daddy last night... Apollo: ...Is sitting right in front of us, yep. Trucy: Wow. You put the \"pro\" in \"professional\", Apollo! Tailpipe (before examining cell phone and stub on driver's door) Apollo: That reminds me... I once read a record of a case that Mr. Wright worked on many years ago. Trucy: ...? Apollo: Apparently, there was this car with a piece of cloth shoved into the tailpipe! That piece of cloth turned out to be a vital clue to solving the case! Trucy: Wow! Apollo: I remember that case record whenever I'm checking out a car... And I always check the tailpipe! Trucy: Everyone's gotta have a hobby, I guess. Apollo: Wouldn't it be funny if... ...Hey! There's something in there! Trucy: What!? Apollo: W-Wait a second... Are these your... Trucy: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! My panties!!! Apollo: Whaaaat!? Already!? Trucy: Wow, thank you, Apollo! You're a genius! Amazing! Apollo: No, no, really, don't mention it. Trucy: No, I'm serious, I'm really impressed! You must have a nose for finding girls' panties! Apollo: ... Um, what are those? Trucy: My little panties, of course! They've come home to mama! I can't wait to use them! Apollo: Y-You're going to put them on? N-Now!? Trucy: Watch closely now... See? Nothing in the panties... ...Ta-da!!! Apollo: Whoa! Wh-Where'd that come from!? How did that bowl get in your panties!? Trucy: My panties are an extra-dimensional space... Anything can fit in there! ...They're my Magic Panties! It's one of my best tricks. Apollo: Magic... panties? Trucy: They love them over at the Wonder Bar. I do shows there nightly. Apollo: ...You mean those panties are a prop!? You could have told me a little sooner! Trucy's Panties put discreetly away in Trucy's pocket. Apollo: Well, that's once case closed, at least. Trucy: What are you saying!? We still have to catch the sly devil that ran off with the tool of my trade! Apollo: Oh, right. (Something tells me we're not finished searching this garage, anyway...) Tailpipe (after examining cell phone and stub on driver's door) Apollo: That reminds me... I once read a record of a case that Mr. Wright worked on many years ago. Trucy: ...? Apollo: Apparently, there was this car with a piece of cloth shoved into the tailpipe! That piece of cloth turned out to be a vital clue to solving the case! Trucy: Wow! Apollo: I remember that case record whenever I'm checking out a car... And I always check the tailpipe! Trucy: Everyone's gotta have a hobby, I guess. Apollo: Wouldn't it be funny if... ...Hey! There's something in there! Trucy: What!? Apollo: W-Wait a second... Are these your... Trucy: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! My panties!!! Apollo: Whaaaat!? Already!? Trucy: Wow, thank you, Apollo! You're a genius! Amazing! Apollo: No, no, really, don't mention it. Trucy: No, I'm serious, I'm really impressed! You must have a nose for finding girls' panties! Apollo: ... Um, what are those?

Apollo: ...You mean those panties are a prop!? You could have told me a little sooner! Trucy's Panties put discreetly away in Trucy's pocket. Apollo: Well, that's once case closed, at least. Trucy: What are you saying!? We still have to catch the sly devil that ran off with the tool of my trade! Apollo: Oh, right. Tailpipe (subsequent times, before examining cell phone and stub on driver's door) Apollo: Still, I'm glad. If I hadn't picked up that habit of looking up tailpipes... ...I might never have seen your panties. I mean, found your panties. Magic panties. Trucy: I know, it was amazing how you slyly peeked up there! I think you have a successful career in peeking up tailpipes ahead of you! Apollo: (I'm so glad all of this makes sense in context.) Trucy: You gotta wonder why my panties were here, though. Apollo: That is a mystery... (Something tells me we're not finished searching this garage, anyway...) Tailpipe (subsequent times, after examining cell phone and stub on driver's door) Apollo: Still, I'm glad. If I hadn't picked up that habit of looking up tailpipes... ...I might never have seen your panties. I mean, found your panties. Magic panties.

Trucy: You gotta wonder why my panties were here, though. Apollo: That is a mystery... Cat Trucy: Hey! A kitty-cat! Here, kitty kitty kitty. Meow. Trucy: ...It's not coming down. Apollo: We do look kind of suspicious, you have to admit. Trucy: It's OK kitty-cat! His hair won't hurt you! Apollo: It's OK kitty-cat! She won't make you disappear in her hat! (Step)ladder Apollo: Look, it's a folding ladder. Trucy: Polly! That's called a \"stepladder\"! C'mon! Apollo: ...A stepladder? How is that different from a regular ladder then? Trucy: It's a much more complex piece of machinery. It's like two ladders stuck together! Apollo: ...So you admit that basically it's a ladder, right? Trucy: Wait... Huh? Apollo: You have to look past the form... at the essence of the thing. Trucy: Er... Can we talk about something else? Skeleton Trucy: Eeeeeeek! Someone's there! ... Oh, it's just a gold-painted human skeleton. Apollo: (Just a human skeleton!? ...And painted gold?) Trucy: There's a mannequin hand waving to us from the box behind the skeleton. This place just screams \"hospital storage\", don't you think? Apollo: It screams something, that's for sure. Examine evidence Cell Phone Strap Trucy: Look at this cute little watch-strap! I want one! Apollo: ...It's kind of odd, though. Trucy: What is? Apollo: I mean, if you wanted to know the time, you could just look at the phone itself. Trucy: Hey, you're right! Sharp, Apollo! Apollo: Th-Thanks. (Finally, some respect!) Trucy: So, what does that tell you? Apollo: Well, the owner of this phone doesn't think through the details, for one. Trucy: They did drop their phone, after all. I kinda figured they were a little spacey already. Apollo: Oh... good point. Trucy's Panties Ribbon Apollo: ...... Trucy: Something the matter? Apollo: Uh... I was just wondering if there was, like, a switch on these... Trucy: Of course not! Apollo: ...Huh. Mysterious. Trucy: Oh? Do you want to know the secret of my panties? Apollo: Ack! N-No! No thanks! (Who uses magic panties in a stage show anyway...?) After examining cell phone and tailpipe and correctly presenting Mirror upon examining stub on driver's door: Trucy: Apollo! Apollo: Huh? What is it? Trucy: Now that we've solved this case, we should go report to Daddy! He'll mope if we leave him alone too long, knowing him. Apollo: Um, OK. ...He doesn't seem the type to mope, though. (And this is hardly a case worth reporting...) Examine Car Apollo: This car belongs to someone at the Meraktis Clinic... and it hit Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright sprained his ankle, and the car lost a side-view mirror. This car vs. Mr. Wright... Not quite the match of the century. Wright Anything Agency Talk Panty-snatcher (after Trucy's Panties is added to the Court Record) Trucy: What, you want to see them again? Well, if you must... Apollo: No no no, I'm fine, really. Let's just put them away, shall we? Case closed. Trucy: What are you talking about!? The case isn't closed until we have our thief! Just find him on the side while you work on the other cases! Apollo: If it were that easy we wouldn't need the police. Trucy: If we don't need the police... then we don't need defense attorneys, either, right? Apollo: (Fine, fine. I'll look for your panty-snatcher...) Present Trucy's Panties Trucy: I'm so glad we found my panties! Apollo: I had no idea they were so important to you. Trucy: And in time for tonight's show, too! A lot of people come just to see my panties, you know! Apollo: You... might not want to advertise it like that. Trucy: ? Kitaki Mansion Examine Trash can (after Mirror is updated in the Court Record) Apollo: There's a big waste basket by the park entrance. Trucy: ...? You aren't going to search through the trash? Apollo: I don't think we need to. Trucy: Oh, no, please, knock yourself out. Don't mind me, I'll be waiting over here. Apollo: Just so we're clear, searching through trash isn't a hobby of mine, OK? Present Mirror (after Mirror is updated in the Court Record) Apollo: I found out who this mirror belongs to. Plum: Ooh. You're tougher than you look. Spit it out. Who was it? Where do they live? Apollo: Urk! I j-just forgot! Heh! Trucy: I remember, Apollo! It was the Meraktis Clinic! Apollo: Shhhh! Trucy: Why? I'm right, aren't I? Plum: ...Meraktis, eh? Apollo: Um, yes. (Why's she so quiet all of a sudden?) ... Is something wrong? Plum: Erm, no. Pay me no mind. And thanks for the info. After clearing all Talk options in Accident Scene, clearing all Talk options and examining bowl in Scene of the Stand Theft, and examining cell phone and tailpipe and correctly presenting Mirror upon examining stub on driver's door in Meraktis Clinic - Garage: June 15Hickfield Clinic Phoenix: Yo! How goes it? Trucy: Daddy! How do you feel? Phoenix: Not bad, Trucy, not bad. It's good to have you young'uns on the case. Lets ol' Daddy-o get some well-deserved R&R. Trucy: The elderly need their rest! Apollo: (Uh... isn't he only 33?) ...Um, we've cleared up most of the cases... Phoenix: I was right about you. Competent. Capable. Tell me what you found out. If you want to. Apollo: (Your enthusiasm is over-whelming...) Talk Progress report Phoenix: Well, I certainly didn't expect you back this early. Trucy: Polly's amazing! He found my panties so quick! Almost like he was the one who stole them! Apollo: ...You have an interesting concept of praise. Phoenix: ...And? Did you find the mad driver who gave me that 30-foot toss? Apollo: Apparently... it was a doctor. From the Meraktis Clinic. Phoenix: Hmm... Meraktis, eh? I've heard of him. Nothing good, mind you. Apollo: That reminds me, a police car was parked outside the clinic. Trucy: Maybe something happened? Apollo: What is this Meraktis Clinic anyway? Meraktis Clinic Phoenix: All I've heard are the rumors. That clinic's been making good money... in a bad way. Apollo: Bad...? Phoenix: Ties to organized crime... The Kentucky Family. Apollo: Um... the Kitaki Family? (He did that on purpose!) Phoenix: Some injuries you can't take to a public hospital, see. They use the Meraktis Clinic for their patch-up jobs. Apollo: Interesting... People Park Trucy: It looked like something had happened in that park. Phoenix: Ah. A body was found there in unusual circumstances... Apollo: Something more unusual than being dead? Phoenix: ...It's not our concern, in any case. Trucy: Right! Let's ignore that and find that noodle stand! Apollo: (What ever happened to professional curiosity?) Present Mirror Phoenix: So this was the thing that led you to the car. Apollo: Yes, sir! The mirror you knocked off was just the clue we needed! Phoenix: Good work, Apollo. Of course you might say... ...I was the one who made solving that case possible. Apollo: (...You don't get points for knocking off a car mirror.) Trucy's Panties Trucy: Look! My panties! They came home to mama! Phoenix: Thanks, Apollo. I was worried about them, too. Trucy special ordered those... Apollo: (A startling display of parental concern!) Phoenix: I'd hate to have to buy a  new pair... *shudder* Apollo: (Make that a not-so-startling display of cheapskatedness.) Anything else Phoenix: ... Apollo: (It's actually a relief to be so thoroughly ignored.) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ...Thanks, really. If I get tired of sleeping, maybe I'll head down to this Meraktis place. Maybe hit 'em up for some reparations... A little legal action would do me some good. Apollo: Um... I was wondering when I get paid? We solved the case of your accident, and um, found a missing article of clothing. Trucy: My panties! Phoenix: That leaves the noodle stand. Apollo: Eh. Phoenix: Feel free to drop in if you get stuck. I'd be happy to help with anything not involving money. Apollo: (Good-bye, quid pro quo. Hello pro bono. *sigh*) Trucy: Right! Back to the office to plan our next move! After clearing all Talk options in Accident Scene, clearing all Talk options and examining bowl in Scene of the Stand Theft, and examining cell phone and tailpipe and correctly presenting Mirror upon examining stub on driver's door in Meraktis Clinic - Garage: June 15Kitaki Mansion Trucy: Little Plum's not here. She's not finished cleaning, huh. Apollo: Maybe she went to get a paint scraper? Plum: OK! Who's the wise guy who spit gum out on the street!? Apollo: (Her voice carries all the way out to the street from inside the mansion...) Trucy: She's a neat freak! How cute! Plum: You there! It was you, wasn't it!? Fess up! I hope you've said your prayers. You're gonna need them... Apollo: Tr-Trucy? Let's leave. Now. Trucy: ...? Examine Mansion front gate Apollo: An impressive gate befitting the Kitaki Mansion. Trucy: Look at the name plate! \"Kitaki\"...! That's so cool! Short and blunt, like any good gangster! Ooh! Let's change our name! How about... \"W. A. A.\"! ... Maybe that's too short and blunt. What do you think? Apollo: No comment. Mansion gate wall Apollo: A colorful dragon turns its baleful gaze in my direction. As if to say, \"Abandon all hope ye who enter here.\" Don't worry, Mr. Dragon. Me and hope haven't been on speaking terms for a while. Spilled paint Apollo: Several colors of paint have been splashed across the gate. It's almost all dry. This is going to be tough to clean. Old lady Apollo: It looks like that woman's still causing trouble... Officer: Look, no one goes in! That means you! Old Lady: Oh, what's the difference? Let... me... go! Ow! Ow ow ow ow ow ow!!! Officer: Ah! S-Sorry! Old Lady: That's it, I'm suing! ...But I might change my mind for five bucks... Apollo: (What is she, some kind of con artist?) People Park sign Apollo: Apparently, this park was the gift of the Kitaki Family. The friendly \"People Park\", brought to you by organized crime... A very naughty part of me is tempted to write \"We Kill\" on the left side of the sign. Police officer below People Park sign Apollo: They're not letting anyone into the crime scene. The guard at the entrance is humming a song. He's got rhythm, actually. Maybe he plays in a band. June 15Wright Anything Agency Apollo: You... You're the woman from the Kitaki place! ???: Y-Yes... Trucy: I knew it! Something's the matter and you want our help, right? Well, you've come to the Wright place! This way, please... ???: Um... Thank you. Alita: My name is Alita Tiala. I... have a request. Talk Your request Apollo: Your request... let me guess, something's been stolen? Alita: Um, your flyer... It says \"now defending\" so I thought... Apollo: Whaaaat!? You mean, you mean you want me to defend you? Me? Trucy: Maybe you can tell us what happened? Were you hit by a car? Did someone steal your stand? Or your panties? Alita: No! No... I'm not the client, actually. The client would be my... well, my fiancé, I suppose you'd call him. Apollo: Fiancé...? What happened to him, then? Alita: He was arrested this morning. The charge... was murder. Trucy: Murder... Alita: Have you heard about what happened at the park? Tiala's story Apollo: So, what's your story? You frequent the Kitaki Mansion, yes? Are you a member of their, um, organization? Alita: No... Not yet. Trucy: Not yet? Alita: You see, I'm to be married next month. To the boss's son. Apollo: The boss's son...? So he's a, uh... *gulp* (A gangster...) Alita: Yes, but the Kitakis are locally responsible gangsters. I thought it'd be nice for a change... Quit my boring job, live the good, gangster life. Trucy: I think you're on to something! \"Mrs. Kitaki\"... I like the sound of that! Apollo: (I'm not sure your daddy would care much for that...) Murder in the park (appears after \"Your request\") Apollo: Wh-What happened!? Alita: I haven't been told all the details. But I do know a body was found in the park. Near the Kitaki Mansion. Trucy: There were a lot of police cars there. Alita: Apparently, the victim was shot with a pistol... But I hear the circumstances of the shooting were... rather unusual. Apollo: And your fiancé was arrested for this? Trucy: Um... what sort of person is your fiancé? Your fiancé (appears after \"Tiala's story\" and \"Murder in the park\") Apollo: Your fiancé is the Kitaki Family's only son, correct? Alita: His name's Wocky. Wocky Kitaki... I brought a photo. Apollo: Well. That's... quite the photo. Alita: I know! Oh, he can be powerful and menacing, but so cute! Apollo: But, if he's the boss's only son... Alita: Yes, I'm sure he'll take his father's place some day. Trucy: Say, I'm a boss already! Of this agency! Alita: Please help my Wocky! Please! Apollo: (...Right! My first solo defense case! Crime boss's son or not, I'll prove he's innocent!) Alita: I... prepared a letter of request. I know you need those. Letter of Request added to the Court Record. Trucy: Right! Let's go check out the scene of the crime! Your fiancé (subsequent times) Apollo: Your fiancé is the Kitaki Family's only son, correct? Alita: His name's Wocky. Wocky Kitaki... I brought a photo. Apollo: Well. That's... quite the photo. Alita: I know! Oh, he can be powerful and menacing, but so cute! Apollo: But, if he's the boss's only son... Alita: Yes, I'm sure he'll take his father's place some day. Trucy: Say, I'm a boss already! Of this agency! Alita: Please help my Wocky! Please! Apollo: (...Right! My first solo defense case! Crime boss's son or not, I'll prove he's innocent!) Present Attorney's Badge Alita: An attorney's badge... So you really are a defense attorney. Please, I'm counting on you. I need your help. Letter of Request Alita: I hope that's OK? I've never written a letter of request before. Apollo: Oh, it's fine. (I should hope it's your first...) Trucy: If we take this we'll be able to investigate the scene! Anything else Alita: I'm not sure I understand... I'm sorry. Apollo: No, no, it's me who's sorry, really! Sorry! Examine evidence Letter of Request Writing Trucy: Why does this envelope say \"Hit Request\"? Apollo: Um... it's a bit of lingo. Like \"call in a hit\", or a \"hit man\"... Trucy: Ooh, you mean gangster-talk!? So does \"hit\" mean \"to defend\" in gangster-ese? Well, \"hit man\"? Apollo: I certainly hope not... (Something tells me she used the wrong envelope...) June 15Hickfield Clinic Apollo: Huh...? Where's Mr. Wright? Trucy: Maybe he's getting an examination again? Apollo: How many does he need!? (Wasn't it just a sprain?) Trucy: Too bad, Polly! You wanted to show off your request to Daddy, didn't you! Apollo: What? Me? No! Trucy: Oh? That's a surprise. Apollo: L-Let's just come back later, shall we? After clearing \"Your fiancé\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency: June 15Detention CenterVisitor's Room Trucy: Polly! You look as happy as a clam in its shell. Apollo: For a lawyer this is it, the place where the battle begins! Guard: ...Ahem. You need something? Apollo: Aaah! Yes, we're attorneys. I was hoping we could see Mr. Wocky Kitaki? Guard: Sorry, he's in questioning right now. Could take a while. Trucy: Drat. Oh well, guess we'll have to come back later then. Apollo: So much for that battle... Examine Security camera Apollo: That security camera is looking at me. I wonder if they tape all of this. Security guard Apollo: A security guard. He stands here, watching this room. I have no idea if he's listening to us talk. I'm not even sure he's breathing. After clearing \"Your fiancé\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency: June 15Kitaki Mansion Apollo: (So this is it... My first murder crime scene!) Officer: Ah, it's you kids again. Look, can't you find some other place to play... Trucy: We're not playing! We're um, \"investigating\"! Aren't we, Apollo? Apollo: Sir, I have a letter of request here. Officer: Letter of... huh? Why does it say \"Hit Request\" on it? Apollo: (Ms. Tiala must have used the Kitaki's stationery...) ???: Excuse me, coming through. Officer: Ah! It's you! Mr. Gavin! Apollo: ...! (Who's this guy...?) ???: I must say I'm used to being inspected by the ladies... But this is the first time I've felt this way with a man. Apollo: Mr.... Gavin? ???: Ah, Fräulein. What is a sweet morsel like you doing in such a dismal place? Can I help? Trucy: ... Y-Yes! The police man officer fellow here won't let us in! We even have a letter of request! ???: You must be exhausted, standing out here! I will take you to the scene of the crime. Trucy: Oooh! R-Really!? ???: ...By your leave, Officer. Officer: Ya... Yes sir! Of course, sir! ???: Ah ha. Very well. This way, Fräulein... Trucy: Whee! Apollo: ... Hey! What about me!? June 15People Park ???: ...On that note, enjoy your investigation! Trucy: Thank you! Will we see you again...? ???: Ask the wind, Fräulein. I'll be riding on it! Apollo: ...Who was that? Trucy: Eeeeeeeeeek! Apollo! Look! A c-corpse! Apollo: Whaaaat!? ...Hey, it's just a mannequin. Trucy: Wow. It sure got me. ???: Ahem. Might I ask exactly what it is you're doing here? Oh, it's you. How did you kids get in here? Trucy: Oh! This guy, well, he was more like a prince really. He let us in... ???: Him again. That glimmerous fop, always getting in my way... Anyway! This scene is off-limits. Apollo: Excuse me? We have a letter of request! ???: ...Hmm. One moment. Apollo: (Why is she holding that big magnifying glass...?) ???: .............................. I'd recognize that handwriting anywhere. Scientific analysis says this was written by Alita Tiala. Apollo: ...Thanks. (It took you thirty minutes to figure that out!?) So... what's up with the mannequin there? ???: It's taking the place of the body, preserving the scene of the crime as it was found. Apollo: (The body... was pulling the stand!?) ???: So, you're a defense attorney, are you? Ema: Detective Ema Skye. I'm in charge of this crime scene. Trucy: She doesn't seem that happy about it. Apollo: ...She doesn't seem that happy about many things. Ema: I trust you know how to stay out of the way. I always carry two pairs of handcuffs... just in case. Examine Noodle stand Ema: Hey there! No messing with the crime scene! Apollo: B-But we need to investigate! Trucy: Apollo! Look! That stand! ... It says \"Eldoon\"! Apollo: ...I've noticed. Well, we've solved the case of the missing stand at least. ...Though the circumstances could stand to be better. Anywhere else Ema: Hey there! No messing with the crime scene! Apollo: B-But we need to investigate! Ema: Investigations are to be carried out by professionals, scientifically! Apollo: (She's not going to let us check out the crime scene, is she...) Trucy: Hey, Apollo. My very un-scientific analysis tells me something here is very suspicious... Apollo: ...I think I know what you mean. It's kind of hard not to notice. (I'd better check out what we came here to find at least.) Talk Any option Apollo: Um, Detective Skye...? Ema: Quiet, please. It's snack time. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. Trucy: We're not making much progress here. Apollo: (She must not be very busy...) Ema: *sigh* I never seem to get a lucky break. Back after nine years, and they won't give me the position I requested... ...And then I hear he gave up the defense attorney life... Apollo: (He? Who's he? An ex-defense attorney...?) Present Anything Apollo: Um, if you could spare a moment to take a look at this? Ema: ...Can't you see that I am extremely, extremely busy? Apollo: (...Eating snacks, yes.) Trucy: Busy eating snacks, I'd say. Apollo: (This is going nowhere fast.) After clearing any Talk option and examining noodle stand in People Park: June 15Eldoon's House Trucy: Oh, Mr. Eldoon...! Hello? Apollo: Looks like he left. Trucy: And we found his stand and everything! What about our free bowl!? Apollo: Oh, too bad, looks like we'll have to wait a little longer for that bowl. So sorry. Trucy: Aw, what a bummer. Examine Clinic front door Apollo: The front entrance to the Meraktis Clinic. The walls and posts are so highly polished I can see my face in them. ... Hot dang, my hair looks good. Green banner Apollo: Looks like this is a banner for some campaign. \"Three shots for the price of one\"... Somehow I don't see people lining up for that. Police car Apollo: A police car is parked in front of the Meraktis Clinic. It's empty. The police must be inside investigating. Blue tarp Apollo: The blue tarp Mr. Eldoon used to cover his noodle stand. Robbed of its purpose, it blows in the wind... alone. Bowl Apollo: A lone Eldoon's Noodles bowl lies on the ground. The lone bowl, tipped on its side... It's kind of surreal. House Apollo: Mr. Eldoon's house has seen better days. And I'm betting I've eaten better noodles. \"NOO\" sign Apollo: This must be his business sign. It reads \"NOO\". Maybe that's how the kids are spelling \"new\" these days. Another failed attempt at hipster marketing. Oil drum Apollo: An oil drum for catching rainwater. ...Ack! A sparrow just flew over and... Aw man, that was just disgusting! Something tells me this wasn't the first time. Sign under oil drum Apollo: There's a hand-written sign here... \"Save the light!\" It's hard to make out the sign in the shade from the clinic next door. Spoon the dog Apollo: Guy Eldoon's dog doesn't look too lively. They say dogs and their owners resemble each other... I guess there are exceptions. After clearing any Talk option and examining noodle stand in People Park: June 15Hickfield Clinic Phoenix: Ah, you're back! Run into some problems? Trucy: Oh, Polly, didn't you want to tell Daddy something? Apollo: Who? Me? No! I'm fine. Really. Phoenix: What's this? So there is a problem? Apollo: No, no problem. Actually, I got a defense request. Phoenix: A defense request! That is a problem. Apollo: Huh...? Phoenix: I've given up the court. I'm not a lawyer anymore. Apollo: ... The request was for me! Phoenix: Oh, right. You're a lawyer, aren't you? Apollo: (He's doing that on purpose! I know it!) Talk Murder Phoenix: So, what about this defense request? Apollo: It's related to the murder in People Park, actually. Trucy: Guess what! We found Mr. Eldoon's noodle stand at the scene of the crime! Phoenix: Did you now. That's unusual indeed. Never heard of a noodle stand being used as a murder weapon. Apollo: ...Uh, I think the murder weapon was something else. Phoenix: You mean you don't know what the murder weapon was? Trucy: That funny detective lady won't let us on the scene! What kind of detective wears a lab coat, anyway!? Phoenix: A lab coat? Hmm. Didn't think she'd be involved with this... Apollo: ...You know her? Phoenix: You could say that. Skye connection (appears after \"Murder\") Apollo: So... you know her, don't you? Phoenix: I met her on a case... this was about ten years ago. She was still a high school student at the time. Apollo: (That would make her about the same age as me!) Trucy: That's my daddy! He knows all the police types. Oh, wait! Maybe you know that other guy, too! Apollo: That other guy...? Trucy: That shining prince on the motorcycle! Phoenix: ...Prince? Mysterious Prince (appears after \"Skye connection\") Phoenix: Apollo. Tell me about this \"prince\" of Trucy's. Indulge a concerned father... Apollo: He was at the crime scene... He looked just like Mr. Gavin! Phoenix: ... Did he now. Apollo: ...You know him? Phoenix: My guess is he's Kristoph Gavin's younger brother... Apollo: His brother!? Phoenix: We're acquaintances, after a fashion. Klavier Gavin... rock 'n' roll god incarnate. Trucy: Klavier... What a lovely name! He's so dreamy! Apollo: (I didn't know Mr. Gavin had a brother! And what was he doing out there?) Phoenix: I have a feeling you'll be crossing paths again soon. ...Now, what was the problem again? Having trouble investigating the crime scene in the park? Trucy: Yeah. That detective woman won't let us! Phoenix: ...Go to the office. Under the silk top hat you'll find a bottle of white powder. Try taking that to this detective. Apollo: \"White powder\"...? (I hope it's not what I think it is.) Phoenix: Just take it to her. It'll be fine, you'll see. Oh, and tell her I said hi. Mysterious Prince (subsequent times) Phoenix: Apollo. Tell me about this \"prince\" of Trucy's. Indulge a concerned father... Apollo: He was at the crime scene... He looked just like Mr. Gavin! Phoenix: ... Did he now. Apollo: ...You know him? Phoenix: My guess is he's Kristoph Gavin's younger brother... Apollo: His brother!? Phoenix: We're acquaintances, after a fashion. Klavier Gavin... rock 'n' roll god incarnate. Trucy: Klavier... What a lovely name! He's so dreamy! Apollo: (I didn't know Mr. Gavin had a brother! And what was he doing out there?) Phoenix: I have a feeling you'll be crossing paths again soon. Wright Anything Agency (after clearing \"Mysterious Prince\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic) Examine Silk hat Leads to: \"So this must be the \"silk top hat\" Mr. Wright mentioned.\" Talk The case Trucy: Hmm... I think we should focus on finding more information about the case. Apollo: You seem to be having fun. Trucy: Of course! This is my first criminal investigation! And it's so mysterious! A noodle stand pushing a dead man along... Apollo: ...Uh, I think it was the other way around. The dead man was pulling the stand. But you're right about it being mysterious. Trucy: I knew it! More information, that's what we need! Apollo: So this must be the \"silk top hat\" Mr. Wright mentioned. Let's take a closer look... Huh? Trucy: Whoa! Apollo: You know what this is, Trucy? Trucy: I... remember finding some in Daddy's dresser when I was little. I thought it was sugar, so I licked it... He got mad at me. Apollo: (This is getting more and more suspicious...) White powder placed gingerly into pocket. Trucy: Let's go talk to that detective! She's sure to know what that white powder is! Examine evidence White Powder Label Apollo: Hmm. The bottle has a label on it. Trucy: Can you read it? Apollo: Uh, not a word. I'm not sure I speak whatever language this is written in. Trucy: That's too bad. I guess we're stuck with this mysterious bottle of white powder... People Park (after clearing \"Mysterious Prince\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic, then examining silk hat in Wright Anything Agency) Present White Powder Leads to: \"Um... Does this ring any bells?\" Apollo: Um... Does this ring any bells? Ema: Ah! Is that--!? It couldn't!? Where'd you get that? Apollo: I brought it from the office. Ema: You... work at the Wright & Co. Law Offices, yes? Apollo: Er, yeah, sort of... Trucy: Detective Skye! How do you know my daddy? Ema: D-D-Daddy!? I'm sorry, who did you say you were? Trucy: Trucy Wright. Phoenix Wright's daughter. Ema: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Mr. Wright has a daughter!? Trucy: You seem shocked. Ema: W-Well, if you're Mr. Wright's daughter and you're his apprentice... ...then I'm available to help you in any way I can! Apollo: Oh, uh, thanks. (You can start by not calling me Mr. Wright's apprentice!) Ema: This powder is used for detecting fingerprints. Apollo: Fingerprints...? Ema: I guess you might call it a memento... from the time I spent with Mr. Wright. Apollo: (White powder memories...) Ema: If you find any evidence with fingerprints on it, please let me know! We'll dust for prints! Apollo: (Well, she's quite the eager beaver all of a sudden...) Examine Benches Apollo: Benches line the river running through the park. Trucy: Ahh, a little urban oasis. I bet children come here to splash around in the water. Apollo: That river's a little deep for splashing... and a little dirty. Trucy: Well, they could listen to the water and pretend they were playing. Blue tarps Apollo: Blue tarps have been placed on the ground around the stand. Trucy: Apollo! I bet the victim was going to have a picnic here! Apollo: ...I guess he could have eaten all the noodles he wanted. Ema: Don't touch those! Those are preserving the crime scene! Apollo: (Oh, I guess the police put these tarps here after all.) Knife Apollo: It's... a knife! Ema: A \"shiv\" to be precise. Trucy: Ooh... lingo! Ema: The defendant, Wocky Kitaki, is the son of known gangsters. The police are assuming this belongs to him. Apollo: (Wait, but wasn't the murder weapon a pistol...?) Huh? Look at this, there's a handprint on this shiv... Ema: A handprint? Then there might be a fingerprint. Let's investigate! Right! First, choose the fingerprint you want to examine. Apollo: ...Choose a fingerprint? Ema: Look closely at the handle. See? There's more than one fingerprint there. Trucy: Those black spots? Ema: That's right. Pick the one you want to analyze. Examine darkest fingerprint Leads to: \"Right! Let's get detecting!\" Ema: Right! Let's get detecting! Apollo: (Wow, she's practically glowing with excitement...) Ema: First, sprinkle some aluminum powder over the print. With a press of [A / Space], like this. See? (Changed from [Just touch the screen, like this. See?] in the original release) The oil left by the print absorbs the aluminum powder, so you just dust it on... ...and blow it off! Trucy: B-Blow? Ema: It's like whistling. You know how to whistle, don't you? Just use [X / Y / R] and... (Changed from [It's like whistling. You know how to whistle, don't you? Just put your lips together...] in the original release) Trucy: Wow! Amazing! It's like magic! Ema: Heh heh. Isn't it though? Apollo: (Right, let's give it a shot!) Ema: Incidentally, it's important that you cover the entire fingerprint with the powder. Obtain fingerprint Leads to: \"Hmm, good... clear... Quite impressive!\" Ema: Hmm, good... clear... Quite impressive! Next, to match the print. The police office has samples so you can tell whose finger this print belongs to. Apollo: Hmm... That doesn't sound like as much fun as actually finding the print. Ema: OK, pick the person whose print you think this is. You probably have a good idea whose knife this is already. Compare Wocky Kitaki profile Comparing...Comparison complete. Match found Leads to: \"So... the fingerprints do belong to the defendant.\" Compare anyone else Comparing...Comparison complete. No Match found Leads back to profile selection Apollo: So... the fingerprints do belong to the defendant. Ema: Yes! Isn't it amazing? Ah, the power of science. It's my life. Trucy: Apollo, she's... sparkling. Apollo: And I'm dimming. Ema: Look sharp, spirits up. The real fight is yet to come! Trucy: Chin up, Polly! Apollo: (The trial hasn't even started and I'm already losing...) Knife added to the Court Record. Knife (subsequent times) Apollo: A knife is sticking straight into the ground. Trucy: With the defendant's fingerprints on it... Which means... You think he stuck it into the victim? Apollo: (I don't know what he did with it but I don't like it.) Mannequin Apollo: This mannequin is dressed up to look like a police officer. I've seen one at the station. (A mannequin in place of a body...) Ema: The body of the victim has already been removed. Trucy: Do you think the victim was the noodle stand thief? Apollo: What, you think someone killed him because he stole it? Trucy: Yeah! Taking care of business, Little Plum Kitaki style! Apollo: (Try not to sound too eager about that, please...) Noodle stand Apollo: ...And this is Mr. Eldoon's noodle stand, obviously. Trucy: It does say \"Eldoon\" in big letters, doesn't it! Apollo: And that mark on his paper lantern there looks familiar. Trucy: It's going to be a little weird telling him... what with the corpse and all... Apollo: Anyway, that wraps up three of our cases. Trucy: That's right! Congratulations, Apollo! Apollo: (And leaves us with one case that's worse than all three put together... Murder.) Trash can Apollo: (There's got to be a good clue or two around here...) Trucy: You and your trash cans! Go ahead, knock yourself out. Apollo: Please, can't you see I'm doing my... Huh? L... Look! Another pair of underwear!? Trucy: Wow, Apollo! You're a genius at finding panties! Apollo: Stop saying that. Wait, these aren't...? Trucy: Th-They're not mine! Apollo: (Could these have been stolen, too?) Bloomers added to the Court Record. Trash can (subsequent times) Trucy: I'll always remember this trash can as \"the place where Apollo found those bloomers\"! Apollo: Don't you have more important things to remember? Wait, these aren't...? Trucy: Th-They're not mine! Apollo: (Could these have been stolen, too?) Talk The case Ema: The report came in late last night. The body was found much as you see it now. ...Except it was a real body. Apollo: But... why? Ema: Why was a body pulling a noodle stand? If I knew the answer to that, I wouldn't still be here. Apollo: Well, what was the cause of death...? Ema: A bullet wound, to the temple. ...He was shot by a pistol. Trucy: A pistol? Ema: Not the easiest thing to come by in this day and age. Apollo: (Unless you're a cop... or a gangster.) Ema: Incidentally, the victim's name was Pal Meraktis. I just received the autopsy report, in fact. Meraktis's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Ema: I mean, really! What's up with this case!? It's enough to make me want to run off, pulling a mysterious noodle stand behind me... Trucy: Not so mysterious, actually... We should tell her, Apollo! After all, we know where the stand came from! Ema: A likely story! I didn't come here to play games, you know. Apollo: Actually, we do know where the noodle stand came from. The noodle stand's owner is... Present Guy Eldoon profile Apollo: Ema: ... Who's the old guy? Apollo: This is the proprietor of Eldoon's Noodles, Mr. Eldoon himself! Trucy: He's famous in this part of town. Ema: Not bad. I guess Mr. Wright picked the right kids for the job. That saved me a lot of work. Thanks. Noodle Stand added to the Court Record. Trucy: What sort of person was the victim, anyway? Ema: You mean what did he do? He was a doctor. Apollo: A doctor...? (I'm starting to see a connection here...) Present anyone else Apollo: Ema: ... Look, I have better things to be doing. I'd make more progress eating snacks than listening to this drivel. Apollo: (You could try actually investigating, rather than just standing around.) Leads back to Talk options The case (subsequent times, before correctly presenting Guy Eldoon profile) Ema: The report came in late last night. The body was found much as you see it now. ...Except it was a real body. Apollo: But... why? Ema: Why was a body pulling a noodle stand? If I knew the answer to that, I wouldn't still be here. Apollo: Well, what was the cause of death...? Ema: A bullet wound, to the temple. ...He was shot by a pistol. Trucy: A pistol? Ema: Not the easiest thing to come by in this day and age.

Trucy: What sort of person was the victim, anyway? Ema: You mean what did he do? He was a doctor. Apollo: A doctor...? (I'm starting to see a connection here...) Your story Ema: Who? Me? I'm just a supervisor for this crime scene. Apollo: (Detective Skye... Hmm.) Ema: I was out of the country for a while. I came back to be a forensic scientist. Trucy: Ooh! Were you studying abroad? Ema: Something like that. I was studying in Europe. Forensic sciences, mind you. But when I got back here, they threw me in criminal affairs! Just like that! Trucy: Why didn't you just become a forensics expert in Europe? Ema: Well, I suppose that was an option, but... I had a lot of favors to repay to people back here. Apollo: (Favors? Wasn't she in high school when she left?) Ema: What? What's that look for? I was involved in an... incident before I left. But Mr. Wright and his people helped me out. I owed them. Trucy: Really? I had no idea... Apollo: (If she's been out of the country for a while... ...she probably doesn't know about Mr. Wright's current, erm, \"state of affairs\".) The defendant Apollo: Um... Could you tell us a bit about the defendant? He's the only son of the Kitaki Family, yes...? Ema: Wocky Kitaki. I don't know if he is the boss's son, but he's certainly throwing his weight around... ...Violently. In the detention center. Trucy: I see. Apollo: Why was he arrested in the first place? Ema: ... You are a defense attorney, aren't you? You're not his, by any chance? Apollo: Er, a-actually, yes, I am. Ema: Well... We have a witness to the moment of the crime. Apollo: Eh...? Ema: The witness called the police. They'll be testifying during the trial tomorrow. Trucy: Whaaaaaaaa--!? The victim (appears after correctly presenting Guy Eldoon profile upon selecting \"The case\" Talk option) Apollo: Could you tell us a bit more about the victim? Ema: Well, let's see... Apparently he's the physician at a clinic in the area. Quite well off, too, from the sound of it. The clinic's name is... The Meraktis Clinic. Trucy: Hmm... Maybe that's why the cop car was parked there? Ema: What? You've been to the clinic? Apollo: Yeah... Though on a related issue. Apollo: (I told the detective about the case of the stolen noodle stand.) Ema: ...I see... So that means... ...Dr. Meraktis stole the stand and pulled it all the way here? Apollo: That would seem to be the case. Ema: ... But why? Apollo: Don't ask me! Present Attorney's Badge Ema: Ah, an attorney's badge. It reminds me of when Mr. Wright was still defending. Everything I have now is thanks to him. Remember, help as many people as you can. That's your job! Trucy: She's right, Polly! Let's make a difference! ...Is something wrong? Apollo: Ah! Ah, no! N-Nothing. (I... I actually felt inspired for a moment there.) Fingerprint Powder Ema: Fingerprint analysis is the very basis of modern forensic science! Doesn't just talking about it leave you breathless with excitement? Apollo: Oh yes. Breathless. (Actually, it does sound kinda interesting...) Ema: Let me know if you find any evidence that might have a  print or two, alright? Knife Ema: The defendant's fingerprints were found on that knife. Trucy: Which means that, at the very least, he was here at the scene of the crime...? Ema: It's highly possible, yes. Apollo: Ugh. This doesn't look good. Ema: No use worrying about what's out already! You just worry about what's yet to come! Meraktis's Autopsy Report Ema: Why did Dr. Meraktis die like this...? Trucy: Pulling a noodle stand... Very strange. Ema: Inconceivable! I just don't get it! Some people just can't die normally! Apollo: (He's dead, give him a break.) Anything else Ema: Sorry... I don't think I can help you with that. I think you need more than just scientific help. But ask me anything you like! ...Just ask scientifically. Examine evidence Fingerprint Powder Label Apollo: The label reads \"Fingerprint Powder\" in some strange language. Trucy: How do we know for sure? What if this is really a jar for something else, like jam, or honey? Apollo: Why would anyone go through the trouble? Trucy: Well, so the police don't find out, that's why! Apollo: I hardly think possessing fingerprint powder is a crime. Trucy: Oh, huh, I guess. That's boring. Bloomers Pattern on back side Trucy: These bloomers sure have a... distinct design! Apollo: You certainly know who they belong to at a glance. Trucy: That way, she doesn't have to write her name on them! Genius! Apollo: ...I would think writing your name would be easier than drawing a plum blossom. Knife Fingerprints Trucy: So, the defendant's prints are on this knife... Apollo: That would mean he was here the night of the crime. Trucy: That's what I call irrefutable scientific evidence! Neat! Apollo: Not so neat when it happens to be evidence against our client... Noodle Stand \"NOODLE\" sign Trucy: Huh? Look at this, Apollo! Mr. Eldoon spelled his name backwards on this side! Apollo: Um, I think that says \"Noodle\". As in \"Eldoon's Noodles\". Trucy: Huh... Oh, I get it! So the name of his store is the same whether you read it forward or backwards! Apollo: Yeah... I guess it would be. Well, except for the last \"s\". Trucy: ...... Then, how about a store called \"Team Meat\"? Apollo: Uh, close, but that would be \"Taem Maet\" backwards. And what kind of store is that? Trucy: Why, a store that sells meat! \"It's not meat, useless it's Team Meat!\" After clearing all Talk options and examining trash can and knife: Ema: So... have you met the defendant? Apollo: Ah. Uh... No. Ema: Visiting hours are almost over at the detention center. You might think about wrapping up here and heading over. Apollo: Good idea. (I don't know what good it will do. We have a witness, and a knife with prints... Have I mentioned I've got a bad feeling about this?) Ema: Don't worry, it's like a Wright tradition. Apollo: (Some traditions I can live without.) June 15Detention CenterVisitor's Room Guard: I'm sorry. Meeting hours for the day are all done. Apollo: B-But we still have three minutes! Guard: I'll put in your request, but don't expect anything. The father's talking in the private room with him. Trucy: The father? You mean like a priest? Guard: I mean the suspect's father, Mr. Winfred \"Big Wins\" Kitaki himself. Apollo: (Not someone I care to meet...) ???: ...Die you--!!! ???: ...You're the one on your way out, old--!!! Apollo: ...... Trucy: ......... Guard: Ah. They're here. Apollo: (Whoa! This guy radiates power! Power.. with a cute apron?) ???: You Wocky's lawyer? Apollo: Y-Yes, sir! Big Wins: Well, I'm Big Wins Kitaki, fourth head of the Kitaki family... capice? Apollo: Er... Actually, I came to speak to your son. Big Wins: ... Mr. Justice. Apollo: Yes? Big Wins: My son's innocent. He killed no one. If he were found guilty... it wouldn't be good. ...Capice? Apollo: Y-Yes! I'm all about capicing! Capice'd loud and clear! Big Wins: You gotta do more than just understand to make it. You'll learn, though. Even if the lesson comes at the end of your short life. Apollo: (I don't feel so good...) ???: What's the big idea, old man! Wocky: You can't treat me like a kid no more, not now! You know I... I... I wanted to go to the clink! I like it here! Apollo: You... must be Wocky? Wocky: A G's not a G till he does hard time! Bizzoooy! You'll see. When I get out of here, things'll change! Big Wins: Silence! My apologies, Mr. Justice... He's usually such a nice boy. Apollo: (Forgive me if I have a hard time believing that.) Wocky: Ha! You can't take me under your wing this time, old man! You heard me! I don't need no trial! I did it! Big Wins: ...I think that's enough for today, Mr. Justice. Don't let me down tomorrow. Apollo: So much for talking to our client. Trucy: But we made so much progress today! We even found my panties! I had fun, at least. Apollo: Of course, the biggest mystery of all remains... (How am I supposed to build a case for the trial!?) Trucy: Oh, almost forgot, it's time for my show! Tonight I'm performing at the Wonder Bar! You should come check it out. To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Apollo: No clues here.\n-- A Night in the Park --Stickler: That night, I passed through the park on my way home from shopping... when I saw them!Press Apollo: Apollo: On the way home from shopping, you say? Why go through the park? Stickler: Ah, a fascinating inquiry. Revealing me culpable of being insufficiently verbose! Let us consider the time saved by passing through the park on the way home from the store: In that time I am capable of solving two GMAT problem sets. On average, it requires me 3 minutes, 24 seconds to complete one such set. Ergo the time to complete two is, on average, 6 minutes 48 seconds. However! In the case that the questions are in the verbal category, admittedly not m... Apollo: Th-That's enough! Enough. I get the idea. Judge: Mr. Justice! The court hopes to finish cross-examination sometime this month. Klavier: Please. I've a recording booked after this trial. Trucy: And I've got a show to perform. Apollo: (Gee, sorry you're all so busy!)Stickler: One man, pulling a stand. Another man, facing him.Press Apollo: Apollo: Were these men talking, by any chance? Stickler: Ah, now that you mention it, they were, though I cannot claim I heard them clearly. Only fragments... such as, \"You lied to me!\" Oh, and... \"I'm gonna give you a taste of your own medicine, pal.\" Klavier: Ah ha ha ha! It's just as our defendant claims! I believe he wished to \"teach\" the victim what it felt like to take a bullet in the heart. Judge: If that's true, then this is a vital piece of testimony! Apollo: (Sounds like he heard them clearly enough to me!) Stickler: Might I be allowed to amend my testimony? Apollo: (Wh... What now!?) Stickler: To be precise, he did not say \"pal\" but \"man\". Yes, that was the way of it. I swear it on my diploma! Apollo: (What's the difference!?) Klavier: And this other man, who was he?Stickler: I saw them quite clearly. The man facing the victim was the defendant.Press Apollo: Apollo: How can you be so sure it was the defendant!? The crime took place at night! It would have been too dark! Stickler: ...Perhaps I was remiss in not mentioning this earlier. Apollo: Huh? Stickler: You see, in class, I always sit in the very backmost seat. Do you know why? Apollo: (...Who cares!?) Stickler: Because I do not wish anyone to copy my perfect notes! Judge: ...And this relates to your testimony how? Stickler: I mention this to illustrate my predisposition to that which is \"perfect\". It was dark, you say? Yet there are lights in the park. If I say the defendant was in the park that night, then he was in the park that night. It is a hard, immutable fact. Trucy: He sure is confident... Apollo: He seems to be telling the truth, too. *sigh*Stickler: In his hand he held... yes, a pistol! It was pointed at the man pulling the stand.Press Apollo: Apollo: Are you sure the pistol you saw is the same as the one just submitted as evidence? Stickler: Am I \"sure\"? Surely... you jest! ...Or so a common witness would be tempted to say. Apollo: ...Huh? Stickler: Yet I am no common witness. I see not only events as they are, but the logical structure governing these events! First, we must consider the fact that it was night in the park, which indeed restricted my field of vision due to insufficient levels of illumination. Now if we consider that the pistol, let us call it \"Object A\", was indeed shrouded in darkness it becomes difficult to say with certainty that Object A was indeed Object A. Trucy: I think he means he couldn't see it that clearly. Apollo: (My badge for a normal witness...) Stickler: Yet the fact that a pistol was fired before my eyes is indisputable. I can still see it when I close my eyes. The defendant raised his weapon...Stickler: A shot! The bullet hit the man pulling the stand from the front, square in the forehead!Press Apollo: Apollo: Are you absolutely certain only one shot was fired? Stickler: Yes. Of course it was one shot. Why do you ask? Apollo: (Ah ha! A contradiction! Finally!) Mr. Stickler. According to the Court Record, the pistol was fired twice. A clear contradiction! Klavier: Klavier: ...Good eyes, Herr Justice. You're cool. Real cool. Apollo: Eh? Y-You really think so? Klavier: Yet, there is no reason why this other shot had to have been fired that night. Judge: Meaning...? Klavier: This pistol came from the Kitaki Family mansion, ja? I think it's not unreasonable to assume the pistol had been fired once before that night. During, perhaps... another altercation? Apollo: (Ugh... He's got a point.) Trucy: Judging from his smug expression... ...I'd say Prosecutor Gavin had that answer ready before you even spotted the problem.Present Meraktis's Autopsy Report Apollo: Leads to: \"Whew... If that's all of it, I think I have a chance.\"Apollo: (He seems pretty confident in his testimony.)Trucy: We always make the biggest mistakes when we're our most confident! He's got a weak point somewhere, Apollo! Find it!Apollo: (...Right! Better give that testimony another listen.)Apollo: (Whew... If that's all of it, I think I have a chance.)Klavier: Is that you... relaxing, I see, Herr Justice?Apollo: Huh? Oh, er... Ahem! Objection!!!Judge: ...Once is quite enough, Mr. Justice.Trucy: Apollo! Pace yourself! This trial's not over yet!Apollo: Urk! Eh, right! Ahem, um, look at this!Judge: The... autopsy report? Is there a problem with the autopsy report?Apollo: Um, right, a problem... Problem... problem... Yes!!! The problem is the location of the entry wound!Judge: The location...?Apollo: You testified that the killer shot the victim \"square in the forehead\", did you not?Stickler: Ah, I have already determined your \"angle\" of inquiry. ...Allow me to explain. It is quite simple, really: First, understand that when I say \"square\", I speak not of geometrical absolute. What do I mean by this? For example, the defection of a \"meter\" is 1,650,763.73 times the wavelength of the light emitted by a krypton particle, as we all know. In addition, it is a well known fact that krypton particles are rare, and invisible to the naked eye, which points to a basic fallacy in your line of reasoning, namely, that wh--Judge: Mr. Justice.Apollo: Yes?Judge: Was your objection to these, er, krypton particle things?Klavier: This is the big time, and you are obsessed with something so small? You disappoint me.Apollo: N-N-No! I'm obsessed with something big! I mean, there's a bigger, less nitpicky problem here!Judge: Do tell...Apollo: Just look at the autopsy report! The location of the entry wound was... ...the right temple!Stickler: T-Temple...?Apollo: Mr. Stickler, you said quite clearly that the victim was shot \"square in the forehead\"! That's a contradiction! ...Isn't it? (It is, right? Finally!)Klavier:Klavier: Herr Justice... Oh, Herr Justice...Apollo: Yes...?Klavier: Your tactics are outdated. Trying to shake the witness by objecting to trifles? Surely you haven't forgotten the fatal wound your master suffered seven years ago? Phoenix Wright... was it?Apollo: ...! Look, I know the wound was in the wrong place according to this testimony!Stickler: Nyurk...!Klavier: Hey, Herr Forehead...Apollo: ...! (F... \"Forehead\"!?)Klavier: Let us imagine you are walking through the park. You see two men facing each other. One with a pistol trained on the other. ...What would you do, Herr Forehead?Apollo: Well, I... I guess... I would try to stop them. I'd probably shout, \"Stop!\"Klavier: And you, Fräulein?Trucy: M-Me? Well... I'd probably scream, \"Eeeeeek!\"Klavier: And you, Herr Stickler? What did you shout, I wonder?Apollo: Ack...! (If the victim turned his head at the last moment...*gulp*)Stickler: ...Ah yes. Thank you for jogging my memory.Judge: It sounds like an addendum to the testimony is required.Witness Testimony-- A Night in the Park 2 --Stickler: As soon as the killer raised his pistol, I took action. \"Cease this at once, you two!\" I cried... with composure. The victim turned in the direction of my voice... and a shot rang out. Whereupon our cowardly killer, the defendant, appeared to have become frightened. Tossing the pistol aside, he fled from the scene.Judge: I see... So you attempted to stop the crime.Stickler: Indeed. ...With composure.Trucy: Well, maybe the criminal wouldn't have fired if he hadn't shouted like that.Apollo: Th-That doesn't really matter now, unfortunately.Klavier: Let us consider this new testimony, shall we? ...Observe the diagram, if you would. The witness... Mr. Stickler, was it? Stood here. He shouted, \"Oh stop! Please!\" or something of this nature. And the victim responded by looking in the witness's direction! If the killer were to have fired at just that moment... As we can see, the bullet would have struck the right temple, as in the report.Judge: That does seem to be the case.Stickler: Witness the power of a Junior in Ivy University's Department of Science!Judge: Very well, Mr. Justice, you may cross-examine the witness.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- A Night in the Park 2 --Stickler: As soon as the killer raised his pistol, I took action.Press Apollo: Apollo: So you saw a raised pistol... Weren't you frightened? Stickler: It can be said we students of Ivy University know no fear. The moment I saw that pistol, my inner sense of justice compelled me to take action! Judge: That was certainly brave of you. You might have gotten shot! Stickler: Eh!? Klavier: You certainly were lucky. If I were in the killer's shoes, I certainly wouldn't have left a witness behind. Stickler: ......! Trucy: He actually looks like he had no idea he was in danger. Stickler: R-Regardless, I attempted to halt the bloodshed!Stickler: \"Cease this at once, you two!\" I cried... with composure.Press Apollo: Apollo: Are you sure both men were able to hear your voice? Stickler: They were, of course. My high, exquisite voice echoed through the park. Klavier: And the victim responded to that clarion call... Stickler: Quite.Stickler: The victim turned in the direction of my voice... and a shot rang out.Press Apollo: Apollo: Did you hear the gunshot at the same time as the victim turned? Stickler: Indeed. I would say \"about\" the same time, to be precise. Apollo: And the victim didn't ask you for help? Stickler: It can be said that he didn't have time to ask. He didn't even have time to take a single step. Trucy: I'm totally sure that the killer fired because Mr. Stickler startled him. Apollo: Don't say that too loud, Trucy, please...Stickler: Whereupon our cowardly killer, the defendant, appeared to have become frightened.Press Apollo: Apollo: Can you describe the killer's actions more clearly? Stickler: He seemed quite surprised, especially considering that it was he who did the deed! As we can see, human psychology is a tangled web, indeed. Klavier: He simply couldn't believe what he had done. He shot, he panicked. A common tale, but true. Stickler: Unfortunately, before I could take further action...Stickler: Tossing the pistol aside, he fled from the scene.Press Apollo: Apollo: You didn't try to apprehend the criminal? Stickler: It all happened so fast, I'm afraid I hadn't the time. Trucy: Doesn't something about that strike you as odd, Apollo? Apollo: ...! What? Trucy: The killer was in a hurry, right? He fired the pistol, and tossed it right away... Apollo: According to the testimony, that's what happened, yes. Trucy: In that case, I'd expect to find something that we didn't find! Apollo: (Find \"something\"? Find what?)Present Pistol Apollo: Apollo: Wait a second! Sticker: Tsk, tsk, another misleading request. Yet you're so beholden to your own mode of \"discourse\" you can't see how it affects you! Apollo: Um... come again? Stickler: Wait a \"second\", you say? A \"second\"? Are we intended to wait just that, a single second, one sixtieth of a minute? That's hardly enough time to draw a breath, let alone make a statement in court! Now, had you asked for a longer period of time, say, 3 minutes, 35 seconds, th-- Judge: Mr. Justice. Apollo: Yes, Your Honor? Judge: Am I to understand you are objecting to the length of a second? Apollo: Yes! I mean, no! Here, just look at the pistol! It doesn't have a single fingerprint on it! Stickler: Ah, a common ploy, made all the more common, I fear, by the prevalence of television. Criminals these days are loathe to leave fingerprints. Apollo: Wait! But you said the killer tossed the gun and ran! Trucy: That's right! He didn't have time to wipe the gun for prints! Stickler: ...! Klavier: Ah, the little girl sticking it to the university student. There's a song in there... Trucy: I'm not little! Klavier: A ha ha ha... Then let's think like adults, shall we, Fräulein? Trucy: Eh...? Klavier: What if the killer... the defendant, was wearing gloves? Trucy: ... Gotta admit, I didn't think of that, Apollo. Judge: Well, Mr. Justice? Apollo: (Could the killer have been wearing gloves...?) I guess... Apollo: (If he was wearing gloves, there wouldn't be prints...) ... (C'mon Justice, you've gotta come up with something...!) Judge: Is there something you want to tell the court, Mr. Justice? Klavier: His silence speaks louder than words, Herr Judge. He can think of nothing... nein? Apollo: I g-guess he could have been wearing gloves. (...I guess.) Judge: Then let's continue with the testimony. If you would. Stickler: ...My pleasure, Your Honor. A small pleasure, but still. Leads back to cross-examination No way Leads to: \"The record of the murder weapon is very clear about one thing:\"Trucy: I liked that contradiction. Kinda sad to see it go.Apollo: Not as sad as I feel. What do we do now?Trucy: At least the testimony's getting a little clearer.Apollo: (She's right! Maybe I can find something to use in this new testimony.)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Phoenix Wright\nDescription: A pianist who can't play a lick.

    "cot": "Testimony 4 states: \"Tossing the pistol aside, he fled from the scene.\"\n\nIf Wocky Kitaki tossed the pistol in panic and fled the scene, the pistol should bear his fingerprints, unless he was wearing gloves or wiped the gun clean. However, the facts presented in Evidence 14 (Pistol) are: \"Weapon left at the crime scene. Two rounds were fired. Fingerprints were wiped.\" This means the pistol does not have Wocky's fingerprints (or anyone's) on it, and had been wiped.\n\nThe contradiction here is that if the killer tossed the pistol and ran in panic, he would not have had the time or composure to meticulously wipe away the fingerprints. Therefore, the witness's statement is in conflict with the condition of the evidence.\n",

Spinning big crimes and little crimes together. And when the Wheel stops... You die. June 15, 9:12 AMWright & Co. Law Offices Examine evidence Attorney's Badge Back side Apollo: There's a number inscribed on the back of the badge. There are many numbers like it, but this one is mine. Proof that I'm an attorney. To tell the truth, I get a happy feeling inside just looking at it. Apollo: (Two months have passed since Mr. Gavin's arrest. My first trial, and I lost both my mentor and my job. Yeah, I'll admit it. I was screwed. But even when I hit bottom, I told myself I'd never come here. Honest. Here being the legendary Wright & Co. Law Offices. OK, Justice, time to stop trembling.) ???: Ah! You must be here for the interview. Right this way. Apollo: Huh? ???: Hello there! You've found the Wright place! Welcome! Apollo: Uh... Ah... (What's with this girl!?) ???: Well now, shall we begin? Apollo: Begin... what? ???: Right, first things first... Any special talents? Apollo: Erm, talents? ???: Yes, well, you must have at least one! Apollo: Well... Uh... I guess... Defending? ???: \"Defending\"... An unusual talent, but it'll do. With a little jazzing up, of course. Apollo: Y-You think so...? ???: Let's give it a go, shall we? Apollo: Huh? ???: Go ahead! Show me! Defend! Just give it all you've got. Don't hold back now! Apollo: Wh-What are you talking about? I can't just \"defend\" here! ???: First lesson: A professional can perform anywhere! Apollo: ...Thanks. ???: We want people to be laughing with us... ...not at us! Apollo: ...Thanks. But I'm not sure why they should be laughing at all. ???: What...? What exactly do you think you came here to do? Apollo: What? Um, defend... No? ???: ... Excuse me, but do you know where you are? Apollo: Huh!? The Wright & Co. Law Offices, right? ???: ...Oh. I was afraid of that. Don't worry, you're not the first. Apollo: Look, what's going on here? Who are you? I came here to meet with the person in charge... ???: Well, you've apparently made no fewer than two mistakes. Apollo: Mistakes? But I got a call from Mr. Wright this morning! ???: Perhaps you should go read the sign out front again? Apollo: What's there to read!? Look, it says right there... ...Oh. Why does it say \"Wright Talent Agency\"...? ???: Welcome to the Wright Talent Agency, where you've \"always come to the Wright place!\" Trucy: I'm Trucy Wright, CEO. I'm a magician. Apollo: (It all came flooding back... The trial... That girl...) ???: Hello, sir. Please, pick a card. Phoenix: That's right. She's my daughter. Apollo: Trucy... Wright. Trucy: Here, check out our flyer! So... what's your name? Apollo: Apollo... Apollo Justice, attorney at law. Examine Bookshelf Apollo: All these legal books must be Mr. Wright's leftovers... ...There's a lot of unrelated books in here, too. \"One Trick a Day\"... \"Magic for Idiots\"... You'd think a pro magician would aim a bit higher. Charley the plant Trucy: Ack! Don't touch Mr. Charley! Apollo: \"Mister\" Charley...? Trucy: He's been in this office much longer than I have! Daddy's mentor had a great fondness for Mr. Charley. He's lived here since Daddy was a rookie attorney! Apollo: Huh.  (Mr. Charley... riiight.) Trucy: Now I take care of him! Hula hoop Apollo: That's one of those hula hoop things everyone was crazy about way back when. Trucy: Really? I had no idea these were that popular! Apollo: I'm not so bad with one myself, actually. Trucy: Eh!? I-I'm still learning... So you can really make someone levitate with it? Show me! Apollo: Huh!? I-I have no idea how! (It's just a normal hula hoop, isn't it?) Magic split box Apollo: A strange, split box leers at me from the wall. Um, is this one of those boxes for cutting people in half? Trucy: That's right! This cabinet is used for an illusion called the \"Zig-Zag\"! Apollo: I've seen one on TV... But why is one just sitting here in your office? Trucy: Oh, it's a little big for me, you see. So I'm using it as furniture. Hats in the top, shirts in the middle, and pants down below! I think it's a nice touch... don't you? Apollo: (It's not exactly what I'd call a \"welcoming\" decor.) Photograph Apollo: An old, sepia-tinted photo of a man in a silk top hat. Trucy: That's my favorite magician! I want to be just like him someday! Apollo: (Sure, nice... Guess it's good to have a role model. Even if he's gotta be well over 100.) Trucy: How rude! Piano Apollo: There are all sorts of strange paraphernalia sitting on top of the piano. Trucy: Those are my magic props! Practice, practice, practice! A professional never leaves their weapons far from reach! Apollo: But you can't play the piano with all this junk on it. Trucy: Oh, no one plays here anyway. And the neighbors complain. Apollo: (I guess Mr. Wright really can't play...) Silk hat Apollo: A blue silk hat, just like the one Trucy is wearing. Trucy: Oh, that's just for show. Don't wear it, please! Apollo: (Last thought from my mind, honest.) Trucy: I put it there so clients can see it and know who I am. Nothing says \"magician\" like a silk top hat! Spaghetti Apollo: Whoa! That fork is floating! ...Not. Why do you have a plate of plastic spaghetti here? Trucy: That right there is the whole reason I became a magician! Apollo: Do tell. Trucy: I saw a plate just like that in a restaurant once. The floating fork looked so real! That's when I knew... Someday, I'd make magic more amazing than that spaghetti! Table Apollo: That table... doesn't look very sturdy. Trucy: You've never seen one of these? It's a magic table! Apollo: So, like, you make this teapot disappear? Trucy: So you might think! But that's not it... Before your very eyes, the contents of the pot change! ...From Earl Grey to Darjeeling! Apollo: Kinda hard to see the difference, I'd think... Move Apollo: (What's up with this \"Wright Talent Agency\"? Guess I'll talk to her and find out what I can.) Talk Wright Talent Agency Apollo: So... Is this really a talent agency? Trucy: You bet! Daddy started it seven years ago, when he quit law. Of course, we only have two people signed up right now. Apollo: Two people... Does that include you? Trucy: Trucy Wright, Magician Extraordinaire! I've done a lot of stage shows! Paid, too! I am a professional, you know. Apollo: Er... right. Trucy: Promise you'll come to one of my shows, OK? Let's see... Oh, and the other person our agency represents is... Phoenix Wright, Pianist Extra Ordinaire! Apollo: Your dad, in other words. Didn't he say he couldn't play the piano? Trucy: Our agency doesn't see that as a problem. Why, there are many magicians who can't do magic! Apollo: At least you're optimistic, I'll give you that. Trucy Wright Apollo: So you're his, er... you're Phoenix Wright's daughter? Trucy: That's right! After Daddy quit law seven years ago... ...I promised I would keep him fed! So I'm kind of his sugar daddy! Get it? Apollo: No. Trucy: I'm in charge of this whole office, too. Pretty amazing for a young lass of fifteen, wouldn't you agree!? Apollo: F-Fifteen? Uh, how old is Mr. Wright? Trucy: Daddy? Oh... he's 33 this year. Apollo: ...I'm sure there's a good explanation. (I hope...) Trucy: ? Phoenix Wright Apollo: Um, about Mr. Wright giving up law... It was because of that incident seven years ago, wasn't it...? Trucy: Eh? You know about that!? Apollo: Not the details. I remember the news, though. It was a big deal. Trucy: So I hear. I was too young to understand what was going on. I'll ask Daddy about it next time I get a chance. Apollo: Daddy, right... That reminds me. About Mr. Wright... He gave me a call this morning to come in. Trucy: Daddy's not here right now. He's in the hospital. Apollo: The hospital!? Trucy: Yeah. He's on strict bed rest until he gets better. Apollo: Wh... What!? Present Attorney's Badge Trucy: Oh, I've seen one of those before! That's an attorney's badge. It looks just like the one Daddy used to have. Now if I take this badge... And do this, and this... See! It's gone! Apollo: H-Hey! My badge! What'd you do with my badge!? Trucy: No need to worry! Just look in your pocket! Apollo: Huh! No way... My pocket? (Wait a second... There's something in there!) ... It's a flyer for your agency! Trucy: And here's your badge. You can have it back now. Apollo: (That's the last time I let her touch anything of mine. Period.) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: OK... Which hospital is Mr. Wright in? I'll pay him a visit. Trucy: Oh, the Hickfield Clinic. It's quite close. Apollo: Right. Well, I'll be going now. And I'll, uh... give this showbiz gig some thought, OK? Trucy: Wait! I'll go with you! June 15, 9:45 AMHickfield Clinic Apollo: (So... this is Mr. Wright's hospital...) ???: Eh? Visitors are ya? Hrmm? Apollo: Uh, yeah. Are you the... doctor? Hickfield: Ayup. Dr. Hickfield's the name. Eh he he. Trucy: Good morning, Doctor! Hickfield: Oh, hiya there, Trucy. Cute as ever! Eh he he. Trucy: Is... this Daddy's room? Hickfield: Oh yah. 'Cept he's gone for a mornin' checkup. Be back soon. How're you, Miss Trucy? Got any places you'd like... examined? Eh heh... Phoenix: Doctor... the nurse was looking for you. Hickfield: Why, if it isn't the Daddy o' the cutest lil' thing in town! Hrm. Hrmm. Guess I'll be off then. Eh he? Later, Trucy. Apollo: Wow, what an odd bird that guy was. Phoenix: Good morning. Didn't expect you so soon, Apollo. Apollo: Mr. Wright... Examine Bottle Trucy: Aaaah! Daddy! You snuck some grape juice in again!? The doctor said you weren't supposed to drink that here! Phoenix: Trucy. Look at the label. Trucy: ... Oh. \"Deep Sea Mineral Water\". That's fine, I guess. Phoenix: I switched the labels. Don't tell Trucy, 'kay? Apollo: (What can I say, the man loves his grape juice.) DVD stack Apollo: A swaying, spiraling stack of DVD cases. \"The Steel Samurai\", \"The Nickel Samurai\"... \"The Pink Princess\", \"The Zappy Samurai: Electric Bugaboo\"... They're all children's action hero shows... Phoenix: This \"kid\" I know keeps sending them to me. Apollo: Huh. Like a niece or nephew? Phoenix: ...Something like that. Apollo: Quite the collection. This kid's parents must be really generous with their allowance. (Funny, Mr. Wright doesn't seem the type that kids would like.) Hospital bed Apollo: Mr. Wright's bed... It's really messy. Trucy: Look how messy this is! You're just hopeless without me, aren't you, Daddy? Apollo: (Yikes! She's attempting to clean up! Look out!) Phoenix: Ah ha ha. You got me. What can I say? I was raised in a barn. Try not to let word get out, Apollo. If you don't mind. Apollo: (Yeah, it might ruin your illustrious career pretending to play the piano.) Piano Apollo: This looks like a child's toy piano. Phoenix: Gotta practice. Wouldn't want my fingers to get stiff. A pro always keeps his weapon close at hand. Shall I play you a tune? Apollo: Uh... no thanks. Phoenix: Ah, how unfortunate. I so rarely get a chance to play. Television Apollo: What's that on TV? Looks like some sort of action hero show... Trucy: Oh, I know that one! That's the Sniffling Samurai! His \"Booger Flick\" attack is a big hit with the grade school crowd. Apollo: I had no idea you liked this kind of stuff, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Well, what else is there to do when you're stuck in bed? Besides, the episodes will just keep piling up if I don't keep up, you know? Apollo: Um... yeah. (Try not buying them.) Phoenix: Now's the only time I get to watch and write up my reports. Apollo: Your... reports? Phoenix: It's a long story. Like a lot of things, actually. Talk What happened? Apollo: So... what happened? Phoenix: ...Who could have imagined it? Me, victim of a hit and run... Apollo: A hit and... You were hit by a car!? Phoenix: Oh, he tried to swerve, I'll give him that. Picture me tossed thirty feet through the air... ...only stopping when my head hit that telephone pole. Apollo: You hit a telephone pole with your head!? Are you OK!? Phoenix: Thankfully, my only injury was a sprained ankle. Apollo: (He really is as lucky as they say...) About Trucy... Apollo: There's something that, well, it just doesn't sit right. I just can't believe you have a daughter, Mr. Wright! And... she's so big! Not fat, but, er, you know what I mean. Phoenix: Oh, Trucy's still a child. Trucy: Daddy! How many times do I have to remind you! I'm not a child anymore! Phoenix: Ah ha ha! But you'll always be Daddy's little baby girl to me, Trucy. Apollo: (Ah ha ha, my foot. I'm not buying it.) Phoenix: Oh, something you should know about Trucy... Apollo: She's a magician, right? She told me. Phoenix: Not a mere stage magician... She's a genius. Trucy: Tee hee! Aw, Daddy! Phoenix: You'll soon come to appreciate her \"talent\". Apollo: You could just tell me things instead of insinuating them. Wright Talent Agency Apollo: So, why did you contact me? What could the Wright Talent Agency possibly want with me? Phoenix: No need to get prickly, now. Apollo: Hey, I didn't ask to be dragged in like this! Trucy: Huh? But didn't you come into the office of your own free will anyway? Apollo: Well, yeah, of course. \"Help! We're in big trouble here at the office! Big!\" ...I thought someone was dying. Phoenix: So you don't think this is big trouble? My talent agency represents only two people... and one of them is in the hospital. Trucy: That's right, Daddy! How are we going to pay this month's rent!? And the groceries!? Phoenix: Yeah... That's the problem with such a tight operation. It's a symbiotic relationship. When one of us falls, the other, too, must fall... Apollo: Hey! This isn't exactly a suitable conversation to be having with a 15-year-old kid! Phoenix: In any case, if Apollo here can't help you... ...you'll have to transfer to a new school. Again. Trucy: No! I can't! I only just made friends... How could you do this to me... to us!? Polly! Apollo: Huh? What? Now it's my fault? Phoenix: On that note, how about you come work for us? I've got the perfect client for you already lined up. Apollo: A... A client? (You mean I get to do my job? I get to defend in court!?) ...Alright. I'll hear what you have to say. Trucy: You got him, Daddy! Hook, line, and sinker! Phoenix: Ah ha. Now it's time to reel him in! Apollo: (It's official: I'm scared.) Our client (appears after \"Wright Talent Agency\") Apollo: Alright, so who's the client? Phoenix: Ah, yes. Here, take a look at the map and I'll explain. Last night, I left the office just before nine o'clock... I was going to that Indochine pasta joint, Alden Tae's. I play piano there, of course. ...That's when it happened! The car sent me flying, nicked a telephone pole... ...and zoomed away. Creepy, huh? Apollo: Just a tad. It's almost as creepy as hearing you tell the story like it was no big deal. Phoenix: The car sped off in this direction... ...So, good luck! Apollo: ...Huh? Phoenix: You wanted a client, didn't you? Well, I'm your client! Find the guy who knocked me into that telephone pole! Apollo: Whoa, hold on! I'm a defense attorney, not a detective! Phoenix: Don't worry. Once you've found the guy, I intend to sue him. Then you can stick it to him in court! Apollo: ...I'm not a prosecutor either! I'm sorry, but... this is crazy. I'm going home. Phoenix: Don't get so worked up. It was just a joke. Apollo: Huh? Trucy: Oh, Daddy. Sorry, Apollo. He just loves jokes, you know. Even the ones that aren't very funny. Phoenix: Your real client should be stopping by the office any time now. Apollo: The office... You mean the talent agency? (No harm in going. It's not like I have anything else to do.) Phoenix: ...One more thing. Do look into my accident too, would you? I marked the scene of the tragedy on this map. It's right in front of this park. Should be easy to find. Apollo: (So, he's going to make me investigate this after all...) Map added to the Court Record. Our client (subsequent times) Apollo: Alright, so who's the client? Phoenix: Ah, yes. Here, take a look at the map and I'll explain. Last night, I left the office just before nine o'clock... I was going to that Indochine pasta joint, Alden Tae's. I play piano there, of course. ...That's when it happened! The car sent me flying, nicked a telephone pole... ...and zoomed away. Creepy, huh? Apollo: Just a tad. It's almost as creepy as hearing you tell the story like it was no big deal. Phoenix: The car sped off in this direction... ...So, good luck! Apollo: ...Huh? Phoenix: You wanted a client, didn't you? Well, I'm your client! Find the guy who knocked me into that telephone pole! Apollo: Whoa, hold on! I'm a defense attorney, not a detective! Phoenix: Don't worry. Once you've found the guy, I intend to sue him. Then you can stick it to him in court! Apollo: ...I'm not a prosecutor either! I'm sorry, but... this is crazy. I'm going home. Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: What's that? Looks strangely familiar... Apollo: How could you not recognize an attorney's badge!? Phoenix: It's been seven years. I've forgotten... a lot of things. Apollo: (I guess some seven years are longer than others.) Map Phoenix: I've marked the location of the accident on your map. Find the criminal who knocked me into that telephone pole! After clearing \"Our client\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic: June 15, 10:05 AMWright Talent Agency ???: Hey hey hey! How long you planning on making me wait, eh!? Trucy: Ah! Good morning! ???: Hey there, Trucy-doll. Sounds like your pops had a bit of a rough spot, eh? Trucy: All's well that ends well, I guess... Apollo: (This... is our client?) ???: Hey! So this is that Pollo fellow, eh? Apollo: Oh, uh, y-yes? (The name's \"Apollo\".) ???: Look at 'im there, arms all crossed-like. Ready to fight! Apollo: Yes, sir! ...You don't mean that literally, do you? ???: The boss told you what I need, right? Don't let me down now, Pollo! Apollo: Don't worry about your defense sir, I'm on it! ???: Defense...? Your noodle half-cooked? It's too late for defense! My castle's been stormed! My keep's been kept! My noodle stand's been stolen! Apollo: N-Noodle...? Trucy: You know Mr. Eldoon from the noodle stand, don'cha, Polly? Apollo: No nicknames, please. And no, of course I don't know him! ???: You new in these parts? Apollo: Not really... ???: Then you know the best noodles in town: Eldoon's Noodles! Apollo: Uh, whose noodles? ???: My noodles! Er, help me out here, Trucy-doll. Trucy: This is Mr. Guy Eldoon... our client! Maybe you can tell us what the problem is, Mr. Eldoon? Guy: Anything for you, Trucy-doll! Talk Who's this guy? Apollo: So... You run a noodle stand, Mr.... Guy: Eldoon. Guy Eldoon's the name! And noodles are my game. The secret's in the soup! I've been searching for the perfect soup for a year 'n' a half. Apollo: Oh. That's... not that long, really. Guy: My family's been noodle men for generations. Got a lot of expectation on my shoulders. Fifteen fathers passing the noodle to fifteen sons. Trucy: That's a pretty old noodle! Guy: Aye, and fool that I was, I pushed it away. I rebelled against my pops, and picked another livelihood. But... that didn't turn out so well. Apollo: Oh. Guy: There was no denying it... Salty broth runs through these veins, boy! Trucy: So, it was like destiny that you became what you are. Guy: Right, destiny's the word! Oh, I fought it... ...but in the end I was bound by the twisted noodle of fate! Apollo: (Not a mental image I care to linger on.) Guy: So, last year, I started my noodle stand. The 15th generation of Eldoon's Noodles! Eldoon's Noodles Apollo: Um... So tell me more about Eldoon's Noodles. Guy: You don't know the genius that are my noodles!? I make 'em so salty, why, they're saltier than... salt! Apollo: (Now I really don't want to find out.) Trucy: Daddy's a regular at his noodle stand. Guy: He frequented my pops's stand back during his attorney days, too. Yep, him and his assistant. Apollo: I'm sorry... I'll be sure to drop by your stand soon. Guy: Wish you could, sonny! Apollo: Eh? Guy: Heck, I wish I could! I'd give anything for a bowl 'bout now. Trucy: What do you mean? Guy: It was stolen! My stand! Gone! Apollo: Stolen...? Stolen stand (appears after \"Eldoon's Noodles\") Guy: It was last night... I was doing my rounds, blowin' my whistle. Trucy: It's like an ice-cream truck's bell but louder! He even gets complaints! Guy: Eh heh, now you're just trying to butter me up. Apollo: (That sounded more like the blues than a whistle...) Guy: I closed up my stand for the night and parked by the house. Then, this morning, dark 'n' early... It was gone! My keep! My castle! Oooooh! Apollo: Maybe some bum carted it off? ...Just guessing here. Guy: Well, I don't care who did it! Without that stand, I'm finished! All my noodle bowls were in there, too. Trucy: That's the saddest thing I've heard all day. Guy: You know it. Anyhows, that's the deal. Good luck! Apollo: Good... huh? Wait... What exactly is your request? Guy: My noodle stand! Find it! And the day you bring my baby back is the day you feast on as many noodles as you want! Course I make it so hot 'n' salty, two bowls'd kill a man. Then I'd really need defense! Apollo: Speaking of defense, that's what I do. I'm a lawyer. Not a detective... Guy: This is where I live, you drop by if you need any info, 'kay? Get it back today if you can, Pollo! I got noodles to make! Apollo: Things have certainly taken a turn for the bizarre. Traffic accidents... and noodle stand thieves. Trucy: Um, actually... There was something I wanted to ask you about, too, Apollo. Apollo: Huh? (I have a bad feeling about this.) Guy: Ah, listen to the lady's problem now. Don't be cruel! Trucy: I lost something last night. That is, something was stolen. Guy: Hey, what's this? More thieving and skullduggery!? Trucy: Well, um... Someone stole a pair of my panties. Apollo: ...Panties? Stolen stand (subsequent times) Guy: It was last night... I was doing my rounds, blowin' my whistle. Trucy: It's like an ice-cream truck's bell but louder! He even gets complaints! Guy: Eh heh, now you're just trying to butter me up. Apollo: (That sounded more like the blues than a whistle...) Guy: I closed up my stand for the night and parked by the house. Then, this morning, dark 'n' early... It was gone! My keep! My castle! Oooooh! Apollo: Maybe some bum carted it off? ...Just guessing here. Guy: Well, I don't care who did it! Without that stand, I'm finished! All my noodle bowls were in there, too. Trucy's request (appears after \"Stolen stand\") Leads to: \"Erm, so they were, um, stolen, your, er...\" Present Attorney's Badge Guy: Yee haw! Attaboy! Way to flash 'em! Ol' Phoenix used to do that to my pops all the time. Trucy: Your father...? Guy: Yup, he'd whip that bad boy out 'n' say \"Put it on my tab, you know I'm good for it.\" Apollo: (A tab at a noodle joint?) Anything else Guy: Sorry, fellah, but the only business I'm concerned with is my business. You gotta help me out! Get my business back! Apollo: Erm, so they were, um, stolen, your, er... Trucy: My panties, yes. Apollo: Ah, er, right. Panties. Guy: That's a cryin' shame, that is, Trucy-doll. Trucy: I was alone in the office last night. I had hung my panties out the window there to dry... ...when a thief came and took them! My favorite panties! I ran after him. \"Give those back!\" I shouted. \"Wait!\" Apollo: Well, that was certainly brave of you. Trucy: ...But I lost him. Without those panties, I don't know what I'll do... Guy: A darn cryin' shame, yup. Trucy: Well, at least the scene of the crime is convenient. I'll mark it on your map! Guy: I'll be headin' home now. Remember, find my stand or there's an empty bowl in yer future, Pollo! Apollo: Er, right. Guy: And you help out Trucy-doll here, too, y'hear? Trucy: Things have certainly picked up, haven't they! We had no work yesterday, and now we have three cases! Apollo: I... I guess. Trucy: Let's see where we stand! Apollo: (Not in a courtroom, that's where.) Well, the first item on our list... Trucy: Phoenix Wright... Daddy's hit and run accident. We have to find the one who hit him! Apollo: ...Who's going to pay us for this again? Trucy: And the second item... Mr. Eldoon's request.. to find his stolen stand. Apollo: For which we stand to gain... a bowl of salty noodles... Trucy: And the last request is mine! To find my stolen panties! Apollo: ...That bowl of noodles is looking better and better. Trucy: Let's go, Polly! To the streets! Apollo: Aren't you enthusiastic. Trucy: How could I not be!? Let's crack these cases, you and me! Apollo: (*sigh* Guess we might as well get started... Let's see. A hit and run... a stolen stand... And last but not least... stolen panties.) After clearing \"Our client\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic, then visiting Wright Talent Agency: June 15Hickfield Clinic Apollo: Huh? Mr. Wright's gone. Trucy: Maybe he's gone for an examination? Apollo: He'll probably be back soon. Let's wait. Trucy: I think it might take some time. Daddy always loves his examinations! Apollo: (Don't ask, Justice. You don't want to know.) Trucy: Why don't we come back later? Apollo: Yeah, I guess you're right. Examine Bottle Apollo: A bottle of Mr. Wright's favorite brand of grape juice. After that trial, I'll never drink grape juice again. Clearly not a problem for Mr. Wright, however. DVD stack Apollo: A swaying, spiraling stack of DVD cases. It looks ready to collapse. Better keep my distance. Hospital bed Apollo: Mr. Wright's bed. Wow, what a mess. Trucy must be in charge of cleaning at home. Piano Apollo: A small, children's piano. I guess the man likes pink. Television Apollo: The television's been left on... to an episode of the Steel Samurai. That's the same episode as before. Must be his favorite. Wright Talent Agency Talk Panty-snatcher Apollo: (Maybe I should ask her more about her... uh... This is going to be difficult--) Trucy: Apollo! Apollo: Yeah? Trucy: Your [sic] going to have to press me for information! Go ahead, do your worst! Apollo: Uh, no thanks, I pass. Trucy: You can't \"pass\"! This is your job! Look, I had hung them outside the window there to dry... ...when a thief came and took them! My favorite panties! I ran after him. \"Give those back!\" I shouted. \"Wait!\" ...But I lost him. I can't live without those panties! Please find them! Any leads? Apollo: Well? Do we have any leads? Trucy: Hmm... One moment... ... Allakazam! Allakazing! Apollo: (Whoa! Where'd all this evidence come from?) Trucy: ... Apollo: Um... So what happens next? Trucy: That's it! Pretty neat, huh? Apollo: ...Yeah. Neat. (*sigh*) Present Anything Trucy: What's that, Polly? Oh, I know! You want to see a magic trick! Well, you've come to the right girl! Watch as I make that evidence disappear, forever! Apollo: Whoa! No, don't! Sorry, my bad! June 15Accident Scene Apollo: So this is where Mr. Wright got hit by that car? Trucy: According to the map, this is the place! Apollo: What a huge mansion... (Changed from [What a huge mansion... Feels like Chinatown.] in the original release) Trucy: Apollo! There's a nice-looking lady over there. Let's question her! Apollo: Um, OK. (I'm a little curious about the park over there, too...) Trucy: Excuse me! Um, can we have a few words with you? ???: You want something? Apollo: (Whoa! That husky voice... Why am I suddenly sweating?) Trucy: That's quite a house you've got there! You must have a lot of money... ???: Whoooh. \"Money\" sounds like something my son would call his friends. This is the Kitaki Family mansion, little girl. Apollo: Eh. ???: You, kid with the hair. You want something? Apollo: Urk! M-M-Me? No, not a thing! Bye! Trucy: Apollo! We can't leave without questioning her! What if she knows something! Apollo: B-But th-the Kitaki Family...! (They're the biggest organized crime syndicate in town!) ???: If you're going to ask something, ask it. If you're man enough. Apollo: Waaaaugh! R-Right! Trucy: Yay! Way to whip him into shape, ma'am! Apollo: (Does she know no fear!?) Plum: I'm Plum. Plum Kitaki. Wife of the fourth head of the Kitaki Family business. Friends call me Little Plum. Apollo: I-I'm l-little Apollo Justice, attorney at law. *gulp* (If looks could kill, this woman would be a mass-murderer by now...) Examine Mansion front gate Trucy: Wow, what a big house! And the gate is so big... Apollo: The Kitaki Family is pretty big around these parts. Trucy: I like the fox! It's so cute! Plum: Ah, that. That's our family crest... from the old country. Trucy: Your family \"crest\"? Plum: We're clever as the fox... and our teeth are sharp. Trucy: So it's like a motto! You need a crest, too, Apollo! Ooh! How about the scales of justice? Or a lunar lander! Apollo: (...I'll pass, thanks.) Mansion gate wall Apollo: A brightly painted dragon. Why do I get the feeling he's glaring at me? Those paints must have been to repaint this wall. Plum: That's right. I called in an artist to do the job right. ...He's the third so far. Apollo: The... third? Plum: The first spilled paint all over the entrance here, the second on my kimono... So I... Apollo: N-No, don't tell me. It's better that I don't know. Spilled paint Apollo: There's paint splashed all over this gate. (What a mess...) Trucy: Was this paint knocked over by the car that hit my Daddy? Plum: That's right. Feh. And I'm left to clean up the mess. If you find whoever did this, bring the scoundrel by, would you? Trucy: Of course! Then you can make them clean up their own mess! Plum: Ah ha ha ha! You're cute. Naïve, but cute. When I find whoever did this, you can bet I'll be doing some \"cleaning\". There's nothing I dislike so much... as a mess. Trucy: Ooh! I wish I could say cool things like that! Plum: I'll bet you do! Wa ha ha ha ha!!! Apollo: (I'd laugh if my teeth weren't chattering so hard.) Talk The Kitakis Trucy: Little Plum? That's a really cute name for someone so... Plum: Yes...? Apollo: Wh-Whoa! Trucy: What is it, Apollo? Apollo: How about you go through me when talking to her, OK, Trucy? Trucy: Huh? That seems like a bit of a needless procedure. Apollo: I'm a lawyer. I live for needless procedures. Plum: Oh little girl, you should know... We're gangsters. Trucy: Gangst... Oh! That means you're the bad guys! Apollo: Trucy! Through me! Please! I'm begging you here! Plum: Wa ha ha ha ha!!! The bad guys... I like the sound of that! Apollo: (...I'm going to need some warm tea after this.) Plum: It takes a lot of hard work to protect a family fortune. Things aren't as easy as they used to be for us \"bad guys\". Trucy: So, you're saying that business is in a slump? Apollo: (Let's not ask about \"business if we can help it, please?) Last night's accident Apollo: So, there was supposedly a car accident here last night. (Changed from [There was a car accident here last night?] in the original release) Plum: Last night... Apollo: Of c-course you wouldn't know about it! S-Sorry to bother you! Plum: Wait. Apollo: Y-Yes? Plum: You're talking about that man, aren't you? The one who flew thirty feet and just walked away? Trucy: That's my daddy! Plum: Ah ha ha! I should've known! One of our Capos thought he'd make a great point man... Trucy: Capo? Point man...? Apollo: Um, could you avoid using too much, er, industry lingo? Plum: In any case, it's been nothing but trouble. I've been cleaning up this mess since morning! Bah! Apollo: Cleaning up this... paint? Splattered paint (appears after \"Last night's accident\") Apollo: Was this paint spilled at the time of the accident? Plum: It was around 9 last night. I heard a crashing noise... ...and found your father drowning in a sea of paint. Trucy: So you came to his rescue? Plum: You've my husband... the Boss to thank for that. The car that hit your father knocked over this paint... ...then turned the corner, and sped away. We're in the middle of repainting our wall, you see. Apollo: (I'm sure that dragon is glaring at me.) Trucy: But, why are you out here cleaning it up? Plum: What do you mean? Trucy: I mean, aren't you a gangster? Don't you have any \"goons\" to do your dirty work for you? Apollo: Please! Go through me when you want to... Plum: Wa ha ha ha ha!!! Don't be such a stiff, lawyer-boy. I suppose we gangsters do have a certain image... Apollo: Urm, yes. Plum: But we're community-oriented gangsters, you see. ...The Boss likes to give back to the people, see? Apollo: (How noble of him...) Plum: I availed myself of the public facilities to get rid of all the garbage... Now there's just the paint on the street to deal with. Apollo: (Public facilities...? I wonder if she means that trash can...) Present Anything Plum: Sorry, kid. I got no idea what you're talking about. After switching to right side view: Apollo: Who's that!? She's looking at the park. Trucy: She's pretty. I bet she has a story, you know? Apollo: (There is something about her... Too bad she seems to be in a bit of a rush.) Examine Old lady Apollo: ...Looks like there's some trouble by the park gate. Trucy: I smell an incident! Officer: Ma'am! There's no entry to the park! Old Lady: Now don't you tell me where I can't go, young fella! I always walk through this park on my way home! Officer: Please, get down from there! You'll hurt yourself, ma'am! Apollo: (That's quite the determined old lady.) People Park sign Apollo: People Park... Huh, kind of an odd name for such an empty place. Trucy: I wonder why it's named that? Hey! There's something written on the gate post... Apollo: Huh? Oh yeah... It says, \"Donated by Big Wins Kitaki\". Trucy: You mean the Kitaki Family built this park? It's so nice of them to give to the community like that! Apollo: ...Let's not get too friendly with them, shall we? (A gangster building a park...? Odd move for a crime boss.) Police officer below People Park sign Apollo: Personally, I'm a little more interested in this park. Trucy: You know what I think? I bet they're filming a movie. Let's go take a look! Maybe we'll see someone famous! Officer: Hey, Miss! Stay out of the park! Trucy: ...He got mad at me. Apollo: Um, did something happen here, officer? Officer: Huh? Uh, no, move along, nothing to see. Why don't you kids go play someplace else? Apollo: We're not kids and we're not playing! I'm an attorney! ???: ...Something wrong? Officer: Ah, Detective Skye! We're fine ma'am, nothing to report! Apollo: (Detective...?) Trucy: Why's she wearing a lab coat? Apollo: You're hardly one to comment on how people are dressed. ???: And... these kids are? Officer: Curiosity seekers, ma'am. They claim to be \"lawyers\". ???: Ah. Why don't you kids run along and play someplace else? Apollo: Look, we're not... ???: Or I might spill something on that pretty face of yours. Want a dose of experimental Hydroxyacelunodosetrase? Trucy: ...Come again? What's Hydroxy... stuff? Apollo: Whatever it is, it doesn't sound good. Let's go, Trucy! ???: Try to keep out the riff-raff, if you would. Officer: Yes ma'am! Apollo: Grr... How are we going to get more information like this? Trucy: Why don't we ask that nice woman across the street? Apollo: (Oh yes, that nice woman... *gulp*) Police officer below People Park sign (subsequent times) Apollo: I gotta say, I'd really like to know what happened here... Officer: Hey, I said no one goes in! Unless you want a face-full of hydroxyadayadawhatzit! Apollo: (Hmm... No dice.) Trash can Apollo: There's a big trash can on the way into the park. I guess we could check it out... Trucy: A detective's life sure is a hard one! Apollo: I'm an attorney, actua... Huh? Trucy: Hmm. Two pieces of garbage with paint on them. Apollo: These... are slippers. They look like those slippers you get at the hospital... Trucy: Look at this, Apollo! Doesn't this go on a car...? Apollo: It's a side-view mirror! Looks like it was torn off when it smacked into something... or someone. Trucy: Wait, you don't think... Apollo: I do. This could be from the car that hit Mr. Wright! Trucy: Wow, and he took off its mirror? I never knew Daddy was so strong. I only have room in my pocket for one of these, though. Which do you want to take? Slippers Slippers crammed into pocket. Leads back to examination Mirror Mirror slipped into pocket. Leads back to examination Trash can (subsequent times, if Slippers is added to the Court Record) Apollo: There's a side-view mirror with some paint on it in this trash can. Trucy: I can only carry one thing at a time in my pocket, you know. Apollo: (Should I swap the slippers for the mirror?) Swap Apollo: Sure, let's swap the evidence. Trucy, if you would. Trucy: I'm on it! Mirror slipped into pocket. Leads back to examination No need Apollo: ...On second thought, let's not and say we did. Leads back to examination Trash can (subsequent times, if Mirror is added to the Court Record) Apollo: There's some paint on the slippers in this trash can. Trucy: I can only carry one thing at a time in my pocket, you know. Apollo: (Should I swap the mirror for the slippers?) Swap Apollo: Sure, let's swap the evidence. Trucy, if you would. Trucy: Right-o! Slippers crammed into pocket. Leads back to examination No need Apollo: Actually... let's not and say we did. Leads back to examination Talk People Park (appears after examining police officer below People Park sign) Apollo: ...Can I ask you a question? Plum: What? Apollo: ...What happened in the park across the street? Plum: Oh, yes, quite the commotion. \"Chicago Lightning\", as the Boss would say. Trucy: Chicago... huh? Plum: Gunfire. Someone was killed. Strange circumstances, too. Apollo: You're kidding! Plum: What a morning! Trouble everywhere. The park, the gate, even our house... Trucy: Did something happen at your house, too? Plum: A crime without honor! Without remorse! It's a private matter... Wanna hear about it? Trucy: Somehow I don't think \"no\" is an acceptable answer, Polly. A private matter (appears after \"People Park\") Apollo: So... what happened at your house? Plum: Bloomers. Last night. Apollo: Eh. (I got a bad feeling about this...) Plum: Me, Little Plum Kitaki, the victim of a panty-snatcher! Trucy: Whaaaaaaat? So it wasn't just my panties that were stolen!? Plum: Got you too, did they? Poor thing. Like I said, whoever did this is a hardened criminal. It wasn't you, was it!? Apollo: N-No! Of course not! Mercy! Plum: I've heard word that panties have been disappearing lately. ...And the missing panties all have something in common. Apollo: (It's hard to imagine Trucy's and Mrs. Kitaki's panties having much in common... I just imagined Mrs. Kitaki's panties... *gulp*) Trucy: I know! We'll find your bloomers, too! Plum: Great! Show me what you're made of. Apollo: (What have you gotten me into this time, Trucy?) Present Mirror Apollo: Can you tell me anything about this mirror? Plum: That's probably from the car that knocked that fellow across the street. Apollo: (Right! That makes this a valuable clue!) Plum: Let me know if you find that car, would you? You splash Kitaki paint, you pay the price. Examine evidence Slippers Toeprint Apollo: Huh? This spot here is black. Trucy: I wonder what that is...? It doesn't look like paint... Leaf indentation on paint on left sole Trucy: The bottom is covered with paint! Apollo: Huh? What's this weird shape here? Trucy: It looks like a leaf was stuck to the bottom when the wearer stepped in some yellow paint. Apollo: So the outline was left when the leaf was removed! Ack! I got paint on my hand! Trucy: ...... Apollo! I saw you try to wipe your hand on my cape! Mirror Severed wires Trucy: It's cut clean off! I wonder what's in there...? Apollo: Don't. There are bare wires hanging out. Trucy: Let's see... Zzzzzzaaaaap! Eeek! Apollo: Wha--!? A-Are you OK!? Trucy: Hee hee! Just a little joke! Apollo: ...... Don't scare me like that! Trucy: You mean, don't \"shock\" you? Zzzzzzaaaaap! Hee hee! After clearing all Talk options: ???: ... Apollo: (...That girl from before!) Plum: Oh! Welcome home, sweetie. ???: Ah, uh... hello, m-mother. Apollo: (She's a Kitaki, too!?) Trucy: Uh, um, Miss! Miss! ???: ...? Trucy: Here, our flyer. ???: The... Wright Anything Agency? Apollo: A-Anything Agency? Trucy: Yeah! Do you like the new flyer? So, um, this is our defense attorney, Mr. Apollo Justice! ???: Attorney...? Trucy: Drop by our office! We'll be waiting! ???: Ah... Good-bye. Apollo: Why did you give her our flyer? Trucy: I dunno. She seemed like she could use some help. Apollo: She's the heiress to a gangster dynasty! She doesn't need our help! Trucy: ...I wouldn't be so sure! Apollo: ...? June 15Scene of the Stand Theft Apollo: So... what's this place? Trucy: This would be Mr. Eldoon's house, silly. Apollo: Oh, so this is where his stand was stolen from. I can see a piece of evidence lying on the ground already. Trucy: ...Hey! Look, there's a police car parked over there. Apollo: You're right... What's with the sparkly... entrance? What is this place? A hospital? There's a sign... \"Meraktis Clinic\". Trucy: Hmm... Oh! That's where the thief went! Apollo: The thief...? Trucy: The one who snatched my panties! He ran into this clinic last night! Wait, maybe that police car is here to find my panties! Apollo: I doubt it. Trucy: Well, there's only one way to be sure! Let's investigate! Guy: Ah, there you are, sonny! Well, you find anything yet!? Apollo: Er, um, no. Not yet. Guy: The longer you loaf around here the saltier your victory bowl gets, just remember that! Apollo: (This bowl of noodles is sounding less like payment and more like punishment...) Examine Clinic front door Trucy: That doorway sure is sparkly! Apollo: The \"Meraktis Clinic\", huh. Looks more like a casino parlor than a hospital. They must be quite profitable. Trucy: Funny, it looks closed. Maybe they're on vacation today? Green banner Apollo: Looks like they have a special offer going on... Trucy: \"Three shots for the price of one!\" Ooh, now's our chance, Apollo! Apollo: Chance for what!? I don't need any shots, thank you. Whoever runs this clinic, they seem pretty business-minded. Police car Apollo: I'd understand if there was an ambulance outside... But a police car? Trucy: Maybe they're tax evaders! Officer: Ah, sorry miss. No going into the clinic today. Trucy: Did something happen? Officer: Huh? Oh, no. Nothing to see here. Move along. You'll have to find someplace else to play doctor. Apollo: (Do we look like the right age to be playing doctor!?) We need a little more info on this Meraktis Clinic. Trucy: We could ask Mr. Eldoon. He is their neighbor and all. And we should check out that garage! What if the thief who stole my panties is still in there!? Apollo: ...*sigh* Blue tarp Guy: That's the place! Right there! That's where I kept my stand. Covered all nice 'n' purty with that blue tarp there! Apollo: So you used this plastic sheet to cover your stand at night? ...I see. Trucy: You see? What? Did you figure out why it was stolen!? Apollo: Well no, but it does suggest that the thief knew what he or she was looking for. They clearly knew what was under that sheet. Guy: So it wasn't one of those casual drive-by stand snatchers, you mean? Not bad, sonny-boy. Not bad at all! Bowl Apollo: Is this yours, Mr. Eldoon? Guy: Hey! That there's the heart and soul of Eldoon's Noodles! The bowl absorbs my salty soup... Pretty soon it's gonna taste just like noodles! Trucy: Wow! It does smell like noodles! Guy: All my other bowls got taken away with my stand! Get it back for me, sonny-boy, I'm beggin' ya! Bowl added to the Court Record. Bowl (subsequent times) Apollo: Is this yours, Mr. Eldoon? Guy: Hey! That there's the heart and soul of Eldoon's Noodles! The bowl absorbs my salty soup... Pretty soon it's gonna taste just like noodles! Trucy: Wow! It does smell like noodles! Guy: All my other bowls got taken away with my stand! Get it back for me, sonny-boy, I'm beggin' ya! House Trucy: This house is... well, it's old! Guy: It's been well-loved, that's for sure. I've lived here with my wife for many years now. It's got character, though, just like my soup! Apollo: (I always thought character was a positive thing.) \"NOO\" sign Apollo: ...That's quite a sign. I take it that's \"NOO\" as opposed to \"OLD\"? Guy: Ah, you like it? Made it myself, I did. I meant to write \"Noodles\" but ran outta space. Trucy: Prior planning prevents poor performance! Guy: Lucky for me it spells a word all by itself! And spruces up my image, it does! Apollo: (It does have a certain power of willful denial thing going for it.) Oil drum Apollo: It looks like the oil drum is connected to that sink over there... Trucy: Collecting rainwater to do the dishes! How environmentally conscious! Apollo: You... don't think he uses rainwater to cook his noodles and to make the broth, do you? Trucy: Oh I'm sure he finds the best water money can buy! Taste is his business, you know. Look, that sign over there! \"Eldoon's only uses water from all-natural sources!\" Apollo: ... (I think I'll take a rain check on eating here.) Sign under oil drum Apollo: There's a hand-written sign here... \"Save the light!\" Trucy: \"Save the light!\" indeed! Mr. Eldoon's house is practically in the dark here! Apollo: I guess the hospital clinic next door blocks the sunlight. Guy: Everything's gone wrong since they built this monstrosity! Broth needs sun or it rots! What's a man to do? They just want my customers to get food poisoning so they can turn a pretty profit... Apollo: (That seems like a lot of trouble to go through for a few extra patients...) Dog Trucy: Look! A doggy! Good boy, good boy, Salty! Apollo: I'm sure the dog has a real name, Trucy. Guy: Yup, sure does! Name's Spoon. And it's a she, by the way. Trucy: Spoon doesn't seem so lively. Guy: She didn't get her bowl of salty broth this mornin', that's why. Poor lil' thing. *sniff* Trucy: Apollo! Let's find that stand soon! For Spoon's sake! Apollo: (I'm pretty sure dogs aren't supposed to eat noodles...) Talk Eldoon's Noodles Apollo: So, your stand... \"Eldoon's Noodles\", was it? Guy: Aye! Passed down from father to son. That stand's seen its share o' salt, mmm-hmm. Salt runs in the family, you might say. Apollo: (I bet high blood pressure does too.) So... your stand, Eldoon's Noodles, was stolen... Guy: Oh, it wasn't just the stand that was stolen, sonny-boy! I lost those wobbly wheels, my salt-crusted stewpot, my stained sign... I didn't just lose a stand, I lost a legend! Trucy: No one steals a legend and gets away with it on my watch! Let's find that legend, Apollo! Apollo: (Isn't it about time he bought a new one anyway?) Stolen stand Apollo: Are there any more details you could give me about the stand? Guy: You bet, sonny-boy! It happened last night... I was blowing my whistle like always, crying the town, I was. The smell of broth filled the streets... thick 'n' salty. I got home, well, right before 10 PM, I reckon. Apollo: (Guess he's not aiming for that late-night market.) Guy: I washed my bowls and gave the wheels a squirt of grease. Then I went inside. Apollo: When did you notice it had been stolen? Guy: Early this morning. Before the sun rose. Work starts early! Apollo: (Do that many people eat noodles for breakfast!?) Guy: I'm washed up on the salty shores of ruination! That stand had my whole life in it... nay, my whole being! Trucy: They took everything? Guy: All my soup stock, my noodles, my bowls... and my dreams! Trucy: At least they left one bowl. Look, there, on the ground. Guy: If you don't find that stand today... Then I'll be forced to walk the streets, peddling that bowl... my last bowl. Apollo: Please, I'm under enough pressure here as it is. The garage Trucy: That's it! That's where the thief who snatched my panties ran to! Guy: It's a crying shame, that is. If they have to steal, make it my loincloth! Not some pretty girl's panties! Apollo: The garage, right. You don't think the thief lives here, do you? Guy: Feh! I wouldn't put it past that good-for-nothing doctor! Apollo: (Hmm... Do I detect a little animosity here?) Trucy: Let's make sure to check out that garage thoroughly! Meraktis Clinic (appears after examining police car) Trucy: Hey, do you think something happened next door? There's a police car out front... Guy: Feh! Probably gave someone food poisoning, I'll bet! Apollo: (If anyone's at risk of giving someone food poisoning...) Guy: That police car got here this mornin', actually. I asked what they were up to, but they wouldn't even tell me, the neighbor! Feh! Trucy: Hmm... Guy: Not that I was surprised much. That doctor works for the wrong crowd. It was just a matter of time 'fore he got what was coming to him. Feh! Apollo: The \"wrong crowd\"...? Guy: ...Never you mind about that. Present Bowl Guy: You can tell my bowls by the Mr. Salty logo! Trucy: The mascot of Eldoon's Noodles! Guy: They come to the stand, they sit, they drink deep from that bowl... ...and when they see the  bottom, their face looks jus' like Mr. Salty's! Genius, no!? Trucy: Very high-concept. Guy: You can't ply a trade if you don't love the tools. Remember that! Trucy: Yes sir! Apollo: (Trucy has a thing for professionals, clearly.) Anything else Guy: Sorry, sonny-boy. My interest is for my stand and precious little else. Get cracking on that case! Find my stand, I'm beggin' ya! Examine evidence Bowl Inside of bowl Trucy: It's the Eldoon's Noodle's mascot! Mr. Salty! He's so cute! Apollo: It's not a very endearing mascot, is it? Trucy: You know... Come to think of it... ...It looks a lot like you, Apollo. Especially the red parts. Apollo: Can I help if I like red? Bottom of bowl Trucy: Ooh, look! I love these little personal touches! Apollo: Seems a shame to hide it on the bottom of the bowl. ...Huh? When I touched it the paint flaked off. Trucy: He must have painted it on by hand with warm, professional care! Apollo: After buying the cheapest paint he could find with cold professional thrift. June 15Meraktis ClinicGarage Trucy: This is the place! This is where that panty-snatcher ran! Apollo: Are you sure? Trucy: Maybe! Let's look for clues! Clues... to a panty-snatching! Clues... like a pair of panties! Apollo: ...Um, Trucy? Could you try not saying \"panties\" so many times? Examine Car Apollo: There's something about this car... Trucy: Let's take a closer look! Cell phone Apollo: Look... a cell phone. Trucy: Someone dropped it beneath this tire! If the car moved, it would be crushed for sure! Apollo: Hmm... I wonder if it belongs to the doctor here? Trucy: We should bring it to him later! Cell Phone added to the Court Record. Stub on driver's door Trucy: Hey! Look at that! Apollo: The mirror's been broken off! (Now THIS is a clue!) Trucy: What!? You're smiling like you know something I don't... You aren't keeping a clue from me, are you, Polly? Apollo: (A clue? Let's see...) Show evidence Apollo: I think I do have just the clue you've got in mind... Present Mirror Apollo: Apollo: My clue is... this! Trucy: Whoa! It's the same color and size and everything! A perfect match! Apollo: I guess we could check it out... Trucy: Hmm. Two pieces of garbage with paint on them. Look at this, Apollo! Doesn't this go on a car...? Apollo: It's a side-view mirror! Looks like it was torn off when it smacked into something... or someone. Apollo: Well... looks like we've just solved a case. Trucy: So the car that hit Daddy last night... Apollo: ...Is sitting right in front of us, yep. Trucy: Wow. You put the \"pro\" in \"professional\", Apollo! Apollo: Gee, thanks, Trucy. Leads back to examination Present anything else Apollo: Trucy: ... That's your clue? Sorry, but that leaves me feeling kind of... clueless. Apollo: (Like father like daughter with the humor, apparently.) Trucy: There's no need to bluff here, Apollo! Save that for the court! Apollo: (Thanks for the advice...) Leads back to examination No evidence Apollo: Hmm. Not that I can think of. Trucy: No? Then what were you smiling about? Apollo: Oh, I wasn't smiling. It was the dust in here. I thought I was going to sneeze... Ah... ah... ah... WAACHOOO! Trucy: Well, don't make faces that ah... AH-CHOO! ...are so misleading then. Apollo: (I know yawns are contagious, but sneezes...?) Trucy: Mmm. Well, I'm sure there's gotta be a clue somewhere! Let's keep checking things out! Leads back to examination Stub on driver's door (after correctly presenting Mirror) Apollo: This mirror fits this car door perfectly... Trucy: So the car that hit Daddy last night... Apollo: ...Is sitting right in front of us, yep. Trucy: Wow. You put the \"pro\" in \"professional\", Apollo! Tailpipe (before examining cell phone and stub on driver's door) Apollo: That reminds me... I once read a record of a case that Mr. Wright worked on many years ago. Trucy: ...? Apollo: Apparently, there was this car with a piece of cloth shoved into the tailpipe! That piece of cloth turned out to be a vital clue to solving the case! Trucy: Wow! Apollo: I remember that case record whenever I'm checking out a car... And I always check the tailpipe! Trucy: Everyone's gotta have a hobby, I guess. Apollo: Wouldn't it be funny if... ...Hey! There's something in there! Trucy: What!? Apollo: W-Wait a second... Are these your... Trucy: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! My panties!!! Apollo: Whaaaat!? Already!? Trucy: Wow, thank you, Apollo! You're a genius! Amazing! Apollo: No, no, really, don't mention it. Trucy: No, I'm serious, I'm really impressed! You must have a nose for finding girls' panties! Apollo: ... Um, what are those? Trucy: My little panties, of course! They've come home to mama! I can't wait to use them! Apollo: Y-You're going to put them on? N-Now!? Trucy: Watch closely now... See? Nothing in the panties... ...Ta-da!!! Apollo: Whoa! Wh-Where'd that come from!? How did that bowl get in your panties!? Trucy: My panties are an extra-dimensional space... Anything can fit in there! ...They're my Magic Panties! It's one of my best tricks. Apollo: Magic... panties? Trucy: They love them over at the Wonder Bar. I do shows there nightly. Apollo: ...You mean those panties are a prop!? You could have told me a little sooner! Trucy's Panties put discreetly away in Trucy's pocket. Apollo: Well, that's once case closed, at least. Trucy: What are you saying!? We still have to catch the sly devil that ran off with the tool of my trade! Apollo: Oh, right. (Something tells me we're not finished searching this garage, anyway...) Tailpipe (after examining cell phone and stub on driver's door) Apollo: That reminds me... I once read a record of a case that Mr. Wright worked on many years ago. Trucy: ...?

Trucy: What are you saying!? We still have to catch the sly devil that ran off with the tool of my trade! Apollo: Oh, right. Tailpipe (subsequent times, before examining cell phone and stub on driver's door) Apollo: Still, I'm glad. If I hadn't picked up that habit of looking up tailpipes... ...I might never have seen your panties. I mean, found your panties. Magic panties. Trucy: I know, it was amazing how you slyly peeked up there! I think you have a successful career in peeking up tailpipes ahead of you! Apollo: (I'm so glad all of this makes sense in context.) Trucy: You gotta wonder why my panties were here, though. Apollo: That is a mystery... (Something tells me we're not finished searching this garage, anyway...) Tailpipe (subsequent times, after examining cell phone and stub on driver's door) Apollo: Still, I'm glad.

Trucy: You gotta wonder why my panties were here, though. Apollo: That is a mystery... Cat Trucy: Hey! A kitty-cat! Here, kitty kitty kitty. Meow. Trucy: ...It's not coming down. Apollo: We do look kind of suspicious, you have to admit. Trucy: It's OK kitty-cat! His hair won't hurt you! Apollo: It's OK kitty-cat! She won't make you disappear in her hat! (Step)ladder Apollo: Look, it's a folding ladder. Trucy: Polly! That's called a \"stepladder\"! C'mon! Apollo: ...A stepladder? How is that different from a regular ladder then? Trucy: It's a much more complex piece of machinery. It's like two ladders stuck together! Apollo: ...So you admit that basically it's a ladder, right? Trucy: Wait... Huh? Apollo: You have to look past the form... at the essence of the thing. Trucy: Er... Can we talk about something else? Skeleton Trucy: Eeeeeeek! Someone's there! ... Oh, it's just a gold-painted human skeleton. Apollo: (Just a human skeleton!? ...And painted gold?) Trucy: There's a mannequin hand waving to us from the box behind the skeleton. This place just screams \"hospital storage\", don't you think? Apollo: It screams something, that's for sure. Examine evidence Cell Phone Strap Trucy: Look at this cute little watch-strap! I want one! Apollo: ...It's kind of odd, though. Trucy: What is? Apollo: I mean, if you wanted to know the time, you could just look at the phone itself. Trucy: Hey, you're right! Sharp, Apollo! Apollo: Th-Thanks. (Finally, some respect!) Trucy: So, what does that tell you? Apollo: Well, the owner of this phone doesn't think through the details, for one. Trucy: They did drop their phone, after all. I kinda figured they were a little spacey already. Apollo: Oh... good point. Trucy's Panties Ribbon Apollo: ...... Trucy: Something the matter? Apollo: Uh... I was just wondering if there was, like, a switch on these... Trucy: Of course not! Apollo: ...Huh. Mysterious. Trucy: Oh? Do you want to know the secret of my panties? Apollo: Ack! N-No! No thanks! (Who uses magic panties in a stage show anyway...?) After examining cell phone and tailpipe and correctly presenting Mirror upon examining stub on driver's door: Trucy: Apollo! Apollo: Huh? What is it? Trucy: Now that we've solved this case, we should go report to Daddy! He'll mope if we leave him alone too long, knowing him. Apollo: Um, OK. ...He doesn't seem the type to mope, though. (And this is hardly a case worth reporting...) Examine Car Apollo: This car belongs to someone at the Meraktis Clinic... and it hit Mr. Wright. Mr. Wright sprained his ankle, and the car lost a side-view mirror. This car vs. Mr. Wright... Not quite the match of the century. Wright Anything Agency Talk Panty-snatcher (after Trucy's Panties is added to the Court Record) Trucy: What, you want to see them again? Well, if you must... Apollo: No no no, I'm fine, really. Let's just put them away, shall we? Case closed. Trucy: What are you talking about!? The case isn't closed until we have our thief! Just find him on the side while you work on the other cases! Apollo: If it were that easy we wouldn't need the police. Trucy: If we don't need the police... then we don't need defense attorneys, either, right? Apollo: (Fine, fine. I'll look for your panty-snatcher...) Present Trucy's Panties Trucy: I'm so glad we found my panties! Apollo: I had no idea they were so important to you. Trucy: And in time for tonight's show, too! A lot of people come just to see my panties, you know! Apollo: You... might not want to advertise it like that. Trucy: ? Kitaki Mansion Examine Trash can (after Mirror is updated in the Court Record) Apollo: There's a big waste basket by the park entrance. Trucy: ...? You aren't going to search through the trash? Apollo: I don't think we need to. Trucy: Oh, no, please, knock yourself out. Don't mind me, I'll be waiting over here. Apollo: Just so we're clear, searching through trash isn't a hobby of mine, OK? Present Mirror (after Mirror is updated in the Court Record) Apollo: I found out who this mirror belongs to. Plum: Ooh. You're tougher than you look. Spit it out. Who was it? Where do they live? Apollo: Urk! I j-just forgot! Heh! Trucy: I remember, Apollo! It was the Meraktis Clinic! Apollo: Shhhh! Trucy: Why? I'm right, aren't I? Plum: ...Meraktis, eh? Apollo: Um, yes. (Why's she so quiet all of a sudden?) ... Is something wrong? Plum: Erm, no. Pay me no mind. And thanks for the info. After clearing all Talk options in Accident Scene, clearing all Talk options and examining bowl in Scene of the Stand Theft, and examining cell phone and tailpipe and correctly presenting Mirror upon examining stub on driver's door in Meraktis Clinic - Garage: June 15Hickfield Clinic Phoenix: Yo! How goes it? Trucy: Daddy! How do you feel? Phoenix: Not bad, Trucy, not bad. It's good to have you young'uns on the case. Lets ol' Daddy-o get some well-deserved R&R. Trucy: The elderly need their rest! Apollo: (Uh... isn't he only 33?) ...Um, we've cleared up most of the cases... Phoenix: I was right about you. Competent. Capable. Tell me what you found out. If you want to. Apollo: (Your enthusiasm is over-whelming...) Talk Progress report Phoenix: Well, I certainly didn't expect you back this early. Trucy: Polly's amazing! He found my panties so quick! Almost like he was the one who stole them! Apollo: ...You have an interesting concept of praise. Phoenix: ...And? Did you find the mad driver who gave me that 30-foot toss? Apollo: Apparently... it was a doctor. From the Meraktis Clinic. Phoenix: Hmm... Meraktis, eh? I've heard of him. Nothing good, mind you. Apollo: That reminds me, a police car was parked outside the clinic. Trucy: Maybe something happened? Apollo: What is this Meraktis Clinic anyway? Meraktis Clinic Phoenix: All I've heard are the rumors. That clinic's been making good money... in a bad way. Apollo: Bad...? Phoenix: Ties to organized crime... The Kentucky Family. Apollo: Um... the Kitaki Family? (He did that on purpose!) Phoenix: Some injuries you can't take to a public hospital, see. They use the Meraktis Clinic for their patch-up jobs. Apollo: Interesting... People Park Trucy: It looked like something had happened in that park. Phoenix: Ah. A body was found there in unusual circumstances... Apollo: Something more unusual than being dead? Phoenix: ...It's not our concern, in any case. Trucy: Right! Let's ignore that and find that noodle stand! Apollo: (What ever happened to professional curiosity?) Present Mirror Phoenix: So this was the thing that led you to the car. Apollo: Yes, sir! The mirror you knocked off was just the clue we needed! Phoenix: Good work, Apollo. Of course you might say... ...I was the one who made solving that case possible. Apollo: (...You don't get points for knocking off a car mirror.) Trucy's Panties Trucy: Look! My panties! They came home to mama! Phoenix: Thanks, Apollo. I was worried about them, too. Trucy special ordered those... Apollo: (A startling display of parental concern!) Phoenix: I'd hate to have to buy a  new pair... *shudder* Apollo: (Make that a not-so-startling display of cheapskatedness.) Anything else Phoenix: ... Apollo: (It's actually a relief to be so thoroughly ignored.) After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: ...Thanks, really. If I get tired of sleeping, maybe I'll head down to this Meraktis place. Maybe hit 'em up for some reparations... A little legal action would do me some good. Apollo: Um... I was wondering when I get paid? We solved the case of your accident, and um, found a missing article of clothing. Trucy: My panties! Phoenix: That leaves the noodle stand. Apollo: Eh. Phoenix: Feel free to drop in if you get stuck. I'd be happy to help with anything not involving money. Apollo: (Good-bye, quid pro quo. Hello pro bono. *sigh*) Trucy: Right! Back to the office to plan our next move! After clearing all Talk options in Accident Scene, clearing all Talk options and examining bowl in Scene of the Stand Theft, and examining cell phone and tailpipe and correctly presenting Mirror upon examining stub on driver's door in Meraktis Clinic - Garage: June 15Kitaki Mansion Trucy: Little Plum's not here. She's not finished cleaning, huh. Apollo: Maybe she went to get a paint scraper? Plum: OK! Who's the wise guy who spit gum out on the street!? Apollo: (Her voice carries all the way out to the street from inside the mansion...) Trucy: She's a neat freak! How cute! Plum: You there! It was you, wasn't it!? Fess up! I hope you've said your prayers. You're gonna need them... Apollo: Tr-Trucy? Let's leave. Now. Trucy: ...? Examine Mansion front gate Apollo: An impressive gate befitting the Kitaki Mansion. Trucy: Look at the name plate! \"Kitaki\"...! That's so cool! Short and blunt, like any good gangster! Ooh! Let's change our name! How about... \"W. A. A.\"! ... Maybe that's too short and blunt. What do you think? Apollo: No comment. Mansion gate wall Apollo: A colorful dragon turns its baleful gaze in my direction. As if to say, \"Abandon all hope ye who enter here.\" Don't worry, Mr. Dragon. Me and hope haven't been on speaking terms for a while. Spilled paint Apollo: Several colors of paint have been splashed across the gate. It's almost all dry. This is going to be tough to clean. Old lady Apollo: It looks like that woman's still causing trouble... Officer: Look, no one goes in! That means you! Old Lady: Oh, what's the difference? Let... me... go! Ow! Ow ow ow ow ow ow!!! Officer: Ah! S-Sorry! Old Lady: That's it, I'm suing! ...But I might change my mind for five bucks... Apollo: (What is she, some kind of con artist?) People Park sign Apollo: Apparently, this park was the gift of the Kitaki Family. The friendly \"People Park\", brought to you by organized crime... A very naughty part of me is tempted to write \"We Kill\" on the left side of the sign. Police officer below People Park sign Apollo: They're not letting anyone into the crime scene. The guard at the entrance is humming a song. He's got rhythm, actually. Maybe he plays in a band. June 15Wright Anything Agency Apollo: You... You're the woman from the Kitaki place! ???: Y-Yes... Trucy: I knew it! Something's the matter and you want our help, right? Well, you've come to the Wright place! This way, please... ???: Um... Thank you. Alita: My name is Alita Tiala. I... have a request. Talk Your request Apollo: Your request... let me guess, something's been stolen? Alita: Um, your flyer... It says \"now defending\" so I thought... Apollo: Whaaaat!? You mean, you mean you want me to defend you? Me? Trucy: Maybe you can tell us what happened? Were you hit by a car? Did someone steal your stand? Or your panties? Alita: No! No... I'm not the client, actually. The client would be my... well, my fiancé, I suppose you'd call him. Apollo: Fiancé...? What happened to him, then? Alita: He was arrested this morning. The charge... was murder. Trucy: Murder... Alita: Have you heard about what happened at the park? Tiala's story Apollo: So, what's your story? You frequent the Kitaki Mansion, yes? Are you a member of their, um, organization? Alita: No... Not yet. Trucy: Not yet? Alita: You see, I'm to be married next month. To the boss's son. Apollo: The boss's son...? So he's a, uh... *gulp* (A gangster...) Alita: Yes, but the Kitakis are locally responsible gangsters. I thought it'd be nice for a change... Quit my boring job, live the good, gangster life. Trucy: I think you're on to something! \"Mrs. Kitaki\"... I like the sound of that! Apollo: (I'm not sure your daddy would care much for that...) Murder in the park (appears after \"Your request\") Apollo: Wh-What happened!? Alita: I haven't been told all the details. But I do know a body was found in the park. Near the Kitaki Mansion. Trucy: There were a lot of police cars there. Alita: Apparently, the victim was shot with a pistol... But I hear the circumstances of the shooting were... rather unusual. Apollo: And your fiancé was arrested for this? Trucy: Um... what sort of person is your fiancé? Your fiancé (appears after \"Tiala's story\" and \"Murder in the park\") Apollo: Your fiancé is the Kitaki Family's only son, correct? Alita: His name's Wocky. Wocky Kitaki... I brought a photo. Apollo: Well. That's... quite the photo. Alita: I know! Oh, he can be powerful and menacing, but so cute! Apollo: But, if he's the boss's only son... Alita: Yes, I'm sure he'll take his father's place some day. Trucy: Say, I'm a boss already! Of this agency! Alita: Please help my Wocky! Please! Apollo: (...Right! My first solo defense case! Crime boss's son or not, I'll prove he's innocent!) Alita: I... prepared a letter of request. I know you need those. Letter of Request added to the Court Record. Trucy: Right! Let's go check out the scene of the crime! Your fiancé (subsequent times) Apollo: Your fiancé is the Kitaki Family's only son, correct? Alita: His name's Wocky. Wocky Kitaki... I brought a photo. Apollo: Well. That's... quite the photo. Alita: I know! Oh, he can be powerful and menacing, but so cute! Apollo: But, if he's the boss's only son... Alita: Yes, I'm sure he'll take his father's place some day. Trucy: Say, I'm a boss already! Of this agency! Alita: Please help my Wocky! Please! Apollo: (...Right! My first solo defense case! Crime boss's son or not, I'll prove he's innocent!) Present Attorney's Badge Alita: An attorney's badge... So you really are a defense attorney. Please, I'm counting on you. I need your help. Letter of Request Alita: I hope that's OK? I've never written a letter of request before. Apollo: Oh, it's fine. (I should hope it's your first...) Trucy: If we take this we'll be able to investigate the scene! Anything else Alita: I'm not sure I understand... I'm sorry. Apollo: No, no, it's me who's sorry, really! Sorry! Examine evidence Letter of Request Writing Trucy: Why does this envelope say \"Hit Request\"? Apollo: Um... it's a bit of lingo. Like \"call in a hit\", or a \"hit man\"... Trucy: Ooh, you mean gangster-talk!? So does \"hit\" mean \"to defend\" in gangster-ese? Well, \"hit man\"? Apollo: I certainly hope not... (Something tells me she used the wrong envelope...) June 15Hickfield Clinic Apollo: Huh...? Where's Mr. Wright? Trucy: Maybe he's getting an examination again? Apollo: How many does he need!? (Wasn't it just a sprain?) Trucy: Too bad, Polly! You wanted to show off your request to Daddy, didn't you! Apollo: What? Me? No! Trucy: Oh? That's a surprise. Apollo: L-Let's just come back later, shall we? After clearing \"Your fiancé\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency: June 15Detention CenterVisitor's Room Trucy: Polly! You look as happy as a clam in its shell. Apollo: For a lawyer this is it, the place where the battle begins! Guard: ...Ahem. You need something? Apollo: Aaah! Yes, we're attorneys. I was hoping we could see Mr. Wocky Kitaki? Guard: Sorry, he's in questioning right now. Could take a while. Trucy: Drat. Oh well, guess we'll have to come back later then. Apollo: So much for that battle... Examine Security camera Apollo: That security camera is looking at me. I wonder if they tape all of this. Security guard Apollo: A security guard. He stands here, watching this room. I have no idea if he's listening to us talk. I'm not even sure he's breathing. After clearing \"Your fiancé\" Talk option in Wright Anything Agency: June 15Kitaki Mansion Apollo: (So this is it... My first murder crime scene!) Officer: Ah, it's you kids again. Look, can't you find some other place to play... Trucy: We're not playing! We're um, \"investigating\"! Aren't we, Apollo? Apollo: Sir, I have a letter of request here. Officer: Letter of... huh? Why does it say \"Hit Request\" on it? Apollo: (Ms. Tiala must have used the Kitaki's stationery...) ???: Excuse me, coming through. Officer: Ah! It's you! Mr. Gavin! Apollo: ...! (Who's this guy...?) ???: I must say I'm used to being inspected by the ladies... But this is the first time I've felt this way with a man. Apollo: Mr.... Gavin? ???: Ah, Fräulein. What is a sweet morsel like you doing in such a dismal place? Can I help? Trucy: ... Y-Yes! The police man officer fellow here won't let us in! We even have a letter of request! ???: You must be exhausted, standing out here! I will take you to the scene of the crime. Trucy: Oooh! R-Really!? ???: ...By your leave, Officer. Officer: Ya... Yes sir! Of course, sir! ???: Ah ha. Very well. This way, Fräulein... Trucy: Whee! Apollo: ... Hey! What about me!? June 15People Park ???: ...On that note, enjoy your investigation! Trucy: Thank you! Will we see you again...? ???: Ask the wind, Fräulein. I'll be riding on it! Apollo: ...Who was that? Trucy: Eeeeeeeeeek! Apollo! Look! A c-corpse! Apollo: Whaaaat!? ...Hey, it's just a mannequin. Trucy: Wow. It sure got me. ???: Ahem. Might I ask exactly what it is you're doing here? Oh, it's you. How did you kids get in here? Trucy: Oh! This guy, well, he was more like a prince really. He let us in... ???: Him again. That glimmerous fop, always getting in my way... Anyway! This scene is off-limits. Apollo: Excuse me? We have a letter of request! ???: ...Hmm. One moment. Apollo: (Why is she holding that big magnifying glass...?) ???: .............................. I'd recognize that handwriting anywhere. Scientific analysis says this was written by Alita Tiala. Apollo: ...Thanks. (It took you thirty minutes to figure that out!?) So... what's up with the mannequin there? ???: It's taking the place of the body, preserving the scene of the crime as it was found. Apollo: (The body... was pulling the stand!?) ???: So, you're a defense attorney, are you? Ema: Detective Ema Skye. I'm in charge of this crime scene. Trucy: She doesn't seem that happy about it. Apollo: ...She doesn't seem that happy about many things. Ema: I trust you know how to stay out of the way. I always carry two pairs of handcuffs... just in case. Examine Noodle stand Ema: Hey there! No messing with the crime scene! Apollo: B-But we need to investigate! Trucy: Apollo! Look! That stand! ... It says \"Eldoon\"! Apollo: ...I've noticed. Well, we've solved the case of the missing stand at least. ...Though the circumstances could stand to be better. Anywhere else Ema: Hey there! No messing with the crime scene! Apollo: B-But we need to investigate! Ema: Investigations are to be carried out by professionals, scientifically! Apollo: (She's not going to let us check out the crime scene, is she...) Trucy: Hey, Apollo. My very un-scientific analysis tells me something here is very suspicious... Apollo: ...I think I know what you mean. It's kind of hard not to notice. (I'd better check out what we came here to find at least.) Talk Any option Apollo: Um, Detective Skye...? Ema: Quiet, please. It's snack time. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH MUNCH. Trucy: We're not making much progress here. Apollo: (She must not be very busy...) Ema: *sigh* I never seem to get a lucky break. Back after nine years, and they won't give me the position I requested... ...And then I hear he gave up the defense attorney life... Apollo: (He? Who's he? An ex-defense attorney...?) Present Anything Apollo: Um, if you could spare a moment to take a look at this? Ema: ...Can't you see that I am extremely, extremely busy? Apollo: (...Eating snacks, yes.) Trucy: Busy eating snacks, I'd say. Apollo: (This is going nowhere fast.) After clearing any Talk option and examining noodle stand in People Park: June 15Eldoon's House Trucy: Oh, Mr. Eldoon...! Hello? Apollo: Looks like he left. Trucy: And we found his stand and everything! What about our free bowl!? Apollo: Oh, too bad, looks like we'll have to wait a little longer for that bowl. So sorry. Trucy: Aw, what a bummer. Examine Clinic front door Apollo: The front entrance to the Meraktis Clinic. The walls and posts are so highly polished I can see my face in them. ... Hot dang, my hair looks good. Green banner Apollo: Looks like this is a banner for some campaign. \"Three shots for the price of one\"... Somehow I don't see people lining up for that. Police car Apollo: A police car is parked in front of the Meraktis Clinic. It's empty. The police must be inside investigating. Blue tarp Apollo: The blue tarp Mr. Eldoon used to cover his noodle stand. Robbed of its purpose, it blows in the wind... alone. Bowl Apollo: A lone Eldoon's Noodles bowl lies on the ground. The lone bowl, tipped on its side... It's kind of surreal. House Apollo: Mr. Eldoon's house has seen better days. And I'm betting I've eaten better noodles. \"NOO\" sign Apollo: This must be his business sign. It reads \"NOO\". Maybe that's how the kids are spelling \"new\" these days. Another failed attempt at hipster marketing. Oil drum Apollo: An oil drum for catching rainwater. ...Ack! A sparrow just flew over and... Aw man, that was just disgusting! Something tells me this wasn't the first time. Sign under oil drum Apollo: There's a hand-written sign here... \"Save the light!\" It's hard to make out the sign in the shade from the clinic next door. Spoon the dog Apollo: Guy Eldoon's dog doesn't look too lively. They say dogs and their owners resemble each other... I guess there are exceptions. After clearing any Talk option and examining noodle stand in People Park: June 15Hickfield Clinic Phoenix: Ah, you're back! Run into some problems? Trucy: Oh, Polly, didn't you want to tell Daddy something? Apollo: Who? Me? No! I'm fine. Really. Phoenix: What's this? So there is a problem? Apollo: No, no problem. Actually, I got a defense request. Phoenix: A defense request! That is a problem. Apollo: Huh...? Phoenix: I've given up the court. I'm not a lawyer anymore. Apollo: ... The request was for me! Phoenix: Oh, right. You're a lawyer, aren't you? Apollo: (He's doing that on purpose! I know it!) Talk Murder Phoenix: So, what about this defense request? Apollo: It's related to the murder in People Park, actually. Trucy: Guess what! We found Mr. Eldoon's noodle stand at the scene of the crime! Phoenix: Did you now. That's unusual indeed. Never heard of a noodle stand being used as a murder weapon. Apollo: ...Uh, I think the murder weapon was something else. Phoenix: You mean you don't know what the murder weapon was? Trucy: That funny detective lady won't let us on the scene! What kind of detective wears a lab coat, anyway!? Phoenix: A lab coat? Hmm. Didn't think she'd be involved with this... Apollo: ...You know her? Phoenix: You could say that. Skye connection (appears after \"Murder\") Apollo: So... you know her, don't you? Phoenix: I met her on a case... this was about ten years ago. She was still a high school student at the time. Apollo: (That would make her about the same age as me!) Trucy: That's my daddy! He knows all the police types. Oh, wait! Maybe you know that other guy, too! Apollo: That other guy...? Trucy: That shining prince on the motorcycle! Phoenix: ...Prince? Mysterious Prince (appears after \"Skye connection\") Phoenix: Apollo. Tell me about this \"prince\" of Trucy's. Indulge a concerned father... Apollo: He was at the crime scene... He looked just like Mr. Gavin! Phoenix: ... Did he now. Apollo: ...You know him? Phoenix: My guess is he's Kristoph Gavin's younger brother... Apollo: His brother!? Phoenix: We're acquaintances, after a fashion. Klavier Gavin... rock 'n' roll god incarnate. Trucy: Klavier... What a lovely name! He's so dreamy! Apollo: (I didn't know Mr. Gavin had a brother! And what was he doing out there?) Phoenix: I have a feeling you'll be crossing paths again soon. ...Now, what was the problem again? Having trouble investigating the crime scene in the park? Trucy: Yeah. That detective woman won't let us! Phoenix: ...Go to the office. Under the silk top hat you'll find a bottle of white powder. Try taking that to this detective. Apollo: \"White powder\"...? (I hope it's not what I think it is.) Phoenix: Just take it to her. It'll be fine, you'll see. Oh, and tell her I said hi. Mysterious Prince (subsequent times) Phoenix: Apollo. Tell me about this \"prince\" of Trucy's. Indulge a concerned father... Apollo: He was at the crime scene... He looked just like Mr. Gavin! Phoenix: ... Did he now. Apollo: ...You know him? Phoenix: My guess is he's Kristoph Gavin's younger brother... Apollo: His brother!? Phoenix: We're acquaintances, after a fashion. Klavier Gavin... rock 'n' roll god incarnate. Trucy: Klavier... What a lovely name! He's so dreamy! Apollo: (I didn't know Mr. Gavin had a brother! And what was he doing out there?) Phoenix: I have a feeling you'll be crossing paths again soon. Wright Anything Agency (after clearing \"Mysterious Prince\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic) Examine Silk hat Leads to: \"So this must be the \"silk top hat\" Mr. Wright mentioned.\" Talk The case Trucy: Hmm... I think we should focus on finding more information about the case. Apollo: You seem to be having fun. Trucy: Of course! This is my first criminal investigation! And it's so mysterious! A noodle stand pushing a dead man along... Apollo: ...Uh, I think it was the other way around. The dead man was pulling the stand. But you're right about it being mysterious. Trucy: I knew it! More information, that's what we need! Apollo: So this must be the \"silk top hat\" Mr. Wright mentioned. Let's take a closer look... Huh? Trucy: Whoa! Apollo: You know what this is, Trucy? Trucy: I... remember finding some in Daddy's dresser when I was little. I thought it was sugar, so I licked it... He got mad at me. Apollo: (This is getting more and more suspicious...) White powder placed gingerly into pocket. Trucy: Let's go talk to that detective! She's sure to know what that white powder is! Examine evidence White Powder Label Apollo: Hmm. The bottle has a label on it. Trucy: Can you read it? Apollo: Uh, not a word. I'm not sure I speak whatever language this is written in. Trucy: That's too bad. I guess we're stuck with this mysterious bottle of white powder... People Park (after clearing \"Mysterious Prince\" Talk option in Hickfield Clinic, then examining silk hat in Wright Anything Agency) Present White Powder Leads to: \"Um... Does this ring any bells?\" Apollo: Um... Does this ring any bells? Ema: Ah! Is that--!? It couldn't!? Where'd you get that? Apollo: I brought it from the office. Ema: You... work at the Wright & Co. Law Offices, yes? Apollo: Er, yeah, sort of... Trucy: Detective Skye! How do you know my daddy? Ema: D-D-Daddy!? I'm sorry, who did you say you were? Trucy: Trucy Wright. Phoenix Wright's daughter. Ema: Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!? Mr. Wright has a daughter!? Trucy: You seem shocked. Ema: W-Well, if you're Mr. Wright's daughter and you're his apprentice... ...then I'm available to help you in any way I can! Apollo: Oh, uh, thanks. (You can start by not calling me Mr. Wright's apprentice!) Ema: This powder is used for detecting fingerprints. Apollo: Fingerprints...? Ema: I guess you might call it a memento... from the time I spent with Mr. Wright. Apollo: (White powder memories...) Ema: If you find any evidence with fingerprints on it, please let me know! We'll dust for prints! Apollo: (Well, she's quite the eager beaver all of a sudden...) Examine Benches Apollo: Benches line the river running through the park. Trucy: Ahh, a little urban oasis. I bet children come here to splash around in the water. Apollo: That river's a little deep for splashing... and a little dirty. Trucy: Well, they could listen to the water and pretend they were playing. Blue tarps Apollo: Blue tarps have been placed on the ground around the stand. Trucy: Apollo! I bet the victim was going to have a picnic here! Apollo: ...I guess he could have eaten all the noodles he wanted. Ema: Don't touch those! Those are preserving the crime scene! Apollo: (Oh, I guess the police put these tarps here after all.) Knife Apollo: It's... a knife! Ema: A \"shiv\" to be precise. Trucy: Ooh... lingo! Ema: The defendant, Wocky Kitaki, is the son of known gangsters. The police are assuming this belongs to him. Apollo: (Wait, but wasn't the murder weapon a pistol...?) Huh? Look at this, there's a handprint on this shiv... Ema: A handprint? Then there might be a fingerprint. Let's investigate! Right! First, choose the fingerprint you want to examine. Apollo: ...Choose a fingerprint? Ema: Look closely at the handle. See? There's more than one fingerprint there. Trucy: Those black spots? Ema: That's right. Pick the one you want to analyze. Examine darkest fingerprint Leads to: \"Right! Let's get detecting!\" Ema: Right! Let's get detecting! Apollo: (Wow, she's practically glowing with excitement...) Ema: First, sprinkle some aluminum powder over the print. With a press of [A / Space], like this. See? (Changed from [Just touch the screen, like this. See?] in the original release) The oil left by the print absorbs the aluminum powder, so you just dust it on... ...and blow it off! Trucy: B-Blow? Ema: It's like whistling. You know how to whistle, don't you? Just use [X / Y / R] and... (Changed from [It's like whistling. You know how to whistle, don't you? Just put your lips together...] in the original release) Trucy: Wow! Amazing! It's like magic! Ema: Heh heh. Isn't it though? Apollo: (Right, let's give it a shot!) Ema: Incidentally, it's important that you cover the entire fingerprint with the powder. Obtain fingerprint Leads to: \"Hmm, good... clear... Quite impressive!\" Ema: Hmm, good... clear... Quite impressive! Next, to match the print. The police office has samples so you can tell whose finger this print belongs to. Apollo: Hmm... That doesn't sound like as much fun as actually finding the print. Ema: OK, pick the person whose print you think this is. You probably have a good idea whose knife this is already. Compare Wocky Kitaki profile Comparing...Comparison complete. Match found Leads to: \"So... the fingerprints do belong to the defendant.\" Compare anyone else Comparing...Comparison complete. No Match found Leads back to profile selection Apollo: So... the fingerprints do belong to the defendant. Ema: Yes! Isn't it amazing? Ah, the power of science. It's my life. Trucy: Apollo, she's... sparkling. Apollo: And I'm dimming. Ema: Look sharp, spirits up. The real fight is yet to come! Trucy: Chin up, Polly! Apollo: (The trial hasn't even started and I'm already losing...) Knife added to the Court Record. Knife (subsequent times) Apollo: A knife is sticking straight into the ground. Trucy: With the defendant's fingerprints on it... Which means... You think he stuck it into the victim? Apollo: (I don't know what he did with it but I don't like it.) Mannequin Apollo: This mannequin is dressed up to look like a police officer. I've seen one at the station. (A mannequin in place of a body...) Ema: The body of the victim has already been removed. Trucy: Do you think the victim was the noodle stand thief? Apollo: What, you think someone killed him because he stole it? Trucy: Yeah! Taking care of business, Little Plum Kitaki style! Apollo: (Try not to sound too eager about that, please...) Noodle stand Apollo: ...And this is Mr. Eldoon's noodle stand, obviously. Trucy: It does say \"Eldoon\" in big letters, doesn't it! Apollo: And that mark on his paper lantern there looks familiar. Trucy: It's going to be a little weird telling him... what with the corpse and all... Apollo: Anyway, that wraps up three of our cases. Trucy: That's right! Congratulations, Apollo! Apollo: (And leaves us with one case that's worse than all three put together... Murder.) Trash can Apollo: (There's got to be a good clue or two around here...) Trucy: You and your trash cans! Go ahead, knock yourself out. Apollo: Please, can't you see I'm doing my... Huh? L... Look! Another pair of underwear!? Trucy: Wow, Apollo! You're a genius at finding panties! Apollo: Stop saying that. Wait, these aren't...? Trucy: Th-They're not mine! Apollo: (Could these have been stolen, too?) Bloomers added to the Court Record. Trash can (subsequent times) Trucy: I'll always remember this trash can as \"the place where Apollo found those bloomers\"! Apollo: Don't you have more important things to remember? Wait, these aren't...? Trucy: Th-They're not mine! Apollo: (Could these have been stolen, too?) Talk The case Ema: The report came in late last night. The body was found much as you see it now. ...Except it was a real body. Apollo: But... why? Ema: Why was a body pulling a noodle stand? If I knew the answer to that, I wouldn't still be here. Apollo: Well, what was the cause of death...? Ema: A bullet wound, to the temple. ...He was shot by a pistol. Trucy: A pistol? Ema: Not the easiest thing to come by in this day and age. Apollo: (Unless you're a cop... or a gangster.) Ema: Incidentally, the victim's name was Pal Meraktis. I just received the autopsy report, in fact. Meraktis's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Ema: I mean, really! What's up with this case!? It's enough to make me want to run off, pulling a mysterious noodle stand behind me... Trucy: Not so mysterious, actually... We should tell her, Apollo! After all, we know where the stand came from! Ema: A likely story! I didn't come here to play games, you know. Apollo: Actually, we do know where the noodle stand came from. The noodle stand's owner is... Present Guy Eldoon profile Apollo: Ema: ... Who's the old guy? Apollo: This is the proprietor of Eldoon's Noodles, Mr. Eldoon himself! Trucy: He's famous in this part of town. Ema: Not bad. I guess Mr. Wright picked the right kids for the job. That saved me a lot of work. Thanks. Noodle Stand added to the Court Record. Trucy: What sort of person was the victim, anyway? Ema: You mean what did he do? He was a doctor. Apollo: A doctor...? (I'm starting to see a connection here...) Present anyone else Apollo: Ema: ... Look, I have better things to be doing. I'd make more progress eating snacks than listening to this drivel. Apollo: (You could try actually investigating, rather than just standing around.) Leads back to Talk options The case (subsequent times, before correctly presenting Guy Eldoon profile) Ema: The report came in late last night. The body was found much as you see it now. ...Except it was a real body. Apollo: But... why? Ema: Why was a body pulling a noodle stand? If I knew the answer to that, I wouldn't still be here. Apollo: Well, what was the cause of death...? Ema: A bullet wound, to the temple. ...He was shot by a pistol. Trucy: A pistol? Ema: Not the easiest thing to come by in this day and age.

Trucy: What sort of person was the victim, anyway? Ema: You mean what did he do? He was a doctor. Apollo: A doctor...? (I'm starting to see a connection here...) Your story Ema: Who? Me? I'm just a supervisor for this crime scene. Apollo: (Detective Skye... Hmm.) Ema: I was out of the country for a while. I came back to be a forensic scientist. Trucy: Ooh! Were you studying abroad? Ema: Something like that. I was studying in Europe. Forensic sciences, mind you. But when I got back here, they threw me in criminal affairs! Just like that! Trucy: Why didn't you just become a forensics expert in Europe? Ema: Well, I suppose that was an option, but... I had a lot of favors to repay to people back here. Apollo: (Favors? Wasn't she in high school when she left?) Ema: What? What's that look for? I was involved in an... incident before I left. But Mr. Wright and his people helped me out. I owed them. Trucy: Really? I had no idea... Apollo: (If she's been out of the country for a while... ...she probably doesn't know about Mr. Wright's current, erm, \"state of affairs\".) The defendant Apollo: Um... Could you tell us a bit about the defendant? He's the only son of the Kitaki Family, yes...? Ema: Wocky Kitaki. I don't know if he is the boss's son, but he's certainly throwing his weight around... ...Violently. In the detention center. Trucy: I see. Apollo: Why was he arrested in the first place? Ema: ... You are a defense attorney, aren't you? You're not his, by any chance? Apollo: Er, a-actually, yes, I am. Ema: Well... We have a witness to the moment of the crime. Apollo: Eh...? Ema: The witness called the police. They'll be testifying during the trial tomorrow. Trucy: Whaaaaaaaa--!? The victim (appears after correctly presenting Guy Eldoon profile upon selecting \"The case\" Talk option) Apollo: Could you tell us a bit more about the victim? Ema: Well, let's see... Apparently he's the physician at a clinic in the area. Quite well off, too, from the sound of it. The clinic's name is... The Meraktis Clinic. Trucy: Hmm... Maybe that's why the cop car was parked there? Ema: What? You've been to the clinic? Apollo: Yeah... Though on a related issue. Apollo: (I told the detective about the case of the stolen noodle stand.) Ema: ...I see... So that means... ...Dr. Meraktis stole the stand and pulled it all the way here? Apollo: That would seem to be the case. Ema: ... But why? Apollo: Don't ask me! Present Attorney's Badge Ema: Ah, an attorney's badge. It reminds me of when Mr. Wright was still defending. Everything I have now is thanks to him. Remember, help as many people as you can. That's your job! Trucy: She's right, Polly! Let's make a difference! ...Is something wrong? Apollo: Ah! Ah, no! N-Nothing. (I... I actually felt inspired for a moment there.) Fingerprint Powder Ema: Fingerprint analysis is the very basis of modern forensic science! Doesn't just talking about it leave you breathless with excitement? Apollo: Oh yes. Breathless. (Actually, it does sound kinda interesting...) Ema: Let me know if you find any evidence that might have a  print or two, alright? Knife Ema: The defendant's fingerprints were found on that knife. Trucy: Which means that, at the very least, he was here at the scene of the crime...? Ema: It's highly possible, yes. Apollo: Ugh. This doesn't look good. Ema: No use worrying about what's out already! You just worry about what's yet to come! Meraktis's Autopsy Report Ema: Why did Dr. Meraktis die like this...? Trucy: Pulling a noodle stand... Very strange. Ema: Inconceivable! I just don't get it! Some people just can't die normally! Apollo: (He's dead, give him a break.) Anything else Ema: Sorry... I don't think I can help you with that. I think you need more than just scientific help. But ask me anything you like! ...Just ask scientifically. Examine evidence Fingerprint Powder Label Apollo: The label reads \"Fingerprint Powder\" in some strange language. Trucy: How do we know for sure? What if this is really a jar for something else, like jam, or honey? Apollo: Why would anyone go through the trouble? Trucy: Well, so the police don't find out, that's why! Apollo: I hardly think possessing fingerprint powder is a crime. Trucy: Oh, huh, I guess. That's boring. Bloomers Pattern on back side Trucy: These bloomers sure have a... distinct design! Apollo: You certainly know who they belong to at a glance. Trucy: That way, she doesn't have to write her name on them! Genius! Apollo: ...I would think writing your name would be easier than drawing a plum blossom. Knife Fingerprints Trucy: So, the defendant's prints are on this knife... Apollo: That would mean he was here the night of the crime. Trucy: That's what I call irrefutable scientific evidence! Neat! Apollo: Not so neat when it happens to be evidence against our client... Noodle Stand \"NOODLE\" sign Trucy: Huh? Look at this, Apollo! Mr. Eldoon spelled his name backwards on this side! Apollo: Um, I think that says \"Noodle\". As in \"Eldoon's Noodles\". Trucy: Huh... Oh, I get it! So the name of his store is the same whether you read it forward or backwards! Apollo: Yeah... I guess it would be. Well, except for the last \"s\". Trucy: ...... Then, how about a store called \"Team Meat\"? Apollo: Uh, close, but that would be \"Taem Maet\" backwards. And what kind of store is that? Trucy: Why, a store that sells meat! \"It's not meat, useless it's Team Meat!\" After clearing all Talk options and examining trash can and knife: Ema: So... have you met the defendant? Apollo: Ah. Uh... No. Ema: Visiting hours are almost over at the detention center. You might think about wrapping up here and heading over. Apollo: Good idea. (I don't know what good it will do. We have a witness, and a knife with prints... Have I mentioned I've got a bad feeling about this?) Ema: Don't worry, it's like a Wright tradition. Apollo: (Some traditions I can live without.) June 15Detention CenterVisitor's Room Guard: I'm sorry. Meeting hours for the day are all done. Apollo: B-But we still have three minutes! Guard: I'll put in your request, but don't expect anything. The father's talking in the private room with him. Trucy: The father? You mean like a priest? Guard: I mean the suspect's father, Mr. Winfred \"Big Wins\" Kitaki himself. Apollo: (Not someone I care to meet...) ???: ...Die you--!!! ???: ...You're the one on your way out, old--!!! Apollo: ...... Trucy: ......... Guard: Ah. They're here. Apollo: (Whoa! This guy radiates power! Power.. with a cute apron?) ???: You Wocky's lawyer? Apollo: Y-Yes, sir! Big Wins: Well, I'm Big Wins Kitaki, fourth head of the Kitaki family... capice? Apollo: Er... Actually, I came to speak to your son. Big Wins: ... Mr. Justice. Apollo: Yes? Big Wins: My son's innocent. He killed no one. If he were found guilty... it wouldn't be good. ...Capice? Apollo: Y-Yes! I'm all about capicing! Capice'd loud and clear! Big Wins: You gotta do more than just understand to make it. You'll learn, though. Even if the lesson comes at the end of your short life. Apollo: (I don't feel so good...) ???: What's the big idea, old man! Wocky: You can't treat me like a kid no more, not now! You know I... I... I wanted to go to the clink! I like it here! Apollo: You... must be Wocky? Wocky: A G's not a G till he does hard time! Bizzoooy! You'll see. When I get out of here, things'll change! Big Wins: Silence! My apologies, Mr. Justice... He's usually such a nice boy. Apollo: (Forgive me if I have a hard time believing that.) Wocky: Ha! You can't take me under your wing this time, old man! You heard me! I don't need no trial! I did it! Big Wins: ...I think that's enough for today, Mr. Justice. Don't let me down tomorrow. Apollo: So much for talking to our client. Trucy: But we made so much progress today! We even found my panties! I had fun, at least. Apollo: Of course, the biggest mystery of all remains... (How am I supposed to build a case for the trial!?) Trucy: Oh, almost forgot, it's time for my show! Tonight I'm performing at the Wonder Bar! You should come check it out. To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Apollo: No clues here.\n-- From Shot to Call --Stickler: I could not prevent the killer from leaving the scene.Press Apollo: Apollo: Which way did the killer run? Stickler: By that time, it was clear the killer had noticed me. Naturally, he ran in the opposite direction. Apollo: (That would mean he ran in the opposite direction from the Kitaki mansion...) Klavier: Achtung! Don't even think about pointing out that he was going away from his home. All he had to do was loop back once he was out of sight. Apollo: (Ugh... How did he know that's where I was going...?)Stickler: Nor could I simply leave the scene in good conscience.Press Apollo: Apollo: You were certainly composed for someone who had just witnessed a killing. Stickler: If one is to devote one's life to the pursuit of science... ...one must never flinch at the sight of a little blood. Nor be so moved by a chemical discovery that one drops one's flask upon the lab room floor. Klavier: Oooh, cool answer. Very cool. Apollo: (Hmm... So nothing strange about how he acted...)Stickler: Ergo! I used my cell phone to call the police.Press Apollo: Leads to: \"So, you called immediately after witnessing the murder?\"Stickler: Until the police arrived at the scene 10 minutes later, I saw no one else.Press Apollo: Apollo: Can you tell us in detail about these 10 minutes? Stickler: I stood in a state of heightened awareness. Anything could happen at any moment. Anyone could appear from any direction! ... Apollo: Is... that all? Stickler: No one came. Nothing happened at all. I saw it all, which is to say... I saw nothing. Judge: It was late at night. It's not odd to think there would be few people around in the park. Apollo: (So he just stood there, watching? Hmm... Not much to go on there.)Trucy: Don't forget, Apollo. You have to focus to perceive the truth!Apollo: (I'm not sure I entirely understand this just yet. But I have \"perceived\" one thing... My bracelet is reacting to his testimony... this has to be the key!)Apollo: So, you called immediately after witnessing the murder?Stickler: The police undoubtedly have a record of the call. Why not check with them?Trucy: Wait, Apollo! This has to be it!Apollo: Wait, you mean his habit?Trucy: Don't forget, Apollo! When he isn't sure about something, he has a habit of fiddling with his book!Apollo: (The only time he even had the book open was here... Which means this is the place to look for this \"habit\"!) I... don't know how I know, but I know.Trucy: ...Know what?Apollo: It's my bracelet, it's different, somehow. I can feel it reacting to something about the witness!Trucy: Your... bracelet?Apollo: I'm not sure I get this \"focus\" stuff you were talking about, Trucy. But... I have a feeling that trusting my bracelet is the way to go. (OK, I just need to touch my bracelet with [X / Y / R] as it reacts to the testimony...) (Changed from [OK, I just need to touch my bracelet as it reacts to the testimony...] in the original release)Touch bracelet Leads to: \"Wh-What's going on!?\"Apollo: Wh-What's going on!? (I can see the witness's face, his expression so clearly! I-It's filling my mind! I can see nothing else, hear nothing else!)Trucy: Apollo?Apollo: Trucy! What's happening to me!?Trucy: This is what I meant by \"focusing\".Apollo: Focusing...Trucy: In this state, you can see everything, Apollo! Everything the witness does!Apollo: Th-That's great, but this is kind of freaking me out!Trucy: Just look for Mr. Stickler's twitch -- his habit. You remember it, right?Apollo: Sure! When he says something he's not sure of, he fiddles with a page of his book.Trucy: You got it! Right now, you're looking at the witness's face. ...And your eyes are sort of bugging out.Apollo: (I'll bet they are.)Trucy: First, move your focus of attention down to Mr. Stickler's hand.Apollo: His hand...?Trucy: You know what to look for now, but you have to be looking at the right place.Apollo: (She's right. I can only see his face like this... Time to try changing my viewpoint!)Focus on page corner of book Leads to: \"Perfect! Now you're really ready!\"Trucy: Perfect! Now you're really ready!Apollo: Ready... for what?Trucy: Ready to perceive the truth behind the twitch!Apollo: Perceive... ([Percieve] highlighted in the original release)Trucy: Try listening to the witness talk as you focus. Then watch for his habit.Apollo: Right... You mean when he fiddles with the page!Trucy: That's right! That's your signal to look closer, to perceive with [X / Y / R]! (Changed from [That's right! That's your signal to look closer, to perceive!] in the original release) Find his weak spot and I guarantee we'll be able to give him the Royal Flush!Apollo: Spoken like a true poker head's daughter.Trucy: I'm a magician, thank you very much.Apollo: (So I have to pay attention to his words... and his fingers!)Trucy: Don't worry if you miss it, you can always try again!Apollo: (Right! Look out nervous twitch, here comes Justice!)Perceive hand twitch on page corner on \"I used my cell phone\" Apollo: Leads to: \"............\"Perceive wrong area Apollo: Trucy: A-Apollo! That's not it! Apollo: Huh? Oh... I guess I'm kind of lost here. Trucy: Remember his habit: He fiddles with the pages of his book! The word he's saying right when you see his fingers twitch is the key! Apollo: (OK, so I have to watch for his fingers to move. Got it.) Trucy: And don't worry about getting it perfect your first time. You can always try again! Leads back to perceive sectionApollo: ............ (I... I saw it! Just now... I could see it!)Judge: M-Mr. Justice? Do you have something to say?Stickler: A-all this b-banging of desks! I-It's quite bad for my circulation, you know.Apollo: Mr. Stickler... Allow me to ask you a simple question. Why did you fiddle with the page of your book just now? ...The very moment you mentioned your cell phone!?Stickler: Wh-Wh-What are you talking about!?Apollo: I'm curious now about this cell phone of yours... Mind if I ask a few questions? (Hmm... What to ask, What to ask...)Ask for his number Apollo: Mr. Stickler... Tell me your phone number! Stickler: Urk!? Wh-Why? Whatever for? Klavier: ...Why not? You have something against making friends? Judge: ...What does this witness's cell phone number have to do with the case? Stickler: Absolutely nothing! This is a... an invasion of my privacy! Judge: Hmm... Seeing you grimace like that makes me wonder about your cell phone, too. The witness will present his cell phone number to the court. Stickler: Waaaugh! Apollo: Trucy... Do you have your cell phone? Trucy: Sure do! Apollo: Try dialing the number that he gives us. Trucy: You want me to call Mr. Stickler's phone? Judge: This... is all highly irregular. Trucy: H-Hey! My pocket's ringing! Wait! This is the phone from yesterday! Apollo: Look... a cell phone. Trucy: Someone dropped it beneath this tire! If the car moved, it would be crushed for sure! Apollo: Hmm... I wonder if it belongs to the doctor here? Apollo: How strange, Mr. Stickler. Stickler: ...! Apollo: Can you explain why your cell phone is sitting here in my assistant's hand!? Leads to: \"Wait a minute! What is the meaning of this!?\"Ask to see his phone Apollo: Mr. Stickler, please show me your cell phone! Stickler: Urk!? Wh-Why? Whatever for? Apollo: Show me, and you'll find out. Stickler: W-Well I can't! I don't have it, you see. Judge: You don't have it...? Apollo: ...Mr. Stickler. Is this your cell phone? Stickler: Yeeeeow! Wh-Where did you get that!? Trucy: That's the phone from yesterday! Apollo: Look... a cell phone. Trucy: Someone dropped it beneath this tire! If the car moved, it would be crushed for sure! Apollo: Hmm... I wonder if it belongs to the doctor here? Apollo: How strange, Mr. Stickler. Stickler: ...! Apollo: Can you explain why your cell phone is sitting here in my hand at this very moment? Leads to: \"Wait a minute! What is the meaning of this!?\"Ask what model of phone Apollo: I was wondering... Can you tell me what model of cell phone you own? Stickler: Urk!? Wh-Why? Whatever for? Klavier: Why not tell him? It's not some matter of national security, I'm sure. Nor does it have anything to do with this case! Take it to the lobby, gentlemen. Judge: Mr. Justice, our current market is flooded with generic-brand cell phones. Please ask questions with a little regard for market trends, please. Trucy: ...Who would have guessed the judge was up on his cell phone industry trends? Apollo: Who would have guessed I'd get chewed out for asking a simple question...? Leads back to: \"Hmm... What to ask, What to ask...\"Judge: Wait a minute! What is the meaning of this!?Apollo: This cell phone was found yesterday... ...in the Meraktis Clinic garage!Judge: The Meraktis... Why, that's where the victim lived!Stickler: Yeeeeeerrgh! Th-That's impossible!Apollo: Mr. Stickler, you lied to the court, didn't you? If your cell phone is here, how could you have called the police!?Stickler: Weeeeeeeeeeeeeouk!Stickler: It... It's true. I didn't have my cell phone that night. That is why it can be said that I called the police from a public pay phone.Judge: A pay phone! So you didn't call on your cell phone after all...Apollo: Just where was this pay phone located, Mr. Stickler!?Stickler: Well, to indicate it with a startlingly high degree of accuracy... ...it was right around here.Judge: That's... quite a ways from the park. But... But why did you lie?Apollo: There can be only one reason. He didn't want the court to know he had lost his cell phone. Because it was found... ...in the victim's garage!Stickler: Wh-Wh-What are you saying!?Apollo: Mr. Stickler... You broke into the Meraktis Clinic garage on the night of the murder! This cell phone tells all!Stickler: B-But that's ridiculous! That makes it sound like... Like I snuck into this fellow's garage to commit some crime! As though I were trying to kill him!Judge: Well, Dr. Meraktis was killed that night.Stickler: W-Well y-yes, but no! This line of reasoning has to be against the rules! Yes, it's true! I lost my cell phone! But you can't prove that I lost it that night!Judge: Hmm... Well, Mr. Justice? If that cell phone was dropped the night of the murder... ...it does raise considerable suspicions as to a connection with the crime.Trucy: Now's your chance, Apollo! Connect Mr. Stickler to the crime!Apollo: Oh, he's already connected enough. I just have to prove it. (Well... Do I have a piece of evidence that can do the job? Can I prove the cell phone was dropped on the night of the murder?)Show evidence Apollo: Of course I have evidence! Klavier: Ooh, I like your swagger, Herr Forehead. Hit it. Judge: The court will see this evidence. Mr. Justice, \"hit it\", as they say! Leads to: \"The evidence that proves the cell phone was dropped on the night of the murder is:\"No evidence Apollo: (Evidence... If only I had some evidence, it'd make this whole thing a lot easier.) Judge: Care to explain the lack of confidence smeared across your face, Mr. Justice? Klavier: Oh, Herr Forehead... I think it should be clear by now. \"No evidence\" means \"no case\". Apollo: (Ack! I guess this is it, then. Time to go for broke!) Leads to: \"The evidence that proves the cell phone was dropped on the night of the murder is:\"Apollo: The evidence that proves the cell phone was dropped on the night of the murder is:Present Mirror Apollo: Leads to: \"That's... a side-view mirror?\"Present anything else Apollo: Judge: Hmm... Well, Prosecutor Gavin? Klavier: No comment, Herr Judge. Judge: No dice, Mr. Justice. Penalty. Trucy: Apollo! Remember where we found that cell phone! If it had fallen on the ground before that night... Apollo: (That's right! The cell phone would have been crushed!) Your Honor! One more chance, please! Judge: Mr. Justice, keep this up and you'll run yourself out of a life's worth of chances! Leads back to: \"The evidence that proves the cell phone was dropped on the night of the murder is:\"Judge: That's... a side-view mirror?Apollo: As it so happens... Dr. Meraktis's car was in an accident... ...that took place the night of the murder!Stickler: An accident!?Apollo: An accident. It happened a little after 9 PM, just outside People Park... our murder scene. Dr. Meraktis's car hit a pedestrian!Stickler: Wh-What are you trying to say?Apollo: From the absence of a mirror, it's clear that the car was parked after the accident. Which means it was parked there after 9 PM on the night of the murder. If your cell phone had been dropped before the car was parked in that garage... ...then it would have been crushed. After all, it was lying on the ground, right under the wheel!Stickler: Urk...Apollo: Ergo, Mr. Stickler! The only time you could have dropped this in that garage... ...was after 9 PM the night of the murder in the park!Stickler: Weeeeeeeeoooorrgh!Apollo: Mr. Stickler! You know what this means? You did break into the victim's garage that night.Judge: This is most unexpected! Mr. Justice... Are you naming the witness as a suspect in the murder of Pal Meraktis!?Stickler: N-No, stop! This is too much! This can't be happening! P-P-P-P-Prosecutor! Say something!Klavier: I suppose it is worth saying this: No connection has been found between Wesley Stickler and Pal Meraktis. That is, other than this.Judge: I believe our next testimony will be most... revelatory. Is the witness prepared?Stickler: Y-Y-Yes, Your Honor!!!Apollo: (I know that face... That's the face of guilt!)Trucy: ...Witness Testimony-- Stickler's \"Truth\" --Stickler: That night... Yes! I went to the supermarket. I must have dropped my cell phone on my way back. And when I was walking through the park, I happened to witness the crime! ...I saw the killer, the victim, the stand... all as clear as day! It was him! I saw the defendant at the scene!Judge: Yes... but your cell phone was lying in a garage.Stickler: Ah, yes, well, as you can see my model of cell phone has a defect... It is given to rolling! It's quite a pain when I drop it alongside the road, you know.Judge: ...Looks like a normal cell phone to me. In any case, Mr. Justice, the cross-examination, please.Apollo: (That's funny... My bracelet didn't react at all during that testimony.)Trucy: His nervous habit must not be acting up... I didn't sense anything either, actually. Looks like you're on your own this time around!Apollo: (Right, no problem... I hope. Here comes Justice!)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- Stickler's \"Truth\" --Stickler: That night... Yes! I went to the supermarket.Press Apollo: Apollo: So you went shopping. Which means... ...you were holding a grocery bag when you witnessed the murder taking place? Stickler: Eh!? W-Well, yes, of course... Klavier: Incidentally, the prosecution has received no report of this domestic detail. Judge: ...Mr. Stickler? Can you explain yourself? Stickler: No! I mean, yes! I did go shopping, really. I walked around the supermarket, trying out the free samples... It's... a deeply spiritual time for me. Judge: I'm sure the store clerks would disagree. Trucy: Do you think sampling free food counts as a religion? Stickler: In any case! That night... ...I sampled to my heart's content, and was on my way back home, yes.Stickler: I must have dropped my cell phone on my way back.Press Apollo: Apollo: That's when you passed in front of the Meraktis Clinic? Stickler: Why... yes. That's correct. Trucy: That was a pretty suspicious pause there. Apollo: Mr. Stickler, do you think you could be a bit more specific? Please show us the exact route you took on the night of the murder. Stickler: O-Of course. The supermarket is here, along the main road. My way home from there takes me past the Meraktis Clinic. This is probably when I dropped my cell phone. Yet, woe is I, I walked on, unaware of my loss! ...And walked right into that fateful park.Stickler: And when I was walking through the park, I happened to witness the crime!Press Apollo: Apollo: Which entrance did you enter the park from? Stickler: Well, to be exact... One might say that I went in from the entrance closest to the Meraktis Clinic. Klavier: The same entrance our victim used. Apollo: Did you notice anything when you entered? Wheel marks from a noodle stand, for instance? Stickler: ...I have no recollection of such a thing, no. Yet, though I might have missed the tracks, I could not miss what happened next! I can a keen observer... of the obvious, you might say.Stickler: ...I saw the killer, the victim, the stand... all as clear as day!Press Apollo: Apollo: (This part of the testimony is the key. I know it! Should I press him about the killer, the victim, or the noodle stand?) The killer Apollo: Are you sure you remember the killer clearly? Stickler: How many times must I repeat myself!? It was him, that unscrupulous, fox-like fellow in the defendant's chair! He was looking even more unscrupulous at the time, no less. Judge: Hmm... He does look a bit like one of those trickster foxes in legends of yore. Apollo: (I guess the victim's identity is already old territory... Time to ask something new.) Leads back to cross-examination The victim Apollo: You could see the victim quite clearly, too? Stickler: Oh, clear as clear can be, I assure you. Apollo: I see. So... Um... How'd he look? Stickler: How? How do you mean, \"how\"? Be specific. Apollo: Um, I mean, in general. Judge: The defense will refrain from straining to come up with questions. Find the question that lies in your heart and ask that! Apollo: Y-Yes, Your Honor. (Great, a judge who moonlights as a self-help guru...) Leads back to cross-examination The noodle stand Apollo: Do you happen to remember the noodle stand? Stickler: Quite well, yes! For a student of the sciences, keen observation and healthy curiosity are vital! I remember everything! I could even read the sign! I believe it said... Er... \"NOODLE\". ......... Yes, that was it. Judge: For remembering something \"quite well\" it sure took you a while to tell us. And thank you for telling us that a noodle stand sells noodles. Very enlightening. Well, Mr. Justice? Apollo: (Hmm... What about that sign? Could that be important?) Not at all Apollo: (How could the sign matter at all? We know it's a noodle stand!) Judge: Very well, please continue with the testimony! Leads back to cross-examination Very important Apollo: So the sign on the noodle stand said \"NOODLE\"...? It appears the defense has just obtained a vital piece of testimony! Judge: Is this noodle stand's broth really that delicious? I'll have to go sample the wares one of these days. I think that's worth adding to the testimony as well. Stickler: ...Hmph! Whatever sort of noodles that stand sells, it can't match up to Ivy U.'s cafeteria! Some apply to the school merely for a taste of our Smart Noodles! Apollo: (I wouldn't mind a taste of that myself...) Adds statement \"Why, I even remember the sign on the stand the victim was pulling! It said \"NOODLE\"!\"Press (after adding statement) Apollo: Apollo: Mr. Stickler, you've proven to be a most skilled witness. Stickler: Skilled? What do you mean? Apollo: I thank you for your powers of recollection. Your testimony just now was quite vital. Klavier: Something going on up in your noodle, Herr Forehead? Apollo: (If my gut feeling here is right... I've just stumbled across a major contradiction!)Stickler: Why, I even remember the sign on the stand the victim was pulling! It said \"NOODLE\"!Press Apollo: Apollo: So the sign said \"NOODLE\"? You're absolutely sure? Stickler: Let me be frank: Yes. In fact, the word \"unsure\" isn't even in my dictionary! Nor the word \"uncertain\" or... Apollo: (He was wasting time looking that stuff up!?) Judge: \"NOODLE\", eh? I like that. It tells you what you're getting, no nonsense. Apollo: (It tells me a lot more than that, actually!) Trucy: Why are you smiling like that, Apollo?Present Noodle Stand Apollo: Leads to: \"And you're absolutely sure the sign read \"NOODLE\"?\"Stickler: It was him! I saw the defendant at the scene!Press Apollo: Apollo: Are you absolutely sure it was the defendant? Stickler: Stop asking me the same questions over and over! This isn't some kind of make-up test! Trucy: What's a \"make-up test\", Apollo? Apollo: Nothing a good student like you has to worry about. (Time to find his weak spot and press it till he breaks!)Trucy: His habit isn't acting up... which means he isn't lying.Apollo: (Hmm... I was kind of relying on my bracelet to get me through this one...)Trucy: But he's pretty unsettled! The odds are really high that you can get something out of him!Apollo: That gleam in your eyes... You're a gambler's daughter through and through.Trucy: I'm a magician, thank you very much!\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Phoenix Wright\nDescription: A pianist who can't play a lick.

To this day, it is said that he slumbers even still within the Forbidden Chamber. Man: Night, night, alderman... Sweet dreams! At long last... The revival of Tenma Taro is at hand. A few months prior to the courthouse bombing... April 17, 12:13 PMWright Anything Agency Apollo: Hm. Guess I'm a little early. Trucy: Oh, hey, Apollo! Getting an early start today? Apollo: Yeah! This is the first job I've had in a while after all! Trucy: Well, aren't we all fired up! Apollo: Well, it's not every day I get a call from Mr. Wright. What kind of work is it anyway? Mr. Wright didn't mention any details. Trucy: Work? Is that how he put it? Apollo: (Don't tell me he just wants me to clean the toilet again.) Trucy: You've really become a fixture around here, Apollo. Apollo: (Come to think of it, it's been almost a year since I was hired. A lot's happened since then... ...But I've settled in nicely despite a few bumps in the road.) Apollo: My name is Apollo Justice. I've been practicing law for about a year, but I still have a lot to learn. This is the Wright Anything Agency, and it's where I work. Don't let the name fool you -- it's definitely a law agency. Trucy: But don't forget that this place is a \"talent agency\" too, Polly! Apollo: Uhh, it's the \"law agency\" part of this office that's usually forgotten... This is Trucy Wright, a budding magician... ...and adopted daughter of the agency's owner, Phoenix Wright. She sometimes makes me help with her magic tricks. Trucy: And what's wrong with that? You're one of the agency's \"talents\" as well! Apollo: I was under the impression that I was a lawyer... Trucy: Oh, we'd better hurry. Doesn't look Daddy's going to make it, so let's get going. Apollo: Huh? Where are we going? What about the job he mentioned? Trucy: This IS the job, Polly! You're supposed to keep me company today! Now, come on! Apollo: Another day of not being a lawyer. Should've seen this coming. Trucy: Well, this is the \"Wright ANYTHING Agency,\" y'know. And there's no law-related work at the moment, so... Apollo: (Tell me again why I chose to \"work\" here?) Where is Mr. Wright, anyway? Trucy: Daddy said something about going to meet an acquaintance. But don't worry. Just focus on your job, and I'll tell you exactly what you need to know. Well, let's go. We don't have all day! Apollo: Wait a second! (*sigh* And another day of \"anything goes\" begins at the Wright Anything Agency...) April 17, 1:30 PMNine-Tails Vale - Yokai Lane Apollo: Whew... So, what are we doing way up here in the mountains? Trucy: This is Nine-Tails Vale. Everyone's been talking about the yokai craze here. Apollo: Yokai? Oh, you mean Japanese monsters? Guess that explains all these weird things... Speaking of which, wasn't Nine-Tails Vale founded by Japanese immigrants? Trucy: Yeah. They're holding a festival to boost tourism over at the alderman's manor. My friend who works there invited us. That's why we're here! Apollo: In other words, I'm your chaperon because your dad was too busy. Trucy: Daddy said that with those horns of yours, you'd make a great addition to their festival. I mean, you look just like a Japanese demon! Wasn't that so thoughtful of him, Polly?! Apollo: I could do without thoughtfulness like that. Trucy: Oh, it's almost time! Come on, Polly! The festival grounds are this way. Apollo: (Alright, I guess it's time to move to the \"Kyubi Manor's Garden\"...) Talk The monster craze Apollo: This monster craze... Come to think of it, I think I heard about it on TV. It's supposedly how Nine-Tails Vale made a comeback from the brink of fiscal disaster. Trucy: Hmm... Our agency could sure use something positive like that. Oh, I know! Let's jump on board the monster craze! You and daddy would be a perfect comedy duo! You could call yourselves Agni & Rudra, Demon Kings of Comedy! Daddy sets them up, and you knock 'em down! Hey, I think we hit the jackpot with this idea! Apollo: Um... Sorry, but I plan on staying a lawyer. Trucy: You do?! Apollo: (You don't have to act so surprised by that.) What to do Apollo: Hey, Trucy? Have you seen my attorney's badge? Trucy: How could you lose something so important? Sometimes I really wonder about you, Apollo. Apollo: This is so weird. I wonder if I dropped it somewhere. Trucy: Oh, look! What are these panties doing here? Apollo: Forget about panties. I'm looking for my badge. Trucy: 3, 2, 1... Ta-dah! Did you forget? These are my magic panties! Apollo: ......Hey! That's my attorney's badge! Wow! How'd you do that? Trucy: I set it all up while we were back at the office. Apollo: Wow, I didn't even-- Wait, you took my badge?! Present Attorney's Badge Apollo: Check it out. Trucy: You're so lucky, Apollo. Everyone can see what you do with just a flash of your badge. Apollo: What about you, Trucy? People can tell you're a magician by the way you're dressed. Trucy: Yeah, but I can't always dress like this. Like when I'm at school and stuff. Apollo: You could always show you're a magician by making things appear or disappear. Trucy: You mean like this? 3, 2, 1... Ta-dah! Apollo: Umm, magic or no, aren't you a little old to be showing those things in public? Trucy: Hmm... Then maybe I'll become a lawyer, too. Apollo: You're abandoning your dream just like that?! April 17, 2:05 PMKyubi Manor - Garden Apollo: Wow, this place is really something. Trucy: It definitely feels like a different world here. ???: Trucy. Trucy: Jinxie! Apollo: And this is? Trucy: My friend, Jinxie Tenma. She's the one who invited us. She just happens to be the maid here. Jinxie: ...Two horns. A love of red. Are you a demon? Apollo: No, ha ha. I'm Apollo Justice! Nice to meet you! Jinxie: Eeeeeek! He IS a demon! Apollo: What the--! Jinxie: Be gone, foul beast! Trucy: Hee hee! You look great, Polly. Fills in some of that space on your forehead! Apollo: Argh... What is this thing? Trucy: It's a warding charm. Jinxie puts them on all the monsters she finds. Apollo: Um, but I'm not a monster. Trucy: Maybe I should have told her you're a good demon. Apollo: Or you could just say I'm human. Jinxie: *shiver* The red demon, emissary of the Underworld. Apollo: (I got up early to do my hair for this?) Um, can I take this off now? Jinxie: So you can eat me? Apollo: I'm not going to eat you! Jinxie: Eek! Forgive me, O terrible one! Trucy: Tone down your Chords of Steel, Apollo. You're scaring her out of her wits! Apollo: Um, don't worry. I'm already full. Jinxie: Please stay that way. Apollo: (Great, now I'm playing along, too.) Talk Nine-Tails Vale Apollo: Um, so I wanted to ask you about Nine-Tails Vale... Jinxie: Eeeeeek! Apollo: Aaaaugh! Jinxie: Be gone, foul demon! Trucy: Looks like you've been demonized, Polly, literally! Apollo: I'm starting to wonder if I really am a demon myself. Um... Jinxie: Eek! Please don't eat me. I have food if you're hungry. Apollo: This isn't working. We won't get anything out of her until we set the record straight. Trucy: Hmmm... If only we had some way to prove you're not as scary as you look. Apollo: (Ouch, unnecessary roughness... Looks like I have to present some proof. Proof that I'm one hundred percent human! (Changed from [Proof that I'm 100% human!] in the original release)) Present Attorney's Badge Apollo: Would you mind taking a look at this? Jinxie: Eeeeek! No, thank you! Be gone, foul demon! Apollo: Ack, banished again. Trucy: That's what you get when you flash a girl like that -- even if it was just your badge. Apollo: Sheesh, you make it sound like I'm some kind of creep. Attorney's Badge (after clearing \"Nine-Tails Vale\" Talk option) Leads to: \"Um, I wanted to show you this.\" Apollo: Um, I wanted to show you this. Jinxie: Eek! What is it?! Apollo: It's my attorney's badge. You see? I'm not a demon, I'm a lawyer. Jinxie: Really?! ...You're a lawyer? Apollo: (Whew... Maybe now she'll stop calling me a demon.) Jinxie: Does it protect you from Enma Dai-O's judgment? Apollo: Who's Enma Dai-O? Trucy: I read somewhere that he's the demon lord who punishes the dead for their sins. (Changed from [I read somewhere that's [sic] he's the demon lord who punishes the dead for their sins.] in the original release) Uh-oh! I think now she thinks you're a demon lawyer from hell, Polly! Apollo: Can I go back to being just a normal demon?! Jinxie: Please... Please don't boil me in a scalding cauldron. I'd prefer a Turkish bath if possible. Apollo: (A Turkish bath? Isn't that more sauna than bath?) Trucy: Don't worry, Jinxie, he's a good demon. He'll save you if you ever go astray! Jinxie: Eek! Please, Mr. Demon Lawyer, sir, have mercy on my soul! Apollo: Argh! I told you, I'm not a demon! And Trucy, you're just making things wors--! (Ack!) Umm... You just leave that Enma Dai-O to me. Trucy: Isn't that great, Jinxie?! Jinxie: Uh-huh. I'm no longer scared to cross into the afterlife. Apollo: (Will someone tell these two I'm human, already!) Talk Nine-Tails Vale Trucy: So, Jinxie, I hear this village is the epicenter of the monster craze. Jinxie: Uh-huh. Barely anyone had even heard of it before, but now it's packed with tourists. Apollo: Really? So, the monster craze is the reason behind today's festival? Jinxie: It was the alderman's idea. But I'd be careful if I were you. There are lots and lots of yokai prowling about Nine-Tails Vale. Apollo: Prowling about? You mean like wild animals or something? Jinxie: Uh-huh. And they're hungry, too. Apollo: Man-eating monsters?! And they're all over the place? Jinxie: Uh-huh. In fact, there was one at the manor yesterday. I heard the doorbell ring, but when I opened the door, nobody was there. It was the Ding-Dong Demon! How else could you explain it? Apollo: Well... When I was a kid, my friends used to play this prank called Ding-Dong Ditch. Jinxie: Well, that doesn't prove yokai aren't real. There's even one here at the manor. The demon Tenma Taro -- he's imprisoned in the Forbidden Chamber. Apollo: Tenma... Taro? The Forbidden Chamber? Tenma Taro (appears after \"Nine-Tails Vale\") Leads to: \"Um, about that yokai you said was imprisoned here at the manor. Is it true?\" Present Attorney's Badge Jinxie: So you really are a demon lawyer. Ummm... So, then, you must know Enma Dai-O, the Appraiser of Souls. What's he like? Apollo: What's he like?! Well, uh... he's um... He's bald, has a white beard, and... Jinxie: A-A-And what? Apollo: He shouts, \"Guilty!\" and \"Order!\", while banging his gavel. I call him \"The Judge.\" Jinxie: Oh, wow, he's as scary as I thought. Apollo: Nah, he's just an old man who's wiser than you might think. Apollo: Um, about that yokai you said was imprisoned here at the manor. Is it true? Jinxie: Uh-huh. He's a super evil demon named Tenma Taro. Here, take a look at this scroll. Tenma Taro's the dark demon you see here. He's super evil and super scary. Apollo: So that's the yokai imprisoned in the Forbidden Chamber? Jinxie: Uh-huh. He was defeated by the village guardian yokai, the Nine-Tailed Fox... ...and locked away forever. Apollo: So... you're saying Tenma Taro is still trapped inside the Forbidden Chamber? Jinxie: Uh-huh. But he's just biding his time until he can escape. Still, we should be perfectly safe! Because there's a reeeally powerful sealing charm on the door keeping it shut tight! Apollo: (What a... charming security system.) Jinxie: You can keep the scroll if you want. The alderman gave me this, but just holding it gives me the chills, so... Apollo: Ah, uh, thanks, Jinxie. (Maybe I'll give this to Mr. Wright.) Yokai Legend Scroll added to the Court Record. Apollo: So... I was wondering... Are those things on your forehead also warding charms, Jinxie? Jinxie: Yes, they're to prevent evil things from getting inside me. Papa told me to wear them. Apollo: Evil things? Trucy: Apollo, don't you dare take those charms off her forehead! They HAVE to stay there... forever! Got it?! Apollo: (I wonder what would happen if I did take them off...?) Jinxie: It's time for me to get back to work. Trucy: Thanks for inviting us, Jinxie! Jinxie: You're welcome. Oh, and before I forget... There's going to be a surprise event today. Even I don't know what's to expect, but it's sure to be fun. Apollo: (Better not be a yokai parade. She'd probably drop dead from fright.) Jinxie: .........Hm? .........Eeeeek! Apollo: Ahhh! D-D-Demon! (Oh, wait... It's just someone in a suit... right?) Jinxie: T-T-Tenma T-Taro! Apollo: Tenma Taro? (The demon from the Forbidden Chamber?) Jinxie: Eeeeeek! Please don't hurt me! Be gone! Be gone! Be gone! Tenma Taro: Hissssssss! Better watch out little girl, or I'll snatch you away! Jinxie: Eek! Charm charm charm...! Where's that \"Die and Go To Heaven\" charm?! Trucy: Oh, she put it on her own forehead this time! Apollo: ...She sure gives up quick. (Huh? Why's everyone hiding their faces?) Villager: Hey, you there! You mustn't stare at Tenma Taro like that! Lower your eyes! He'll steal your soul if you're not careful! Apollo: Huh? (Steal my soul? Seriously?) ???: Your devilry stops here and now, Tenma Taro! Apollo: Now what?! Trucy: Look, Apollo! There's somebody up on the roof! ???: Ah-ha ha ha ha ha! Villager: That booming laugh! Could it be...! ???: My nine golden tails are proof of my unassailable righteousness! With my band of one hundred minions, I vanquish evil from the land! (Changed from [With my band of 100 minions, I vanquish evil from the land!] in the original release) I am the wrestler of righteousness! Ya-ha! Wrestler: The golden lord of yokai, The Amazing Nine-Tails, is here! Fear not, good little boys and girls! For I shall defeat Tenma Taro! Ah-ha ha ha ha ha! Ah-ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Villager: Hurray! Hurray! It's The Amazing Nine-Tails! Wrestler: Up to your no good tricks again, eh, Tenma Taro?! Well, not on my watch! Tenma Taro: Aaaaaaaaaaaah! Wrestler: A-ha ha ha ha ha ha! There's nothing to fear now, my child! I have banished Tenma Taro! You and your people can now live in peace! Jinxie: Th-Thank you, Mr. Amazing Nine-Tails, sir! Wrestler: Now, I must be off! Another match and another foe to vanquish, await! Apollo: W-What was that all about? Did that wrestler just chase off a yokai? Looked like he came out of the alderman's manor. Jinxie: That was The Amazing Nine-Tails! He's a pro wrestler from right here in Nine-Tails Vale. But no one knows his true identity! Apollo: (Jinxie sure seems chipper all of a sudden.) What was all that about him banishing Tenma Taro? Jinxie: That was a yokai exorcism. It's an annual ritual where Tenma Taro is released, to remind us of his wickedness. In the end, the Nine-Tailed Fox drives Tenma Taro out, and purifies our village. But The Amazing Nine-Tails did the honors this year! Apollo: (So that was the big surprise, huh? The Amazing Nine-Tails and Tenma Taro, huh... Well, whatever floats her boat.) Jinxie: Oh, would you look at the time. I'd better get back to work. Please excuse me. Apollo: She's a strange one, all right. Trucy: I think she's sweet in her own special way. (Changed from [I think she's sweet in own her [sic] special way.] in the original release) Apollo: (Knowing Trucy, she probably has lots of friends who are \"sweet\" in their own way.) Trucy: Well, we still have some time to kill. Might as well see the rest of Nine-Tails Vale while we're here. Apollo: The fun never stops, does it? .............................. .............................. April 17, 3:40 PMKyubi Manor - Garden Trucy: I think I bought nearly every yokai souvenir that was for sale. Apollo: I know, because my wallet's running on empty. Trucy: Hm? What's with all the commotion over there? Apollo: Huh? Hey, isn't that your friend Jinxie?! I hope everything's okay. Jinxie: I-I-It's t-t-terrible! Th-Th-Thththth...! The--! The--! Trucy: Calm down, Jinxie! Tell us what happened. Jinxie: Th-Th-The demon T-Tenma T-Taro... ...He killed Alderman Kyubi! Apollo: Whaaaaaat?! Trucy: Wait, killed as in dead? Jinxie: Yes. And Tenma Taro did it! Apollo: Tenma Taro?! You stay here while I go have a look. Jinxie: P-Please, wait! Apollo: Huh...? Ack! Jinxie: It's a... Tenma Taro Warding Charm. It should protect you, but please... be careful. The alderman's in the Fox Chamber at the top of the main staircase. Apollo: Okay, got it! Tenma Taro Warding Charm slipped into pocket. April 17Kyubi Manor - Fox Chamber Anime cutscene Apollo: A-Are you all right?! Man: Wh-Who are you...? Apollo: H-Help! Someone call an ambulance! Apollo: The police arrived soon after that, at which point I returned to the festival grounds. Apparently, the man impaled by the spear was already dead. But there was one other person there, and he was immediately rushed to the hospital. April 17Kyubi Manor - Garden Apollo: Thank goodness the other man's going to be fine. Sounds like he'd only been unconscious. Trucy: You think Jinxie's going to be okay? Apollo: I'm sure she'll be back to her old self in no time. At least she's calm enough for the police to question her for now. (And I'd sure love to know what crazy animal left those feathers and tracks...) Trucy: Oh, look, here comes Jinxie. Jinxie: ...Hi, Trucy. ...Hi, Mr. Demon Lawyer. Apollo: Heya... Feeling any better? ...I was wondering if you're up to filling us in on what happened... Talk About what happened Apollo: So, the man with the spear in his chest was already dead? Jinxie: Uh-huh. It was Alderman Kyubi. When I found him, he was already... Apollo: (So the victim was the village alderman...) And the one who was found alive? Who was he? Jinxie: Damian Tenma. He's the mayor of the neighboring city, Tenma Town. They arrested him. *sob* Apollo: So... he's the killer? Ack! Jinxie: Nuh-uh! Papa didn't kill anyone! Apollo: Papa? As in... your father? Trucy: That's right. Jinxie's dad is mayor of Tenma Town. Apollo: No way! Jinxie: Errr... Yes, way, but he's innocent. Apollo: (This just got way more complicated. The victim was the alderman of Nine-Tails Vale. And Jinxie's father, the mayor of Tenma Town, was arrested for the crime. Sounds like we have some investigating to do.) Trucy: I know this is difficult, Jinxie, but you need to hang in there! Jinxie: I know. I'll try my best. Apollo: Would you mind telling me a little more about the victim? The alderman (appears after \"About what happened\") Leads to: \"So the victim was the village alderman? What can you tell me about him?\" Present Yokai Legend Scroll Jinxie: They sell those at the village souvenir shop. Apollo: They really went all out, making it look like a real scroll and all. Jinxie: By rolling it up like that, you can't see Tenma Taro's picture. It's so you don't lose your soul if you accidentally gazed upon him. Even if it is a souvenir, no one in this village wants to accidentally see what's inside! Apollo: I've heard of losing or selling your soul for many things, but for the price of a souvenir? Jinxie: I wonder how many innocent shop girls have fallen victim. *shivers* Apollo: Wouldn't it be better not to sell them at all? Tenma Taro Warding Charm Jinxie: That warding charm is my supernatural security system. It protects me from yokai -- ghosts, demons, and other things that go bump in the night! Just the other day, I was chased down by a demented camera demon. But I drove him back with my trusty warding charm! Apollo: (Camera demon? Sounds more like an overexcited tourist.) Jinxie: Still, I suppose it's not nice to repel every yokai I meet. I mean, there are some that aren't all bad. I learned that today. Apollo: (Um... Why is she staring at me like that?) Apollo: So the victim was the village alderman? What can you tell me about him? Jinxie: His name was Rex Kyubi. They say his family has ties to the legendary Nine-Tailed Fox. He was really kind, and he always looked out for me. He was a former pro wrestler, and I even heard he knew The Amazing Nine-Tails. Apollo: (A former pro wrestler, huh... Hmm... That's something to keep in mind.) With your father being mayor and all, I guess you're originally from Tenma Town, huh? So then, why did you come work here? Trucy: It was to overcome your fears, right, Jinxie? Jinxie: Uh-huh. Plus, Mama was from Nine-Tails Vale, though she's no longer with us. She loved these flowers. I always wanted to live where Nine-Tails flowers grew. Trucy: Wow, what a beautiful flower. And with exactly nine petals, too! Jinxie: Just looking at them gives me courage, even when I'm scared of yokai. Nine-Tails Flower added to the Court Record. Apollo: Jinxie, when you first told us what happened, you said the killer was a demon. Jinxie: Uh-huh. The warding charm on the Forbidden Chamber's door... It's been... removed. Apollo: (The Forbidden Chamber's door? That big door that was barred shut? There wasn't a charm on it when I checked it out, so I guess it was removed by someone...) Jinxie: That's how Tenma Taro escaped! Ooh... Ooooooh! But when... when I try and remember what happened, it all goes... fuzzy. Trucy: Jinxie, you should do get some rest. You've been through a lot today. Apollo: (Between the warding charm being removed, and the black feathers and weird tracks... ...I could see how a superstitious person might think a demon was the killer.) Trucy: Apollo! Maybe this is your chance. Apollo: Chance for what? Trucy: To do the right thing and defend Jinxie's dad in court! Apollo: Who, me? Wouldn't a man like Mayor Tenma have access to more experienced lawyers? Jinxie: Umm... You wanna know what the detectives said? They doubted there was a lawyer who could get a not-guilty verdict in this one. Apollo: (Sounds like they're expecting an open and shut case.) Trucy: Don't worry, Jinxie! If anyone can prove your dad's innocence, it's Polly! Apollo: Wha--?! Trucy: You'll accept the case, won't you, Polly! Jinxie: Ooh... It's all over, isn't it? I'll... I'll be all alone... for the rest of my life. Apollo: (Oh, right... Jinxie already lost her mother.) ...All right. Jinxie, leave your father's defense to me! Trucy: Atta boy, Polly! Jinxie: You're going to help Papa, Mr. Demon Lawyer? Apollo: Yep, because that's what lawyers do. (Plus, no toilet cleaning for a while!) I'll do whatever it takes to make sure your father walks away a free man! Jinxie: Th-Thank you, Mr. Demon Lawyer! I can tell you're one of the good ones. Red Demons are usually so mean. Apollo: (It's been awhile, but I'll be fine! Ready or not, here comes Justice! Guess I oughta go and meet my new client.) Ah, but before I forget... (Better jot this down in my notebook.) Trucy: Hey, Apollo, what's the notebook for? Apollo: Oh, I just thought I should jot down some stuff about the case. And so I don't misplace them, I'm putting my Notes in the Court Record. I guess it's what you would call a \"To-Do\" list. Trucy: Oh? Sounds handy. Apollo: (To read my notes, I just open the Court Record with [R / RB / E]. Then I can switch between the tabs using [L / LB / Q] and [R / RB / E].) Trucy: Oh, I almost forgot! So, about Jinxie's father... No matter how scary he seems, promise me you'll resist the urge to run away! Apollo: Wait, what? Jinxie: His angry glare can paralyze you with fear. Trucy: And some claim he can even shoot laser beams from his eyes. Jinxie: Well, maybe Papa isn't really THAT scary... Apollo: (A paralyzing stare... Laser beams from his eyes... He sounds like some kind of monster.) Trucy: Hm, I think it's about time I see Jinxie off. I'll head back to the office after I'm done. Apollo: Okay, thanks. April 17Detention Center - Visitor's Room Apollo: Ah, visiting hours. Perfect timing. (Hope he's not as scary as he sounds...) ???: ...Who are you? Apollo: (Yikes!) S-So you're Damian Tenma, r-right?! I'm, uhh... I'm Apollo Justice, attorney-at-law! I'm here to, uhh... I'm here to help! Huh? Aaaaaaaaaaah! (Lemme outta here!) S-Sorry, sorry! I get a little loud sometimes! Tenma: How... incredibly... RUDE! Apollo: Umm, sorry. Did I do something to offend you? Tenma: A visitor when all others shun me like a common criminal! And here I am with nothing to offer! I am the epitome of rude! Apollo: (.........Wait, so he wasn't mad at me?) Tenma: Unworthy as I am, I, Damian Tenma, shall breach these walls... ...so that I may treat my benefactor to some tea, and maybe some cookies, too. Apollo: No, wait! We can do tea and cookies after we prove your innocence! How about you start by telling me what happened? Tenma: Hrmmm... I see. So tea and cookies can wait, can they? Apollo: (Whew, that was close. We don't need \"jailbreak\" added to the list of charges. Seems like a good guy, but with a face like that, I can see why he's misunderstood.) Talk Reason for arrest Apollo: Mayor Tenma. Do you mind if I ask why you were arrested? Tenma: ! Grrrrrr! Apollo: Whoa! S-Sorry! I guess some things are better left unsaid! Tenma: Bah! Apollo: Excuse me? Tenma: To think a public paragon such as I could be treated like this! This arrest should have never happened! Apollo: Go on... Tenma: I fear the ill effects it will have on our youth! Now I've but one choice. I must leave here at once, if only to protect the moral fiber of our youth! Apollo: No, wait! You can protect the moral fiber of our youth after you've been declared not guilty! Tenma: Hrmmm... I suppose you're right. Apollo: (Phew... Our youth just came this close to quite a scare.) Tenma: My fingerprints were on the spear that killed Alderman Kyubi. That's why I was arrested. Apollo: Your prints were on the murder weapon? That's never good. Any idea how they got there? Tenma: None. For I hardly remember a thing, you see. I was fast asleep at the time. Someone must have slipped me a sleeping pill or something. What's worse, somebody clobbered me on the head. Apollo: I see... A drug induced slumber, and a blow to the head. No wonder you hardly remember a thing. Tenma: ............Ho. Apollo: (Huh? Was that some kind of strange laugh?) Well, I think we can safely assume your prints were planted while you were unconscious. Motive Apollo: What do the police have on you as far as a motive is concerned? Tenma: Truth be told, there's been a bit of trouble between the alderman and I as of late. Apollo: Oh? Was it personal in nature? Tenma: Nothing like that. It's a long story... ...but suffice to say, I've been pushing to merge Nine-Tails Vale with Tenma Town. Surrender Nine-Tails Vale to Tenma Town now!!! Apollo: Yikes! Tenma: ...That's what I told him. Apollo: (I'd like to tell YOU to stop shouting like that, but I'm too scared!) So, um, that's the motive the police have established for the alderman's murder? Tenma: Indeed it is. After all, Alderman Kyubi was dead set against a municipal merger. Apollo: And that's why they think you killed him, he was in your way. Tenma: Arrrrrrgh! Cuuuurrrrssseeees! Apollo: Um, M-Mayor Tenma? Are you okay...? Tenma: Jinxie! Forgive me! I never meant to worry you like this! Apollo: It'll work out fine! Just leave it to me! (If only it really were that easy. I don't even know where to start...) Present Attorney's Badge Tenma: ......Thank you for agreeing to defend me. Apollo: Oh, no thanks required. Just doing my job. Tenma: ............ ............ Apollo: (He's even scarier when he's not saying anything.) Um... Nice day today, huh? Tenma: ............Hrmmm. Apollo: I, um, love nice days like these. It's, uh, perfect lawyering weather, heh heh heh! Tenma: The trial......... is tomorrow. Apollo: Yes, right, the trial! (Why do I keep blabbering on like that?) Tenma Taro Warding Charm Apollo: Those charms on your head... They're the same as this one, correct? Tenma: Indeed they are. Jinxie applied them after the murder. She said they would keep Tenma Taro from possessing me. Apollo: Oh, right! (So it's not some creepy fashion statement.) Still, there are an awful lot of them. Tenma: That there are. Truth be told, my head's feeling a bit... itchy. Apollo: Can't you just peel them off? Tenma: Jinxie did this for me. I could not hurt her feelings like that. Apollo: (He really cares for his daughter.) Anything else Apollo: I wanted to show you this. Tenma: ! Apollo: Aaagh! Sorry! Tenma: ............... Apollo: (I hate when he clams up like this.) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: Thank you for meeting with me, Mayor Tenma. Tenma: Please, wait. My daughter, Jinxie... Apollo: Yes? Tenma: She... she already lost her mother. And now with me being held in here, I fear she'll be terribly lonely. I hesitate to ask, but......... I beg you, be a friend to her in her time of need. Apollo: Leave it to me! Trucy and I will look out for your daughter! Tenma: I shall rest a little easier, then. You know, you remind me of some of the new friends Jinxie has been talking about. Apollo: New... friends? Tenma: Yes. It seems she's made some new friends since she started working in Nine-Tails Vale. They're quite the unusual bunch, too. There's a lady with an exceptionally long neck... ...a young lad with an incredibly long tongue, and many other interesting characters. Apollo: (Friends? Sounds more like a bunch of monsters to me!) Tenma: Now, if you would excuse me. It appears my time is up. Apollo: (Whew... Why am I so tired? I must've been more tense than I thought... Still, I'm glad he didn't turn out to be as scary as he looks!) A call? ...Oh, it's Mr. Wright. Justice here. Phoenix: Apollo, is that you? Apollo: Hi, Mr. Wright. What can I do for you? Phoenix: Trucy told me you've taken on a new case. Apollo: Oh, that. It was kinda spur of the moment. (He's actually calling ME about a case?) Phoenix: That's fine, but I have a favor to ask. Apollo: Sure. What is it? Phoenix: I'm at the airport right now. There was someone I had to meet. A new addition to the agency, actually. Her name's Athena Cykes, and she just passed the bar. Apollo: (That's right. I remember hearing about her coming to join us. Guess that was today.) Phoenix: She took off as soon as I told her you needed help with a case. It was like there was no stopping her. Apollo: Wait... Whaaaaaat! Where is she now? Phoenix: Probably somewhere in Nine-Tails Vale by now. That's where that favor I mentioned comes in. I need you to go find her. Apollo: But I've never even met her before. What does she look like? Phoenix: She'll be the girl in the yellow suit sporting an attorney's badge. Apollo: Okay, I'll find her. A new addition to the agency... (Well, I'd better get back to Nine-Tails Vale quick.) Wright Anything Agency Talk Any ideas? Apollo: Trucy, I'd like to hear your thoughts on what happened. Trucy: You do? Does that mean I can join the investigation? Apollo: I could sure use your help, but remember what Mr. Wright said? \"Trucy, you're in high school now, so you need to focus.\" Trucy: Right... I guess I better pull it together. It's time to forget everything else and just focus on my magic tricks! Apollo: Wait, no! He was talking about your schoolwork! What to do Trucy: Welcome to Trucy's Two Cents! Go ahead, ask me anything! Apollo: Oh, um, okay... Jinxie's always plastering charms on my forehead. What should I do? Trucy: That's an easy one, Apollo. Just do this... 3, 2, 1... Ta-dah! Apollo: Do what...? ......Ack! Trucy: See! She won't be able to stick any more on if there's already one there. Problem solved! Apollo: How's that a solution? Either way, I still have a charm plastered on my forehead! Present Attorney's Badge Apollo: Check it out. Trucy: You're so lucky, Apollo. Everyone can see what you do with just a flash of your badge. Apollo: What about you, Trucy? People can tell you're a magician by the way you're dressed. Trucy: Yeah, but I can't always dress like this. Like when I'm at school and stuff. Apollo: You could always show you're a magician by making things appear or disappear. Trucy: You mean like this? 3, 2, 1... Ta-dah! Apollo: Umm, magic or no, aren't you a little old to be showing those things in public? Trucy: Hmm... Then maybe I'll become a lawyer, too. Apollo: You're abandoning your dream just like that?! Tenma Taro Warding Charm Trucy: Jinxie's warding charms... Hm, what if I incorporated it into my act? Might be fun. Apollo: You mean like having charms come out of your magic panties? Trucy: Exactly! And then I'd have them fly off and stick to audience members' foreheads! Apollo: Somehow, I don't think that would go over so well. Trucy: Then how 'bout I have them stick on my assistant? That would be you, Polly! Apollo: How does that make it any better?! And I'm not your assistant! Trucy: What?! But I could've sworn you were. Apollo: Where in the world did you get that idea? Anything else Trucy: Okay! Watch me make that disappear! Apollo: No, wait! That's crucial evidence! Trucy: But I wanted to show you my new disappearing trick! Oh, I know! If it's really so important, how about I make more of it appear! Apollo: Fabricating evidence is even worse than making it disappear! Trucy: Oh, well. Too bad. April 17Nine-Tails Vale - Yokai Lane ???: I. Already. Told. You! I'm a lawyer assigned to the case! I need to study the crime scene, so if you would please tell me where Kyubi Manor is...! Policeman: You can't fool me! You're just some delinquent high school student playing hooky! ???: You stupid, pig-headed...! This attorney's badge isn't just for show, you know! Apollo: (Looks like I just found Ms. Athena Cykes.) Athena: Tsk! Why won't you believe me?! Don't expect me to defend you in court if you ever get arrested! Policeman: Well, I'm the one who usually does the arresting, so... Say, shouldn't you be getting back to school? Athena: I already told you, I'm a lawyer, not a student! Policeman: That's it! Enough of your lies! You're coming with me! Athena: Aaah! Get your hands off of me! Anime cutscene Apollo: .........Urnngh... Think you can watch out for the bystanders next time...? Athena: Whoops! Are you okay? Apollo: I think so. (But that police officer's out cold.) Athena: I am SO sorry! I do that when people suddenly grab me. It's like a reflex or something. Apollo: (Reflex? Sounds more like a felony!) You're Athena Cykes, I take it? Athena: That would be me. And you are? Apollo: I'm Apollo Justice. I work at the Wright Anything Agency. Athena: The Wright Anything Agency? What a fishy sounding name. Apollo: ...It's a long story, but it IS a law office, among other things. Didn't Mr. Wright explain it to you? Athena: Oh, right, THAT Wright! So then, you must be...! Where have you been?! I've been looking all over for you! Apollo: (I could say the same thing to you.) Well, here I am. Now how about telling me a little bit about yourself. Mr. Wright didn't really tell me much... as always. Athena: .........Ah, of course! Feel free to ask away! Talk Athena Cykes Apollo: So, Athena, I hear you just passed the bar. Athena: That's right! And here's my shiny new badge to prove it. Isn't it beautiful? Apollo: Oh, so you must be a bit younger than me. Athena: Heh heh heh. A bit more than you might think, in fact! I'm only eighteen! Apollo: E-Eighteen? How in the world did you become a lawyer at that age? Athena: I skipped a few grades while I was an exchange student in Europe. And I got my license to practice law while I was over there. Apollo: All I can say is, wow... (She must be a genius or something.) Athena: I also studied analytical psychology! Thought it might help me be a better lawyer. Apollo: (Psychology helps her be a better lawyer? How exactly does that work?) The client Athena: So, tell me about our client. What are they like? Apollo: Oh, right, you haven't met him yet. Well... Apollo: ...And that about sums it up. Athena: He's more worried about his daughter than himself. What a wonderful father. *sniffle* Apollo: Wait, are you crying? Athena: I'm not cr-crying! There was something in my eye! Apollo: (Um, they're called \"tears\"...) Athena: Moving right along... Let's get down to business! Helping our client is priority number one! Psychology (appears after \"Athena Cykes\") Apollo: So, Athena, you mentioned studying psychology. Athena: That's right! I've always wanted to bring analytical psychology into the courtroom. The power of psychology will bring a breath of fresh air to the legal system. Apollo: Oh, really? So how do you plan on using it to defend our client? Athena: ...Um, well, for example, I can try to listen in on a witness's inner voice... ...and then analyze their psychological state with the help of my trusty partner Widget! Apollo: Widget...? Athena: This device around my neck here! Say hi, Widget! Widget: Hi Widget! Apollo: IT TALKS?! Athena: Whoa, you need a volume knob! Anyway, the little guy will sometimes say what I'm feeling. Widget: Awk-ward... Athena: Don't worry, you'll get used to it. Apollo: Now THAT I seriously doubt. Present Attorney's Badge Athena: Yep! That's your attorney's badge, all right! Its dull, grimy look makes me think of all the courtroom battles you've faced so far! I hope mine will look like that someday! Look out legal world, Athena Cykes is psyched and ready to go! Apollo: ......... (Actually, I just haven't polished it lately... Maybe I should keep that to myself. No need to deflate her dreams about \"work\" just yet.) Yokai Legend Scroll Athena: What an interesting picture! It looks like a one-on-one monster smack down! It must've been quite a battle. Which yokai do you think is stronger? Apollo: Seems to me Tenma Taro's ability to fly would give him an edge over the Nine-Tailed Fox. Athena: But the Fox has powerful legs. He'd pounce before Tenma Taro knew what hit him! Apollo: He won't be pouncing on anyone after he's dropped from way up in the sky! Athena: Errr... B-But the Nine-Tailed Fox is gold-colored! Gold is way better than black, so I'm sure he'd win! Apollo: What do colors have to do with anything? (Besides, everyone knows red is the best.) Anything else Athena: *sigh* Sorry, Apollo. Nothing's coming to mind. But give me an hour and I'll have it analyzed Cykes style! I'll get started on it right now! Apollo: No need for that! I was just wondering. After clearing all Talk options: Athena: ...Oh, I almost forgot. I have something you might be interested in. I got in on my way here. Think it might have something to do with our case? Apollo: A special edition covering our case? That was quick. Athena: That's the whole point of special editions, isn't it? To be the first to get the scoop? ¡Rápido! (Changed from [That's the whole point of special editions, isn't it? To be the first to get the scoop? Rapido!] in the original release) Apollo: Right... Well, let's see what it says here... (What's the deal with the Spanish?) Tenma Taro was seen.... wha--? He was seen flying through the sky?! Athena: Yeah, somebody happened to snap that photo near Nine-Tails Vale. The article goes on to say it might be connected to our case. Apparently, that photo was shot right after the murder occurred. Apollo: Well, there were black feathers and strange tracks at the crime scene. I'm not surprised the locals think a yokai was involved. Athena: Wait a second... Yokai as in one of those Japanese monsters? Mein Gott! You don't actually think it was a supernatural murder, do you? Apollo: Ha ha ha, n-no, of course not. (Now German? Why not plain old English?) Special Edition Paper added to the Court Record. Athena: ¡Ándale, Apollo! Let's get cracking on that crime scene already! (Changed from [Andale, Apollo! Let's get cracking on that crime scene already!] in the original release) Talk The investigation Apollo: Okay, what's next on the list? Athena: Investigating the crime scene, what else?! Well, what are we waiting for?! Last one there is a rotten egg! Apollo: We don't have to run all the way there. Athena: Okay... Then how about speed walking?! Apollo: (Why does this have to be a competition at all?) Present Special Edition Paper Athena: Looks like this paper doesn't shy away from stories on strange creatures. Apollo: Really? What does it say? Athena: They claim to have produced photos of Gourdy and a Kappa water sprite thingie. And just the other day, they got one of Konaki Jiji crying his poor old eyes out... ...followed by that infamous shot of Tenma Taro. Apollo: I don't know about a Kappa, but I bet the Konaki Jiji... ...is just a shot of someone's grandpa lost and crying up in the mountains. Athena: That's not very nice! They should have helped him instead of publishing his picture! April 17Kyubi Manor - Foyer Athena: Do you hear that? It sounds like a TV or something. Oh, look! There's a TV in that little room in the corner. TV: In other news... The mysterious masked wrestler The Amazing Nine-Tails... ...has been confirmed missing according to sources close to the wrestler. It appears he disappeared sometime after the special event held in Nine-Tails Vale today. He also failed to appear at a match today where he was scheduled to defend his title. Local villagers say his disappearance may be connected with Tenma Taro's recent escape. Apollo: So, that wrestler's gone missing. ???: Hey, you two! You don't belong in here! Athena: Eek! Apollo: Don't worry, there's nothing suspicious-- ???: What about them there horns o' yours? They look mighty suspicious if ya ask me! Apollo: Horns?! That's my hair...! Anyway, we're lawyers, and we're here to-- ???: Ah! You're them lawyers come to defend Mayor Tenma, ain't ya?! Eh heh heh. Shoulda reckoned what with that expensive-looking bracelet ya got there. The name's Phineas Filch. Filch: I'm the caretaker here. Pleased to meetcha, eh heh heh. Apollo: Um, same here. Athena: Wow, talk about a quick change of heart. Filch: So, tell me, Demon Lawyer! Betcha use them demonic horns of yours to scare the bejeebers outta witnesses, huh? Come here, ya lil' horned demon, you! Apollo: Youch! These horns, er... I mean, my hair isn't meant to threaten anyone! Filch: They ain't? Seems a mighty big waste o' perfectly good horns if ya ask me. Then again, ain't none o' my business, so... Apollo: *sigh* (That was fast. Guess he's done with me.) Filch: Well, I'd best get back to work! Athena: Athena: Halt! Stop right there! Filch: Huh? Me? Athena: Apollo, your bracelet's gone! Apollo: Ah! Filch: Don't ya worry, Mr. Lawyer, sir! I'll check the lost 'n' found later! Apollo: .........Somehow, I don't think that will be necessary. Just check your wrist right now. Filch: Arrrrrrrrrgh! The cat's outta the bag! Apollo: (It was barely in the bag in the first place!) Athena: That was a pretty pathetic attempt. Filch: S-S-Sorry! I'm sooooo sooooo sorry! Just couldn't control myself! Please, forgive me! I'm beggin' ya! Apollo: (Sheesh, I almost feel sorry for him now.) Athena: What should we do about him, Apollo? Apollo: Well, I got my bracelet back, and he seems sorry enough, so... Filch: I knew ya'd understand, Mr. Lawyer, sir! Ya obviously got a big heart! As big as the wad o' cash in your wallet, I hope, eh heh heh! Apollo: You leave my wallet out of this. Filch: Ho HO! Athena: Hey! Didn't you just finish apologizing for stealing from us?! Filch: Run away, run away! Head for the hills! Athena: Get back here, you! Apollo: (Talk about a quick escape.) ...Hm? Looks like he dropped a few things. Looks like a pair of diagrams. This one's of the crime scene, and here's one of the foyer. Athena: He left his shoes behind, too. Apollo: The guy's the living definition of a bumbling thief. Athena: Let's hang on to his shoes. We can give them back next time we see him. As for the diagrams, I say we keep them! Apollo: They look like something the police might draw. Wonder where the caretaker got them? Crime Scene Diagram added to the Court Record. Foyer Diagram added to the Court Record. Apollo: Now then, as I recall... ...the Fox Chamber should be at the top of those stairs. April 17Kyubi Manor - Fox Chamber Athena: Whoa! Where'd all these black feathers and weird tracks come from?! Apollo: The popular opinion seems to be that they're from Tenma Taro. Athena: You mean the great evil has returned? Apollo: Even if he did, I'd be laughed out of the courthouse trying to indict him. ???: Hey, who are you and what are you doing here? This is a crime scene! Apollo: And who are YOU? Are you with the police? ???: I asked first! Who are YOU and what are you doing here?! On second thought... I'm placing you under arrest for disturbing a crime scene! Apollo: Ack! Under arrest?! B-B-But... ???: Save it for the boys back at HQ! Now, come quietly or else! I don't want to be late for lunch! Apollo: P-Please, wait! We're Mayor Tenma's lawyers! ???: Well why didn't you just say so! So you're the lawyers I heard about. Ha ha ha! I almost took you two in! You two sure were suspicious, though! Athena: I don't know how many more times I can take being called suspicious in one day... Apollo: Sorry, we didn't catch your name. Fulbright: My name? I'm Bobby Fulbright! The heroic detective who defends our good citizens from evil! The champion of justice who comes running whenever you're in need! And my catchphrase? It's \"In justice we trust!\" Apollo: Hoo boy... (This guy's a story and a half...) Fulbright: So! What can I do for you? Talk Investigating the scene Apollo: So, would it be okay if we had a look around? Fulbright: Certainly not! No unauthorized personnel allowed! Apollo: Couldn't you make an exception? Fulbright: Cease and desist at once, or you'll have to deal with my little friend here! Apollo: Ack! (Yikes! Is he reaching for his...?!) Fulbright: In justice we trust! Apollo: ...! (Phew, it's just his badge.) Fulbright: You may be Mayor Tenma's attorneys, but you still need authorization to cross a police line! Athena: Apollo, let's see if we can't change his mind! Apollo: Good luck! Let me know how it goes! (I bet he's as dense as heroes come...) Persuasion (appears after \"Investigating the scene\") Leads to: \"You're wasting your time and mine! Nobody's crossing this line without authorization!\" Present Anything Fulbright: Justice need backup sometimes, too! So I don't mind you asking for help, but you should start by thinking things over yourself. After all, the road to justice starts with your own first step! Ha ha ha! Apollo: If you don't have any information to offer, you could just say so. Fulbright: You're wasting your time and mine! Nobody's crossing this line without authorization! I'm a wall of justice keeping injustice -- that would be you -- at bay! Apollo: *sigh* I knew it. Look, there's just us and you here, right? Fulbright: Justice and me, you say? Apollo: Th-That's right...? Fulbright: Are you trying to say that justice and I aren't enough to keep you out?! Apollo: Um, what? Athena: ...! No, silly! We're saying that you're an inspiration in our quest for justice! Fulbright: No!!! It can't beeeee!!! Apollo: You have him on the ropes now, Athena! Athena: Um, if we were on the side of justice, would you let us through? Fulbright: B-B-But, guarding the crime scene is a part of justice, too! Athena: Sure... but only a bad guy would stand in the way of justice, right? Fulbright: Aaaaargh! Whose justice is the most just here? Apollo: Well, we can't have a fair and just trial without a thorough investigation, so... Fulbright: Hrmmm... Oh, Lady Justice...! What would you have me dooooo?! Athena: I think we really got to him. Apollo: Yeah, he seems pretty neurotic as far as champions of justice go. (Changed from [Yeah, he's [sic] seems pretty neurotic as far as champions of justice go.] in the original release) Athena: Our pleas for justice must've had a huge impact. It's tying him up in knots! Now's our chance to start looking around. Apollo: (After all that about authorized personnel only... this was surprisingly easy.) Fulbright: Hrmmm... Should I stop them or let them through? Whose justice is more just? Athena: Well, let's get to work! We're supposed to be finding clues related to the crime, right? (Changed from [We're supposed to being [sic] finding clues related to the crime, right?] in the original release) Apollo: Right. A search of the crime scene should turn up some evidence we can use at the trial. Let's try viewing the crime scene from different angles. Athena: You never know what's hiding just around the corner, right? So we move the cursor with [left analog stick / WASD]... (Changed from [Wait, but how do we go about changing our perspective?] in the original release) Apollo: And change our perspective with [right analog stick left/right / left/right arrow keys]. (Changed from [Touch the arrows on the bottom screen or press left or right on [D-Pad].] in the original release) If there's a particular spot you want to examine, just give it a tap. Athena: Okay, let's leave no stone unturned! Nous allons commencer! Let's get started! Examine Forbidden Chamber door Apollo: The Forbidden Chamber... They say the demon Tenma Taro was imprisoned in there before his \"escape.\" Athena: Think we could get this door open? Apollo: It's worth a try. Hrrrgh! ...No good. It's shut tight! I don't even see a key hole. Seems pretty hopeless. Fulbright: In justice we trust! Apollo: Yikes! Fulbright: Did I just hear the voice of someone in need?! Allow me to fill you in! This door simply will not open! We've tried and tried, but it won't budge! It's an essential part of the culture found in this manor, so we can't blow it up either! Apollo: (So, an unopenable door. Right.) Fulbright: According to Ms. Jinxie Tenma, it was shut tight when she came across the crime scene. Athena: Thanks for the tip, Detective Fulbright. We didn't expect you to be so helpful. Fulbright: Aaaaaaaaaaargh! Forget I just said that! Apollo: (So, the Forbidden Chamber was shut tight at the time of the murder. Sounds like something I'd better keep in mind.) Outline on table Apollo: So, this is where Alderman Kyubi's body was found. Athena: Apparently, the murder weapon -- a spear -- had Mayor Tenma's prints on it. Apollo: That's not good. Fulbright: Never fear, Detective Fulbright is here! Apollo: Yikes! Fulbright: Of course, I can't offer you any information on my investigation, so... In the name of justice, I must say goodbye! Apollo: Umm... What was that all about? Armchair on right Athena: Wow! This is a pricy-looking chair! Apollo: Apparently, the mayor was found drugged and unconcious in it. Athena: Really?! Apollo: Yeah, and when he came to, he was arrested for murder. Talk about your rude awakenings. Athena: So, he's the prime suspect in a crime he knows nothing about?! Widget: That stinks! Athena: Oh, poor Mr. Tenma. *sniffle* He must be feeling so scared and confused. Apollo, it's up to us to save him! Apollo: (It's like she's on her own emotional roller coaster.) Fox statues Athena: Look! This statue only has one tail. Apollo: Maybe it's the Nine-Tailed Fox's sidekick. I bet the number of tails represents a yokai's power. Athena: So... if you had two, Apollo, I'd only have one? Apollo: Wait. What? Athena: ...Not that it means you're better than me, got it?! Apollo: Like I said, what? Armchair on left Apollo: There's something wedged under this chair. Let's see if we can't lift it up and... Fulbright: Freeze! Apollo: Yikes! Fulbright: No disturbing crime scene evidence! Even if you ARE the mayor's lawyers. Apollo: (He does have a point there.) Athena: Hey Detective Fulbright, did you hear about the attack over on Yokai Lane? I hear an elderly woman was assaulted by a strange yokai shaped like a roll of cloth! Fulbright: And you waited till now to tell me?! I better get over there at once. In justice we trust! Athena: ...That was surprisingly easy. Okay, Apollo, now's our chance to look around some more. Apollo: (The more I get to know her, the scarier she gets. Hope she never finds MY weakness.) Cloth under armchair Apollo: Whatever this is, it's stuck on tight. Athena: Looks like a large bloodstained cloth. Apollo: The blood's probably the alderman's, but it's pretty far from his body. Wonder how it got here... (And why does this seem important?) Back of folding screen Apollo: (Nothing much to see on this side. Maybe I should go check the other side.) Weapons Athena: This one's a spear, but what about this one? It looks like a giant pair of pliers. Apollo: Looks like something a demon might use. Saw something like that in a manga once. Athena: Really? What are they used for? Apollo: Oh, things like pinching through cheeks... Athena: Eeeuuuw! Apollo: Pulling out tongues... Widget: Stop, stop! Apollo: Oh, and you should see what they can do to a person's eyes-- Athena: Okay, okay, I get the idea! But I'm sure THIS thing is just a simple can opener or something like that! Apollo: Demons eat canned food? I always wondered what they are besides people. Feathers and tracks Apollo: These weird tracks must've been made when someone stepped in the alderman's blood. Athena: Maybe the killer inadvertently made them when they were fleeing? They're pretty big tracks, almost bird-like. The feathers also point to a bird. Apollo: Then it must be one big bird! And not one of the friendly yellow type, either! Athena: Maybe it's some mutant bird creature! Apollo: So, your theory is a giant mutant bird murdered Alderman Kyubi with a spear? Athena: It's more plausible than saying a monster or yokai did it. Apollo: Sorry to burst your bubble, but a giant spear-wielding bird is by definition a monster! Front of folding screen Athena: It's a folding screen. I wonder what they were using it for. Apollo: I read that the Japanese used to use these in drafty rooms, but now they're just for show. Athena: You mean like... like my attorney's badge. *sniffle* Widget: Poor Athena... Apollo: (That cop treating her like a child must've really bothered her.) Clock above door Athena: Apollo, what words come to mind when you watch that pendulum in there? Apollo: Hmm... Unsteady and umm... restless. Athena: That's a direct representation of your current state of mind. Apollo: Wait! That was some kind of psychological test?! Athena: My diagnosis? This strange case has made you anxious, causing you to lose your cool. Apollo: You're actually not that far off the mark. Broken statue behind door Apollo: Hm? There's something behind the door. Whatever it is, it looks like it's broken. Probably broke when the door was opened. Why would anybody put something there? Athena: Yeah, that wasn't very smart. Apollo: Maybe it was Jinxie. She was the first one to discover the body. She must have heard the screams and come running in here in a panic. Athena: Well, look at you, Apollo! Now you're using analytical psychology, too! Apollo: I am? Athena: Wow, you really learn quick! But I guess I shouldn't be surprised. You're the ace attorney of Wright Anything Agency! Apollo: (I can't tell whether she's serious or not. Now, if Trucy said something like that, I'd immediately know she was messing with me.) Intact statue behind door Athena: Doesn't this tanuki statue remind you of the manor's caretaker, Phineas Filch? Apollo: This raccoon-looking thing? Yeah, it does look like him! Athena: Ooh, I just got the best idea! We should knock it over! It might transform back into Mr. Filch! Apollo: Mr. Filch is mischievous, but he's not magical, you know. Athena: Way to waste a brilliant idea, Apollo. Air vent Apollo: Huh, that looks like an air vent. It's pretty high up there. Athena: What if you got a running start and jumped? Apollo: I doubt even a high-jumper could make it. Athena: Argh! Don't rule it out before you try it! Besides, I'm an excellent jumper. Apollo: Even so, that must be about nine feet high. Athena: Like I said, you don't know until you try, Monsieur Justice! Apollo: (She doesn't know when to give up and when to stop using foreign words.) Trophies Athena: Look, trophies! Ooh! This one was awarded to Alderman Kyubi! \"The Amazing Nine-Tails, Yokai Div. Winner, Tenma Town Pro Wrestling Tournament.\" Apollo: Yokai Division? I didn't know you could have a division of one. Athena: Apollo, you should enter the tournament next time! And I have the perfect name for you! The Mysterious Firebrand! A mild-mannered masked lawyer by day... demonic masked wrestler by night! Apollo: No one's going to hire a masked lawyer, Athena. Window Apollo: Hey, this window opens. And outside... we have ourselves a steep cliff. Athena: The window only opens about six inches -- not wide enough for anyone to get in or out. Look, Apollo! There's something caught in the window frame! It looks like gold fur. What a pretty color! It must be from some kind of animal! Apollo: Wonder what it's doing here. Did Alderman Kyubi have a pet fox? Golden Fur added to the Court Record. Window (subsequent times) Apollo: What's this gold fur caught in the window frame here? Could it be from some rare gold-colored fox found only in Nine-Tails Vale? Athena: You think a fox squeezed out of this window? Apollo: Nothing's getting out that way. There's a steep cliff on the other side. Athena: Hmm... It's one mystery after another. Statue next to armchair Apollo: Hmm... What do we have here? Looks like a statue of the Nine-Tailed Fox and Tenma Taro battling it out. Athena: Eek! Careful, Apollo, it's got blood on it! Apollo: Really? ...Hey, you're right. Wonder if it's the alderman's blood? Athena: How can you remain so calm after seeing all this blood? Apollo: Well, this isn't the first time I've seen something like this, so... Athena: You're no fun at all! At least act surprised or grossed out or something for my first case! Apollo: I'm already a lawyer. You want me to be an actor, too? Fox and Demon Statue added to the Court Record. Statue next to armchair (subsequent times) Apollo: Hmm... What do we have here? Looks like a statue of the Nine-Tailed Fox and Tenma Taro battling it out. Athena: Eek! Careful, Apollo, it's got blood on it! Apollo: Really? ...Hey, you're right. Wonder if it's the alderman's blood? Athena: How can you remain so calm after seeing all this blood? Apollo: Well, this isn't the first time I've seen something like this, so... Athena: You're no fun at all! At least act surprised or grossed out or something for my first case! Apollo: I'm already a lawyer. You want me to be an actor, too? Yokai figurines left of the window Athena: Look! A cat with two tails! Apollo: No such thing. Athena: Oh, and this lady has a really long neck! Ha ha ha! How funny is that! Apollo: There's no way a creature like that could ever exist. She'd have a tough time swallowing. Athena: Apollo... I bet you were one of those kids who didn't believe in Santa Claus. Apollo: What's that got to do with anything? After examining Forbidden Chamber door, outline on table, cloth under armchair, window, and statue next to armchair: Apollo: (Guess that about wraps it up.) Now if only we could get that detective to tell us what he knows... Athena: Hey, Apollo... Do you hear something? Apollo: Hm? .........I don't hear anything. Athena: Oh, right. Your hearing must not be as sensitive as mine. Apollo: Um, what are you talking about? Athena: A whooshing sound, like wind rushing through a narrow strait. And the echo of someone's voice... \"In... In...\" Fulbright: IN JUSTICE WE TRUST! Athena: Aaaaaaaaah! Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Someone's got a sharp set of ears! That was the sound of my righteous voice reverberating through the air duct! Athena: I heard it through the air ducts? Fulbright: Yeah, check it out. Apollo: But why would she hear you through there? Fulbright: Why don't we go to the diagram? As you can see, that vent is connected to an air duct that leads out into the hallway! The wind must've rushed through there... ...and carried my monologue with it straight to your ears! Athena: And what a... unique monologue it was. I was just thinking... Maybe the killer made their escape through the air duct or something! Fulbright: Heh heh heh, a cute theory, but I don't think so. The air duct in the hallway is low enough to climb into, that much is true. But as you can see, the vent in the ceiling is very high. Nine feet high, in fact. (Changed from [9 feet high, in fact.] in the original release) I highly doubt that there's any way to get up there without a ladder or something. And I don't see anything of the sort in this room, do you? Athena: Hmm... I guess you're right. Apollo: Speaking of things in this room... Fulbright: Yeah? Apollo: Can you tell us what you guys turned up, Detective Fulbright? Fulbright: Not on my watch, buddy! In the name of justice, I cannot reveal facts pertaining to the prosecution's case! Apollo: Aw, come on, throw us a bone here. Athena: Excuse me, Detective Fulbright, but I recall you saying earlier... ...that you would come running whenever we were in need. Fulbright: Yurk! I suppose I did say that! Helping those in need is what justice is all about, but... But keeping information out of enemy hands is also a form of justice! Hmm... Aaaaargh! Which justice is the most just? Why is this always so hard! Athena: Hmm......... Well, how about this? Let's do a little give and take. I mean, serving the public is part of justice, too, right? You know, like the police motto? \"To serve and protect.\" Apollo: (I doubt leaking information to the defense team falls under that motto.) Fulbright: Yes, of course! I must serve as well as protect! (Changed from [Yes, of course! I must serve and [sic] well as protect!] in the original release) Okay, I will share some information. ...In the name of justice! Athena: We did it, Apollo! Apollo: Yeah, we did it, all right. (But I'm not sure that was entirely ethical...) Talk Details of the case Apollo: Was it Ms. Jinxie Tenma who first discovered the crime scene? Fulbright: That's right. And this photo shows what she saw when she opened the door. Ms. Tenma had a key, allowing her immediate access. Apollo: A key? So, then, the Fox Chamber was locked? Fulbright: Yes, and Ms. Tenma had the only key to its door. Apollo: Really? So, Alderman Kyubi didn't have a key to the Fox Chamber? Fulbright: Actually, he had a master key for most of the doors in the manor, but... It disappeared after his murder. Athena: Disappeared? You think the killer took it?! Fulbright: It could very well be connected to the murder. We're looking into the possibility now. But it's the timing of Ms. Tenma's discovery that I think is most important. Of course, I'm not going to share that information with you, ha ha ha! Athena: You think you're some kind of champion of justice, but you're just plain old mean! Fulbright: I won't fall for that, you shameless rascal! I only help good little boys and girls! Athena: Shameless rascal? Who even says that? Apollo: Well, I wouldn't exactly call you a good little girl, either. Crime Photo added to the Court Record. Details of the case (subsequent times) Apollo: Was it Ms. Jinxie Tenma who first discovered the crime scene? Fulbright: That's right. And this photo shows what she saw when she opened the door. Ms. Tenma had a key, allowing her immediate access. Apollo: A key? So, then, the Fox Chamber was locked? Fulbright: Yes, and Ms. Tenma had the only key to its door. Apollo: Really? So, Alderman Kyubi didn't have a key to the Fox Chamber? Fulbright: Actually, he had a master key for most of the doors in the manor, but... It disappeared after his murder. Athena: Disappeared?

But it's the timing of Ms. Tenma's discovery that I think is most important. Of course, I'm not going to share that information with you, ha ha ha! Athena: You think you're some kind of champion of justice, but you're just plain old mean! Fulbright: I won't fall for that, you shameless rascal! I only help good little boys and girls! Athena: Shameless rascal? Who even says that? Apollo: Well, I wouldn't exactly call you a good little girl, either. Feathers and tracks Apollo: Those feathers and tracks look like something a yokai might leave behind. Fulbright: You don't actually think the murderer was some sort of monster, do you? Athena: What's the name of that creature in the Forbidden Chamber? Tenma... something... Because from the black feathers and big tracks, it looks like that creature did it. Fulbright: Our prime suspect would, no doubt, love to pin the blame on some imaginary creature. Athena: Can Tenma whatchamacallit even be made a victim of slander? Apollo: (I doubt the mayor would do something as childish as blaming a boogieman.) Athena: So, the most likely scenario so far is... ...that Tenma guy left the feathers and tracks behind... ...to make it look like yokai Tenma was the killer. Apollo: ...Wait, what? Now I'm as confused as you! (At any rate, I doubt Mayor Tenma would plant evidence like that.) Suspects Apollo: So, Mayor Tenma is your only suspect? Fulbright: That's right. Even his name, Damian Tenma, makes him sound like a villain. And he's really scary looking, too. Apollo: Wait, are you telling me that's why he was arrested? Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Don't be ridiculous! He was the only one without an alibi. Apollo: Oh, is that so? Fulbright: Yup. Other than the victim, the suspect, and Ms. Tenma, the only others around were... ...Mr. Filch and Mayor Tenma's aide, and the two of them were together at the time. Apollo: (Filch... The guy who tried to steal my bracelet. Just living up to his name, I guess. We should go talk to him again when we have a chance.) What about Jinxie? She's not being suspected at all? Fulbright: She may have no alibi whatsoever... but she also has no motive. It's unfathomable that she would murder the alderman, and pin the crime on her father. Besides, do you really think a little girl could lift up this huge spear? Apollo: True enough. That spear looks even bigger than her. Present Attorney's Badge Apollo: Um, so this is my attorney's badge. Fulbright: No, no! Present it with more confidence and conviction! Like this... In justice we trust! Apollo: Okay, um, how's this... Apollo Justice, attorney at law! H-Here comes Justice! Fulbright: That was amazing! But you know what they say, practice makes perfect. Let's see you do it ten more times! Apollo: Okay, I'll try my best! Athena: Um, Apollo? What are you doing? Apollo: (Ack! How'd he talk me into this?!) Anything else Fulbright: Justice need backup sometimes, too! So I don't mind you asking for help, but you should start by thinking things over yourself. After all, the road to justice starts with your own first step! Ha ha ha! Apollo: If you don't have any information to offer, you could just say so. After clearing all Talk options: Fulbright: That's about all I can reveal at this time. Well? You must admit, Damian Tenma appears to be the most likely suspect. Apollo: (I admit it looks bad, but I'm still not buying it.) Fulbright: Oh, and one more thing... I must warn you about the prosecutor. Apollo: The prosecutor assigned to Mayor Tenma's trial? Fulbright: That's the one. He's -- how shall I put it -- not what you'd expect. That is unless you've faced a convicted killer serving hard time as a prosecutor before. Apollo: What the--?! Is this some kind of joke? Talk The prosecution Leads to: \"Can I ask why a man imprisoned for murder is serving as prosecutor?\" Apollo: Can I ask why a man imprisoned for murder is serving as prosecutor? Fulbright: Because he's mastered the use of psychology in courtroom battles. Everyone's talking about how this murder was the work of some strange creature. But yokai are nothing more than a figment of the imagination. They're baloney! Who better to prove that than a master of psychology? He's the best man for the job. Apollo: But he's a convicted murderer! No matter how you look at it, that's just insane! Fulbright: Well, the chief prosecutor personally assigned him, so... ...none of us are in a position to question the matter, ha ha ha! Apollo: (This really is the dark age of the law.) Athena: This prosecutor... He wouldn't happen to go by the name \"Blackquill,\" would he? Fulbright: Bingo! Simon Blackquill. So, you HAVE heard of him? Athena: ...You could say that. Apollo: (What's that supposed to mean?) Fulbright: Well, I bet you don't know his unofficial title. Ever heard of the \"Twisted Samurai\"? That's Prosecutor Blackquill! Apollo: The \"Twisted Samurai\"...? Is that because he's a criminal? Fulbright: Well... Yes and no. You could say it also has to do with the effect his crime had on things. Apollo: How so...? Fulbright: His conviction is what twisted and warped the legal world into this dark age of the law. Apollo: What?! And HE of all people is going to stand in court tomorrow?! Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Never fear! I myself will be there to protect you! Apollo: ......... (That's reassuring, I guess...) Fulbright: Well, you kids knock yourselves out! Can't wait to see how you do tomorrow! Athena: Wait, Detective Fulbright. I've been meaning to ask you something. Um... Why are you barefoot? This doesn't look like the sort of place where you need to take your shoes off... Fulbright: Hm? Ah! Ahhhhhh! I hadn't even noticed. Why AM I barefoot? Apollo: (You honestly hadn't noticed until just now?!) .........Wait a second. Those shoes we found earlier... Excuse me, Detective Fulbright. These wouldn't happen to be your shoes, would they? Fulbright: Yes! Yes they are! My favorite pair, in fact! Thank you for bringing them to me. You must truly be on the side of justice! Apollo: (Don't tell me Mr. Filch actually stole from a detective?) Athena: Stealing shoes right off of someone's feet... That's pretty amazing. Apollo: I find it more amazing that Detective Fulbright didn't notice. (Well, looks like we've gotten all we can out of the detective, so let's see... Maybe we should go have a word with Mr. Filch. I want to hear what his \"alibi\" is.) April 17Kyubi Manor - Foyer Filch: This is just awful! T-Terrible, I say! S-Somebody, help! Athena: Oh, look, it's mister-- what was it again? Finch? Filch: No, no, no! The name's Filch, Phineas Filch! Apollo: (Keep on pilfering and you may wind up a jail bird instead.) So what seems to be the problem, Mr. Filch? Filch: Oh, it's just terrible! Terrible, I tell ya! Come quick! Apollo: O-Okay...? (What's the deal with him all of a sudden?) Apollo: Looks like some kind of mask. Filch: I-It's The Amazing Nine-Tails's mask! Apollo: The Amazing Nine-Tails...? (Oh, right -- the wrestler who appeared during the festival's special event...) What's his mask doing here? Filch: He'd never take off his mask like this! Someone musta killed 'im! Apollo: Whaaa--?! Wh-Who would do such a thing? Athena: Let's go talk over there in private. Apollo: Hm? Look... There's some white hair caught up inside this mask... Amazing Nine-Tails Mask added to the Court Record. Apollo: So, what makes you believe that The Amazing Nine-Tails has been murdered? Filch: Ya really wanna know, eh? You're a studious one, ain't ya! Eh heh he! Apollo: Yes, I mean, no. Er, I mean, just tell me, please. Filch: Well, it's like this. I'd dreamed o' becoming a wrassler myself! Hey, how 'bout ya join me in the quest for the champion's belt?! Whadda team! Me in my bandit's mask and you in that demon mask of yours! Apollo: Demon mask? Heh heh. Wonder if I could make it big. Athena: Apollo, let's save your pro wrestling debut until after the trial. Apollo: Huh?! Oh, no no! I wasn't actually... (Argh! Why did I let him pull me off topic like that?!) Athena: Come on, Apollo -- ask him about The Amazing Nine-Tails's murder already! Talk The Amazing Nine-Tails Filch: The Amazing Nine-Tails is our village's savior, and don't ya forget it! His trademark's a gold cape made to look like nine fox tails! He whirls through the ring, smacking down Tenma Town wrestlers left 'n' right! He sparked the monster craze, revitalizing Nine-Tales [sic] Vale in the blink of an eye. Yep, saved our village from becoming a ghost town. Now it's a yokai town, eh heh heh. Apollo: Huh, The Amazing Nine-Tails really does sound, well... amazing. Filch: Yeah, pretty amazing, huh? That's why he's worshipped like a hero 'round here! I'm proud to be from the same village as him. Athena: Come to think of it, you look kind of monster-like yourself, Mr. Filch. Guess it makes sense since you're from the same village as The Amazing Nine-Tails! Filch: Eh heh heh... I know! A lot o' people have told me I look like a yokai. Apollo: (Since when was that a compliment?) Ouch! What's the big idea! Filch: Eh heh heh... Check your pocket. Apollo: Hey, how'd you do that?! Filch: Keep it. I got lots more. Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy added to the Court Record. Apollo: So, you keep saying that the Amazing Nine-Tails was killed. What's the story behind that? The Amazing Nine-Tails (subsequent times) Filch: The Amazing Nine-Tails is our village's savior, and don't ya forget it! His trademark's a gold cape made to look like nine fox tails! He whirls through the ring, smacking down Tenma Town wrestlers left 'n' right! He sparked the monster craze, revitalizing Nine-Tales [sic] Vale in the blink of an eye. Yep, saved our village from becoming a ghost town. Now it's a yokai town, eh heh heh. Apollo: Huh, The Amazing Nine-Tails really does sound, well... amazing. Filch: Yeah, pretty amazing, huh?

Guess it makes sense since you're from the same village as The Amazing Nine-Tails! Filch: Eh heh heh... I know! A lot o' people have told me I look like a yokai. Apollo: (Since when was that a compliment?) Amazing Nine-Tails's Death (appears after \"The Amazing Nine-Tails\") Apollo: Are you saying he was murdered because his mask washed up along the river outside? Filch: That's only part o' it. The main reason is no one's seen 'im since the special event. The word 'round Nine-Tails Vale is he was killed by Tenma Taro. Apollo: You villagers really are superstitious, aren't you? Filch: That we are. We love conspiracy theories, too, like the mayor's diabolical plot. Apollo: The mayor? Of Tenma Town? What is he plotting? Filch: Rumor has it he's planning on releasing Tenma Taro. That's why he wants the merger. He'll open the Forbidden Chamber once he's in control. Apollo: That's quite a tale. Filch: Ain't finished yet! There was only one person who could stop the mayor. Our hero, The Amazing Nine-Tails! He vowed to battle the mayor of Tenma Town and stop the municipal merger! Apollo: ......... (I couldn't make this stuff up if I tried.) Athena: Apollo! We still have to ask him about the alderman's murder, remember? About the alderman's murder (appears after \"Amazing Nine-Tails's Death\") Apollo: Mr. Filch, would you mind telling us what you were doing at the time of the murder? Filch: I was in the caretaker's office guarding the entrance like Mr. Kyubi said I should. And I made double sure no one came in. I have a clear view of the foyer from where I work. Apollo: (He must be talking about this small room in the upper right. It definitely looks like you can keep track of the comings and goings from there.) And you have an alibi to back your statement up, Mr. Filch? Filch: Eh heh heh. I do, indeed! I was with Mayor Tenma's aide. Florent L'Belle's his name. Apollo: So, the two of you were together... That's a pretty sound alibi, all right. And nobody came in or out of the manor around the time of the murder? Filch: Kept watch here the whole time. Didn't see a soul pass by. And if anyone did, that there security camera woulda spotted 'em. Apollo: (So no one came in or out around the time of the murder... That means we're dealing with someone who was already inside when it happened.) So, do you think this mask is the real deal? Filch: Without a doubt. This here's the mask worn by The Amazing Nine-Tails. Apollo: What about that white hair I found inside the mask? Athena: Wait! I just thought of something! Remember the golden animal fur we found at the crime scene? Could it have come from this mask? Look! There's even a spot where some fur is missing. Apollo: Hmm... Then this places this mask at the crime scene at some point in time. Which means......... (What does this mean? Someone with white hair who is linked with the murder and is against the merger? No way...! Could The Amazing Nine-Tails and the alderman actually be...?!) Athena: Something wrong, Apollo? You should see the look on your face! Apollo: Oh, no, it's n-nothing. (Maybe Jinxie could tell us something, since she works here...) Golden Fur reattached to The Amazing Nine-Tails's mask. About the alderman's murder (subsequent times) Apollo: Mr. Filch, would you mind telling us what you were doing at the time of the murder? Filch: I was in the caretaker's office guarding the entrance like Mr. Kyubi said I should. And I made double sure no one came in. I have a clear view of the foyer from where I work. Apollo: (He must be talking about this small room in the upper right. It definitely looks like you can keep track of the comings and goings from there.)

And if anyone did, that there security camera woulda spotted 'em. Apollo: (So no one came in or out around the time of the murder... That means we're dealing with someone who was already inside when it happened.) Present Amazing Nine-Tails's Mask Filch: Hey, that there's The Amazing Nine-Tails's mask! Yer aiming to sell it, aint ya?! Why you sneaky, lily-livered-- Apollo: No, I'm not trying to sell it. It could be a key piece of evidence. Filch: Aw, too bad. Thought I'd hook ya up with this buyer I know. Apollo: Wait, you WANT me to sell it?! Anything else Apollo: You mind if I ask you about this? Filch: Hm? Oh, that... Right, right... Apollo: Well, does it ring a bell? Filch: Eh heh heh heh... Oh, it's ringing, all right. Ya wanna thank me for all my hard work, and I humbly accept! Apollo: No, this isn't a gift! (Should've known this was a dead end.) Kyubi Manor Garden or Detention Center Talk Any ideas? Apollo: Come up with anything yet? Athena: Oh! O-Of course I have! But it's not quite ready for primetime. Apollo: Huh? Athena: The truth will only be revealed once we've dotted all our i's and crossed all our t's. In other words, it's still just a theory, so I don't think I should say anything yet. It's the dilemma any great detective must face! Widget: Whatever! Athena: Tsk! Widget! Apollo: (So basically, you have no ideas. Thanks for nothing.) About the murder Apollo: What are your thoughts on the case so far? Athena: Well... I think our killer is most likely highly intelligent and stone-cold cool. I mean, just look how they killed the alderman: one decisive thrust, no hesitation. Apollo: And you know this how? Psychology? Athena: That's right! I've profiled the killer based on the evidence we found at the scene! I can almost picture the killer in my mind... A terrifying face twisted from hatred toward the victim... Big, bulging eyes full of murderous intent... A horrible gash-like mouth from ear to ear... And... wings, black and sinister. Apollo: Wings? That sounds like Tenma Taro! Athena: On second thought, scratch psychology. That last part was just my imagination. Apollo: You think?! Present Amazing Nine-Tails's Mask Athena: So who do you think is the man behind The Amazing Nine-Tails mask? Apollo: Well, there was that white hair we found inside the mask. I have a feeling it's going to be a valuable clue. Athena: We should run a DNA test on it. Ooh! And what if the results show that the hair's not human? Don't you think it's fun to fantasize about stuff like that? Apollo: Sure, as long as you're prepared to have that fantasy shattered by the results, too. Athena: In that case, let's forget about the DNA testing! After clearing \"About the alderman's murder\" Talk option in Kyubi Manor - Foyer: April 17Nine-Tails Vale - Yokai Lane Apollo: Oh, look, there's Jinxie. Jinxie: Milk, cheese, yogurt, ice cream, and... Apollo: (Sounds like she's out grocery shopping. She must really like dairy products.) Jinxie: ...a charm to make a better milkshake and another to cure my lactose intolerance. Apollo: (Maybe she should just stick to soy milk.) Jinxie! Hey, it's me! Jinxie: Eek! It's th-th-the demon lawyer! Apollo: Ack! (Not another warding charm... *sigh*) Athena: Um, Apollo? Who is she? Apollo: Oh, right. This is your first time meeting each other. This is Jinxie, Mayor Tenma's daughter. She was the first to discover the crime scene. Athena: Oh, so she's the one who--! Um, hello. My name's Athena Cykes. I'll be helping Apollo defend your father at his trial. Pleased to meet you! Jinxie: P-Pleased to meet you, too. Uhh... Um, where's Trucy? Apollo: She went back to the office ahead of us. But don't worry. Athena and I are on the case! Jinxie: W-W-Wait, how do I know you didn't...! ...That you d-d-didn't gobble her up alive! Apollo: Relax, I didn't eat her up! And I wouldn't do such a thing in the first place! Jinxie: Oh, poor little Trucy! *sniffle* Apollo: (I'm about ready for some tears of frustration myself.) Athena: She's quite an, um, interesting character, huh, Apollo... Talk The incident Apollo: Jinxie, do you remember any more of what happened? Jinxie: Not much. ...At least not yet. Apollo: But you do think Tenma Taro was the killer, right? That yokai we saw at the festival? Jinxie: I don't know anything about that! Apollo: Huh? But you said Tenma Taro murdered the alderman. ...It's okay, Jinxie. You can tell me-- Yikes! What was that for?! Jinxie: People see things when they don't get enough sleep. There's no such thing as monsters. Apollo: Huh?! (What's gotten into her?) So, if there are no monsters, you admit I'm human? Jinxie: No, you're still a demon! Apollo: ............ Oh, I give up. Athena: It seems like Jinxie doesn't want to talk about Tenma Taro for some reason. Apollo: But that's precisely what we need to know more about... Besides, she definitely thought there was a yokai there in the Fox Chamber. Jinxie, about this charm... Jinxie: Ah! That's...! Apollo: You gave me this when I was heading off to the scene of the crime. You thought Tenma Taro was the murderer. That's why you gave this to me, right? Jinxie: Errr... That's true, but... Apollo: If there's anything else you could tell us, it would really help. And it will help your father, too! Jinxie: Umm... All right, then. Tenma Taro did it? (appears after \"The incident\") Apollo: Why do you think Tenma Taro's the killer? Jinxie: I saw him. Saw him with my own eyes. Tenma Taro was right there in the manor! He escaped his prison... ...and ran right by me! Athena: Whaaaaaat?! Apollo: Jinxie, tell us everything you saw! Jinxie: I called the police after I stumbled on the scene. I was just about to head back to the festival grounds when... ...I saw Tenma Taro. It was right around here. He was running right at me! I was... I was paralyzed with fear. But there was no one around to help me. *shiver* The foul beast raced right by me toward the foyer. Apollo: Toward the foyer? Athena: Mr. Filch and Mr. L'Belle were supposedly in the foyer at the time. That means they would've seen Tenma Taro, too. Apollo: Sounds like we'd better get their statements. (Considering Jinxie's mental state, her eyes could've been playing tricks on her.) Athena: Um... Apollo? Remember the picture in this paper? Someone caught Tenma Taro flying through the air. I wonder if it's the same Tenma Taro Jinxie says she saw. Apollo: ...Don't be ridiculous! Jinxie: *shiver* Tenma Taro IS the killer. And he can fly, too. The Amazing Nine-Tails Apollo: (Jinxie works at the alderman's manor, so maybe she can shed some light on this.) So, no one knows The Amazing Nine-Tails's true identity? Jinxie: Uh-huh. They say no one's ever seen him without his mask. Apollo: Doesn't that make you want to know even more? Jinxie: Uh-huh. That's why matches where wrestlers try to expose their opponent are so popular. Apollo: Wait... you mean expose, as in strip them naked? Jinxie: Eek! You even think like a demon! ...The only thing the winner removes is the loser's mask. To have your mask torn off is the worst humiliation a wrestler could suffer! That's why their masks are more important to them than life itself. So you see, these unmasking matches are life and death battles for the wrestlers. Apollo: (That means this mask didn't just happen to wash up along the riverbank. There's got to be a story behind it.) Jinxie: No one can stop The Amazing Nine-Tails! Apollo: (Bet she'd be shocked to find out he's really the alderman.) The Tenma Taro you saw (appears after \"Tenma Taro did it?\") Apollo: About the yokai you saw at the scene of the crime... Anything else stand out? Jinxie: Actually, I heard this strange jangly sound. Athena: A jangly sound? Can you be a little more specific? Jinxie: My memory's kind of fuzzy... But I vaguely recall seeing Tenma Taro holding a staff or something like that. Maybe that's what was making the strange sound. Apollo: Does Tenma Taro usually carry a staff? Jinxie: Good question. I've never heard anything like that and it's not shown on the scroll. Apollo: How about in other documents? Any of them show Tenma Taro with a staff? Jinxie: This is the only known document depicting Tenma Taro. After all, those who needlessly depict the demon are forever cursed. (Changed from [After all, those who needless [sic] depict the demon are forever cursed.] in the original release) Apollo: Then what's the deal with the Tenma Taro you saw, Jinxie? Yokai Legend Scroll updated in the Court Record. Jinxie's Statement added to the Court Record. The Tenma Taro you saw (subsequent times) Apollo: About the yokai you saw at the scene of the crime...

(Changed from [After all, those who needless [sic] depict the demon are forever cursed.] in the original release) Apollo: Then what's the deal with the Tenma Taro you saw, Jinxie? Present Nine-Tails Flower Jinxie: The Nine-Tailed Fox is famous for imprisoning Tenma Taro, but legends say that he also... ...gave us the Nine-Tails Flower, and that he still watches over the village to this day. Apollo: Wow, coming here is like traveling to ancient Japan with all the strange beliefs and all. All those yokai, the Nine-Tails Flower, the Forbidden Chamber, and the list goes on. Jinxie: Uh-huh. It was like I should've been born here. Too bad the population is shrinking. But there's an effort underway to protect the yokai. It also helps the local economy. Apollo: Protect the yokai? You mean like endangered species? Jinxie: Uh-huh. There're even plans to create a yokai wildlife park in the near future. Apollo: Now I'm really starting to wonder about this place. Crime Photo Apollo: Jinxie, I wanted to show you this-- Athena: Wait, Apollo! You can't show that to her. Having her father arrested was bad enough. Jinxie: Huh? Did you say something? Apollo: (Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.) Oh, um, never mind. Amazing Nine-Tails's Mask Apollo: (Wait, Jinxie's a huge fan of The Amazing Nine-Tails. She'd probably freak out if I showed her this mask without the guy in it.) Athena: What are you thinking?! It would crush her if she figured out her favorite wrestler is dead. Apollo: Guess I'll spare her the grief, although she really could use a reality check. Jinxie: ? Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy Jinxie: Ah! Th-Th-That's The Amazing Nine-Tails! He... he lives in the mountains right outside the village. But he often comes to visit. Apollo: Really? He doesn't sound very secret or reclusive to me. Jinxie: No, he's not. In fact, he visits the village bathhouse all the time. Athena: No way! The Amazing Nine-Tails goes to public bathhouses?! Jinxie: Uh-huh. But like a true wrestling legend, he never takes his mask off. Apollo: He takes baths in his mask? Jinxie: Uh-huh. And he also has a towel that says, \"Wrestlers Wanted!\" Apollo: If I saw a naked guy in a mask and a message like that on his towel, I'd run the other way. Jinxie's Statement Jinxie: I saw... him... Tenma Taro. It nearly scared me to death. Athena: Do you see a lot of monsters, Jinxie? Jinxie: Uh-huh. *shivers* In fact, I encountered the Sunekosuri this morning. *shivers* Apollo: Sune... kosuri? You know, I don't know that one. Tell me about it. Jinxie: It's a mean little beast that trips you by bumping into your shins. I keep tripping all the time because of that pesky little thing! When it gets really bad, I stick Sunekosuri warding charms on my shins! Apollo: Um, how about investing in some shin guards, and watching your step instead? Anything else Jinxie: What's this? A Tsukumogami? Apollo: Tsukumo... gami? Jinxie: A yokai that inhabits objects that have been used for a really long time. The Red Demon and a Tsukumogami... What a strange combination. Apollo: (Is everything to her some supernatural phenomenon?) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: Why didn't you tell me you saw Tenma Taro earlier? Jinxie: Actually... Mr. L'Belle told me not to tell. Apollo: Mr. L'Belle? Jinxie: Papa's aide. Apollo: (Oh, right. The other guy who was supposedly in the foyer at the time of the crime.) And what exactly did he tell you? Jinxie: \"Keep the village superstitions in mind... ...before you go talking about seeing Tenma Taro at the time of the crime.\" Apollo: Village superstitions? Jinxie: They say you must not gaze upon Tenma Taro. But in the event that you do look... ...and then tell anyone what you saw, Tenma Taro will claim your soul. Apollo: And that's something everyone here knows? (Sounds like a bunch of baloney to me.) Jinxie: Uh-huh. Everyone from babies to the village elders know about it. But I didn't because I'm not from around here. Apollo: Hey, come to think of it... Apollo: (Huh? Why's everyone hiding their faces?) Villager: Hey, you there! You mustn't stare at Tenma Taro like that! Lower your eyes! He'll steal your soul if you're not careful! Apollo: Huh? (Steal my soul? Seriously?) Apollo: (The guy at the special event thing said almost the exact same thing.) Athena: Apollo, do you think this L'Belle guy actually believes in Tenma Taro? Apollo: I seriously doubt it. He's not even from Nine-Tails Vale. Athena: Then why would he try to keep Jinxie from talking? Apollo: Good question. I think we'd better go have a word with him. Athena: Time to unmask this monster of a mystery. Jinxie: The last time I saw Mr. L'Belle, he was relaxing in the foyer. Athena: Bueno! Next stop, the manor foyer! With any luck, he'll be there waiting for us! April 17Kyubi Manor - Foyer Athena: There's no one here. Guess our luck isn't so good when it comes to Mr. L'Belle. Apollo: Maybe he's out for a walk or something. (Hmm? Somebody left something on the sill of the caretaker's office window.) Oh, it's a TV program guide. Athena: Looks like someone circled a pro wrestling match. Filch: Hey, whaddya think you're doing! Athena: Eek! I-I-It's a...! Oh, Mr. Filch! Wh-What can we do for you? Apollo: (I bet she was going to scream, \"Monster!\" which really isn't much of a stretch...) Filch: Ain't nothing I need you to do for me. But what business do ya got with my TV listings? Apollo: Oh, no, it just caught my eye. Can I ask if you watched this pro wrestling program today? Filch: Yep, 'twas a match between a couple o' rank amateurs, though. It was a complete disaster. I reckon even I coulda done better than that. Apollo: (I seriously doubt that.) TV Listings added to the Court Record. Apollo: (Almost forgot. There's something I wanted to ask him.) Mr. Filch, did you see anything unusual around the time of the murder? For example, Tenma Taro or something like that? Filch: Huh?! T-Tenma Taro?! Apollo: So you did see him? Filch: Errr... My, how clean and shiny your forehead is again today, Mr. Lawyer, sir! Bet ya shine it up every day real purty like. The ladies must love it, eh heh heh. Apollo: Don't change the subject! And FYI, that was a seriously bad attempt at flattery. Jinxie said she saw Tenma Taro flee toward the foyer. So you must've seen him too if you were here! Filch: Yi-Yi-Yiiiiiiiiipes! Apollo: (Wow, I really pushed a button there!) Well, did you see anything or not? ???: ???: That is quite enough. I must ask that you not pester my friend anymore. Filch: Yipes! Forgive me for being pestered, sir! Apollo: And you are? ???: I am Florent L'Belle... L'Belle: ...beau divine and PERSONAL aide to Mayor Damian Tenma. Apollo: (Beau divine? More like yokai grotesque. This place is crawling with monsters.) L'Belle: OH! Excuse YOU! Apollo: Ack! Wh-What the heck was that for?! L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! It was just a little cologne. You had a look of stinky sweat about you. It's from my OWN original brand of cosmetics called \"Je suis L'Belle!\" *sniff sniff sniff* Oh, what a heavenly scent. Apollo: Ugh. I think you just paralyzed my olfactory receptors. L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! I suppose such a scent WOULD be difficult for a peasant to appreciate. I'll have you know, THAT is Brand No. 5 \"Bonjour.\" It's MY way of introducing myself. Enjoy! Apollo: (Where's my bottle of \"Adieu\" so I can return the favor?) Enough about the cologne. Please tell us what you saw around the time of the murder. Talk Keeping Jinxie quiet Apollo: I heard you're the one who told Jinxie not to mention that she saw Tenma Taro. L'Belle: Why that little--! So, she told you she saw the demon, did she? Athena: Mr. L'Belle, do you mind if I ask whether you believe in the village superstitions? (Changed from [Mr. L'Belle, do mind [sic] if I ask whether you believe in the village superstitions?] in the original release) L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Oh, PU-LEASE! I was merely trying to keep with traditions. Nevertheless, I will say this... I wouldn't stick MY nose into this whole Tenma Taro business if I were you. Bad things happen to those who do. THAT much is true. He is one... scary... monster. Apollo: That's crazy! You really expect me to believe that monsters are real? L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Well, YOU'RE real, and YOU sure look like a monster. Apollo: (Look who's talking!) So, Mr. L'Belle, you didn't see Tenma Taro? Aaah! L'Belle: Little Jinxie has an ACTIVE imagination. Isn't that right, Phineas? Filch: That's right. I didn't see nothing, especially not Tenma Taro! L'Belle: As for ME, I only see things of beauty. That's why I can barely see you. ...Pwh! Ah ha ha ha! Apollo: (I've got two words for this guy: total freak.) Your alibi Apollo: Could I ask you what you were doing at the time of the crime? L'Belle: In other words, you'd like to hear MY alibi. Tsk, to think you'd suspect ME of all people! Apollo: Oh, no, it's just a formality. We ask everyone the same questions. Aaah! L'Belle: How DARE you doubt me! That's an affront to beauty itself! You OBVIOUSLY can't see straight! Apollo: Urnngh... Like that spritz really helped...! L'Belle: What were WE doing, you ask? Go ahead, Filchy, answer the question. Filch: Errr... At the time of the crime, we were... um... uh... in this here foyer! L'Belle: Exactly! Good answer, Filchy, good answer! Filch: Eh heh he. Just repeating whatcha told-- Youch! L'Belle: You've said QUITE enough! Apollo: (.........What is WITH these two? Great, now he's got me talking like that.) Present Tenma Taro Warding Charm L'Belle: Yes? That's a warding charm, but why are YOU showing it to ME? Apollo: ............ (Guess it doesn't work on all monsters.) Yurk! L'Belle: Shame on you, thinking THAT would work on ME! Apollo: Blech! L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! You should be honored to be bathed in my beautiful scent, peasant! Apollo: Ack... (Now I really wish it would work.) Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy L'Belle: Pffft, The Amazing Nine-Tails? What's so AMAZING about HIM? I mean, MY glossies are selling WAY better than his. Apollo: You sell glossies of yourself? L'Belle: That's right. I have one for all seven of my hair colors! Apollo: ............ (Well, guess that's it. Civilization over.) L'Belle: Tsk, if you WANT one, you need simply ask. I'll even let you choose the color yourself. Apollo: No, thank you! Anything else L'Belle: Yes? Do you ALWAYS go around sticking your hand in OTHER people's faces? Apollo: Oh, no, I just wanted to show you this. L'Belle: Ah, yes, you DO have something in that grimy paw of yours. But I only have eyes for things of beauty. Now, if you would excuse me. Apollo: (Guess he'll only look at stuff that interests him.) After clearing all Talk options: L'Belle: Are we quite through here? I'm a VERY busy man, you know. Apollo: ...Right. Well, thanks for your help. (So, these two were in the foyer, but didn't see Tenma Taro.) L'Belle: Come along, Filchy. Filch: Where we goin'? Oh, right! Gotta practice them statements for tomorrow! ...Yipes! My eyyyes! L'Belle: You're going to dig your own grave with that big mouth of yours someday! Apollo: ......... (What does he mean, \"practice statements\"?) L'Belle: Now if you would excuse me, it's time to touch up my makeup. (Changed from [Now if would [sic] excuse me. It's time to touch up my makeup.] in the original release) Athena: Apollo, I know this sounds strange... ...but Mr. L'Belle seems unusually preoccupied with Tenma Taro. Apollo: Really? How can you tell? Athena: Well, it's kind of hard to explain. You see, I can read people's emotions from the tone of their voice. Apollo: You mean you have good ears? Athena: Something like that. People's emotions are expressed in the tone of their voice. And my ears can pick up even the subtlest of tones for some reason. Apollo: That's an interesting skill... But what do you mean he's preoccupied with Tenma Taro? Athena: I'm not exactly sure, but it was like he was... obsessed with the thought of Tenma Taro... That's what I picked up from his voice, anyway. Apollo: Everywhere we turn it's Tenma Taro this, Tenma Taro that. Hmm... Athena: We should go talk to the mayor, too. Apollo: Sounds like a plan. (We need to get to the bottom of that rumor about him wanting to release Tenma Taro.) April 17Detention Center - Visitor's Room Athena: Something wrong, Apollo? Where did your enthusiasm go? Apollo: (What am I doing asking the mayor if he has ever thought about releasing Tenma Taro?! At best, he'll think I'm an idiot. At worst... *shudder*) Athena: Oh, he's here! Tenma: ......... Athena: It's so nice to finally meet you! I'm Mr. Justice's partner, Athena Cykes! I'm looking forward to working with you, Mr. Tenma... Taro! Tenma: Hm?! ...Oh, yes. I look forward to working with you, too. Apollo: (Eek! Glad he didn't mind Athena calling him by a completely wrong name!) Athena: Apollo, he's just as kind and gentle-looking as I'd imagined! Apollo: (Lucky for you, after that blunder you just made...) Um, there was something I wanted to talk to you about. There are rumors going around about how you want to or did set Tenma Taro free. Tenma: What utter nonsense! Apollo: Yikes! Tenma: They always assume the worst of me because of the way I look! But those rumors don't have a shred of truth, I tell you! Athena: A little touchy about his appearance, isn't he? Apollo: (What he really needs to work on are his people skills...) Talk Tenma Taro's revival Apollo: Um... So rumor has it that you want to push the merger through... ...in order to release Tenma Taro. Of course, that's a bunch of baloney, isn't it? Tenma: Grrrrrr! Apollo: Ack! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry if I offended you! Tenma: So, that's the talk around town, is it?! Apollo: I can see how that would make you angry. Tenma: .........What if Jinxie's schoolmates start teasing her about this? Apollo: Huh? Tenma: I must break out of here at once! Her tormentors must be taught a lesson! Apollo: No, wait! First, we have to get you a not-guilty verdict. Tenma: Don't try to stop me! This is about a father's duty to his darling daughter. Hold tight, sweet Jinxie! Daddy's coming to save you! Apollo: Relax! We'll look out for your daughter until we can get you free. Tenma: Hrmmm... Is that so? You don't need me to... go straighten things out myself? Apollo: (Whoo boy... They'd probably call in the SWAT team if he showed up at her school. Oh, right. I ought to ask about the reason behind the merger.) Why the merger? (appears after \"Tenma Taro's revival\") Apollo: It seems like you were rather forceful in pushing for the municipal merger. Did you really want Nine-Tails Vale that badly? Tenma: Yes, well, it's quite an attractive prize in terms of tourism. BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: (Wait... Am I feeling what I think I'm feeling?) Tenma: Sure, I played a bit of hardball, but only when I deemed it necessary. Apollo: (I knew it. My bracelet's reacting!) Athena: What is it, Apollo? Apollo: Mayor Tenma may not be telling the whole truth. Athena: Really? How can you tell? Apollo: People invariably tense up when they lie. That's where my bracelet here comes in. I can sense when the person I'm talking to is feeling tense... ...because it begins to feel tight on my arm. Athena: Noooooo waaaaaay! You can do that?! Apollo: Wait, so you believe me? Just like that? Athena: Sure. Each of us has our own special gifts. Apollo: (Oh yeah. Athena has a gift, too: her special sense of hearing...) Athena: Still, what do you think the mayor's lying about? Apollo: I don't know, but it's our job to find out. (It's been a while since my bracelet last reacted like this. Let's see if I still remember how to do this... First I touch my bracelet ([X / Y / R])... Right! Now let's give it a whirl!) Present Bracelet Yes, I remember this feeling of intense concentration! The ability to see the smallest twitch, the slightest frown that no one else can see... Now, Mayor Tenma was lying somewhere in that statement he just made. And when he lied, a certain \"habit\" made itself clear just under his right eye. I just have to shift my viewpoint up and focus on that area! Pan to right eyelid Leads to: \"All right, I've got him now.\" Apollo: All right, I've got him now. His nervous tell should appear when he's trying to pull the wool over my eyes. (Changed from [His tic should appear when he's trying to pull the wool over my eyes.] in the original release) I've gotta pore over every word he says, and wait for it to appear. (Changed from [I've gotta pour [sic] over every word he says, and wait for his tic to appear.] in the original release) And when it does, I'll \"Perceive\" ([X / Y / R]) it! Tenma: Yes, well, it's quite an attractive prize in terms of tourism. Perceive right eyelid on \"in terms of tourism.\" Apollo: Leads to: \"Mr. Mayor, please, you can trust us with the truth.\" Perceive wrong area Apollo: Apollo: Something is upsetting you right now... Is that not correct?! I know because of that telltale habit of yours. Tenma: ......... Apollo: .........Well? Ack! Tenma: ......... I get that often. Am I really that strange? Apollo: Oh, no, no. Th-That's not what I meant. I didn't mean to imply there was anything wrong with you! Athena: Well done, Apollo. Now both of you are upset! Apollo: (Argh, let's try that again.) Leads back to presenting bracelet Apollo: Mr. Mayor, please, you can trust us with the truth. Tenma: The truth? I don't understand. Apollo: When you mentioned tourism... ...the bottom of your right eye started twitching. Tenma: What nonsense is this?! So what if it did?! Apollo: Please, tell us more about your merger bid. Tenma: What more is there to tell? Apollo: Why were you really seeking to merge with Nine-Tails Vale? Tenma: I already told you: tourism. The monster craze really revitalized the village, making it quite the prize. Apollo: You really don't trust us, do you? Tenma: What are you talking about? The village has been hot property ever since the monster craze started, has it not? Apollo: I think you've yet to realize that what you're saying contradicts the facts. You say that the monster craze really revitalized Nine-Tails Vale, so... ...you felt it would be an attractive prize for its tourism. But that would contradict this. Present Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy Apollo: Leads to: \"The monster craze in Nine-Tails Vale is a very recent phenomenon.\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: This evidence proves you're not being entirely truthful with us. Aaaack! S-Sorry, sorry! I take it all back! Tenma: ...Oh, forgive me. There was a fly that was driving me crazy. Apollo: If that's how he deals with flies, I'd hate to see him when he's really angry. Tenma: So, you think I'm not being entirely truthful? Apollo: Y-Yes... yes, sir. (This guy is seriously scary!) Leads back to: \"I think you've yet to realize that what you're saying contradicts the facts.\" Apollo: The monster craze in Nine-Tails Vale is a very recent phenomenon. It was sparked when The Amazing Nine-Tails rose up against the municipal merger. The village was practically a ghost town before then. Tenma: Argh! Apollo: So, you see, you couldn't have possibly seen it as an attractive prize for its tourism. What's the REAL reason behind your push to merge Tenma Town with Nine-Tails Vale, huh? Tenma: W-Well, umm... uhh... Ah... Ah... Arrrrrrrrrgh! Why the merger? (after perceiving) Apollo: Are you ready to tell me the truth now? Tenma: Honesly, I never wanted to pursue the merger in the first place. But I had no choice if I wanted to protect my darling little Jinxie. Apollo: Protect her from what? Tenma: I received a threat. It said either I go through with the merger or my Jinxie dies. Apollo: What?! Athena: How awful! Who would do such a thing? Tenma: I don't know. But whoever blackmailed me must be connected to the murder. Apollo: Wait, so you think the blackmailer and the killer could be one and the same? Tenma: Alderman Kyubi was immensely popular, so you have to ask, who would want him dead? The blackmailer who wanted the merger at all costs had all the motive in the world. Athena: But why go from blackmail to murder?! The merger protests won't disappear just because the alderman was killed. Apollo: Ah! (Could it be...!) What if there was another reason for the murder? Athena: Like what? Apollo: Maybe the blackmailer discovered Alderman Kyubi's secret identity! And his secret identity was a threat to the blackmailer's merger scheme! Athena: What do secret identities have to do with anything, Apollo? Apollo: (I have evidence revealing the alderman's secret identity. Maybe it's time to use it.) Present Crime Photo Apollo: Um... this is a photo of the crime scene. You didn't happen to see a yokai there, did you? Tenma: ...What in the world are you talking about? Apollo: Oh, no, I'm not saying I believe in monsters or anything, aha ha ha. Tenma: ......... Apollo: I-I'm sorry! Tenma: ............... Hrmm... Apollo: Heh heh... (Please, somebody let me out of here!) Ummm... so did you see one? You know, like, I don't know, Tenma Taro or... Never mind, just forget it, heh heh! Tenma: ............Huh... Huh huh... Huh. Apollo: (Is he laughing at me, with me, or even laughing at all? It's kinda hard to tell.) Amazing Nine-Tails Mask (after clearing \"Why the merger?\" Talk option after perceiving) Leads to: \"Mayor Tenma, please take a look at this if you would.\" Apollo: Mayor Tenma, please take a look at this if you would. Tenma: That's...! That's The Amazing Nine-Tails's mask! What is the meaning of this?! Apollo: This mask was almost definitely at the crime scene. And there was some white hair inside. Tenma: White hair... you say? Apollo: There was but one person with white hair in the manor that day. Tenma: Wha... What are you saying!? Apollo: You know which man I'm talking about, right? I'm talking about Rex Kyubi -- The Amazing Nine-Tails himself! Athena: No way! Tenma: The alderman was--! Impossible! Athena: Wait! Come to think of it, Alderman Kyubi WAS a former pro wrestler! So the blackmailer turned killer when he discovered the alderman's secret identity! Apollo: Um, didn't I just say that? But yeah, The Amazing Nine-Tails was a threat to the blackmailer's scheme. He opposed the merger and as a result, single-handedly sparked the monster craze. Athena: Even so, what was the mask doing at the crime scene? Apollo: There had been an event at the manor... ...and maybe Alderman Kyubi had taken part in it... if you get my drift. Tenma: This is absurd! Apollo: Mr. Mayor, do you have proof of the threat that was made against you? Tenma: Yes, a blackmail letter. Unfortunately, it disappeared after the murder. I'd been carrying it around in my briefcase but now, it's suddenly vanished. Apollo: The blackmailer must've taken it with them after they killed the alderman. (Well, at least we've clearly established the killer's motive.) (Was not an inner monologue in the original release) Guard: Mayor Tenma, visiting hours are over. Tenma: It would appear this meeting is adjourned. Athena: .........Apollo, do you really think the Tenma Taro that Jinxie saw is the killer? Apollo: I don't know. All I know is there is no such thing as monsters. Athena: What about that newspaper article? Could the killer have purposely freed Tenma Taro to do their dirty work? Apollo: Oh, come on! There wasn't any Tenma Taro to release in the first place! Athena: Yes, but the only suspects the police have right now are the mayor and a yokai. Apollo: (We'll probably be arguing whether there was a yokai involved in court tomorrow.) *sigh* I can already see that look of disbelief on the judge's face. Athena: Apollo? Are you all right? Apollo: I'm fine! I'm fine! I'll, um... I'll think of something! (I'd better because I can't very well say a flying demon was the killer. At this point, the only thing I know for sure is tomorrow is going to be one doozy of a trial.) To be continued (Changed from [To Be Continued] in the original release) Nothing to examine during investigation Apollo: Nothing of particular interest here. Area already examined Apollo: (We've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around.) The Monstrous Turnabout Image Gallery Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 April 18, 9:15 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Apollo: You okay, Athena? You've been really antsy ever since we got here. Athena: I-I'm just excited. This IS my first real court case after all! Apollo: (Yeaaah, a real ball of excitement she is... I know just what she needs.) ATHENA!!! Athena: Eek! Didn't you ever learn about indoor and outdoor voices? Apollo: I'm just trying to show you the best way to relieve your pre-trial jitters. Athena: By scaring the daylights out of me? Apollo: No, I find that shouting \"I'm fine!\" in a loud voice really relieves stress. It's part of my \"Chords of Steel\" voice workout, and a must before every trial. Athena: Y-You want me to shout? Here? Apollo: That's right. Here, I'll go first, then you try. I'm Apollo Justice and I'm fine!!! Athena: All right, um... I-I'm Athena Cykes... ...and I'm fine!!! ............Hmm... I think that actually worked! Apollo: I thought it might help. Always works for me. An old friend of mine from junior high and I say it all the time. Athena: I see... A proven remedy to calm the soul. I like it! Hey, how about we finish off with... ...a race around the courthouse! Apollo: The point is to relieve stress, not get totally exhausted! Phoenix: What's with all the racket, you two? Apollo: Ah, Mr. Wright. Heh heh, just a little voice workout. Hey, what's with the suit? Phoenix: Oh, this? I was thinking about getting my attorney's badge back, that's all. Apollo: That's all?! That's huge news! ...But why now? Phoenix: I have a feeling I'll be needed in the courtroom again sometime soon. But we can talk about that another time. Apollo: (No fair. Inquiring minds want to know. But wow... I'm so used to him in his usual laid-back clothes... That suit makes him look like a million dollars.) Phoenix: By the way, have you heard about the prosecutor assigned to this case? Apollo: Yeah, he's serving time, but before that, he was a prosecutor. He also uses psychology...? Phoenix: That's right. I've heard the rumors about how he was back before his conviction. Using the power of suggestion, he could make even the most stalwart defendants confess. Apollo: (Psychology in the courtroom. Been hearing a lot about that lately.) So, he must be a pretty scary guy, considering he's a prison inmate and all. Phoenix: So they say. They also say he'll cut you down if you talk too much. Apollo: Ack! I knew he was gonna be bad news! Phoenix: Ha ha ha, it's probably just hyperbole, at least I hope for your sake. Apollo: Wait, so is it true or not? Phoenix: Let's just say you should be concise and choose your words carefully. ...If you'd like to keep that head of yours attached to the rest of your body, that is. Apollo: Yikes! (Better tone down my Chords of Steel, too.) Phoenix: So, are you all ready? It might be a good idea to check the Court Record again before stepping into the ring. Apollo: ...Right, Mr. Wright! B-But I'm fine! Phoenix: I'll be watching from the gallery. Good luck! Apollo: Thanks! Athena: Okay, let's do this! Apollo: (The odds of pulling this off are ridiculously low, but that's nothing new. Believe in our client. Seek the truth. That's all we can do. Hang in there, Mayor Tenma, here comes Justice!) April 18, 9:30 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 4 Day 1Court Is Now In SessionAll Rise Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Damian Tenma. Apollo: Apollo Justice, defense team leader, is ready, Your Honor! Judge: I'd know that big, booming voice anywhere. As chipper as ever, eh, Mr. Justice? But who is the young lady next to you? Athena: I'm Athena Cykes, Mr. Justice's junior partner, and fresh out of law school! Judge: Well, now, full of beans, too, eh? Excellent! Makes an old man feel young again. Now for the prosecution. Hmm... It appears the prosecution is not ready yet. Fulbright: Never fear, for I shall explain! It's just a minor procedural complication, Your Honor. The prosecutor for this case is being escorted from prison as we speak. Judge: Prison? Oh, yes, of course. I almost forgot that he is currently serving time. Anime cutscene Officer: Yup, Prosecutor Blackquill's an inmate! But even a convicted murderer's still got a job to do and duties to perform. ???: ......... Apollo: Um... who's that with his back to us over there? Athena: That's him. I'm sure of it. ...Prosecutor Blackquill. Judge: *ahem* Is the prosecution ready? Blackquill: ...............Hmph. ......Enough jabbering. Get on with it already. Judge: Aah! Of course, forgive me! Apollo: (Urngh! Why are all the people related to this case so scary?!) Judge: Very well, Prosecutor Blackquill. Your opening statement if you please. Aah! Wh-What's the matter?! Blackquill: ......Must we continue to fritter away time like this? It is all right there in the indictment. An opening statement... would be pointless. Judge: Pointless? Oh, um... well... Apollo: Looks like the cat -- or in this case, the prosecutor -- has the judge's tongue. Judge: But, but... we need an opening statement as an overview of the case at hand. Blackquill: Hmph. Well, then, Your Baldness, if it's so very important, why don't you do the honors? Judge: Who?! Me?! Blackquill: There's a term for people who whine and fuss about how they need silly, useless things... ...and then decide they no longer want them once it's theirs: a selfish old fool. Judge: Huh?! Athena: Wait, was that the prosecution's opening statement? Blackquill: Hmph. Old dotards such as you are a plague upon the young. I pity your poor grandchildren, or is it great grandchildren? Judge: ! All these years, I thought the opening statement was the prosecutor's job... ...but I suppose I could give it a try. Might be a nice change of pace. (Changed from [...but I suppose I could give it try. [sic] Might be a nice change of pace.] in the original release) Apollo: What?! (He actually fell for that?!) Athena: That must've been the power of suggestion Mr. Wright was talking about. Judge: *ahem* The opening statement, huh... Hmm... Let's see here... The victim was one Rex Kyubi, alderman of Nine-Tails Vale. And the defendant, Damian Tenma, mayor of Tenma Town, is accused of his murder. Blackquill: ...And why, pray tell, was the mayor arrested? Judge: His prints were on the murder weapon. Plus, he had a motive: the elimination of the biggest roadblock to the municipal merger. The caretaker and the secretary, other potential suspects, both have alibis. And his daughter, who was also in the vicinity at the time of the incident, has no motive. Blackquill: So, in a nutshell...? Judge: I'd have to say the charges against the defendant are incontrovertible. Blackquill: Bravo, Your Baldness. Your years of experience shine bright like your head. Judge: Ho ho ho. Flattery will get you everywhere. Athena: He's playing Simon Says with the judge! Judge: Moving right along now, let's hear from our first witness for today, Detective Fulbright. Judge: Witness, please state your name and occupation. Fulbright: I am the detective assigned to this case, Bobby Fulbright! Oh, and I'll also be keeping tabs on old Blackquill here. Judge: I also heard you would provide protection if it ever came to that. Blackquill: ............Hmph. It would seem that I have been sorely underestimated. Apollo: (Wait, who's protecting who from what?) Fulbright: Still, I truly believe anyone can turn their life around, even ol' Blackquill here. Blackquill: Fool Bright! Save your platitudes for funerals. Get on with your statement. Fulbright: Ha ha ha! That's the spirit! Justice must be swift and true. I see it in your eyes! There IS hope for your rehabilitation and return to society! I will never give up on you! Athena: Prosecutor Blackquill doesn't seem to intimidate Detective Fulbright. Apollo: Well, you know what they say: ignorance is bliss. Athena: Oh, so that's why Detective Fulbright was assigned to Blackquill. He's so oblivious! Judge: Now, let's have your first statement, Detective Fulbright. Fulbright: You got it! But first, I'd like to say to the defense that justice will ultimately prevail! Witness Testimony -- About the Murder -- Fulbright: Alderman Kyubi was murdered with a spear that had been on the wall. The fingerprints of the defendant, Damian Tenma, were found on the murder weapon. At the time, Alderman Kyubi was asleep from a drug he unwittingly ingested. Mayor Tenma attacked his helpless victim, impaling him like a human shish kebob! But the sudden pain jolted the victim awake, and he grabbed a statue and struck back! Apollo: Alderman Kyubi had been slipped some kind of sleep-inducing drug? Fulbright: That's right. The accused was scared because the alderman was a former pro wrestler. So he slipped him a drug to make sure he'd be out cold and defenseless! Here's the autopsy report to prove it! Kyubi's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Judge: And the victim managed to attack his attacker, despite being impaled by a spear?! That sounds almost superhuman. Is it even possible? Fulbright: Well, he WAS a former pro wrestler, after all! That spear was probably nothing more than a mosquito bite to him! Apollo: Apollo: Not so fast! Don't try to brush it all off by saying the alderman had been a pro wrestler. Do you really expect us to believe he could fight back after being skewered by a spear? Blackquill: Hmph. Never heard of the incredible feats of which man is capable of in a pinch, have you? Like the samurai of yore, wrestlers can battle through intense pain. It sharpens their senses. I used to talk about it with a former wrestler I met in the clink. Apollo: I dunno... It still sounds a little far-fetched. Blackquill: Does it now? ......Then perhaps we should test the theory on you with the edge of my blade! Apollo: (I didn't sign up for this!) Blackquill: ............Hmph. And so your life is spared... for now. Apollo: (Please let those shackles be made of titanium... I don't want to die.) Fulbright: Ha ha! My investigations are as thorough as they are foolproof, or my name isn't Fulbright! I vow to resign immediately if I ever make a false arrest! Blackquill: The accused's prints were on the weapon. And he's the one person without an alibi. Quite decisive evidence. Wouldn't you agree, Your Baldness? Judge: Hmm... The defendant IS sounding guiltier by the minute. Apollo: (He has the judge leaning toward a guilty verdict, and the trial's just barely begun!) Blackquill: Hmph. What's more, a curious rumor about the accused is making the rounds. They say he seeks the merger for the purpose of freeing Tenma Taro from his imprisonment. Truth be told, I can think of no real reason to show interest in that backwards burg. Perhaps he's a complete nutter and really does seek to release an imaginary demon. Either way, he is raving mad and more than capable of murdering the alderman. Man: That mayor is a strange one, all right. I heard he went to a blood drive, but instead of donating, he tried to make a withdrawal! Judge: Order! There will be no gossiping in my court! Blackquill: Your Baldness. Please take a gander at those charms plastered around his cranium. I hear they're meant to keep him safe from possession by the demon Tenma Taro. Then again... Perhaps he's already under the demon's spell. Behold! The lunatic appears poised to lunge at you at any moment. Judge: Eeeep! Athena: Athena: The rumors and quirks of Mayor Tenma have no relevance to this case! Besides, those charms on his head... they're... they're just a fashion statement! ...I think. Judge: Hmm... Come to think of it, such things don't seem relevant to the case, do they? Athena: The prosecution will refrain from dragging our client's reputation through the mud! Blackquill: Oh, what a dreadfully fearsome lass we have here. Apollo: Whew, thanks for that lifeline, Athena. Athena: Careful, Apollo. He has the judge dancing in the palm of his hand! The power of suggestion is one of the more powerful tools in Simon Blackquill's arsenal. He's trying to manipulate everyone's impressions to suit his objectives. Apollo: (This guy really is bad news.) Judge: In any case, it seems the victim did manage to defend himself, despite being impaled. What sort of weapon did he used against his attacker? Fulbright: None other than this statue right here! Judge: It appears to be a statue of two strange creatures locked in battle. Blackquill: Two yokai to be exact. On one side is the Nine-Tailed Fox and on the other Tenma Taro. Quite interesting if you think about it. It's as though this very case were rendered in art. Apollo: Fox and Demon Statue updated in the Court Record. Judge: Mr. Justice, you may proceed with your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- About the Murder -- Fulbright: Alderman Kyubi was murdered with a spear that had been on the wall. Press Apollo: Apollo: So, those weapons on the wall of the Fox Chamber... I presume those are real? Don't you think keeping real weapons around like that is rather dangerous? Fulbright: No matter what he collected, the alderman insisted it be the real deal. For instance, he had a real demon's club in his possession. Apparently, one of his ancestors claimed it after defeating a demon in battle. Apollo: Wha--?! (That's got to be an old wives' tale.) Fulbright: Ha ha ha! The alderman had pure, unadulterated justice flowing in his veins! Whatever he did, he did it right! We've... lost a real champion of justice in his death! Blackquill: Hmph. Nothing but claptrap and balderdash if you ask me. Now stop your bleating and tell us about the weapon. Fulbright: Your wish is my command! Fulbright: The fingerprints of the defendant, Damian Tenma, were found on the murder weapon. Press Apollo: Apollo: It doesn't make sense, if you think about it. Prints could be easily wiped off. Fulbright: Hm. You do have a point there. Blackquill: I'd venture to say, he did NOT wipe off the prints because he COULD not. Apollo: What do you mean? Blackquill: ......... Athena: Looks like he wants YOU to figure it out. Well, don't just stand there! Show him who's boss! Apollo: (I'm... totally lost... so why don't you just tell me the answer already?!) Athena: I don't think he saw that plea for help. Fulbright: You feeling all right, kid? Running a fever, perhaps? Apollo: (I wish trials came with a reset button.) Judge: Well, the specifics may yet come to light. Please proceed, Detective Fulbright. Fulbright: At the time, Alderman Kyubi was asleep from a drug he unwittingly ingested. Press Apollo: Apollo: Come to think of it, a coffee cup was found on the floor. Was the sedative in his coffee...? Fulbright: Bingo! We found traces of a sleeping agent all over the inside of the cup! Blackquill: And that is why he was out cold. That is until he leapt to his feet upon being impaled by the mayor. Apollo: What an awful way to wake up. Blackquill: Heh. A rather stimulating eye opener if you ask me. I, too, would have risen to the attack, for to die in battle is the samurai way. Paradise awaits fallen heroes, but that hole in his stomach would make eating a challenge... Fulbright: Prosecutor Blackquill, please! Those morbid jokes of yours have no place in this court! Blackquill: ............Hmph. Says the jester in detective's guise. Fulbright: Moving right along...! Fulbright: Mayor Tenma attacked his helpless victim, impaling him like a human shish kebob! Press Apollo: Apollo: So, the alderman was drugged because he was really strong? Fulbright: Did you see those rock hard muscles of his? I'm surprised the spear even managed to pierce that armor-like musculature! I admit, I'm completely jealous of that righteous body of his, ha ha ha! Apollo: Well, he did look pretty buff, even in that suit he had on. Blackquill: Quite a difference when compared with a yellowbelly like you. Apollo: Yellowbelly? Who even says that anymore? Athena: Yeah, and the color's all wrong, too......... Ooh, I know! How about a squishy red tomato! Apollo: I move to strike both of your comments from the record! Judge: Mr. Justice's character is not the issue here. Now, let's get back to what happened after the far more muscular alderman was impaled. Fulbright: Yes, well, your average person would likely have died on the spot. Fulbright: But the sudden pain jolted the victim awake, and he grabbed a statue and struck back! Press Apollo: Apollo: Could he really have attacked his attacker after being impaled with that huge spear? Fulbright: Absolutely! After all, he was once a pro wrestler. The injustice of being drugged, then speared was answered with a righteous counterattack! Apollo: But does being a former pro wrestler make him superhuman? Fulbright: Absolutely! After all, he was one of the good guys, like a superhero on the side of justice. Even though he was retired, he could still don his superhero guise in times of need! Apollo: Apollo: You need to lay off the comic books, detective! We're talking about real life here. Blackquill: Setting aside the halfwit's flights of fancy, the fact is this. The court-ordered post mortem concluded the victim moved after his skewering. Apollo: (So, he found the strength somehow to attack his attacker, huh?) Present Fox and Demon Statue Apollo: Leads to: \"Did the alderman really strike the mayor?\" Athena: Detective Fulbright's testimony sounds airtight. No wonder he's so confident. Apollo: No, he only thinks it's airtight. It's up to us to poke some holes in it. That part about the alderman fighting back sounds like a big hole waiting to be poked. Apollo: Did the alderman really strike the mayor? Fulbright: What?! Are you questioning my sense of justice?! Apollo: Your so-called \"justice\" need to find itself a pair of legs to stand on. You claim the alderman struck back after the mayor put a spear through him. But the statue he supposedly used to defend himself creates a major hole in your theory. Judge: It would appear that the defense has a counter-argument. Very well, let's hear what the defense thinks is odd about the detective's statue theory. Kyubi fought unarmed Apollo: Well, the alderman was a former pro wrestler, so why would he even use it as a weapon? He could've defended himself with his bare hands! I mean, that's what pro wrestlers do! Blackquill: Hmph. You've a lot of nerve... ...but will you raise an objection in the face of swift punishment as solicitors are wont to do? Apollo: Um... Well... Not if I deserve it...? Judge: And you do! The defense will look before they leap next time! Is that understood? Apollo: Sorry, Your Honor! Can I try that again? Leads back to: \"Very well, let's hear what the defense thinks is odd about the detective's statue theory.\" There are no fingerprints Leads to: \"There are no fingerprints on this supposedly crucial piece of evidence.\" It's not broken Apollo: If the statue really was used as a weapon, why are there no signs of breakage? Athena: Um, Apollo? When was the last time you had your eyes examined? The statue is clearly broken. See the area around their hands? Apollo: Ah! Eh heh heh, guess I missed that. Judge: I'm afraid I can't let that one slide without a penalty. Apollo: Please, let me try that again! (Detective Fulbright claims that the alderman used the statue to attack the mayor. But there's a hole in his theory!) Leads back to: \"Very well, let's hear what the defense thinks is odd about the detective's statue theory.\" Apollo: There are no fingerprints on this supposedly crucial piece of evidence. And if you look at the crime scene photo... ...you'll notice that the alderman isn't wearing gloves. Judge: Yes, I believe he is quite gloveless indeed. Apollo: If he touched the statue with his bare hands, he should've left some fingerprints! Detective Fulbright, you DID take that into account during your investigation, didn't you? Fulbright: Arrrrrrgh! This can't be happening! D-D-Did I arrest the wrong maaaaan?! Athena: You did it, Apollo! You knocked Detective Fulbright off his high horse! Apollo: Well, it's just one point in our favor. Athena: Who do you suppose clubbed the mayor if it wasn't the alderman? Apollo: Hmm... Well, if it wasn't the alderman... ...that means someone else must've clubbed the mayor. Athena: You mean there was a third party there in the Fox Chamber? Apollo: Exactly! And this could be the big break we've been looking for! Judge: Hmm... There does seem to be a hole in the prosecution's argument. Prosecutor Blackquill, would you care to respond to the defense's assertion? Blackquill: Hmph. Apollo: (The least you could do is look at me while being dismissive.) Blackquill: Your mind is as dull as an unhoned blade, Justice-dono. Apollo: Justice... dono? (He's been watching too many samurai flicks.) Blackquill: It will take far more than that to cut down Simon Blackquill. A whelp such as you has no hope against my superior swordsmanship. Apollo: This is a trial, not a swordfight, Prosecutor Blackquill! Blackquill: Hmph. There is a perfectly good explanation for the lack of prints on the statue. You might recall that bloodstained cloth found at the scene of the crime. Well, it just so happens... that the blood was the mayor's. Apollo: So, um... what are you getting at? Blackquill: Hone your mind, boy! Why was there blood on that cloth? Solve that riddle and you shall see that the hole you thought you found is but an illusion. Apollo: Now let's see... How was that cloth used...? Was it used... By Kyubi as a head covering Apollo: The alderman was probably wearing it over his head. Athena: Wha--?! Blackquill: Do you truly think the alderman would show up to a meeting over the fate of his village... ...wearing this ridiculous-looking cloth over his head? Apollo: Sure. They had a festival that day, didn't they? Who's to say he didn't party a little too hard and just forgot to take it off?! Blackquill: ............... Judge: ............... Apollo: Okay, fine. So maybe he didn't do that... Can I try one more time? Leads back to: \"Now let's see... How was that cloth used...? Was it used...\" To wipe up blood Apollo: Maybe the cloth was used to wipe as much of the mayor's blood as possible off the statue. And in the process, the culprit inadvertently erased the alderman's fingerprints as well. Blackquill: Blackquill: But the mayor did not bother to wipe away his own fingerprints on the murder weapon. Why would he wipe down one weapon but not the other? Careful, now. Use what little brains you have left before you speak. Apollo: Gimme a do-over on that one! Please! Leads back to: \"Now let's see... How was that cloth used...? Was it used...\" To wrap the statue Leads to: \"Maybe the alderman wrapped the statue in the cloth.\" Apollo: Maybe the alderman wrapped the statue in the cloth. In short, he wasn't touching the statue directly when he used it to strike back at the mayor. Ah! Blackquill: ...Precisely. Bully for you, boy. Apollo: Aw, it was nothing. Athena: Apollo, don't let him start manipulating you, too! You just closed the hole for the prosecution! Apollo: I did? ............Ack, I did! Blackquill: Right. That a statue wrapped in cloth would leave no fingerprints is as plain as day. But this also proves there are no holes in our theory of the alderman striking back. Apollo: .........Oops. Arrrrrrrrrgh! Fox and Demon Statue updated in the Court Record. Blackquill: Now do you see how dull your mind is? Apollo: I'll make sure to sharpen it next time. Blackquill: A particularly frightening inmate once told me that... ...he always tenderly honed his blades before he went to work, like the samurai of yore. Judge: Samurai? Sounds more like a homicidal maniac to me! Blackquill: Actually, he was working in the prison kitchen at the time. Apollo: (Wait, so the inmate was a murdering samurai prison chef?) Judge: Hmm... It would seem that the victim and his killer were the only ones there after all. Apollo: (I was kinda attached to that hole... Now what?) Athena: Apollo, I just thought of something. If they didn't find anyone's fingerprints on the statue... ...who's to say someone other than the alderman didn't hit the mayor with it? Apollo: Why didn't I think of that! Anybody could've NOT left prints on it! Blackquill: Hmph. Then who, pray tell, struck the mayor with the statue? Please, illuminate us with your wisdom, young lady. Athena: There's only one answer -- the real killer! Blackquill: Prove the existence of this \"real killer\" then. What evidence have you? Athena: Oh, I'll give you evidence, all right! Apollo: Athena, are you sure about this? (Changed from [Athena, are sure [sic] about this?] in the original release) Athena: To borrow your words, Apollo, I'm fine! Take a look at this! Black feathers and tracks, allegedly from a yokai, were found at the scene. I believe they're from the third party who struck the mayor with that statue. Judge: Is the defense actually suggesting some sort of monster killed that alderman?! Athena: That's exactly what I'm suggesting! Apollo: Apollo: No, Athena! You just lost what little credibility we had left! Athena: .........Aah! Sorry, sorry! Guess I got carried away. Judge: Mr. Justice, we've no time to deal with objections between members of the defense. Apollo: Sorry, Your Honor. It's just, this kid's still, well, a kid... Athena: Ouch... You meanie! I'm reporting this to Mr. Wright! Judge: So, is this court to believe the feathers and tracks are from a \"yokai\" as you put it? Apollo: Uhh, no, Your Honor. I believe they are a fabrication. The real killer wanted us to believe some sort of monster murdered the alderman. Judge: Hmm, interesting. And why do you suppose the killer would do that? Apollo: Umm.... Why, indeed? Judge: Mr. Justice, you seem as new to this as your partner is. Apollo: Ouch... (This, I'm not reporting to Mr. Wright...) Blackquill: Hoy, Fool Bright, explain to His Baldness what these brats are missing. You know, the who and why behind those feathers and tracks. Apollo: Wha--?! (You mean you can explain all that?!) Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Our investigative prowess is without equal! Apollo: (I'm starting to think I chose the wrong profession.) Judge: Very well, let's hear about these so-called yokai feathers and tracks. Witness Testimony -- Feathers and Tracks -- Fulbright: This entire case centers on one man's attempt to crush opposition to the municipal merger! Mayor Tenma panicked when The Amazing Nine-Tails helped embolden the protestors. So he stoked the villagers' fears by fabricating a monster! The strange feathers and tracks he planted made it look like a yokai was the killer. Apollo: Those feathers and tracks stoked the villagers' fears? (Changed from [Those feathers and tracks stoked the villager's [sic] fears?] in the original release) Fulbright: Absolutely! He knew exactly how to prey on their superstitious minds. Blackquill: Those feathers only gave weight to the idea that the alderman was slain by a demon. The accursed demon Tenma Taro, that is. Judge: Tenma who? Blackquill: Tenma Taro -- the legendary demon locked away in the village's Forbidden Chamber. From a young age, the villagers are taught to fear the great, black-feathered demon. And thus were they blinded to other, more plausible explanations. Apollo: Apollo: Hold on for a second. Before we start letting our imaginations run wild... Isn't there someone else that could be considered a suspect? Judge: Mr. Justice, please explain yourself. Apollo: On the day of the incident, there was a special event held at Kyubi Manor. And as part of this event, there was someone dressed in the likeness of Tenma Taro. Obviously this person is a much more likely suspect than any legendary demon! Blackquill: Blackquill: Dullard. You are playing right into the killer's mind games. Apollo: What? Blackquill: Listen here. The feathers and tracks were merely red herrings. The villagers believe the murder to be the work of the real Tenma Taro. However, the police believe that the person in the Tenma Taro suit is the killer. Apollo: Ahh! Blackquill: The defendant sought to sow this confusion in order to deflect blame away from himself. However, he was knocked unconscious by the alderman... ...and thus our mentally deficient mayor was caught red-handed at the scene of the crime. Apollo: Apollo: Do you honestly believe Mayor Tenma would do something so stupid?! Blackquill: Blackquill: The evidence speaks for itself. ...Fool Bright! Fulbright: Right. It was the mayor's last-ditch effort to stop the opposition before things got crazy. The Amazing Nine-Tails was fueling both the yokai craze and the anti-merger movement. Plus, he's one of the better-known masked wrestlers, and the hometown favorite. That's why the mayor panicked and set out on the path of injustice. Judge: But do the people of Nine-Tails Vale really believe a yokai is behind the crime? Fulbright: Yokai sightings are an everyday event there, so I wouldn't be surprised if they did. Judge: Hmm... I must say... A crime that preys upon innocent, impressionable minds. Blackquill: Just so. A particularly silver-tongued inmate once had the following words for me. The innocent of heart are the easiest prey. Judge: You don't say? Was this inmate a con artist? Blackquill: .........No. He was framed for the murder of his beloved. I actually felt sorry for the poor chap. Apollo: (Wait, so he wasn't the predator, but rather the prey?) Judge: Yes, well... Now then, the defense may proceed with their cross-examination. Cross Examination -- Feathers and Tracks -- Fulbright: This entire case centers on one man's attempt to crush opposition to the municipal merger! Press Apollo: Apollo: Detective Fulbright, is the anti-merger movement really that strong? Fulbright: Oh, absolutely! They parade around in yokai costumes shouting, \"Down with Mayor Tenma!\" And just the other day, they stormed Tenma City Hall, claiming it was a den of vipers! Blackquill: Hmph. But when the accused showed his face... ...the angry mob scattered like leaves upon an autumn wind. For you see, lowly yokai are no match for Tenma Taro, the Dark Lord of their kind. Athena: Wait, are the villagers scared of Mayor Tenma or Tenma Taro? I'm confused. Apollo: I think he means Mayor Tenma. It's easy to get the wrong impression about the guy. Judge: Detective Fulbright, why do you suppose the defendant would commit such an act? Fulbright: Mayor Tenma panicked when The Amazing Nine-Tails helped embolden the protestors. Press Apollo: Apollo: The Amazing Nine-Tails... No one knows his true identity, right? Fulbright: That's right. And he was a lone wolf, or in other words, he didn't belong to a wrestling federation. He appeared like a shooting star, defeating one Tenma Town wrestler after another. And before anyone knew it, he was a champion! Blackquill: Like the samurai of yore, surrounded thick with enemies, he cut them down one by one. It was a complete and utter loss of face for Tenma Town Pro Wrestling. Fulbright: He was amazing! If ever there was a real superhero, it would be him! I dream of becoming a true champion of justice like him someday! Athena: I bet Detective Fulbright would be a great pro wrestler. He could even team up with Prosecutor Blackquill. Apollo: A police detective and a prisoner in chains? .........You know, I think people would actually pay to see that. I know I would. Fulbright: Ha ha ha. So you DO understand the greatness that is The Amazing Nine-Tails! Fulbright: So he stoked the villagers' fears by fabricating a monster! Press Apollo: Apollo: Did the murder and yokai evidence really stoke the villagers' fears? Fulbright: Absolutely! It had an immediate effect! The presumed return of the dreaded Tenma Taro has them shaking in their boots! Judge: Oh my, is it really that bad?! Blackquill: Hmph, that superstitious lot? It's as if Jack the Ripper had been set loose in their village. The mere thought of that demon lurking about is enough to spark a mass exodus. Judge: I see... That's a very persuasive argument. Apollo: (The mere thought of His Honor buying into Simon the Psycho-Slasher's words... ...makes me want to spark my own exodus out of the courtroom right about now.) Fulbright: So you see, there can be only one reason why anyone would plant those feathers and tracks! Fulbright: The strange feathers and tracks he planted made it look like a yokai was the killer. Press Apollo: Apollo: ...But it doesn't add up. If what you say is true, why top it off with murder? Fulbright: Hm? What do you mean? Apollo: You claim that our client planted the yokai evidence to stoke the villagers' fears. If so, then why not stop there? Why murder Alderman Kyubi? Judge: Hmm... Excellent point. Apollo: It is, isn't it! So, Your Honor agrees there was no reason for the murder, correct?! Blackquill: Blackquill: Perhaps the killing was on the spur of the moment. (Changed from [Perhaps the killing was spur of the moment.] in the original release) Apollo: You're saying it wasn't premeditated? Blackquill: From the outset, I had no intention of paying heed to any of your babble. However, the fact is, the mayor made a startling discovery. Apollo: A startling discovery? (Why don't I like the sound of that?) Blackquill: Alderman Kyubi's secret identity. Athena: Apollo... I think Prosecutor Blackquill has figured out the alderman's secret identity. But even if he has, why would it be a motive for the mayor to commit murder? Apollo: (...This is not good!) Blackquill: This patch of fur was discovered at the crime scene. It's from the mask worn by The Amazing Nine-Tails. Therefore, we can conclude that this mask was at the crime scene. Judge: Oh, my. But why would it have been there? Blackquill: The victim was a former pro wrestler and a member of the anti-merger movement. ...Need I say more? Judge: Well, um............ Ah! C-Could it really be?! Blackquill: Hmph. Your Baldness has had an epiphany I see. Our victim, Rex Kyubi, was The Amazing Nine-Tails! And the mayor's discovery of such was his motive for murder! Apollo: Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Judge: Order! Order!!! What a shocking development. A motive clearer than crystal clear! Athena: What do we do now, Apollo?! Apollo: I didn't think they'd tie the alderman's secret identity to the mayor's motive for murder! Blackquill: At last we've reached my real point: why did the alderman have to forge a secret identity? Does it not pique your interest, Your Baldness? Judge: I admit it does... It IS odd that he had to create this other persona... ...just to secretly participate in the anti-merger movement. Blackquill: Very astute of you, Your Baldness. Fulbright: Right, now take a look at this! If you value your dearest's life, you will merge Nine-Tails Vale with Tenma Town. This blackmail letter was found in Alderman Kyubi's pocket! Apollo: Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaat!!! Blackquill: At present, the alderman's wife is in the hospital. And that letter is clear evidence the mayor was blackmailing him by threatening her life. Athena: Wait, didn't the blackmail letter sent to Mayor Tenma go missing... ...right after the alderman's murder? Apollo: You think maybe the killer took the letter from the mayor after the murder... ...and planted it into the alderman's pocket? Athena: It's possible... but we don't have any proof that that's what happened. Apollo: (Talk about being up the creek without a paddle...) Blackmail Letter added to the Court Record. Fulbright: Mayor Tenma would've made a clean getaway if he'd just left after planting the yokai things. But he was knocked out cold by his sudden decision to kill The Amazing Nine-Tails! Judge: So, it was The Amazing Nine-Tails's counterattack that brought the entire crime to light. Apollo: Wait a sec... (Fulbright's claiming that the mayor killed the alderman after planting the yokai evidence. And that the mayor was knocked out cold immediately after that?) Detective Fulbright, please add your previous statement to your testimony! Adds statement \"Mayor Tenma killed the sleeping alderman after planting the feathers and tracks.\" Press (subsequent times) Apollo: Apollo: So, you're saying our client hadn't planned on killing the alderman? Fulbright: That's right. The motive only came after he discovered the alderman's secret identity! Apollo: W-Well, I guess that does make sense. Athena: What do we do now, Apollo?! Apollo: I didn't think they'd tie the alderman's secret identity to the mayor's motive for murder. Fulbright: Let's get on with the testimony, shall we! Fulbright: Mayor Tenma killed the sleeping alderman after planting the feathers and tracks. Press Apollo: Apollo: So let me get this straight. You believe the mayor planted the yokai evidence before the murder, not after? Fulbright: Absolutely! And then he was knocked out cold by the alderman's last punch! He wouldn't have had a chance to plant the evidence after that! Apollo: (Hmm... Something's not right here.) Present Crime Photo Apollo: Leads to: \"Detective Fulbright, your sense of justice is anything but fair!\" Apollo: (Hard to believe that a stiff, humorless man like the mayor could be behind such a stunt.) Athena: Argh... We have to do something, Apollo, before they pin it all on the mayor! Apollo: Then we're going to need to prove that Mayor Tenma didn't plant that yokai stuff. Athena: How are we supposed to do that? Apollo: Detective Fulbright, your sense of justice is anything but fair! Fulbright: What's this?! You are question my justice again?! Apollo: Yes, and I'm going to prove it to you. Take a look at this photo. Judge: This... is the crime scene photo. And just what does this prove? Apollo: It proves when the feathers and tracks were planted. Fulbright: But I already told you, they were planted before the murder! The defendant planted the yokai evidence, then was knocked out cold while killing his victim! Apollo: But that would be impossible. If you look right here, it's clear when the feathers and tracks were left at the scene. Present tracks Apollo: Leads to: \"Aren't you just pointing to the yokai feathers and tracks, Mr. Justice?\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: There's clearly something wrong... right around here. Judge: The only thing clear to me is that the defense is barking up the wrong tree. Blackquill: Hmph. Really up a tree now, aren't we? Judge: Yes, and a stiff penalty should help you learn that correct assertions don't grow on them. Apollo: Ugh... I wonder if bandages do... (There is clearly something wrong with the assertion that... ...the feathers and tracks were there before the murder.) Leads back to: \"If you look right here, it's clear when the feathers and tracks were left at the scene.\" Judge: Aren't you just pointing to the yokai feathers and tracks, Mr. Justice? Apollo: Yes. See how the feathers are on top of the blood, and the tracks were made in blood? In other words, the yokai evidence could've only resulted AFTER the murder. Fulbright: Th-Then the mayor must've planted the evidence after killing the alderman! Apollo: But you said it yourself, the mayor had been knocked unconscious thereafter. There would've been no time for him to plant any evidence at all! Therefore! There must've been someone else besides the mayor and the alderman at the crime scene! Fulbright: Arrrrrrgh! There must be some mistake! Judge: Order! Order!!! Fulbright: Wh-Where's your evidence?! You can't possibly have any, can you?! Ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: Evidence? Oh, I have evidence. In fact, I have an eye-witness's testimony for you. Fulbright: You do?! But hooooow?! Was my vaunted sense of justice really just half-baked? Athena: He's taking this really hard. Judge: Hmm... Mr. Justice. What is this testimony regarding a third party that you claim to have? Apollo: I have it right here, Your Honor. It's the sworn testimony of Mr. Tenma's daughter. The witness, Jinxie Tenma, saw a yokai in the hallway after stumbling upon the scene. It was the demon Tenma Taro... He's the source of those feathers and tracks! Judge: ......... Blackquill: ......... Fulbright: ......... ......... Apollo: .........Will somebody please say something? Judge: ...The defense will explain to the court exactly what he means. Fulbright: You... You dare to mock this court and justice itself?! You're unfit to bear your name, boy! Blackquill: You Baldness, it appears our defense attorney here is delirious from exhaustion. Athena: Athena: Apollo! Think of something, quick, before you're held in contempt of court! Apollo: What do you think I'm trying to do?! Before you decide whether I should step down, please... hear me out...? Judge: Very well, Mr. Justice, I'm all ears. But you had better explain yourself well. What was this yokai you were talking about? Apollo: It's all in this statement here -- Jinxie Tenma asserts that she saw Tenma Taro. After she discovered the crime scene and called the police... ...she came around a corner in the hall. It was around here... ...that she saw Tenma Taro fleeing toward the foyer! The defense asserts that whoever was impersonating this monster... ...is the one who left those feathers and tracks behind, intentionally or otherwise! Judge: Wh-Whaaaaaat?! Fulbright: How incredibly unjust! Why haven't I heard about this before?! Man: The defense just proved there was someone else! Woman: So the mayor isn't the killer? Man: Was it all just a set up? The prosecutor IS a convicted felon, after all. Athena: Apollo! The momentum has shifted in our favor! Apollo: Good. Now let's keep it that way! Blackquill: Blackquill: ............Hmph. Little do you realize... ...that though you are in the midst of a fray, your sword is broken. Apollo: My sword? (I didn't know I had one to break.) Are you implying there's a problem with my claim? Blackquill: Consider this: if that yokai impersonator had indeed fled toward the foyer... ...that fool and that fop would have seen him. Apollo: Fool and fop? Oh, you mean Filch and L'Belle. Hmm, now that you mention it... Blackquill: Both Phineas Filch and Florent L'Belle were in the foyer at the time. But they haven't stated that they saw a yokai, have they? Did you ever consider that yokai was but a figment of a scared little girl's imagination? Apollo: Argh. Why DIDN'T those two see the Tenma Taro impersonator pass by? Athena: Why don't we ask them ourselves? Apollo: I was just about to say that myself. No, really, I was! The defense would like to call Mr. Phineas Filch, caretaker of Kyubi Manor, to the stand! I just know he must have seen something! Judge: Hmm... I suppose we can't ignore the fact that the little girl believes she saw a monster. I trust you have no objections to Mr. Justice's request, Prosecutor Blackquill? I understand that Mr. Filch is enjoying a nap out in the lobby. Blackquill: Hmph. I knew that tanuki was a rare find. But when we captured him, I didn't think he'd end up a witness. Do with him as you will. Apollo: (D-Did he just say captured? No, wait. I don't want to know.) Judge: Very well, then. Bailiff, please go wake Mr. Filch and escort him to the witness stand. Judge: Will the witness state his name and occupation, please. Filch: The name's Filch, Phineas Filch, caretaker of Kyubi Manor. Oh, and... This is for you, Your Lordship. Just a little something I though ya might like. Judge: Oh, my, what a fabulous pair of shoes! And \"Your Honor\" will do just fine, Mr. Filch. Apollo: ...Ah! It's those shoes again! Athena: Um... Don't they belong to Detective Fulbright? Apollo: Don't tell me Filch stole them again. Filch: They're all yours, Your Honorship, sir. Judge: What?! But they seem awfully expensive. Filch: Yep, too expensive for me, but I reckon they'd be perfect for someone like Your Honorship. Judge: Hmm... It's a kind gesture, but legal ethics dictate I can't accept such gifts. Filch: Aw, ethics smethics. Just take 'em if ya want 'em. Polished 'em up real nice for ya, too. Judge: I'm sorry about the shoes, Mr. Filch, but I WILL accept your testimony. The court would like to hear whether you saw Tenma Taro in the foyer after the murder. Witness Testimony -- Guarding the Foyer -- Filch: At the time of the murder I was on guard duty in the foyer, just like Mr. Kyubi asked. (Changed from [At the time of the murder I was on guard duty in the foyer, just like Mr. Kyubi's [sic] asked.] in the original release) I was making sure no one -- fair, foul, fishy, or otherwise -- could get to our guest. I was still in my office keeping a good watch when the murder happened after 3 PM. But I didn't see nothing outta the ordinary, no siree! Blackquill: That yokai you keep jabbering on about was but a phantom of a little girl's dreams. Apollo: So, you're telling this court you never saw anyone dressed up like Tenma Taro? Filch: Yep! Was guarding the whole time. That's the truth, the holy truth, 'n' nutter-butter the truth! And Tenma Taro? Bah, ya don't really believe in all that yokai mumbo jumbo, do ya? I certainly don't! BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: Hm? (My bracelet, it's...) Athena: Something the matter, Apollo? Apollo: My bracelet keeps squeezing my arm. Athena: Really? So you think Mr. Tanuki-- er, I mean, Filch has been lying to us? Apollo: I wouldn't rule it out. (Now, if I could just zero in on a tell -- some sort of nervous habit...) ???: *Screech!* Apollo: A-Aaaaaaagh! What in the--?! (W-What's a hawk doing in here!?) Blackquill: Allow me to introduce my trusty cohort, Taka. He seems to have taken quite a liking to the courthouse. Made it his new home, in fact. Apollo: ...He doesn't live with you... you know, in jail? (Who's ever heard of a courthouse bird?) Blackquill: Taka simply loathes trickery and fraud. And that queer power of yours seems to have offended my dear, bosom buzzard. Apollo: This isn't some sort of trick or-- Aaaaaaaaaagh! (I won't be able to spot squat like this!) Filch: Wh-What the heck's goin' on 'round here?! Run for the hills! Judge: N-No pets or other animals allowed in the courtroom! Taka: *Screech!* Judge: Ack! Somebody help! Blackquill: Oh, he's merely having a bit of sport. He won't harm you, save when truly famished. Judge: In that case, Prosecutor Blackquill, you will ensure your feathered friend is properly fed. Athena: Looks like we have to do this the old-fashioned way. Apollo: We'll be fine... I think. (If there was someone dressed as Tenma Taro there, Filch should've seen him. We'll just have to put our faith in Jinxie's statement for now.) Judge: Mr. Justice, please proceed with your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- Guarding the Foyer -- Filch: At the time of the murder I was on guard duty in the foyer, just like Mr. Kyubi asked. (Changed from [At the time of the murder I was on guard duty in the foyer, just like Mr. Kyubi's [sic] asked.] in the original release) Press Apollo: Apollo: Mr. Filch, why did Alderman Kyubi have you handle guard duty? Filch: Eh-heh heh... 'Cause he trusts me. I AM the manor's caretaker, after all. Apollo: So, you took said guard duty seriously? Filch: Eh-heh heh... Lemme tell ya something about me. I'm-- Yipes! Blackquill: Listen here, you little tanuki. Get straight to the point and be quick about it. The court wishes to hear what you did or didn't see in the foyer, and naught else. Filch: Y-Yes, of course, sir! Right away, sir! Apollo: (Blackquill's got him completely under his thumb.) Filch: Like I said, I was guarding the foyer entrance that day! Filch: I was making sure no one -- fair, foul, fishy, or otherwise -- could get to our guest. Press Apollo: Apollo: So no one could get to him... Sounds like security was pretty tight. Filch: That's 'cause there's always lotsa sneaks 'n' thieves 'round festival time. Apollo: And the solution was to entrust the manor's security to a thief? That's not even funny. Athena: Maybe it's a matter of stopping thieves by hiring one. After all, it takes one to know one. Apollo: I dunno, it seems more like letting the fox guard the henhouse to me. Judge: Hmm. So, the witness testifies that he took his guard duty seriously? Filch: Yes, sir, Your Honorship, sir! Filch: I was still in my office keeping a good watch when the murder happened after 3 PM. Press Apollo: Apollo: Did you really keep an eye on the foyer the entire time?! Filch: *sigh* Poor old Filchy... Been working hard my whole life... ...only to be smeared by some greenhorn in his fancy-schmancy suit and silly haircut. Ah! Sorry, sorry, Mr. Blackquill, sir! Didn't mean to get off subject there! Apollo: (Sheesh... Blackquill didn't even say anything.) Filch: To answer your question, yes, I kept an eye -- no, both of 'em, in fact -- on the foyer! Present TV Listings Apollo: Leads to: \"Don't lie to the court like that, Mr. Filch.\" Filch: But I didn't see nothing outta the ordinary, no siree! Press Apollo: Apollo: Could you describe to the court who you would consider fishy looking? Filch: Someone all fidgety and shifty-like, you know, like they're about to steal something. Apollo: (He......... just described himself.) Athena: I wonder why Mr. Filch didn't see Tenma Taro. Apollo: Maybe Jinxie only thinks she saw Tenma Taro. Or... Athena: Maybe Mr. Filch is lying. Apollo: And if he's lying, we might be able to spot a contradiction in his testimony. Apollo: Don't lie to the court like that, Mr. Filch. Filch: Hey, it ain't right to bushwhack a fella like that! Apollo: Unfortunately for you, I have evidence that proves you're lying. If you look at this TV listing here, you'll see that at the time of the crime... ...there was a pro wrestling match scheduled -- something you'd never miss. Filch: Ack! I didn't watch that one, no siree! I was doing my job, just like I was s'pposed to! Apollo: (This guy doesn't know when to give up.) Mr. Filch. Someone even circled the match. It was you, right? Filch: Yipes! Apollo: Not only that, you even told me you watched it. You said, and I quote: \"It was a complete disaster.\" Filch: Hrrrgh! Apollo: So, do you admit to slacking off?! Filch: Y-Y-You can't trick me with your rudy poo lawyer talk! I'm one of them professional-types, too! I can do double-duty, watching TV and the foyer at the same time! Apollo: (The only thing Filch can claim to be a professional of is \"professional thief\"...) Judge: Mr. Justice. You would have this court believe the witness was slacking off? Apollo: That's correct. He claims to have been watching TV and the foyer at the same time. But that's nothing but a bald-faced lie! Judge: Bald, you say? But I'M not the one who's lying! Perhaps you meant the witness, Mr. Justice? And in that case, let's see what evidence you can offer. You claim Mr. Filch is lying about watching TV and the foyer simultaneously. Now, prove it. Present Foyer Diagram Apollo: Leads to: \"Please take a look at the direction the TV is facing in this diagram.\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: This piece of evidence here clearly exposes Mr. Filch's lie. Judge: Hm? How does that prove anything? Apollo: Oh, it, um... (Whoops! Way off on that one!) Heh heh, sorry. Don't know what I was thinking. Judge: Yes, well, I have moments like that myself. Apollo: (Whew, looks like he'll let this one slide.) Judge: But random guesses and speculation must be punished! Apollo: Yargh! Athena: Apollo! We should think about how Mr. Filch was when he was watching TV! Apollo: Please, lemme try that one again! Judge: The defense will look before they leap this time. So, what do you have for us, Mr. Justice? Leads back to: \"You claim Mr. Filch is lying about watching TV and the foyer simultaneously. Now, prove it.\" Apollo: Please take a look at the direction the TV is facing in this diagram. Now, unless Mr. Filch has eyes where his right ear should be... ...I'd think it would be impossible to watch the foyer entrance and the TV at the same time. Judge: Why, yes! Someone watching TV there couldn't possibly see the entrance! Apollo: Exactly. And that means, Mr. Filch... ...you were slacking off and were NOT watching the foyer as you claim! Filch: Yiiipes! The bag's outta the cat! Er, I mean, other way 'round! Judge: Order! Order! Order!!! But Mr. Justice, is Mr. Filch's less-than-stellar work ethic relevant to this case? Apollo: It's very relevant, because while he was slacking off watching TV... ...there really could've been a Tenma Taro impersonator in the foyer! Blackquill: Apollo: What now?! Blackquill: Granted, this tanuki was lax in his duties, but he still had the foyer entrance covered. Apollo: What are you talking about? Blackquill: .........This. Apollo: Um... I'm not a mind reader. Ack! Blackquill: Auditory sense. His eyes may have been slacking off, but his ears were still hard at work. Right, tanuki? Filch: ...They were? ............Er, I mean, yes! Yes they were! Apollo: But you already admitted to slacking off. Now you say you weren't? Filch: My eyes might be lazy, but my ears ain't. I woulda heard anyone in the foyer, eh-heh. Ya see, the foyer floor and stairway get all creaky squeaky when someone walks on 'em! Creak, creak, creak! Loud enough to wake the dead, I reckon! Apollo: So, you're saying you didn't hear anybody walk by? Filch: Yep! My ears were working fulltime. So, who's the liar now, ya no-good shyster! Apollo: A lying thief calling me a shyster. This HAS to be the low point of my fledgling career... Filch: Gotta hand it to ya, Mr. Blackquill, sir, ya really are something else, eh-heh heh! I mean, ya don't miss a thing. And them bags under yer eyes? They're darker than mine! Blackquill: Fair warning, Mr. Filch. Taka is particularly fond of tanuki. Should you lie to this court again, you may suddenly find yourself on the menu. Filch: Yiiiiiipes! Please don't eat me, Mr. Taka, sir! Judge: The witness will henceforth testify truthfully under penalty of painful bird attacks! And with that in mind, the court requests that the witness revise his testimony accordingly. Witness Testimony -- Ears Working Overtime -- Filch: It's true, I was watching a pro wrestling match on the office TV. My eyes mighta been slacking off, but my ears? They were working overtime. The floor there's all creaky squeaky-like. No way I woulda missed someone walking by. So ya see, there weren't no Tenma Taro in the foyer. Blackquill: Superstition is the religion of feeble minds. Understand? A simple, rational explanation is best. Forget yokai, demons, and such. We must use common sense, for lacking that, our entire world would be but upside-down. Apollo: (Says the convict prosecutor who is totally a sign of the end times for the legal world.) Filch: And besides, if there were any yokai roaming about, I'd nab 'em 'n' sell 'em to the zoo! Athena: I wonder whether Jinxie was just seeing things. Apollo: That seems to be the general consensus, but I'm sticking to my guns. Athena: But if we can't prove she saw Tenma Taro, the mayor's sure to be convicted! Apollo: Then we'd better hope my guns fire bullets, not BBs... Judge: The defense may cross-examine the witness. Cross Examination -- Ears Working Overtime -- Filch: It's true, I was watching a pro wrestling match on the office TV. Press Apollo: Apollo: You ARE paid for your work, aren't you? So, how do you justify watching TV on the job? Filch: A-A-Arrgghh! B-B-B-But...! It ain't easy being me! I mean, I can't watch TV when we have visitors and there's no way to record stuff! Apollo: (Sorry, am I supposed to be consoling you over your first-world problems?) Athena: If those are his only problems, he should consider himself lucky. Apollo: I guess pro wrestling's serious business to Mr. Filch. Filch: My eyes mighta been slacking off, but my ears? They were working overtime. Press Apollo: Apollo: You lied earlier about taking your guard duty seriously, didn't you? Filch: Oh, uh, that? Ain't no harm in bending the truth a little, right? Blackquill: Listen to me, you little tanuki. Lie again and Taka shall feast upon that forked tongue of yours. Taka: Screech! Filch: Yiiipes! Sorry! Just lemme keep my tongue! Apollo: (At least leave it until we get the truth out of him, in any case.) Blackquill: You were negligent in your duties, were you not? Filch: Yes, sir, I was sir! But it ain't like that... Filch: The floor there's all creaky squeaky-like. No way I woulda missed someone walking by. Press Apollo: Apollo: So, you have pretty good ears, Mr. Filch? Filch: As good as they come, I'd say. Ain't nothin' to hear a creaky floor. Plus, that Tenma Taro makes a sound when he goes by. It's like a jingle jangle. Apollo: Jingle jangle? How does he do that? Filch: It's that staff o' his. That's what jingle jangles. Athena: What's he talking about, Apollo? Apollo: Beats me, but I guess Tenma Taro has a staff that makes noise. Athena: Come to think of it, didn't Jinxie mention something like that, too? She said she saw Tenma Taro holding a staff-like object that made a jangly sound. Apollo: I guess that's the source of the noise then... Judge: Well, Mr. Justice? Mr. Filch says Tenma Taro \"jingle jangles.\" Would you consider that vital information? Very important Apollo: Extremely vital! I request that it be added to his testimony! Adds statement \"If Tenma Taro was to pass by, his staff woulda gone jingle jangle.\" Not so important Apollo: (Doesn't seem particularly important to me.) No, Your Honor. I don't think it's of any importance. Judge: Very well. The witness may continue with his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press (after adding statement) Apollo: Apollo: Could someone walk by without making a sound? Filch: Nope, not even a ninja. That's 'cause even the tiniest mouse makes that floor creak, eh-heh. Real creaky squeaky, it is! Blackquill: I can vouch for the tanuki's keen ears. He came running from across the building the moment Fool Bright dropped his wallet. And true to his name, Filch filched it before Mr. Less-Than-Bright knew what happened. Apollo: That's some scary good hearing. Filch: Wads o' cash or expensive shoes on the pavement... Sounds like that don't get by ol' Filch's ears. Got years o' practice, eh-heh heh. Athena: Remind me not to bring anything of value to the manor next time. Apollo: The sound of shoes makes sense, but wads of cash? What does that sound like? ...Anyway, it sounds like they need to hire somebody to take care of their caretaker. Filch: If Tenma Taro was to pass by, his staff woulda gone jingle jangle. Press Apollo: Apollo: So, Tenma Taro's staff makes a distinctive sound? Filch: Yep, like a jingle and a jangle. Athena: Wait, Jinxie said something like that. Something about Tenma Taro making a jangly sound. Apollo: Hmmm... I think we're missing something here, but I can't quite put a finger on it. (Perhaps I should take a look at the Court Record again...) Present Yokai Legend Scroll Apollo: Leads to: \"Tenma Taro's staff would make a jangly sound, you say?\" Filch: So ya see, there weren't no Tenma Taro in the foyer. Press Apollo: Apollo: Please tell the court, what did Jinxie see if not Tenma Taro? Filch: She's always going on about seeing this yokai or that. Just an active imagination, I reckon. She won't even come near me 'cause she thinks I'm some sorta tanuki monster! Athena: Can't say I blame her. Apollo: So, Mr. Filch, you'd chalk it up to a child's active imagination? Filch: Yep. No Tenma Taro or anyone else got in or outta Kyubi Manor on my watch. Athena: Apollo, what could this mean? Do you think Jinxie was just seeing things? Apollo: Well, if that's the case, the details she provided were pretty impressive. But if we're to continue believing Jinxie's statement... Athena: We'll have to uncover Filch's lie? Apollo: Right, or.... find out why he can't tell the truth. Apollo: Tenma Taro's staff would make a jangly sound, you say? Well, I'm going to say that your story doesn't add up. Judge: Is there something the defense would like to share with the court? Apollo: Mr. Filch, you say that you didn't see Tenma Taro on the day of the incident. Why then, did you assume just now that Tenma Taro would be holding a staff? Filch: Huh? Apollo: You see, the Tenma Taro Jinxie saw held a staff in his hands. And she described its sound just like you did -- as a kind of jangly sound. Filch: Yeah, so he was holding a staff. What's yer point? Apollo: Apollo: The point is that Tenma Taro doesn't use a staff. Not normally. Filch: What are you talking about? Apollo: You see, this is the only known document depicting Tenma Taro. Is there a staff in that picture, Mr. Filch? Judge: You're right! There's no staff! Not even a cane or a walking stick! Filch: Ack! Judge: So, the question is, why does the witness think Tenma Taro uses a staff? Apollo: I believe the answer will overturn the prosecution's case on the most basic level! Blackquill: .........Well now, this IS getting interesting. Judge: All right, Mr. Justice, it's time to show the court where you're going with this. Please tell the court why Mr. Filch believes Tenma Taro carries a staff. The scroll is wrong Apollo: Maybe the scroll is incorrect. There could be an older drawing that shows Tenma Taro with a staff. And Mr. Filch could have seen that. Blackquill: Hmph. If that were the case... ...then the fact that the witness believes Tenma Taro had a staff would not be an issue. Apollo: Oh, in that case, I retract my previous statement. Judge: Not so fast, Mr. Justice. You must be held accountable for your flights of fancy! Apollo: Argh! Athena: Ouch. A legal smack down... Apollo: (Filch believes Tenma Taro has a staff... ...despite the fact that Tenma Taro has never been drawn that way! So how could he have possibly known about the staff?) Judge: Let's try that again, Mr. Justice. Leads back to: \"Please tell the court why Mr. Filch believes Tenma Taro carries a staff.\" He actually saw Tenma Taro Leads to: \"Mr. Filch actually saw Tenma Taro right after the crime occurred!\" Filch is a scatterbrain Apollo: Mr. Filch obviously has a few screws loose. So, it's no surprise he would make a mistake like that! Filch: Now, hold it right there! As caretaker o' Kyubi Manor, I keep every screw nice 'n' tight! Apollo: (I rest my case.) Judge: With an assertion like that, this court wonders whether the defense has a screw loose, too. Here's a penalty to make sure you keep your screws in tighter next time. Apollo: (Filch believes Tenma Taro has a staff... ...despite the fact that Tenma Taro has never been drawn that way! So how could he have possibly known about the staff?) Judge: Let's try that again, Mr. Justice. Leads back to: \"Please tell the court why Mr. Filch believes Tenma Taro carries a staff.\" Apollo: Mr. Filch actually saw Tenma Taro right after the crime occurred! That's the only way he could possibly know about the staff! Filch: B-B-Busted again! Blackquill: Bloody hell! You duplicitous little--! Apollo: (Yes! How'd that feel, Blackquill? Not so fun when you're on the receiving end of the blade, is it!) Admit it, Mr. Filch! You DID see Tenma Taro that day, didn't you? Filch: Um... Uhhhhhh... Apollo: Well?! Filch: I'm beggin' ya! Please don't make me say it! Apollo: But you clearly did see Tenma Taro! Stop stalling and testify to that fact! Filch: No can do! No way, no how! You ain't got no idea how terrifying he can be! Apollo: ...He? (Mr. Filch still won't admit seeing Tenma Taro, even though everyone already knows he did. The question now is, why?) Athena: Mr. Filch is scared to death! Apollo: Is that why he can't admit the truth? Athena: Hmm... Come to think of it... Jinxie: They say you must not gaze upon Tenma Taro. But in the event that you do look... ...and then tell anyone what you saw, Tenma Taro will claim your soul. Athena: Jinxie wouldn't admit to seeing Tenma Taro after hearing about the village superstitions. She said that if she told anyone that she had seen Tenma Taro, he'd claim her soul. Apollo: Wait, you think Filch believes that, too? Filch: Ah! So Mister Big-Time, City-Slicker Lawyer has heard about 'em?! Them old village superstitions? Judge: Will the defense please explain what the witness is talking about? Apollo: The people of Nine-Tails Vale believe some pretty strange things. And their superstitions may be the reason our witness here can't admit the truth... ...the truth that he really did see Tenma Taro. Filch: D-Darn straight, that's why! It's all right here! Apollo: Ignoring the superstitions will cost you your soul? Filch: See?! That's why us folks in Nine-Tails Vale can't talk about seeing Tenma Taro! Village Superstitions added to the Court Record. Apollo: That clears up one mystery. The killer took advantage of the superstitions by wearing a Tenma Taro costume. They knew that that way no one could talk about him, so it was as if he never existed! The defense holds that this Tenma Taro impersonator is the true killer! Judge: Whaaat?! Blackquill: Blackquill: Hmph! Superstitions, you say? What kind of a fool would actually believe such rubbish? And would that using some silly fairy tale could so easily expose the culprit. (Changed from [And would that using some silly fairy tale so easily expose the culprit.] in the original release) You'll need to come up with a more rational, common-sense explanation than that! Apollo: Apollo: Your common sense seems awfully narrow-minded to me, Prosecutor Blackquill! Blackquill: Blackquill: Try living in my world of narrow cells, mortal danger, and dark, sleepless nights! There is no lack of superstitions in the clink, but few are those who truly believe in them! Apollo: Apollo: Well, the village superstitions are real enough to the people of Nine-Tails Vale! A life or death superstition might even make you a believer! Blackquill: ............Grr! Raaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwrrrrrrrrrrrr! Judge: Order! Order, I say!!! Blackquill: You fool of a tanuki! Two times now, your lies have cost me! Filch: S-S-Sorry, sorry! I promise not to do it again! Blackquill: ...Taka, my fine-feathered friend, have at him! Filch: Yiiipes! He's gonna eat me alive! Head for the hills! Apollo: Ah! He took off. Judge: B-B-Bailiff! What are you waiting for?! After him -- and with your fastest men! Athena: That's certainly not something you see every day. Judge: Well, it would seem a new and important fact has come to light. A third party disguised as the yokai Tenma Taro was at the scene. And now we have two witnesses who can attest to that fact. Any objections, Prosecutor Blackquill? Blackquill: .............................. .............................. Apollo: Uh-oh... Athena: Wha--?! Judge: Huh? ............Ahhhhhh! Apollo: His shackles...! Urk! (I... I'm too young to die!) Blackquill: Justice-dono, long has it been since I've been forced to draw my blade. You had best say your prayers. Judge: Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek! D-Detective, do something! Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Have no fear, Fulbright is here! When the going gets tough, the champion of justice gets going! Apollo: Apollo: Then get going, already, before he kills us! Fulbright: Oh, but I stand in awe of Simon Blackquill, for it is his sense of justice that set him free! Judge: Objection! Objection! I object to Detective Fulbright's definition of justice! Blackquill: Blackquill: Hmph. I'm not in the habit of cutting down unarmed cowards. Judge: Oh, w-well, in that case, Prosecutor Blackquill, can I ask you to, umm, you know... Apollo: (I think the judge forgot he's in charge here.) Blackquill: So, Justice-dono's assertion is this: Tenma Taro is the real killer, not Mayor Tenma. According to him, there was a yokai at the scene of the crime. Apollo: Right! And that yokai, or rather, whoever was impersonating him, killed Alderman Kyubi! Blackquill: Apollo: Ack! Blackquill: Care to explain why Jinxie, being the first to discover the murder... ...did not see your alleged killer yokai there in the Fox Chamber? Apollo: What? (He's right, she said nothing about Tenma Taro being in the Fox Chamber...) Blackquill: .........Hmph. Let me enlighten you. That little scamp heard a dying scream right before she opened the chamber door. Apollo: ...And your point is...? Blackquill: Upon opening the door, she found a freshly skewed murder victim -- the alderman... ...and the homicidal maniac who had killer him -- the mayor. Apollo: No, there must've been someone dressed up like Tenma-- Aagh! Blackquill: Then why does that little scamp claim not to have seen a yokai in the Fox Chamber? Judge: Hmm... Considering her father is accused of murder... ...surely she would've mentioned any third party that might have been in the room. Apollo: I don't understand. Why didn't she see Tenma Taro inside the Fox Chamber? Blackquill: Hmph. There is but one way to find out: Ask Jinxie Tenma whether she saw your killer yokai at the scene of the crime. Apollo: Uh-oh... Blackquill: The final battle draws nigh. Only one of us will leave here alive. Heh heh heh. Long has my blade thirsted for blood. At long last, it shall be sated! Apollo: Wait, this IS still a trial, right? Blackquill: Show me what you're truly capable of, Justice-dono! Judge: V-Very well, then. Both parties no doubt need some time to regroup... ...so the court will take a 10-minute recess in order to-- Aagh! Blackquill: ...Three minutes. Judge: I-I'm sorry, but... a three-minute recess? Blackquill: Just so. Plenty of time if your destination of intent is the loo. Judge: The loo? You mean the bathroom? Apollo: (Sheesh... At least include enough time to wash our hands.) Blackquill: See that you take no more than three minutes. All latecomers will be punished. Judge: Y-Yes, sir! I hereby declare a three-minute recess before the battle begins! Athena: I declare Prosecutor Blackquill the winner of this round of Simon Says... Apollo: Doesn't bode well for us if the prosecutor is running the show, does it...? April 18, 10:40 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Athena: He busted out of his shackles. Apollo: Yeah, what was that about? Guess they don't make shackles like they used to. Athena: Better be careful, Apollo. You've really brought out the samurai in him. Especially after you proved there was a Tenma Taro impersonator at the manor. Apollo: What's with that guy and the whole samurai act, anyway? Tenma: Such fine swordsmanship... That is no mere act. Mr. Justice, it's high time I challenge this jailhouse prosecutor to a duel! Apollo: No, wait! Let's save the dueling until after we prove your innocence! Tenma: Hrmmm... I suppose it could wait till later. Apollo: (*sigh* Does ANYONE remember we're conducting a trial here?) Athena, I'm gonna go wash up. Athena: Remember what Blackquill said, Apollo. Don't be late! April 18, 10:43 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 4 Judge: Now then, I believe our next witness is Ms. Jinxie Tenma, a maid at Kyubi Manor. I believe we can proceed now -- if the witness is ready, that is. Jinxie: N-N-Nurarihyon! Leader of the One Hundred Demons! He really does exist! Athena: Wow... That is one well-polished tray... Judge: The witness will show her face while in court, or her testimony will be inadmissible. Jinxie: Eek! Judge: What is it, my child?! Jinxie: Be gone, Nurarihyon, Leader of the One Hundred Demons! Judge: Ho ho ho. You think I'm a yokai? Well, I WAS once known as a judicial monster of sorts. The beast of the bar, the demon of due process, if you will. Jinxie: Eek! My charm has no effect... Athena: The demon of due process? Not sure I can see that one... Blackquill: .........Now, you little scamp. Jinxie: Yes? Blackquill: I trust you know why you're here. Jinxie: .........B-B-Bags. Blackquill: Bags? Oh, that tricksy tanuki? Try the noodle stand. And go enjoy a big bowl of tanuki tail noodles why you're at it. Apollo: (Everyone's a comedian.) Jinxie: No... I meant YOUR bags. The ones under your eyes. You must have trouble sleeping. (Changed from [No... I meant YOUR bags. The one's [sic] under your eyes. You must have trouble sleeping.] in the original release) Here. This charm will keep Azukiarai away. Blackquill: Azukiarai? The yokai that washes azuki beans? The only thing needing washing will be your father's neck before I take his head clean off! Jinxie: Azukiarai often keeps people up at night with the noise he makes washing beans. But if you stick this charm on your forehead, you won't hear him anymore. Blackquill: .........I-Is that so? Well, thank you. Athena: Looks like Prosecutor Blackquill got more than he bargained for. Apollo: They're bad enough alone, but together, those two are just plain creepy. Judge: Your testimony, if you please, Ms. Tenma. Specifically, whether or not you saw Tenma Taro when you discovered the crime scene. Witness Testimony -- What Jinxie Saw -- Jinxie: Did I see Tenma Taro in the Fox Chamber? Well, when I opened the door... *shiver* I saw... I saw... Yes! Now I remember! Y-Y-Yokai! Yokai! Right there in that room! Apollo: So there was a yokai at the scene of the crime! Jinxie: *shiver* Uh-huh, lots... and lots of them! Apollo: Wait, more than one yokai? Did Tenma Taro happen to be among them? Jinxie: I don't know! I just don't know! All I know is the room was swimming in yokai! Kasha, Nurikabe, Setotaisho! Eeek! They were all there! Judge: Well this is an unexpected turn of events. We've gone from no yokai to a flood of them. Blackquill: This is ludicrous. You would have this court listen to this delusional little scamp's testimony?! Apollo: Yurk! Athena: Athena: Your Honor! I believe her memory is simply clouded by fear! But a quick therapy session should ease her mind. With the court's permission, of course. Judge: What a fabulous idea! Please proceed, Ms. Cykes. Apollo: You sure you know what you're doing, Athena? Athena: She's obviously not herself. The trauma of discovering that crime scene... ...and fear of testifying have her dazed and confused. A regular ball of confusion! But my analytical psychology-based approach should be able to help. Judge: Any objections, Prosecutor Blackquill? Shall we let Ms. Cykes proceed? Blackquill: ............Hmph. It makes no difference to me. Do as you will, but I doubt we shall get any viable testimony. She'd be better served by bearing witness to the sword skills I forged in a distant land! Athena: Hmph! I'll show you! Jinxie: Did I see Tenma Taro in the Fox Chamber? Jinxie: Well, when I opened the door... *shiver* I saw... I saw... Jinxie: Yes! Now I remember! Jinxie: Y-Y-Yokai! Yokai! Right there in that room! Athena: Found something! Hmm... Looks like an out-of-control emotion. Apollo: Um, Athena? What exactly are we looking at here? Athena: Oh, this? It's one of Widget's functions. Right here you can see images and emotions extracted from the witness's voice. Apollo: Whoa! You mean that little thing can do all this?! Widget: Pretty cool, huh?! Apollo: (And here I thought it was just some kids' toy.) Athena: Unfortunately, all I'm getting is an overflow error right now. See how Sad is brightly lit there at the bottom left? She's under an uncontrollable amount of distress, which is masking her other emotions. It seems the sheer terror she experienced has made her a confused mess. Apollo: So all those yokai she thinks she saw are a product of rampant emotions? Athena: Yes, that's right. Her fear has instilled in her hallucinations and false memories. She's seeing normal everyday objects as monsters in her mind. It's a form of schizophrenic hallucination brought on by emotional trauma. And the trauma in Jinxie's case is fear. Apollo: (So she was, and still is, seeing ordinary objects as yokai...) Athena: We'll have to find the root cause of her extreme fear before I can treat it. Now, let's see... Apollo, can you point out the yokai on the wheel of fire? She seems particularly terrified of that one. Start by pressing Probe ([L / LB / Q]). (Changed from [Start by tapping Probe (L) on the bottom screen.] in the original release) Next, point to what's causing Jinxie's out-of-control emotion. Finally, hit Probe again ([X / Y / R]) to try and get to the heart of the matter! (Changed from [Finally, tap Probe again (X) to try and get to the heart of the matter!] in the original release) Apollo: (Okay, let's give this a try.) Jinxie: Y-Y-Yokai! Yokai! Right there in that room! Probe Cat Monster on a Wheel of Fire Apollo: Leads to: \"Jinxie, what's the name for that yokai on a wheel of fire?\" Apollo: Jinxie, what's the name for that yokai on a wheel of fire? Jinxie: Th-That's... a Kasha, a yokai that steals the bodies of the recently deceased! I bet it came to steal the alderman's! Apollo: It's almost creepy how well that fits the actual situation. Athena: Exactly! It's a form of hallucination where the patient can't see things for what they are! There must be something at the scene of the crime that she's mistaking for a Kasha! Apollo, you need to point out what she thought was a yokai on a wheel of fire! Apollo: (Hmm... I think I know the answer now.) Jinxie, that wasn't a Kasha you saw. Could you have possibly mistaken this for a Kasha? Present chandelier Apollo: Leads to: \"The light fixture?\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: This is what you mistook for a Kasha! Athena: What? That thing? Apollo: No? Jinxie: I'd never mistake that for a Kasha! Apollo: Really? Athena: You have to consider what a Kasha looks like, Apollo. Think, brightly blazing wheel near the ceiling. Apollo: (Okay... Let's give this another try.) Leads back to: \"Could you have possibly mistaken this for a Kasha?\" Jinxie: The light fixture? Apollo: This one right here. It has a flame design and is up there on the ceiling. There was never a yokai on a wheel of fire. The Kasha you saw was just a light fixture! Jinxie: Eeeeeek! Athena: That's one memory back to normal! Nice job! Now that you've got the hang of it, it should be a cinch to point out the rest! Apollo: Jinxie! What about this white wall-like monster? Jinxie: Th-That's Nurikabe! It's a wall monster that blocks your way or leads you astray! Apollo: That's no yokai, Jinxie! It's a folding screen! Jinxie: Eeeeek! Apollo: And this racoon dog isn't a tanuki monster, it's just the statue of one! Jinxie: Eeeeeeeeek! Apollo: And look! These are just coffee cups. And this right here? It's nothing more than a fox statue! Jinxie: Eeeeeeeeeeeek! I don't know what I was thinking! NOISE LEVEL50% Athena: You did it, Apollo! Her extreme fear is under control now! Jinxie: It was all just my eyes playing tricks on me. There weren't any yokai after all! Athena: See! A clear-cut statement. That's the power of my psychology and your intuition, Apollo! And just like we thought, there never really were any yokai in the Fox Chamber! Blackquill: .........Right. There never really were any yokai there. So, the defense is asserting the exact opposite of their original assertion? Apollo: ............Wait. Um, Jinxie? What about Tenma Taro? Jinxie: There wasn't anyone there dressed up as Tenma Taro, or any other yokai, either. I remember it clearly now. Apollo: You've-- Athena: Gotta-- Apollo: Be-- Jokiiiiiiiiiing!!! Judge: Order! Order in the court! Apollo: I think we just dug our own grave. Blackquill: Allow me to push you on in. It's the least I can do. Apollo: Nooo...! Athena: Apollo! Can I interrupt your freak-out for just a minute? I'm still picking up some noise! It's an unexpected emotion! Apollo: Does that mean Jinxie hasn't remembered everything yet? Athena: Exactly! We should be able to get something else out of her! I'll enter the new information we have and run an update! Jinxie: Did I see Tenma Taro in the Fox Chamber? Jinxie: I was so scared when I entered the room... Jinxie: ... my legs gave out and I fell to the floor. Pinpoint Sad marker Apollo: Leads to: \"The amount of fear you felt is rather low despite your legs having given out from fright.\" Jinxie: There in the Fox Chamber I saw... *shiver* Jinxie: ...the alderman dead on a table and papa collapsed in a chair. Jinxie: Nobody else was there! And that includes Tenma Taro! Apollo: Wait. What am I supposed to do? Athena: Try to find the emotions that contradict her statements. Apollo: So if I find a contradictory emotion, I should point it out? Athena: That's right. But it's not just contradictory emotions you should look out for. You should also keep an eye out for sudden changes in an emotion's intensity. Her emotions might get stronger or weaker as you move from statement to statement. It's important to compare how the same emotion changes throughout the testimony. Apollo: Contradictory emotions and changes in intensity... Okay, I'll give it a shot. Apollo: The amount of fear you felt is rather low despite your legs having given out from fright. Could something have lessened your fear? Jinxie: Actually, I did experience a sudden burst of courage at that moment. Apollo: You did? Where did it come from? Jinxie: Um... uh... Let me think... Oh, it was Mama. I suddenly felt as if she was there with me. Athena: Okay, I'll enter, \"Sudden burst of courage.\" Now, let's see... Ah! Look! Apollo, the noise is all gone! Jinxie seems to have remembered everything now! NOISE LEVEL0%BYE BYE Apollo: A sudden burst of courage... Now where could that have come from? Jinxie, was there something that gave you a sudden burst of courage? Jinxie: Um, yes there was, b-but... um... I, uh... I realized I had done something naughty when I thought about it later. Athena: Any idea what could have given Jinxie that courage? Apollo: Well, there IS one piece of evidence that comes to mind. I wonder if she saw something like it at the scene of the crime. Jinxie, did your sudden burst of courage have anything to do with this? Present Nine-Tails Flower Apollo: Leads to: \"Jinxie, you didn't happen to see a Nine-Tails Flower there at the scene, did you?\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: Could it have been this?! Jinxie: ...Huh? Apollo: (Oh... That's not encouraging...) Athena: The evidence you presented seems to have produced confusion rather than courage. Apollo: Guess I got that one wrong. Athena: Well, if at first you don't succeed... You know the rest, Apollo! Leads back to: \"Jinxie, did your sudden burst of courage have anything to do with this?\" Apollo: Jinxie, you didn't happen to see a Nine-Tails Flower there at the scene, did you? Jinxie: Ah! The demon lawyer strikes again. I can't hide anything from you. I found a small case with a picture of a Nine-Tails Flower on it. I liked it so much, I kept it! Apollo: You what?! You can't remove evidence from a crime scene! Judge: That's right, young lady. Removing evidence is a big no-no. Now, the witness will produce said evidence this instant! Jinxie: S-Sorry, sorry... Judge: Hmm... It does seem to be some sort of case. Oh, look, something slid out. It... appears to be a key! Blackquill: Might I have a look, Your Baldness? Hmmm......... Ah! This is none other than the master key to Kyubi Manor. Judge: Are you certain of this, Prosecutor Blackquill? Blackquill: It matches the serial number of the key that went missing after the murder. Apollo: A master key... that went missing? (Why don't I like the sound of that...?) Blackquill: Our little scamp here has stumbled upon an article of unimaginable consequence. Apollo: That's a little melodramatic, don't you think? Blackquill: Hmph. Heed these words, for I shall say them but once. The sole key to the Fox Chamber has been in this little scamp's constant possession. Ergo, she was the sole person who could use it before, during, and after the murder. Which leaves the master key as the only other key that could have opened the chamber. But this master key... ...was found in a room that had been locked by this girl. Apollo: And your point is? Blackquill: Until Jinxie Tenma opened the Fox Chamber with her key... ...the room had been locked tight from the outside world. And there was no one else in there, save the victim and his killer. I trust you have figured it out for yourself by now. A killer other than Mayor Tenma himself would be utterly inconceivable! Apollo: Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Athena: Athena: How... could... this... happen...?! Nnrrrrrrgh...! Judge: The defense's assistant will refrain from growling her frustrations! Apollo: A-Athena, are you all right? Athena: Ugh! I know Mayor Tenma's innocent, but there's nothing we can do! Widget: This sucks! Blackquill: ...Cykes-dono. Allow me to put you out of your misery. Athena: Can I decline your offer? Blackquill: Abandon your client and your misplaced faith in him. Let the relief of a clear head and a clean conscious come rushing in. That will make the inevitable guilty verdict far easier to accept. Apollo: (Great. Now he's playing Simon Says with us! Well, he's not going to fool us with his stupid mind games! (Changed from [Well, he's not going fool [sic] us with his stupid mind games!] in the original release)) Athena, don't fall for his tricks! Athena: Uuh... Now I'M the one who's dazed and confused. I can't even think straight. Apollo: Hey, are you all right?! (She fell right into his trap!) Blackquill: Now, I suggest you make a mad dash from the courtroom and into the wild blue yonder. Only by running shall your mind be cleared and your conscious cleansed. Athena: All right, I'll be back in 10! Apollo: Apollo: Stay with me, Athena! Don't let yourself be twisted by that samurai! Athena: Apollo? Judge: Mr. Justice? ...I heard the word objection, but what is it you object to? Apollo: Huh...? Oh, right... (That objection was more of a reflex than anything else... ...though I was hoping something would come to me while I was trying to stop Athena...) Judge: The court is waiting, Mr. Justice. Though as it stands now... ...I'll be forced to declare your client guilty and your legal skills suspect if this is it. Now, do you have anything that could overturn the prosecution's case? Apollo: Um, well... Actually, I do! I'm Apollo Justice, and I'm fine! Athena: Apollo! You do have something more than your Chords of Steel, don't you? Apollo: Not really, but we'll be fine! Athena: B-B-But...! Apollo: (I've got absolutely nothing, but that's never stopped me before! I have to explain how the real killer could have escaped that locked room. Because it's all over if I don't!) Athena: Apollo, this calls for a new approach! Try to think outside the box! Apollo: Or in this case, inside the box! (And what a doozy that locked room is, too.) Judge: Well, Mr. Justice? Do you have anything that can counter the prosecution's argument? Apollo: Y-You bet I do! The real killer must have escaped from the locked room one way or another! Blackquill: Vague conjecture shall only earn you a taste of my blade, Justice-dono. Apollo: Err... (Time to do or die, literally!) Judge: The defense will now explain how it would be possible to escape the locked room. Athena: Y-You sure about this, Apollo? Can you really explain what happened? Apollo: I-I'm fine! We just need to think this whole escaping-a-locked-room thing over from the beginning! So... let's see. If the killer had escaped... ...how could they have done so? Athena: The choices are pretty limited. The room has a window, but... ...it doesn't open wide enough for anyone to get through, and there's a sheer cliff outside. As for the air vent... ...it's up too high and there's nothing you could stand on to reach it. And needless to say... ...the Forbidden Chamber wouldn't open no matter what we did, so that's out. Apollo: Yeah, that's why we gotta keep the solution simple. Like they say, simple is best. (Changed from [Yeah, that [sic] why we gotta keep the solution simple. Like they say, simple is best.] in the original release) We need to rule out all of the absolutely impossible escape routes. Then, whatever's left just might lead us to how the Fox Chamber was compromised! Your Honor! The defense proposes that the killer escaped through here! Present Fox Chamber door Apollo: Leads to: \"The hallway door? Well, yes, I suppose that would be the only way out.\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Judge: Hmm... And just how did the killer escape through there, Mr. Justice? Your reasoning skills seem as questionable as your proposed escape route. Apollo: Ack! I wish I could escape right now. Judge: I'm afraid there's no escaping a penalty for your random guessing, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Um, could I try that one again? Leads back to: \"Your Honor! The defense proposes that the killer escaped through here!\" Judge: The hallway door? Well, yes, I suppose that would be the only way out. Blackquill: .........Hmph. It would appear you've already forgotten. The only available key until Jinxie Tenma came on scene was within that locked room. How would one exit the Fox Chamber, and then lock it without a key? Hmm? Apollo: I should've seen this coming... Athena: Remember Apollo, keep it simple. Apollo: Simple, right. I could understand if the killer had exited the room with the key, but... Judge: Well, Mr. Justice? The prosecution has some fine Japanese steel waiting unless you explain yourself quickly. Apollo: I-I'm fine! I can explain myself! The reason the Fox Chamber's hallway door was locked was because... Tenma locked it from inside Apollo: Mayor Tenma locked it himself after the killer fled the scene... ...just in case the killer decided to return. That would explain why the room was locked! Judge: Yes, I see... Then again, wouldn't Mayor Tenma have mentioned that himself? Apollo: Oh, uh, maybe it slipped his mind because of that blow to his head? Aaaaaagh! Blackquill: ...Hmph. I have already considered and investigated such possibilities. Apollo: You have? Blackquill: The mayor's fingerprints were not found on the door or its doorknob. The only fingerprints found belonged to the alderman. Ergo, the mayor did not so much as touch the door. Apollo: (Oops.) Okay, then how about... Leads back to: \"The reason the Fox Chamber's hallway door was locked was because...\" It locked on its own Apollo: Maybe the door closed accidentally... on its own. (Changed from [Maybe the door closed accidently [sic]... on its own.] in the original release) Ack! Blackquill: The killer will never be identified if we attribute key moments to mere chance. Perhaps that spear just happened to fly off of the wall and impale the alderman, too. And perhaps that sedative just happened to make its way into his coffee. Mere chance could explain any number of things. Apollo: Right, um... next idea, then... Leads back to: \"The reason the Fox Chamber's hallway door was locked was because...\" The perp locked it from outside Leads to: \"What if the door was locked from the outside?\" Apollo: What if the door was locked from the outside? In other words, the killer took the key through the hallway door, then locked it-- Youch! Blackquill: Consider this: The master key was found inside the tightly locked Fox Chamber. Any assertion that the key was removed from that room is a blatant contradiction of fact. Athena: Exiting the room before locking the door WOULD require taking the key outside. But the key was found inside the room, which does seem like a contradiction. Apollo: If only we could explain both. Like, how the key could be inside the room AND be used to lock the door from outside. Judge: Well, let's see if the defense can respond before Prosecutor Blackquill draws his sword. (Changed from [Well, let's see if the defense can response [sic] before Prosecutor Blackquill draws his sword.] in the original release) How could the master key be at the crime scene, despite the room being locked tight? Slipped it in when the door was opened Apollo: Maybe someone threw it in from the hallway when Jinxie opened the door? That would explain-- Aaah! Blackquill: .........Hmph. Perhaps we should ask the little scamp herself. When you opened the Fox Chamber, did you witness anyone throw the master key inside? Jinxie: Sorry. I didn't see anyone else there. Apollo: Oh... Blackquill: What a pity. Or perhaps you intend to accuse the witness of murder? Judge: You leave me no choice. A penalty for random speculation and lack of foresight. Apollo: Ugh. (How could've someone gotten the key into that locked room?) Judge: Let's try that again. Leads back to: \"How could the master key be at the crime scene, despite the room being locked tight?\" Threw it in from outside Leads to: \"What if someone threw it into the room from outside -- you know, something like...\" Changed the lock Apollo: If the door had been rebuilt after the key was placed in the room... ...that would explain how it got there! Judge: Hmm... And the original door? Where did that disappear to? Apollo: Well, I guess it's highly unlikely that the door was rebuilt in the first place, so-- Ack! Judge: Penalty! Apollo: Ugh. (How could've someone gotten the key into that locked room?) Judge: Let's try that again. Leads back to: \"How could the master key be at the crime scene, despite the room being locked tight?\" Apollo: What if someone threw it into the room from outside -- you know, something like... ...go out the hallway door, lock the room, and then toss the key back in through the window. That would explain how the master key could be inside the locked room! Blackquill: ...And where would you throw it from? There is a cliff outside the Fox Chamber's window. Throwing the key in from there is an impossibility. Apollo: .........Oh! Right... Ack! Athena: I wonder if the key could've been tossed in from somewhere other than the window. Apollo: Somewhere other than the window? Hmm... Could the key have been tossed in through somewhere other than the window? Present Air Duct Apollo: Leads to: \"The air vent?\" Present window Apollo: Apollo: I propose the key was tossed in through the window! Blackquill: It seems the defense has developed a case of amnesia. A sheer cliff lies just outside that window. No one tossed in anything through there. Apollo: What if you threw it in from the bottom of the cliff? I bet you could get it in if you threw it as hard as you could? Blackquill: ...Hmph. I'm afraid you would still have no ground to stand on, just as with your case. For you see, a raging river lies at the bottom of that cliff. Judge: A penalty for the amnesia-prone attorney! Apollo: Ugh. (So the key didn't get in through the window. Guess I'd better rethink this.) Leads back to: \"Could the key have been tossed in through somewhere other than the window?\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: I propose the key was tossed in through here! Judge: Hmm... And how would that even be possible? Apollo: Oh, um... Very carefully, Your Honor? Judge: ......... The defense will refrain from tossing around vague answers to key questions. Apollo: Ack! Judge: Let's try that again. How could the key have wound up in that locked room? Apollo: (Well, if it isn't the window, from where else could it have been thrown inside?) Leads back to: \"Could the key have been tossed in through somewhere other than the window?\" Judge: The air vent? Apollo: Yes. The window may be out of the question, but the air vent's not! Athena: Oh, that's right! The Fox Chamber's air duct... ...leads out into the hallway. Apollo: That's right. The real killer entered the air duct from the vent outside the Fox Chamber... ...then dropped the key into the room through the vent inside the chamber! Blackquill: Hrgh! That's preposterous! Athena: Ooh, that explains how the key got in there after it was used to lock the door perfectly! Judge: Mr. Justice! Um... I'm afraid I'm a bit confused... Apollo: Don't worry! I'll explain it so even Your Honor can understand. First, the real killer, disguised as Tenma Taro, murdered the alderman in the Fox Chamber. Then, they fled the room through the hallway door and locked it. Next, they entered the air duct from the vent outside in the hallway. Finally, the killer tossed the key into the room through the air vent in the ceiling there! All that was left to do after that was go back through the duct and flee the manor! Well, Your Honor?! Could that be any clearer?! Judge: Amazing! Even I could follow that! Athena: The judge seems really pleased. Apollo: That explains everything! The real killer was someone dressed up like Tenma Taro. And there WAS someone else other than the mayor and the alderman in that room! Man: Hey, it looks like that lawyer has beaten the jailbird prosecutor! Man: Whoa! That was a total turnabout! Woman: That massive forehead of his seems so much more attractive now! Judge: Order! Order! Order, I say!!! Apollo: Now that I've proved a possible third party, I don't see how our client could be guilty! Blackquill: Blackquill: ..........A valiant effort, Justice-dono, but your final thrust missed its mark. Apollo: Huh? Blackquill: Both that little scamp and the tricksy tanuki saw the yokai after it left the room. But then what? Did that irksome yokai simply go through the foyer and waltz right out the front door? Apollo: Th-That's exactly what happened! The killer fled from the-- Youch! Blackquill: But that is impossible -- without being spotted by the foyer's security camera, that is. The electric eye here would have captured any pesky little yokai trying to escape. However, there is no sign of Tenma Taro anywhere in the security footage. Apollo: Wh-Wh-What?! Blackquill: Save for the foyer entrance, there is no other way to flee the manor, is there? Apollo: I don't feel so good. Athena: Athena: Wait! I believe there IS one other way to escape besides the foyer entrance! There's a large window in the foyer. It's possible to escape through there without being seen by the security camera. Apollo: Hey, you're right! Blackquill: Blackquill: Hmph. Must I point out every crucial detail to the defense? It seems you lack not only brains, but investigative prowess to boot. That is the cliff side of the manor. The only killer escaping that way would be a dead one. Athena: N-Nooooooooon! Apollo: Wait... So the killer didn't escape out the foyer window? Widget: What the heck, right? Blackquill: ....Ha! I suppose your next proposal is the killer sprouted wings and flew off into the sunset? Apollo: (That would mean the killer really was a yokai...) Athena: ...If only we had some sort of evidence that could point to a flying killer. Apollo: Who's saying we don't? (As completely far-fetched as it might be...) Athena: WHAAAT?! You're saying you can prove the killer could fly?! Apollo: Whoa! I thought I was the one with the Chords of Steel! Judge: Oh, I can't wait to hear this. Apollo: Um, Your Honor...? Judge: What evidence do you have that the killer flew away? Present Special Edition Paper Apollo: Leads to: \"Take a look at this special edition paper.\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: This piece of evidence shows that the killer yokai flew through the sky! Blackquill: ............ Apollo: ............ Blackquill: ............ Apollo: Never mind. Lemme try that again. Judge: Mr. Justice! You wouldn't be trying to escape without a penalty, would you?! Apollo: (I know we have some kind of evidence of a flying yokai.) Blackquill: Justice-dono, surrender yourself now or suffer the death of a thousand cuts. Apollo: N-Never! Leads back to: \"What evidence do you have that the killer flew away?\" Apollo: Take a look at this special edition paper. Judge: \"Tenma Taro: Real or Flight of Fancy?\" ...What does this article prove, Mr. Justice? Apollo: The photo in that article was taken shortly after the murder. Maybe the yokai in that photo is the killer shortly after they fled out of the window...? Judge: M-Mr. Justice! You're not seriously suggesting--! Apollo: Oh, I'm serious! I mean, it all adds up! The killer, disguised as Tenma Taro, flew away! You know, by some way or another! Blackquill: Blackquill: It is your brain that has flown the coop. (Changed from [It is your brain that has flow [sic] the coop.] in the original release) That image is naught but trick photography or some other form of artifice. Apollo: Okay, then, how about the Tenma Taro figure Mr. Filch saw? It just vanished into thin air? Blackquill: .........No, there is a rational, common-sense explanation for that. That infernal yokai our tricksy tanuki witnessed never reached the entrance. He -- or should I say she -- turned back before the camera's electric eye. Apollo: ......She? (I don't like where this is going one bit!) Blackquill: Now, the fact that we know the yokai had come from the Fox Chamber... ...means that it was likely either Mayor Tenma or his daughter Jinxie Tenma. However, we know that Mayor Tenma was already unconscious at that time. Apollo: *gulp* (Not good. Not good at all!) Blackquill: Do you understand the gravity of the situation now, Justice-dono? The falsified yokai remnants... ...and the appearance of \"Tenma Taro\" were the work of one individual. And that individual is none other than Jinxie Tenma! Apollo: ............ Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh! Nooooooooooooooooooooooo! Judge: Order! Order! The defense will stop competing for the greatest freak-out ever! Blackquill: The little scamp was, no doubt, simply trying to protect her father. And it's no wonder that her superstitious mind conjured up this mad masquerade. Judge: Prosecutor Blackquill's assertion makes perfect sense to me. It's far more convincing than saying the killer escaped by flying out of the window. Blackquill: Hmph. Did you truly believe this could end any other way? Apollo: (Did we fall right into his trap?) Athena: What do we do now, Apollo? Apollo: Our case no longer stands without a real yokai. If only we had one. Blackquill: Bailiff, seize her! It is time I interrogated her as the samurai of yore would. ???: Apollo: M-Mayor Tenma? Tenma: ......... Blackquill: Hmph. This farce is over. How does it feel, seeing your own daughter accused of a cover-up most foul? Tenma: ......... Tenma Taro's true identity is-- Blackquill: Now, now, Mr. Mayor. It would be futile at this point to claim you were the yokai. After all, you had been knocked out cold by a blow to the skull. Slipping into a yokai costume and roaming about the manor would be all but impossible. Tenma: ......... Blackquill: Consider this well. As it stands, your daughter will be arrested for obstruction of justice. But if you confess, the prosecution would be willing to overlook her little yokai farce. Judge: Confess? The defendant intends to confess?! Apollo: Wait! Athena: Apollo! Prosecutor Blackquill's up to his mind games again! Apollo: Mayor Tenma! No! Don't fall for his twisted words! If you're sent away for murder, Jinxie will be left all alone! Tenma: .........The real killer is... Athena: Mayor Tenma's going to confess unless we do something! Apollo: (But... But I can't prove how the real killer could've flown away...) Tenma: ............ Caw caw-caw-caw! Look upon me and despair, for ripe is the time for my return. Apollo: Hm? (Uh-oh... I should watch what I wish for.) Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! Foolish mortals! I am Tenma Taro, the yokai you seek! Apollo: Um... M-Mayor Tenma? Tenma: Silence! I am Tenma Taro -- freed from the bonds binding me to the Forbidden Chamber! Behold! The return of the Demon King! Apollo: Wh-What the--?! Athena: Demon King...?! Judge: Well then, I think it's time for me to... ...t-take a vacatioooon! The witness will...! Um... He will explain himself! Are you saying you're Tenma Taro, the yokai we've been chasing this whole time? Tenma: Indeed, it is I, Tenma Taro, the one whom you seek -- come to reveal the truth. This child is Tenma Taro, you say? Hah! What nonsense! Apollo: So, Mayor Tenma... is a yokai now? Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! His body is now mine! Judge: So, you're saying that Mayor Tenma is... being possessed by you? And that the yokai that Jinxie Tenma and Phineas Filch saw... ...and the one captured in the newspaper photo... Those were all you? Tenma: The accursed power of these warding charms prevents me from revealing my true form. Apollo: ......... Blackquill: Your Baldness! .........Can this not be interpreted as an admission of guilt?! Judge: Well, a confession by a yokai would be quite unprecedented. Blackquill: Be that as it may, the defense's case has been overturned. Apollo: Huh? What?! Blackquill: You claimed the yokai that little scamp saw was some third party -- the true killer... ...the one who escaped from the locked Fox Chamber, but it was the accused all along. Apollo: Argh! Blackquill: Ironic, is it not? Your yokai turned out to be real in a manner of speaking. For the alderman's killer is none other than Mayor Tenma! And the yokai at the scene? That, too, was Mayor Tenma, or should I say, our dear Tenma Taro! The pieces have all fallen into place. Apollo: H-How so, Prosecutor Blackquill? Blackquill: Hmph. It seems I must spell it out for you. Mayor Tenma killed the alderman in the Fox Chamber -- which was locked at the time. He then removed the warding charms from the Forbidden Chamber's door... ...but then fell unconscious from the blow the alderman had delivered to his head. That's when his daughter Jinxie Tenma stumbled on the scene of the crime. The little scamp fled in terror, whereupon the spirit of Tenma Taro... ...freed at last from the charm's warding effect, took possession of the mayor. The newly freed Tenma Taro then fled from the Fox Chamber. So, you see, the yokai Jinxie Tenma saw was her father possessed by Tenma Taro. Apollo: Apollo: But when we arrived on scene, the mayor was found unconscious! How's that possible if he was supposed to have flown out the foyer window?! Blackquill: Then, what? Do you mean to say the maid of Kyubi Manor, Jinxie Tenma, was Tenma Taro? Apollo: ............Oh. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Tenma: Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! That, too, is easily explained. Flew about for a time did I, but presently tired, I made for the Forbidden Chamber. But alas, exhaustion took me unaware in the Fox Chamber, and I knew no more. Blackquill: Hmph. It would seem the pieces are still in place. Apollo: (Is Blackquill up to his tricks again?) Judge: I-I don't know what to say. Is the defendant a real live...? Man: So that rumor about Mayor Tenma is true? I knew yokai were real! Man: You mean he really did kill the alderman just so he could release Tenma Taro?! Judge: Order! Order!!! Athena: Now he's got everyone in the courtroom believing in yokai! Apollo: It's Simon Says on steroids! He wants to convict our client any way he can -- even if it means blaming a yokai! Blackquill: The proverbial ducks are all in a row. You should now have no qualms about finding the accused guilty, Your Baldness. Judge: Hmm... This is one of the most bizarre cases in my entire career. Otherworldly, in fact. Can yokai even be prosecuted under our legal system? Apollo: Apollo: Mayor Tenma is just pretending to be Tenma Taro to protect his daughter. Plus, I already proved how a third party could have escaped from the locked room! A verdict at this point would be premature! Judge: Hmm... Since both sides have raised valid points, I've no choice but to-- Blackquill: Blackquill: Hmph! This is the dark age of the law where defense attorneys are not to be trusted. This is but a ploy to gain time for them to fabricate evidence! How will I sleep tonight... ...knowing you will not let the run rise on the mayor's day of reckoning, Justice-dono? Apollo: Apollo: I won't fabricate any evidence! Blackquill: Blackquill: Then prove it by joining me. A night in the clink will ensure you will not succumb to temptation! Apollo: How about I just promise not to succumb to anything? Blackquill: We have both evidence and a confession. The killer is this yokai before us. It is beyond dispute. A guilty verdict is all but-- Uuuwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Apollo: What's wrong with him? Fulbright: Prosecutor Blackquill! We've had enough of your hijinks! The foundation of justice is fair play, and you are in serious violation of that! Blackquill: *huff* *huff* What in the devil was that? Fool Bright! Have you tampered with my shackles in some manner? Fulbright: Ha ha ha ha! It seems you found that quite shocking. It's my special Jolt of Justice device. Each press is a shocking reminder to behave. Blackquill: You shall pay for this. I, Simon Blackquill, vow to-- Uuuwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Fulbright: Your Honor! You need not fear now! I believe Prosecutor Blackquill will remain on his best behavior. Apollo: ...A bit late with the reassurances, aren't we, Detective? Judge: W-Well, in that case... *ahem*... This concludes today's deliberations. The prosecution and the defense will use this opportunity to further their investigations. This court is adjourned! To be continued Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: That statement clearly contradicts the evidence! Blackquill: ...Hmph. I object to you on personal grounds. The sole contradiction lies in what your faulty logic dreamt up just now. Apollo: Ack! Judge: Objection overruled. The defense will think twice before making such erroneous statements! Apollo: (It seems that statement didn't particularly conflict with the evidence.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: Consider the evidence. There's obviously something wrong with that statement! Blackquill: Your gall knows no bounds. It's shocking, really. Apollo: What's that supposed to mean?! Blackquill: You stand there, brazely objecting to perfectly factual statements... One does not see such shameless behavior that often. Judge: A penalty for our shameless attorney! Apollo: (Oh, no. Looks like Blackquill is turning the judge against me.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: The evidence is at complete odds with the witness's testimony! Blackquill: ...........................Your Baldness. Judge: Wh-Who, me? Blackquill: What do you make of this objection of his? Judge: Oh, I don't know if I should, um, well... Blackquill: I've no patience for vagaries. Now, answer my question. Judge: Y-Yes, sir! The defense's objection was clearly misguided! Blackquill: Bravo. Nicely done. Judge: Ho ho ho. It seems our misguided attorney has earned himself a penalty. Apollo: (Erk... I better look before I leap next time!) Consult (when evidence must be presented) Athena: Hmm... There has to be a contradiction here somewhere. Apollo: (Too bad I'm drawing a blank.) Athena: There was a statement that I thought was a little strange, but... ...I wouldn't bet my life on it. Apollo: .........And which statement would that be? Since I'm the one betting my life on it. Athena: Hee hee hee. Okay, if you must know, I'll show you the one I'm thinking of. Apollo: (Time to swallow my pride and let her lend a hand.) (There must be an inconsistency in the testimony Athena's pointing out!) Consult (when statements must be pressed) Athena: Hmm... I can't flag any inconsistencies. Apollo: So there haven't been any contradictions in the testimony so far... That can mean only one thing... Athena: Time to press the witness! Apollo: Right. We'll have to work to get the testimony we need. Let's press the heck out of any statements that stick out. Pinpoint wrong emotion (during Mood Matrix segment \"What Jinxie Saw\") Apollo: Apollo: Hmm... This seems like an unnatural reaction... Athena: Really? Because I don't see it that way. Apollo: So it isn't unexpected given her testimony? Athena: Hello? Is there anybody in there? Just nod if you can hear me. Apollo: (Yes, there is someone at home, and that someone is going to try that again.) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's argument is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims! This court finds the defendant, Damian Tenma... Guilty The Monstrous Turnabout Image Gallery Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 April 18, 1:20 PMWright Anything Agency Athena: Having a yokai testify in court is unprecedented to say the least. Apollo: \"I am Tenma Taro, the yokai you seek!\" How could such a straight-laced man like Mr. Tenma suddenly become a demon? Athena: Yeah, it's strange. Even worse, Prosecutor Blackquill is playing along. *sigh* I can't even think straight anymore. I need to go out for a run! See you in a bit! Apollo: Wait! What about the--! ...Investigation. Trucy: Back! ...Eek! Athena: Whoa, whoa! Trucy, welcome back. Oh, you're in your stage outfit. Back from work? Trucy: Yep! I really nailed this new magic trick I've been working on! ...I also heard about those tricks that were conjured up in court earlier today. You know, the demon-out-of-nowhere trick and Polly's tightrope-style defense trick! Apollo: I was seriously considering a disappearing act of my own after all that craziness. ...Anyway, our next trick is to find a suspect other than the mayor. I know the killer must've used the air duct in the escape. Athena: And whoever did that was the Tenma Taro that Mr. Filch and Jinxie saw. Apollo: Right. Maybe there's some evidence in the air duct. Athena: The real fight starts right now! Trucy: Hey, before you go, let me make the evidence you no longer need disappear! 3, 2, 1... Ta-dah! Unnecessary evidence has disappeared into Trucy's magic panties. Apollo: (I wonder where all that stuff goes?) Athena: Okay, let's get over to the scene of the crime! ¡Vámonos, Apollo, Vámonos! (Changed from [Vamonos, Apollo, Vamonos!] in the original release) April 18Kyubi Manor - Fox Chamber Athena: Detective Fulbright! Mind if we search the air duct? Fulbright: Well, since you really are on the side of justice, I suppose I can let you... Plus, my own sense of justice has been called into doubt, so... Athena: Wonder if he's been like this ever since the trial. Apollo: Well, his sense of justice HAS been beaten to a pulp. It'll probably take a while for him to recover. Athena: I sorta feel bad for him, but we have work to do! Let's go get the evidence we need! Apollo: The air duct is the key. We know the Tenma Taro impersonator used it to make an escape. After murdering the alderman, the killer left the Fox Chamber through the hallway door. Then, after locking the door from the outside... ...the killer entered the air duct in the hallway. Finally, the killer dropped the key into the Fox Chamber through the air vent here... ...then went back through the duct and fled the manor. That's how the illusion of no one entering or leaving the locked room was created! Athena: If the killer passed through the air duct, maybe we'll find some evidence there. Apollo: Yeah, maybe some black feathers or something like that. Well, here's our vent. It's awfully high up. Athena: Don't worry, I brought a stepladder! Happy hunting! Apollo: (How nice of her to volunteer me for the job.) Whoa, it's pitch black in here. Well, here goes nothing! *cough, cough* *wheeze* *sputter* *cough, cough* There's a thick layer of dust in here! *cough, cough* *wheeze* *sputter* *cough, cough* ............ ...I don't... get it. Athena: Find anything? Yikes! Apollo, what happened?! You're covered in dust! Apollo: Yeah, dust... Lots of dust. Athena: So, what'd you find? Apollo: You know how dust collects on something when nobody uses it for a long time? Athena: Yeah, like Mr. Wright's desk back at the office. Apollo: Right... You think it'd be possible to crawl over that sort of dust without leaving a trail? Athena: I seriously doubt it... Wait, you're not suggesting--! No one's gone through that duct lately?! Apollo: Kinda looks that way. And if it's true, Mayor Tenma is going to be fingered as the killer. Athena: B-B-But...! Apollo: (If we don't turn things around quickly...) Fulbright: In justice we trust! Apollo: Ack! Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Sorry, Mr. Justice! But it seems your justice was not the most just, after all! It is MY sense of justice that has prevailed! Apollo: Argh! Athena: Detective Fulbright sure seems chipper all of a sudden. Apollo: Ugh. And I'm back to my old devastated self. Fulbright: Aw, come on! Where's that never-say-die spirit? Bring it on, Mr. Lawyer Man! Bring it on! Apollo: Let me suffer in peace. Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Justice prevails once more! Athena: It's not over yet! And besides... Kicking someone when they're down is what bad guys do! Fulbright: Ack! A-Are you calling me a... a bad guy?! Me? Bobby Fulbright, champion of justice?! Athena: Then how about some information on the investigation? We need some help here! Fulbright: Information? About the investigation? All right! But I won't have you calling me a bad guy ever again! Understood?! Athena: We did it, Apollo! Apollo: Yeah, but how long can we keep this up? Talk The investigation Athena: I can't believe Prosecutor Blackquill would stoop that low! I mean, to pinning the blame on a yokai?! He really wants a conviction at all costs! Apollo: (She could give a yokai a run for its money when she's mad...) Fulbright: Yes, well... I have him writing a self-reflective essay as we speak! Athena: I doubt that'll teach him anything. Apollo: Yeah, he'll probably just write \"Dotard\" a thousand times. Fulbright: That whole yokai business is most likely a ploy to win a conviction. Truth is, Prosecutor Blackquill believes Jinxie Tenma planted that yokai stuff. Planted it in an effort to protect her father -- the real killer. Athena: Yeah, right! I'd like to see him prove it! Fulbright: Whoa! Calm down! He doesn't have any direct evidence, but we did find this. It was at the base of the cliff just outside Kyubi Manor. Apollo: Wait... That isn't the staff Tenma Taro was supposedly carrying, is it? Fulbright: The one and only! Ms. Tenma no doubt tossed it over the cliff when she was done. Athena: No way! W-Well, what about prints?! Fulbright: Nope, no prints, but if she was wearing a costume, there wouldn't be any, anyway. Apollo: Well, prints or no prints, it's not going to work out in our favor. (Sounds like the staff might have belonged to the mansion. But if that's the case... ...then where in the mansion did Tenma Taro get it from?) The Amazing Nine-Tails Apollo: Did Prosecutor Blackquill figure out that the victim was The Amazing Nine-Tails? Fulbright: He did, indeed. He's a sharp one, all right. He figured it out while investigating the municipal merger and the victim's past. The Amazing Nine-Tails sparked the yokai craze and worked against the merger! And Mayor Damian Tenma is the corrupt politician who murdered that great hero! The Amazing Nine-Tails's fans are so angry, they even tried to storm the detention center! Athena: I don't blame them. I mean, their favorite masked wrestling hero was murdered. They must've been shocked when they found out what happened. Apollo: Speaking of which, isn't Jinxie also a fan of The Amazing Nine-Tails? Jinxie: A wrestler's mask is more precious than his own life! He'd never unmask himself in front of others. But there ARE matches where wrestlers battle for the right to remove each other's masks. Jinxie: To have your mask torn off is the worst humiliation a wrestler could suffer! That's why their masks are more important to them than life itself. Athena: She spoke with a passion that only a fan could appreciate. We oughta become fans ourselves and go protest in front of the prison! Apollo: What? No! Did you forget that Mayor Tenma is not only Jinxie's father, but our client!? Athena: Oh, yeah. Fulbright: You be careful, now. You're defending the most hated mayor in history. I just hope you don't find yourself on the wrong end of a figure-four leg lock! Apollo: (Maybe I should wear a mask to hide MY identity.) Present Crime Photo Fulbright: Such a grisly crime scene! I won't rest until that murderous fiend is behind bars! Apollo: So, you still think Mayor Tenma is responsible? Fulbright: That's right! Damian Tenma is an evil fiend who must be banished from this world! Now, take my hand and together we will defeat this evil! Apollo: Um, I think you're forgetting that Mayor Tenma's still my client. Kyubi's Autopsy Report Apollo: So, it was the spear that killed the alderman? Fulbright: That's right. He'd been in a drug-induced sleep, but woke the moment he was impaled. That's when he was struck by his attacker! Apollo: That's almost superhuman. Fulbright: Justice cannot allow evil to exist unopposed! Even if it means sacrificing one's life! Athena: I bet you two could strike back even if you were impaled! I mean, you're so full of justice. Apollo: Really? Or are you just saying that because of my name, Athena? After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: Are there any other new developments we should know? Fulbright: Hm, now that you mention it... Our suspect is suffering partial memory loss, but he DID manage to remember something. Apollo: He did? What did he say? Fulbright: He said he didn't want to speak with us. His exact words were: \"I am under no obligation to speak with you mortals!\" ...and other things of that nature. Apollo: (I wonder what Mayor Tenma remembered.) Fulbright: Too bad you can't go ask him now, 'cause Prosecutor Blackquill's busy questioning him. I know! Why don't you wait down at the playground with the rest of the kids? Ha ha. Athena: What now, Apollo? Apollo: How about regrouping back at the agency? Athena: Good idea. We might get some words of wisdom out of Mr. Wright while we're there. Detention Center, Yokai Lane, Kyubi Manor Garden, or Kyubi Manor Foyer Talk Any ideas? Athena: So the crime scene was locked tight at the time. Ugh, this is a tough one. Apollo: The only people in that locked room were the deceased -- the alderman -- and the mayor. Athena: Maybe the killer hid somewhere in that room. Apollo: But is there really anywhere to hide in the Fox Chamber? The trial Athena: That was quite a day in court. The news just can't stop talking about how the demon Tenma Taro made an appearance! Apollo: There's never an exorcist around when you need one. Athena: Well, I heard the judge actually held an exorcism in his courtroom after that. Apollo: Good. Let's hope it's the last we'll see of that pain-in-the-neck yokai. Athena: I don't know. I have a feeling Tenma Taro could exorcise an exorcist. Apollo: As an attorney defending a demon, I know exactly how that feels. Present Amazing Nine-Tails Mask Athena: I can't believe Alderman Kyubi was The Amazing Nine-Tails! Apollo: Hmm, maybe that's why the killer targeted him. His popularity among the anti-merger faction would have been a major obstacle. Athena: Yeah... Maybe the alderman felt threatened, and that's why he had to disguise himself. Jinxie's Statement Athena: Do you think the Tenma Taro Jinxie saw was the real killer? Apollo: Hmm... It's hard to say at this point. Athena: But if that's not our killer, then what was it doing in the manor? Apollo: ...Maybe it just wanted to use the bathroom. Athena: Huh?! I've heard of monsters in the closet and under the bed. They're in the bathroom, too?! Apollo: No, what I'm saying is the Tenma Taro Jinxie saw was someone dressed up like a yokai. I mean, there is no such thing as monsters in the bathroom. People on the other hand... Athena: Oh, I get it. That was your attempt at a joke. Ha ha, very funny... Apollo: (For someone so competitive and smart, she sure get some crazy ideas.) April 18Wright Anything Agency Apollo: Maybe I'll... go read over some past cases... Athena: And I'll... go do some research on exorcisms... Trucy: Hey, what's with you guys? You seem bummed out. Apollo: How should I put this? It's like we're at the edge of a cliff and the only way is down. Trucy: In other words, business as usual, right? Apollo: Yeah, I suppose so. Except this time, it's like we're bound and gagged, too. Athena: Don't forget blindfolded with our ears plugged up... Trucy: Ooh, and monsters at every turn, huh? Sounds rough... ???: Hey, Apollo. Oh, and Athena's here, too. Athena: Mr. Wright. Phoenix: How goes the investigation, Apollo, Athena? Athena: I think it's safe to say that things have gotten hairier than before. Phoenix: Really? What happened? Talk Our defense Phoenix: I was watching the two of you this morning from the gallery. That was one tough day in court, to say the least. Apollo: I know. I've never had to defend a yokai before. Phoenix: That business about the locked room was another major hurdle. Athena: Yeah, and on top of that, Jinxie was accused of being an accomplice! Phoenix: But at least you figured out how someone could have escaped that locked room. (Changed from [But at least you figured out how someone could have escaped the Forbidden Chamber.] in the original release) Apollo: Yeah, well, we just found out that our reasoning might be a tad... flawed. Phoenix: Oh, really? Well, that's... bad news. Athena: How are we going to get out of this one...? Phoenix: The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles. Athena: Force... a smile? Phoenix: Yeah. My mentor taught me that back when I was still learning the trade. She... also taught me to return to the basics whenever I got stuck. Apollo: Return to the basics? Phoenix: That's right. Always believe in your client, no matter what happens. That is a lawyer's greatest and most trusted weapon. Apollo: The basics... (Always believe in your client, huh...) You and Athena Apollo: So, Mr. Wright, how long have you known Athena? Phoenix: I met her during a trip to Europe. Apollo: Huh!? Y-You were in Europe? (Why haven't I heard about this before?) Phoenix: Yeah, I went there a few times to study the various legal systems over there. Apollo: Oh, okay... Er, wait a minute. I thought you worked as a pianist after you quit practicing law. Phoenix: I did, but an old friend of mine needed help with some legal work from time to time, so... Apollo: Oh, I guess you were never very far from the courtroom, then. Athena: It was like fate brought us together! It's thanks to Mr. Wright that I became a lawyer at all. Phoenix: Ha ha ha. I knew she was lawyer material from the moment I met her. And I have high hopes for her ability to analyze people's emotions. Athena: Aww, it's nothing special. Apollo: (Hmm... Maybe I've underestimated that analytical psychology of hers.) Athena: It's just, I thought that if my special ability could help defend innocent people... ...then I had to do everything in my power to bring it to the courtroom! That's when I really started hitting the books hard! Phoenix: I'm still amazed she actually became a lawyer. And at the tender age of eighteen, no less. (Changed from [And at the tender age of 18, no less.] in the original release) Apollo: Wow, that's almost superhuman. (Or personal -- like she's trying to help somebody she knows.) (Changed from [Or personal -- like she [sic] trying to help somebody she knows.] in the original release) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Your attorney's badge, huh... I used to show mine to everyone, too. Apollo: Why? Phoenix: You know, I never really thought about it. But I could ask you the same question. Apollo: Me? Well, I guess you could say I show it because there's someone to show it to. ...Or something like that. Phoenix: Ah ha ha. When you say it like that, it sounds kind of... I don't know... philosophical? Apollo: Heh heh, I guess it does. (.........Or does it?) Yokai Legend Scroll Apollo: Here's a little souvenir Trucy wanted you to have. Phoenix: Aww, how sweet! I know. I'll hang it in my office once the case is closed. Apollo: I don't know, it's pretty creepy looking. We don't want to freak our clients out. Phoenix: Hmm... You have a point there. Maybe you should hang it in your room, Apollo. Apollo: My room?! I don't want this thing in there! Phoenix: I don't want it, either. It has instant nightmare fuel written all over it. Apollo: Well, Trucy got it for you, so stop trying to pawn it off on me! Phoenix: You know... The more I look at it, the more I wonder if these are your distant relatives. Apollo: Hey... What's that supposed to mean?! Crime Photo Phoenix: So the room was locked tight and the only people in there were the suspect and victim? I headed up a similar case a long time ago. Apollo: Really?! Phoenix: Not only that, the defendant was my assistant. Apollo: What?! Phoenix: And not only that, the prosecutor for that trial loved to swing her whip around in court. Apollo: A whip?! Phoenix: When I saw that whip... man, I thought it was all over. Apollo: Wait, your assistant getting accused of murder hadn't made you think that already...? Anything else Phoenix: Ah ha ha. You're getting good at this, Apollo. Remember, the way you present evidence in court can really have an impact on the trial. Hmm... But your elbow angle's a little off. It should really be more like this. Apollo: I-I'll be fine! I'll be more careful next time. Promise! After clearing all Talk options: Athena: All right! I'm totally pumped up after talking to you, Mr. Wright! It's like you said, the worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles! Phoenix: And don't forget to return to the basics whenever you get stuck. Apollo: (Keep believing in my client. Right!) Um, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes? Apollo: I'm... I'm going to go visit our client again! Phoenix: I think that's a good idea. Apollo: (Alright, time to see what's new down at the Detention Center!) April 18Detention Center - Visitor's Room Athena: Mayor Tenma, we wanted to talk to you about something! Tenma: Caw-shaaaaaaaaw! Athena: Eeek! Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! So, my minions have returned! Athena: Apollo, he still thinks he's a yokai! Apollo: I wonder if we'll ever be able to talk to Mayor Tenma again. Tenma: Silence, peddler of the legal trade! Free me from these imprisoning walls with great haste! Athena: Wow... He's sounding more and more like a real demon with every sentence. I'm starting to wonder if we should even be helping him win his freedom. Apollo: Still, we can't let Mayor Tenma stay possessed, you know what I mean? Tenma: If you can clear me of these charges, I shall help in whatever manner I may. Now, ask of me what you will! Apollo: I suppose it's worth a shot. Talk Feathers and tracks Apollo: Were those feathers and tracks at the scene of the crime really your doing? Tenma: Indeed! The remnants of Tenma Taro, King of the Underworld, they be! The day when I once again dominate the mortal world is at hand, caw caw-caw-caw! Athena: The prosecution claims the feathers and tracks were planted by Jinxie. Tenma: What's this?! I must breach these walls and go defend my little Jinxie at once! Athena: Huh? Mayor Tenma, is that you? Tenma: ! ...Grr! Well, now! Damian appears to still reside within this body. But I should have expected as much from a descendent of mine! Be silent, now, Damian! Apollo: (I guess a little thing like demonic possession won't stop a father's love for his daughter.) You didn't kill Alderman Kyubi, did you? Tenma: I have killed no one! The remnants of my presence have been misconstrued. The murderer is not I! For if I had slain that mortal... ...raging hellfire would have consumed him, leaving naught but ash! Apollo: Yikes! ............S-So... S-So... you're saying, there must have been somebody else there? (Come to think of it, the mayor had mentioned that he'd been clubbed with this statue. I'd better ask about this, too.) What you remembered Apollo: Detective Fulbright mentioned that you might have something new to tell me. Tenma: Indeed, I have. I regurgitated this key but a short while ago. Behold, the key to the Forbidden Chamber! Apollo: Whoa! Is regurgitation one of your demonic powers, too?! Tenma: Bah! I do not waste my powers on such parlor tricks! Take the key from the killer did Damian, whereupon he swallowed it. He sought to bar the killer entry to the Forbidden Chamber. Apollo: (So, he wanted to keep it shut tight?) Tenma: But no fingerprints shall you find upon that key. Apollo: How do you know that? ...Wait. Is THAT another one of your demonic powers, then?! Tenma: Foolish mortal! You would have me, Tenma Taro, act as some asinine alchemist?! I but asked the jailer and my will was done -- quite eagerly, I must add, caw caw-caw-caw! Guard: Always an honor to serve, Your Malevolence! Apollo: (Guess I'm not the only one he scares the living daylights out of.) Athena: Um, can we ask how you use this key? We couldn't find a keyhole anywhere in or around the door. Tenma: Curse that infernal door! But if I had known its manner of opening, long, long ago would I have made my return! Athena: He has a point there. Apollo: Maybe Jinxie knows something about how the whole thing works... Forbidden Chamber Key added to the Court Record. What you remembered (after correctly presenting Fox and Demon Statue) Apollo: Detective Fulbright mentioned that you might have something new to tell me. Tenma: Indeed, I have. I regurgitated this key but a short while ago. Behold, the key to the Forbidden Chamber! Apollo: Whoa! Is regurgitation one of your demonic powers, too?! Tenma: Bah! I do not waste my powers on such parlor tricks! Take the key from the killer did Damian, whereupon he swallowed it. He sought to bar the killer entry to the Forbidden Chamber.

Athena: He has a point there. Apollo: Maybe Jinxie knows something about how the whole thing works... Forbidden Chamber Key added to the Court Record. Apollo: (I should question him about the blackmail letter, too. Let's see what he says when I show it to him.) What you remembered (subsequent times) Apollo: Detective Fulbright mentioned that you might have something new to tell me. Tenma: Indeed, I have. I regurgitated this key but a short while ago. Behold, the key to the Forbidden Chamber! Apollo: Whoa! Is regurgitation one of your demonic powers, too?! Tenma: Bah! I do not waste my powers on such parlor tricks!

We couldn't find a keyhole anywhere in or around the door. Tenma: Curse that infernal door! But if I had known its manner of opening, long, long ago would I have made my return! Athena: He has a point there. Apollo: Maybe Jinxie knows something about how the whole thing works... Blackmail letter (appears after correctly presenting Blackmail Letter) Apollo: Who placed this in the alderman's pocket? Tenma: Hrmmm. Very few were they who knew the letter was in Damian's briefcase. Apollo: So, whoever knew about the blackmail letter being in the mayor's briefcase... ...is a potential suspect in its theft and placement in the alderman's pocket. Tenma: Ah! Could it have been... HIS doing?! Apollo: Mr. Mayor, er... I mean, Mr. Taro! Did you just remember something?! Tenma: Indeed, I did. There was but one other who knew of that letter: Damian's aide Florent L'Belle. Full knowledge of that briefcase's contents did that aide possess. Apollo: Then he may be the blackmailer and the murderer we're looking for! Tenma: That is preposterous! He's a most trusted advisor. He would never betray Damian! Athena: It seems like Mayor Tenma is a bit too trusting of those around him. Apollo: (Still, this is HUGE! Now we know who might've slipped that blackmail letter in the alderman's pocket! Look out, Florent L'Belle, here comes Justice!) Athena: Let's go find Mr. L'Belle and rake him over the coals! Apollo: Thanks for the help. You've just given us a major lead! Blackmail Letter updated in the Court Record. Athena: Hmm... There's something that still bothers me. If Mr. L'Belle is the killer... ...what could have motivated him to open the Forbidden Chamber? Apollo: We should probably search it for clues. Athena: Only one problem. How do you open a locked door that doesn't have a keyhole? Apollo: Let's go talk to Jinxie. Maybe she can help. Blackmail letter (subsequent times) Apollo: Who placed this in the alderman's pocket?

Present Fox and Demon Statue (after clearing \"Feathers and tracks\" Talk option; before clearing \"What you remembered\" Talk option) Tenma: What, might I ask, is that? Apollo: This statue was found at the scene. Someone hit Mayor Tenma over the head with it. It had been wrapped in a large cloth before the alderman's murder. Tenma: Let me see whether Damian knows about such a thing... Hrmmm, yes... Something wrapped in just such a cloth does he recall. A secret gift from Alderman Kyubi it would seem. He, however, had not a chance to see it till now, for the cloth did conceal it. Apollo: Maybe the cloth fell off or was removed after the mayor was struck. Tenma: Hrmmm, of that Damian does not know. Apollo: (A secret gift? Interesting... Maybe Jinxie knows something about it...?) Fox and Demon Statue (after clearing \"Feathers and tracks\" and \"What you remembered\" Talk options) Tenma: What, might I ask, is that? Apollo: This statue was found at the scene.

Maybe Jinxie knows something about it...? I should question him about the blackmail letter, too. Let's see what he says when I show it to him.) Yokai Legend Scroll Tenma: Ages has it been since I've seen that. We often battled it out like this back in the day. Athena: I've been meaning to ask, which one of you was stronger? Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! That would be me, of course! For I am the demon lord of the yokai! Caw-shaaaaaaaaw! Athena: Yeah, but the Nine-Tailed Fox imprisoned you in-- Apollo: Athena! Don't encourage him! It's already hard enough as it is. Athena: Aw, I just wanted to find out which one was really the strongest. Special Edition Paper Tenma: Why, that is a photo of me soaring through the heavens. Hrmm, but look at my wing angle. It's all wrong. Athena: Wow, you're really a stickler for details. Tenma: I even gave a big smile for the camera... ...but so small am I in this shot that one can't even see it! Apollo: Never knew demons were so interested in how they're presented by the media. Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy Tenma: Hrmmm... A descendent of old Nine-Tails, perhaps? It would seem he's doing quite well these days. Apollo: Yeah, he's a huge hit from kids all the way up to their grandparents. Tenma: Hrmmm... It seems I've been resting on my laurels for far too long. It is time I, too, debut in the mortal world and rekindle my struggle against that wily fox. Athena: That's the spirit! You can make your debut as soon as we get you that not-guilty verdict! Tenma: Then I had best return to top form! Pushups and sit-ups should do for now. Caw caw-caw! Apollo: (Is he planning a new career as a pro wrestler?!) Blackmail Letter (after clearing \"What you remembered\" Talk option and correctly presenting Fox and Demon Statue) Tenma: Why this--! This is that accursed blackmail letter that was sent to Damian. Apollo: Apparently, somebody slipped it into the alderman's pocket. We believe someone, probably the killer, stole it from Mayor Tenma's briefcase. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you? Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! You have questions, do you? Very well, ask away, mortal! Anything else Apollo: Umm... I was hoping you'd take a look at this. Tenma: Hrmmm... An offering to me. Quite admirable. But the best thing you could offer me is to win me my freedom! Caw caw-caw-caw! Apollo: R-Right, right... I'll do my best! After clearing \"Blackmail letter\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: April 18Nine-Tails Vale - Yokai Lane Apollo: Hey, isn't that...? Jinxie: Grrr. You dare imprison me? Athena: Jinxie! She's... acting really strange. Jinxie: That loathsome, no-good Nine-Tailed Fox. He shall know the terror that is mine and despair. Grrr... Grrr. You shall pay. Oh, you shall pay dearly! ......All of you! Apollo: J-Jinxie, are you all right? Jinxie: ! Eeeeeek! Apollo: Aaaah! Jinxie: Oh! Is that you, Mr. Demon Lawyer? Apollo: ...Morning, Jinxie. Jinxie: Morning? Isn't it already past noon? And what am I doing here? Last I remember, I lay down to take a nap back at the manor. ......Oh, no! It must've been the Makuragaeshi! Apollo: Makura... gaeshi? Jinxie: Ever wake after a restless night's sleep to find your pillow in an unusual place... ...or that you've been sleeping on the floor or in the hallway? Well, it's that yokai's fault! The Makuragaeshi preys on people when they're asleep! Apollo: ...It sounds like you just need to be tucked in really tight, or maybe a snug sleeping bag. Athena: Jinxie, how come you don't have any charms on your forehead? Jinxie: I don't? Oh, they must've fallen off. Without them, evil things can creep into me. Apollo: (I'd say we had a more than adequate demonstration of that just now...) Jinxie: I'd better reapply them. Apollo: Jinxie, there's something we wanted to ask you. Jinxie: Ah! There was something I wanted to tell you, too! I... I remembered something else! Apollo: You did? What was it? Talk What you remember Apollo: Jinxie, can you tell us what you remembered? Jinxie: Well, after the trial I remembered lots of stuff. But there was one thing I thought was really weird. Apollo: (I'm almost afraid to ask, but here goes...) Really? What? Jinxie: Um... It's about the yokai feathers and tracks. They weren't there when I first opened the door! Apollo: Wait, whaaat?! Are you sure? Jinxie: Uh-huh. My memory's crystal clear now. Apollo: So, you're saying they were left at the crime scene after you found it? Athena: This could spell major trouble, Apollo. Apollo: Why? Athena: Because Jinxie is already accused of leaving the feathers and tracks at the scene. If they weren't there when she discovered the crime scene... ...it will totally fuel the claim that she fabricated the evidence later on. Apollo: Ack! Athena: Jinxie's fuzzy memory of the whole incident is really working against us. The prosecution will probably say she doesn't remember planting the evidence. Good luck rebutting that! Apollo: Oh, man, this is not good. (I sure hope she didn't plant the evidence while she was sleepwalking or something...) The Forbidden Chamber Apollo: Jinxie, you wouldn't happen to know how to open the Forbidden Chamber, would you? That door doesn't even have a keyhole. Jinxie: Well, it's supposed to have a secret mechanism. They say you have to figure it out before the keyhole will appear. Apollo: A secret mechanism?! Really? Jinxie: Uh-huh. It's hidden in the Fox Chamber. But only Alderman Kyubi knew what it was, and how it worked. Apollo: The alderman of Nine-Tails Vale sure loved his secrets. (Changed from [The alderman of Nine-Tails Vail [sic] sure loved his secrets.] in the original release) Athena: Apollo, let's go see if we can find that secret mechanism! Apollo: Whoa, slow down! There's something else I need to ask about. Jinxie, is there only one key to the Forbidden Chamber? Jinxie: Uh-huh. Even the manor's master key won't open it. That's because it's a very special room... that must never be opened. Apollo: Guess that means nobody entered the Forbidden Chamber after the murder. After all, we know Mayor Tenma took the key from the killer and swallowed it, so... Athena: So the mayor's efforts to keep the killer out of the Forbidden Chamber... ...were not in vain! Forbidden Chamber Key updated in the Court Record. The Forbidden Chamber (subsequent times) Apollo: Jinxie, you wouldn't happen to know how to open the Forbidden Chamber, would you?

Present Fox and Demon Statue Jinxie: Alderman Kyubi made that statue. It's a token of goodwill... ...I think it was meant to be for Nine-Tails Vale and Tenma Town. Apollo: A token of goodwill? But the two yokai are fighting. Jinxie: Fighting? Oh, I see what you mean! The cup portion is missing. This statue... ...originally depicted the two yokai holding up a cup in celebration. But it sure doesn't look that way now, does it? Apollo: Maybe it broke when it was used to hit Mayor Tenma on the head. Jinxie: That would explain it. I guess the only two people who knew what it really looked like were the alderman and I. Now it's just me, but its symbol of goodwill will be forever etched in my mind!

After clearing all Talk options and presenting Fox and Demon Statue: Apollo: So... is there anything else we should know about, Jinxie? Jinxie: ...No... That's about it... BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: Ack! (My bracelet! It's reacting!) Jinxie, you wouldn't happen to be-- Fulbright: In justice we trust! Apollo: Yikes! Jinxie: Eek! A ghost! Fulbright: Argh! Apollo: Detective Fulbright! What are you doing here? Fulbright: I have business with this young lady, if you must know. Prosecutor Blackquill has asked me to question her. Jinxie: Question me? ...Sorry, not interested. Apollo: Are you here to ask about that whole yokai affair? Fulbright: That's right. Specifically, we want to ask-- Ah, but I can't tell you that, now can I? Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Athena: Oh, come on, please? We're partners in justice, right? Fulbright: No no, Prosecutor Blackquill specifically told me, my questions were of the utmost justice. I will not fall for your lies! In justice we trust! Apollo: The Twisted Samurai sure has him on a short leash. Jinxie: So you're not a ghost? Maybe some sort of urban troll, then? Fulbright: Now, come along, Ms. Tenma. To the station with you! Athena: He took her away. Apollo: (Missed my chance to see what she was lying about.) Athena: Well, at least we found out there's a secret mechanism for opening the chamber! Let's go check it out! Apollo: I just hope they let us in now. April 18Kyubi Manor - Garden L'Belle: Oh, what an absolutely FABULOUS scent! I'm SO glad I had these carnations imported from England. Nothing but the FINEST will do. Perhaps I should place one aside for our DEARLY departed alderman. Athena: Hey, it's Mr. L'Belle! Apollo, let's ask him about you-know-what! Apollo: (Oh yeah, before we search the Fox Chamber we should ask about the blackmail letter.) L'Belle: Why, if it isn't the mayor's little lawyers. What do YOU want with ME? Apollo: Oh, um, there's something we wanted to ask... (Where's that ringing coming from?) L'Belle: You'll HAVE to excuse me. ...Hello? L'Belle here. Apollo: What the--?! (Those things on his shoulders are cell phones?!) L'Belle: ...Yes, about that. You MUST forgive me! This WHOLE matter with Mayor Tenma has been a COMPLETE nightmare. Athena: ......Where do you buy clothes like that? L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Surprised? This is my OWN special design. It's the ULTIMATE in functional beauty. Apollo: Functional beauty? Are you sure about that? Looks a bit unwieldy to me. Ack! L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! You simply don't have an eye for beauty. Apollo: (...If having an eye for beauty means looking like this guy, I'd rather be blind.) L'Belle: So, what DO you want with ME? Talk Did you see Tenma Taro? Apollo: Both Jinxie and Mr. Filch said they saw Tenma Taro. But what about you, Mr. L'Belle? If you were there in the foyer, why didn't you see-- Ack! L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Very well, I ADMIT it. That's right! I, Florent L'Belle, SAW the demon Tenma Taro! Apollo: Hmm... (So he did see something.) Then why did you lie about not seeing him? L'Belle: I was SIMPLY trying to protect dear little Jinxie. Apollo: Protect Jinxie? What do you mean? L'Belle: Why, don't TELL me you haven't heard of that strange little HABIT of hers? Apollo: Which one are we talking about...? L'Belle: The ONE where she wanders around making mischief without knowing WHAT she's doing! Rumor has it she's possessed by Tenma Taro. Apollo: That one's new to me. L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Well, THERE you have it! Anytime you HEAR about a Tenma Taro sighting... ...little Jinxie should be your PRIME suspect. Athena: Tell us more about that rumor! Rumor about Jinxie (appears after \"Did you see Tenma Taro?\") Apollo: So, what was that rumor about Jinxie? L'Belle: They say she's possessed. Not ALL the time, of course. It hits suddenly, then she starts WANDERING around doing strange THINGS. Apollo: I-Is that so...? (Although, come to think of it...) Jinxie: That loathsome, no-good Nine-Tailed Fox. He shall know the terror that is mine and despair. Apollo: (That certainly would explain how she was acting earlier.) L'Belle: Once, she EVEN put on a Tenma Taro costume and wandered around the woods at night. Apollo: She did? Anime cutscene Jinxie: Beware you who sealed me away! Apollo: (Ugh. I wish I'd never asked.) Athena: Does she remember anything while she's possessed? L'Belle: Unfortunately, no. She doesn't seem to remember a THING during these EPISODES. Athena: Memory loss during possession... Hmm... L'Belle: Come to think of it, her MEMORY of the MURDER scene was QUITE fuzzy. I suppose THAT, too, was caused by her possession. Apollo: .........Ah! Then maybe-- L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! So you DO understand! That whole yokai business was ENTIRELY of her own making! Apollo: Now wait a minute! (Although... that yokai evidence wasn't there until after she discovered the crime scene... Did she leave those black feathers and strange tracks there herself?) Athena: Apollo, let's ask Mayor Tenma about Jinxie's episodes the next time we talk with him! Present Jinxie's Statement Apollo: Jinxie thinks she saw Tenma Taro near the scene of the crime. L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! That little dear is ALWAYS talking such nonsense. After all, she's ALWAYS calling you a red demon, is she not? Apollo: Gngh! L'Belle: Plus, she has the nerve to call ME of all people a yokai! She even has a name for me: Baron Powder Face! Pffft! I've NEVER been so insulted! Apollo: (How could anyone look at him and NOT think monster?) L'Belle: Now, if she had named me the BEAUTIFUL Baron Powder Face, I could've forgiven her. Apollo: Wait, THAT's your sticking point?! Blackmail Letter L'Belle: WHAT is THAT? Apollo: It's the blackmail letter, but it wasn't sent to Alderman Kyubi. It was sent to Mayor Tenma. L'Belle: AND? ......Your point BEING? Apollo: Someone took the letter from the mayor's briefcase... ...and then placed it in the alderman's pocket after he was murdered. L'Belle: Oh, you don't say... Apollo: You wouldn't happen to be the one who made the switch, would you? After all, you're the only one who knew that the blackmail letter was in his briefcase... ...so, naturally, you-- Ack! L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! PERHAPS that shot of cologne will MAKE those scales FALL from your eyes! Apollo: Or my eyes fall from their sockets. L'Belle: Is it possible that you would like to FRAME me as a potential SUSPECT? What would MAKE you raise such an OUTRAGEOUS allegation in the first place? Apollo: Oh, uh, well... L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! My ONLY crime is being born as BEAUTIFUL as you see here! In other words, YOU have NOTHING! Now, let me show you what to DO with this garbage! Apollo: Ahhh! You can't destroy evidence like that! L'Belle: What do you mean I CAN'T? I just DID, ah ha ha ha! Feel a little lighter now? Apollo: (You've just won a one-way trip to the top of my \"most annoying people ever\" list, buddy.) After clearing \"Rumor about Jinxie\" Talk option and presenting Blackmail Letter: L'Belle: Are we done with your SILLY questions now? I'm a VERY busy man, you know. Apollo: *sigh* (I guess that's it for now.) L'Belle: Hello, L'Belle speaking! ...Really? You wish to carry MY new product at YOUR store? Oh, but I'm afraid it's my own PRIVATE brand. It's NOT available to the public. ...What? Then I shouldn't advertise it on TV? But I DON'T understand. As THE embodiment of beauty, it is my duty to announce my good looks to the world! Apollo: ......... (Stop the bus. I'm getting off.) L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! EVERYONE wants my EXCLUSIVE \"Je suis L'Belle!\" brand products! It's the crown jewel of MY collection, born of my LONG, RELENTLESS pursuit of beauty! But now that it's become SO popular, it's been an ABSOLUTE nightmare! Apollo: You don't say. L'Belle: Well, they CAN'T have it! It's just for ME! It's not meant for you PEASANTS. Apollo: Peasants? L'Belle: This is my LATEST product! I'm calling it \"Couleur Me L'Belle!\" A DAZZLING hair color that you can wash out with just water! Apollo: (Guess that means you can't sweat.) L'Belle: I have SEVEN colors in all. You can find out more in my commercials and magazine ads. Apollo: (...Yet, it's not available to the public? Great sales strategy there, genius.) Athena: Come to think of it, Mr. L'Belle... ...your hair color's changed since the last time we met. L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! The little lady has QUITE the discerning eye! Here's a little sample. Consider it a gift for one who TRULY appreciates beauty. Athena: Oh, uh... Apollo, what should I do? Apollo: Better take it before you get a face full of cologne. Athena: Good point. ...Wow, thanks, Mr. L'Belle. Couleur Me L'Belle! added to the Court Record. Athena: Okay, let's head over to the Fox Chamber. Apollo: We've still gotta find the secret mechanism for opening the Forbidden Chamber. Present Couleur Me L'Belle! L'Belle: Dazzling hair color that you can wash out with water. Isn't it magnificent? Athena: What if you start to sweat? Won't that wash the color out, too? L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! I assure you, Florent L'Belle, embodiment of beauty, does NOT sweat! Apollo: Then what about rain? Even if you don't sweat, you never know when it might-- Ack! L'Belle: Pffft! Peasants like YOU fail to GRASP the truth. Rain and other forces of nature draw back in awe of my beauty! Apollo: (Sure they're not being repelled back by your narcissism?) Before clearing all Talk options and presenting Blackmail Letter in Kyubi Manor - Garden: April 18Kyubi Manor - Fox Chamber Policeman: Hey, we're trying to conduct an investigation here! Come back later once we're done. Apollo: *sigh* (Oh, well. Guess we'll have to find a way to kill some time.) Athena: Let's go talk to Mr. L'Belle while we wait. Apollo: Okay, there was something I wanted to ask him, anyway. Policeman: If you're looking for Mayor Tenma's aide, I saw him in the garden earlier. We won't be here much longer. Go keep that narcissist company in the meantime. Apollo: *sigh* After clearing all Talk options and presenting Blackmail Letter in Kyubi Manor - Garden: April 18Kyubi Manor - Fox Chamber Apollo: Okay, let's find that secret mechanism for opening the Forbidden Chamber. Athena: Ooh, this is so exciting! I can't wait to see how it works! But do you really think the killer entered the Forbidden Chamber? Apollo: We'll just have to open it to find out. Athena: We should also see if there was anywhere the killer could've hid in this room! Okay, let's get started. ¡Apúrate, Apollo, Apúrate! Examine Forbidden Chamber door Apollo: Still no keyhole, huh. Athena: Yeah, and the door won't budge, just like those spiky bangs of yours. Apollo: Well, all it takes is some water, but I don't think that would work on the door. Athena: Oh, I know! I'll break it down with a body slam! Apollo: Ha ha ha. I seriously doubt you could do that. Athena: Tsk, how do you know if I haven't even tried?! Apollo: No, wait, don't! Athena: Aaaagh... Apollo: (As much as you hate losing, Athena, I think the door would win this match...) Table Athena: Maybe the killer hid under this table! Apollo: That would be a terrible hiding place. The alderman's body would've been right above. Athena: Hmm, maybe you're right. Guess the underside is a bit... Wait, there's something under the table. Apollo: Let's check it out. Lustrous cup Apollo: Hey, look! There's something down here! Athena: It looks like a piece of something. Only question is, a piece of what? Apollo: Hmm... Oh, I know! It might be a piece of this statue. Remember what Jinxie said? The statue originally depicted two yokai holding up a cup. It was a symbol of goodwill. Athena: So, this piece broke off and rolled under the table? Fox and Demon Statue updated in the Court Record. Lustrous cup (subsequent times) Apollo: What have we here... It's the piece that broke off of this statue. Athena: You think it broke off when the mayor was clobbered on the head? Apollo: I'd say that's the most likely explanation. Fox statues Apollo: There's a carving of the Nine-Tailed Fox over the door and statues of him on either side. The way those two statues are glaring, it's like they're guarding the door from us. Come to think of it, there are two foxes on the folding screen as well. It can't be a coincidence, can it...? Athena: Hey, this statue moves! Apollo: Don't get carried away, now. I mean, who knows? It might trigger a trap. Athena: Heh heh. I can handle it. If a spear comes shooting my way, I'll snatch it out of the air! After all, I have the reflexes of a regular karate kid! Apollo: (I guess if you can catch something that fast out of mid-air, you can accomplish anything. Still... There might be something to the fact that these fox statues rotate. Maybe there's something around here that shows the position they should be in.) Feathers and tracks Athena: Look at all these feathers... Apollo: ...And bloody tracks, too. Athena: Then we have Jinxie and Mr. Filch's eyewitness reports... Apollo: ...And a newspaper photo. Athena: Our yokai's definitely not the shy type, that's for sure! Apollo: (This is bad! Mayor Tenma is scary enough without people thinking he's a yokai!) Overturned chair Apollo: I don't think we'll find anything else on this chair. Right Fox Chamber door Athena: I just remembered this mystery novel I once read. The murder occurred in a locked room... ...and the perpetrator made sure to hide behind the room's door when it was opened. Then, when no one was looking, he made his escape. Apollo: A clever trick, but it would've been impossible in this case. See this broken tanuki statue here? The door must've banged into it when it was opened. Athena: Oh, I get it. The killer couldn't have been there because of the statue. Left Fox Chamber door Apollo: Better take a look behind this door, too... Oh, look. The doorknob banged into the wall. Made a big dent, too. That wouldn't have happened if the killer had been hiding there. Athena: Right... I guess that rules out the old hide-behind-the-door trick. Air vent Athena: There really is no escaping here through the air duct. Apollo: And here we went through all the trouble of bringing a ladder to check it out. Athena: That's not a ladder, Apollo. It's a stepladder. Apollo: What's the difference? They both have the word ladder in them. Athena: What's the difference...? ............ Oh, I know! Let's play rock, paper, scissors to decide who's right! Apollo: You're way too competitive. And it's not even related to the original issue, either! Window Apollo: There's a cliff outside this window. Makes it pretty impossible to get out this way. Athena: When I hear things like that, it just makes me want to try! Never say never, right? I bet I could get out this way. Hrrrgh! Apollo: No, wait! Do you have a death wish or something?! Athena: Tsk, it won't even open wide enough for me to squeeze through! Guess I lost that bet. Apollo: That loss just saved your life. Statue next to armchair Athena: This statue originally depicted the two yokai holding up a cup in a gesture of goodwill. Apollo: Maybe Alderman Kyubi was planning on smoothing things over with Mayor Tenma. Athena: But he was murdered instead... ...by somebody who intervened. Apollo: The mayor was only pursuing the municipal merger because he'd been blackmailed. Who knows? If this murder hadn't occurred, maybe they could've come up with a solution. Front of folding screen Apollo: Two foxes standing back to back are depicted on this elegant folding screen. Could this have something to do with the keyhole? Hmm... Wait a minute... Two foxes... There are two fox statues in front of the Forbidden Chamber as well. Athena: Maybe the keyhole will appear if we do something to this folding screen. Hmm... But I don't see anything unusual about it. Apollo: Well, it does have two foxes on it, and there are two fox statues in front of the door. Athena: Then maybe there's a clue somewhere in this room. Let's turn the whole place upside down! Apollo: (She's as excited as a kid in a candy store.) After examining front of folding screen, lustrous cup, Forbidden Chamber door, and fox statues: Athena: Well, I can't think of anywhere else to look. You find anything, Apollo? We'll never find the keyhole to the Forbidden Chamber at this rate. Apollo: There's something about that folding screen. You know how those fox statues in front of the Forbidden Chamber move? That screen might be a clue as to how we're supposed to position them or something. Athena: Hey, I bet you're right! Let's go over that screen with a fine-toothed comb! Examine Front of folding screen Leads to: \"On closer inspection...\" Apollo: On closer inspection... ...I think there's more to this screen than meets the eye. Athena: Let's check every last inch of it! Apollo: I can rotate the folding screen with [right analog stick / arrow keys]. (Changed from [Tap and slide on the bottom screen to rotate the folding screen.] in the original release) And if I spot anything of interest, I can press [A / Space] on it to inspect it further. (Changed from [I can also tap on something of interest to inspect it further.] in the original release) Athena: You can also zoom in and out with [X / B] and [B / M] to get a better look. (Changed from [You can also zoom in and out to get a better look.] in the original release) Now, let's check every last inch of it! Examine front side Apollo: Hey, doesn't it look like the picture here has been cut off on both ends? Athena: Hmm, now that you mention it... Apollo: It looks like there are supposed to be doors on both ends, but they're cut in half. Athena: Maybe those doors symbolize the Forbidden Chamber's door. Apollo: Yeah... It definitely feels like something significant, but the question is, what? Examine keyhole pictures on back (before examining key pictures on back) Apollo: What's this? Looks like a keyhole or something. Athena: You think it could be the keyhole to the Forbidden Chamber? Apollo: No, it's just a picture. Athena: Still, you know what they say: a picture's worth a thousand words. Examine keyhole pictures on back (after examining key pictures on back) Apollo: What's this? Looks like a keyhole or something. Athena: You think it could be the keyhole to the Forbidden Chamber? Apollo: Wait, what about that key drawn on the end of the screen? You think the two are related? Leads to: \"A key and a keyhole? Ooh, I just got an idea!\" Examine key pictures on back (before examining keyhole pictures on back) Apollo: It's a picture of a key. Hmm, that shape looks awfully familiar. Oh, I know! It's shaped like the Forbidden Chamber's key. Athena: Hmm... We're definitely getting warmer... Apollo: Okay, let's take an ever closer look. Examine key pictures on back (after examining keyhole pictures on back) Apollo: It's a picture of a key. Hmm, that shape looks awfully familiar. Oh, I know! It's shaped like the Forbidden Chamber's key. Hmm... Wait! What about that keyhole drawn on the center of the screen? You think the two are related? Leads to: \"A key and a keyhole? Ooh, I just got an idea!\" Athena: A key and a keyhole? Ooh, I just got an idea! If we folded the screen up just right, the key and keyhole should overlap! Apollo: Hey, I think you're right! Athena: Let's give it a try! Apollo: Look, a door! Athena: Yeah, and it's open, too! Apollo: The two foxes are now facing each other, so... Hey, what if we made those fox statues face each other?! Athena: Apollo! Let's go check out the two statues! Apollo: Okay! Help me move the two statues so they face each other -- just like on the screen. Look! A lock appeared! Athena: Now we can use that key! Apollo: Okay, here goes nothing! Apollo: ...It worked! Athena: Time to see why this chamber's so forbidden! Apollo: What secrets could it hold, I wonder...? April 18Kyubi Manor - Forbidden Chamber *creeeeeeeeeak* *thud* Apollo: These doors need some serious oil. Athena: Aaah! That was like nails on a chalkboard! Apollo: Oh, right. Forgot about those super good ears of yours. Look, more feathers... Athena: Eeeeeeeeeeeek! Apollo: What the heck is that...? ...Is that a Tenma Taro... statue? But there's... something odd about it. Athena: Ugh... All I know is I don't like it, but I can't explain why. Apollo: You okay, Athena? You look kinda pale. You're not scared, are you? Athena: What, of this thing? Don't make me laugh, heh heh. Apollo: Really? ......Hey, look! Athena: Wh-What?! What is it?! Apollo: Over there on the left. There's a bunch of staves on that rack. (Changed from [Over there on the left. There's a bunch of staffs on that rack.] in the original release) They kinda look like the staff we saw earlier... Athena: You mean the one Jinxie said she saw Tenma Taro carrying? Apollo: Yeah. I bet our Tenma Taro impersonator really did come in here at some point. Athena: Well? What are we waiting for? Let's search the place! Examine Tenma Taro statue Apollo: Whoa, that's one big statue. Must be something like fifteen feet tall. And look! THIS Tenma Taro has a staff! But the Tenma Taro in the scroll didn't have one. Athena: Hmm... I wonder why. Apollo: I feel like this could be significant, but why...? Let's take a closer look. First, to go around this table here... Athena: Ah! Apollo, are you sure that's a good idea? Apollo: Hey, it looks like there's some sort of compartment in the base of the statue. Athena: Don't open it! Who knows what might be in there! Apollo: It's just a big empty compartment. And from all the dust and cobwebs... ...I'd say it hasn't been opened in a really long time. Athena: That's enough, Apollo. Let's shut it and-- Apollo: Wait, there IS something in here! Looks like some sort of figure. But it's so dusty, I can't tell what it's supposed to be. Wonder what it's doing here. Forbidden Chamber Figure added to the Court Record. Tenma Taro statue (subsequent times) Athena: This statue's probably twice as tall as Prosecutor Blackquill. Apollo: (Yeah, and he towers over me as it is.) Athena: It's like if you took something really scary, like a spider, and made it fifteen feet tall. Apollo: A fifteen-foot tall spider?! Athena: What? I was just exaggerating for dramatic effect. Apollo: Well, Prosecutor Blackquill may be scary, but a fifteen-foot spider is utterly terrifying! Scroll Apollo: Looks like an old scroll... and there's something drawn on it! Unless I'm mistaken, it looks like an old guy... Some sort of monk, maybe? Athena: A monk? What are you talking about? Apollo: You know, people that take walks in the mountains as a form of spiritual training... Athena: Wouldn't that just be a hiker? Apollo: The guy in this picture doesn't look like he's doing it for fun, Athena. Athena: Hmm... Oh look, there's some yellow... thing strapped to his back. Apollo: Whoa! It's turning into Tenma Taro! Athena: What's this scroll getting at? Is this how Tenma Taro was born? Apollo: Well, whatever it is, it's definitely creepy. Scroll (subsequent times) Apollo: The yellow thing the one guy had transformed into Tenma Taro! Athena: Hmm... Or maybe the picture's showing Tenma Taro getting caught in a yokai trap. I bet that yellow thing is a trap to catch the demon before he ravages the entire mountain! Apollo: I highly doubt yokai are things you can catch like a bear or wild boar. Athena: Then maybe that yellow thing is some leftovers that didn't get put in the fridge. They got all gross and moldy and out popped Tenma Taro! Apollo: You have a really active imagination. First off, they probably didn't have fridges back then... ...and second, we'd be swimming in yokai if they spawned that easily. Athena: Okay, Mr. Smarty-Pants, what is it, then? Apollo: Oh, umm... That yellow thing could've been a bomb containing Tenma Taro. And the old guys were terrorists who used yokai to further their cause. Athena: ...Apollo, if I have an active imagination, yours is hyperactive. Feathers Apollo: Black feathers... They looks exactly like the ones in the Fox Chamber. Athena: That means the killer must've been in here at some point. The question is, why? Apollo: Maybe... Maybe the Tenma Taro costume was hidden in here. I mean... ...if someone carried it through the manor, it would've stuck out like a sore thumb. Athena: But when did the killer get in here? The mayor snatched the Forbidden Chamber key when the killer hit him on the head. That means the killer could've only gotten in here before the murder. Apollo: Wow, this is one tough riddle, all right. Lanterns Apollo: A stone lantern... Athena: Like those Japanese garden lamps? Where's the switch? Apollo: Lamps like these are lit by fire not electricity, so there is no switch. Athena: Oh, here it is! Apollo: Whaaat?! Athena: It was hidden out of sight. Apollo: ...I see Tenma Taro's cell has been outfitted with all the amenities a yokai could want. Air vent Apollo: Oh, look. There's an air vent here, too. Athena: I guess even forbidden chambers need proper ventilation. Apollo: Hmm... But I don't think anyone could reach this one, either. Athena: Yeah, and there's nothing to stand on around here. I wonder where this vent leads. Apollo: Well, the Fox Chamber's vent didn't branch this way, so... Athena: Maybe it doesn't have anything to do with this case, after all. Staves Apollo: Hey, there's a bunch of staves here. And it looks like one's missing. The Tenma Taro Jinxie saw must've taken it. Athena: I'd have to agree. These look like the one Detective Fulbright showed us. Apollo: Why do you think there are so many here? Athena: Maybe they're spares. Tenma Taro might be, you know, absent-minded or something. But the fact that he has spare staves handy, well... ...it shows that he's aware of his faults, and is trying to deal with them. Or at least that's my take on it. Apollo: (Maybe this will remind her to deal with her own faults. But I won't hold my breath.) Staves (subsequent times) Athena: These look like the staff Detective Fulbright showed us. Apollo: That must mean that the Tenma Taro Jinxie saw... ...took this staff from here. I wonder what all these staves are doing here in the first place. Gravestone Apollo: Looks like a gravestone or something. Athena: It reads, \"Here lies Tenma Taro, Age 80. Cause of death: Choked on a chicken bone.\" Apollo: *gasp!* Say it ain't so! ...Besides, that sounds more like an autopsy report than an epitaph, if you ask me. Wait, you're joking around because you're scared! It's your coping mechanism! Athena: I'm n-not scared! Widget: Freak-out central! Right here, baby! Athena: Cut it out, Widget! Apollo: (Denial is strong in this one.) Cream bottle on floor Apollo: What's this? Whatever it is, the packaging is really gaudy. And the fact that there's no dust on it means it hasn't been here very long. Athena: Oh! It's hand cream. Let's see what brand it is......... \"Je suis L'Belle!\"?! Apollo: L'Belle?! (What the--?!) But then, wouldn't that mean Mr. L'Belle was here? Athena: I guess so... but why? Apollo: Well, whoever was dressed up like Tenma Taro... ...must have taken a staff from here in the Forbidden Chamber. And that same person probably dropped this hand cream at that time. Athena: In other words, the Tenma Taro impersonator we're looking for is none other than... Apollo: ...Florent L'Belle! This might be a big break for us in court tomorrow. Athena: Now all we have to do is get the truth out of Mayor Tenma! Hand Cream added to the Court Record. Cream bottle on floor (subsequent times) Apollo: Mr. L'Belle's private brand of hand cream. He must've been here in the Forbidden Chamber at some point. Athena: This could be the big break we need. After examining Tenma Taro statue, scroll, feathers, air vent, staves, and cream bottle on floor: Athena: Guess that about wraps it up. What now? Apollo: We should probably talk to some of the witnesses again. Athena: You mean like Mr. Filch... and Jinxie? Apollo: Yeah. I really want to ask Mr. Filch about the village superstitions and Tenma Taro. Talk Any ideas? Apollo: Any good ideas yet, Athena? Athena: Good ideas? You bet I do! Umm... Well, there's that thing. Apollo: Thing? What thing? ............ Athena: ............ Ugh, you saw right through me, didn't you?! Apollo: Huh? You mean you really have nothing for me? Athena: No, sorry! I just got a little carried away! Apollo: (Oh, boy. Bluffing is obviously not her strength.) The real culprit Apollo: Seems we finally have the real killer in our sights. The only person to threaten Mayor Tenma, push for the municipal merger... Athena: ...And to be identified at the manor disguised as Tenma Taro... ...is none other than Mayor Tenma's aide, Florent L'Belle! We're in for a fight tomorrow! Let's banish Tenma Taro, both literally and figuratively! Apollo: Yeah! We'll be fine between the two of us! We'll send that yokai packing, along with that twisted samurai of a prosecutor! Widget: Let's do this! Wright Anything Agency Talk Any ideas? Trucy: I was shocked to hear a demon appeared at your trial. Apollo: You were shocked? I was the one questioning him! Trucy: Wish you would've called me in. Apollo: Really? You would've come to my rescue? Trucy: With a demon like that, your tightrope-style of defense... and my magic tricks, we would've had it all. We could've been The Three Great Illusions! The audience would've been in the palm of our hand! Apollo: I'd settle for convincing the judge with some solid evidence. What to do Trucy: It's everyone's favorite, Trucy's Two Cents! Go ahead, ask me anything! Apollo: My client has turned into a demon. I don't know what he's thinking, and I have no idea what to do. Trucy: Hmm, I think this calls for... placing yourself in the other person's shoes. In other words, think of what it's like to be a demon. That should be easy for you, Polly! Apollo: Right... Okay, here goes......... Jinxie: Eeeeeek! A red demon! Apollo: Aaaaaaugh! Jinxie: Return to the black pit from whence you were spawned! Apollo: It ain't easy being a demon, that's for sure. Trucy: Hm? Fox Chamber Examine Fox statues Apollo: So, the fox statues are part of the keyhole mechanism. Athena: Let's try moving them around. Maybe something will happen! Apollo: But what if it's a trap. Who knows? The ceiling might come crashing down. Athena: Oh, will you relax? If it comes to that, I'll just dash out of the way! Apollo: Yeah, but what about me?! Folding screen Apollo: I would've never guessed the screen was the clue to the keyhole mechanism. That alderman sure was an interesting guy. Athena: I'll say! Makes me want to implement a secret locking mechanism into the office door! Apollo: What, are you planning to turn it into a Forbidden Chamber II or something? Athena: If I were, I'd need a demon to imprison... Apollo: Ha ha, very funny. But no, I'm not going to imprison myself. April 18Kyubi Manor - Foyer Filch: It's the curse, the curse! The curse of Tenma Taro! Athena: Eek! Filch: You outsiders are ignoring them superstitions at OUR peril! Mind yer own business, will ya?! Apollo: Aagh! Youch! What's all this about a curse? Filch: Tenma Taro's gonna curse us all 'less ya stop sticking yer nose where it don't belong! Stop the investigation! Listen to what them superstitions say! Athena: Right... Umm... How about obeying the law... before you go obeying the superstitions? Filch: Huh? Athena: Hey, what are you doing with Widget around your neck? He's mine! You know better than to go around stealing people's stuff like that! Apollo: The same goes for my bracelet! Filch: S-S-Sorry, sorry! I promise I won't do it again! Athena: Tsk, he almost kidnapped my sweet, little Widget. Widget: The big jerk! Filch: I'm sorrrryyyy! Apollo: *sigh* I guess you can't teach an old raccoon dog new tricks. (As long as we have him here, I guess we should ask him about what happened.) Talk Stealing Athena: I can't believe you did that! It's one thing to steal a pair of shoes, but to steal Widget! Widget: Grrr! Filch: Yiiipes! Mercy, mercy! I can't seem to control myself! It's that thieving blood running in my veins! Apollo: Thieving blood? What's that supposed to mean? Filch: Eh heh heh. Glad ya asked. The infamous bandit Azuki Kozo was my grandpappy! Take a gander at this! Apollo: What exactly am I looking at? Looks like another one of those yokai to me. Filch: It's none other than THE Azuki Kozo! Robbed from the rich to give to the poor, he did! And he'd leave one o' these figures at the scene of the crime! What's more, I'm his grandson 'cause he was my grandpappy! Apollo: Wow, you don't say! Filch: Thieves' honor, it's the honest truth! Ah... The sloshing sound of azuki beans scrapping together in the dead o' night... It's the magical sound of dirty money getting washed clean for givin' out to the poor! I'm Azuki Kozo, washer of money, giver-outer of wealth, reborn! Athena: ......... Forget the money. You should be washing yourself of this nasty habit. Apollo: (Wait a second. This figure looks familiar.) Yes! It looks just like that old, dusty figure we found in the Forbidden Chamber. Forbidden Chamber Figure updated in the Court Record. Filch: Hey! Whaddaya doing with that there figure?! Apollo: Oh, this? We found it in the Forbidden Chamber. Looks like it'd been there practically forever. Filch: Hmm... Could mean my grandpappy broke into the Forbidden Chamber way back. Hey, that reminds me. He once told me there's treasure in that there chamber! Apollo: Treasure? Forbidden Chamber Treasure (appears after \"Stealing\") Apollo: What do you know about the treasure in the Forbidden Chamber? Filch: Eh heh heh. Only that it's the greatest get-rich-quick chance in the universe. Grandpappy told me all about it. Said there's an amazing treasure in there! Apollo: There's something amazing in there? (Didn't see anything like that, though.) Your grandfather didn't, by chance, already steal it, did he? Filch: Seein' how there was one o' his figures in there, that just might be. Eh heh heh, that's Grandpappy for ya! Bet he washed that treasure up real good before handing it out to the poor. Apollo: Oh, of course, because he was so righteous... Tenma Taro sighting Apollo: In court, you mentioned seeing Tenma Taro near the scene of the crime. Filch: Sorry I didn't come clean right away, but them superstitions got the better o' me. Apollo: The people of Nine-Tails Vale sure seem like a superstitious bunch. I'm not surprised you wouldn't want to talk about seeing Tenma Taro. Filch: Darn right! Them superstitions scare me outta my wits, I tell you! That's why I'm gonna do exactly what they say from now on. Apollo: So you plan on staying here in Nine-Tails Vale? Filch: Yep. I'm gonna keep living right here 'n' keep with the old ways, just like Grandpappy did. Them superstitions are like a rulebook to me. Apollo: Wait, so you're saying you actually believe in those old wives' tales? Filch: Ain't you been listening to a word I said? Apollo: You're going to do \"exactly what them superstitions say\"? Well, I say that's baloney. Present Village Superstitions Apollo: Leads to: \"It's clearly written right here: \"Ignoring the superstitions will cost you your soul.\"\" Present anything else Apollo: Filch: ............Say, Mr. Lawyer, sir... Apollo: Yeah? Filch: I don't have much school learnin', but I ain't no dummy. That there ain't got nothing to do with me. But I'd be happy to take it off yer hands if ya wanted, eh heh heh heh. Apollo: I don't think so. (Let's try that one again.) I heard every word of what you had to say... ...but I don't believe them for a second. Leads back to: \"You're going to do \"exactly what them superstitions say\"? Well, I say that's baloney.\" Apollo: It's clearly written right here: \"Ignoring the superstitions will cost you your soul. There is, however, one way to save it: your immediate departure from the village.\" Filch: ...Ah. Apollo: So according to this, you shouldn't even be here, let along talking with us. You said you plan on staying right here in Nine-Tails Vale. But if you really believe in the superstitions, you would've been long gone by now. Filch: Uwaaah! Apollo: I know you've been lying to me! Time to come clean, Mr. Filch! Filch: Yiiiiiiiiipes! Tenma Taro sighting (second time) Apollo: You were lying about believing in the superstitions, weren't you? Filch: Sorry, but I didn't have no choice. Apollo: So, what was the real reason why you couldn't talk about seeing Tenma Taro? Filch: It's all that pretty boy's fault -- Mr. L'Belle, if ya know what I mean. He told me not to say a word 'bout seeing Tenma Taro. Said if I did, he'd do to me what them superstitions said would happen. Apollo: So, it was Mr. L'Belle who muzzled you? Why would Mr. L'Belle want to scare you into silence? Filch: Mr. L'Belle was trying to protect that little maid gal! It was on account o' that rumor! The one about her being possessed! Apollo: That rumor again... Athena: I guess we really do have to talk to Mayor Tenma about the possession rumor. Apollo: Ouch! Hey, watch it! Village Superstitions stolen by Phineas Filch! Filch: I'll be taking this back now, eh heh heh heh. Kinda like family to me. Apollo: You could've just asked instead of stealing it... Tenma Taro sighting (subsequent times) Apollo: You were lying about believing in the superstitions, weren't you? Filch: Sorry, but I didn't have no choice. Apollo: So, what was the real reason why you couldn't talk about seeing Tenma Taro? Filch: It's all that pretty boy's fault -- Mr. L'Belle, if ya know what I mean. He told me not to say a word 'bout seeing Tenma Taro. Said if I did, he'd do to me what them superstitions said would happen. Apollo: So, it was Mr. L'Belle who muzzled you? Why would Mr. L'Belle want to scare you into silence? Filch: Mr. L'Belle was trying to protect that little maid gal! It was on account o' that rumor! The one about her being possessed! Apollo: That rumor again... Athena: I guess we really do have to talk to Mayor Tenma about the possession rumor. Present Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy Filch: Hey, I know that picture! That's my Amazing Nine-Tails glossy! How dare you steal from me! Apollo: No, this is the one you gave me. Remember? You said you had lots more. Filch: I did? Well, it was never really mine in the first place, so... You can go ahead and keep it. Apollo: (Don't tell me I'm now guilty of receiving stolen goods...) Azuki Kozo Figure Apollo: So, your grandfather was a famous thief? Filch: That's right. He stole for the rich to give to the poor. Just like your Robin Hood. But in these parts, he's known as Azukikozo! He washes his loot clean before handing it out to the poor. Apollo: (It's hard to imagine Mr. Filch has such noble intentions. I bet he was planning on keeping my bracelet for himself.) After clearing all Talk options: Athena: Was that all we wanted to ask Mr. Filch? Apollo: Yeah, I think that was it. Let's go see \"Mr. Tenma Taro\" one more time. (Just thinking about dealing with that yokai again makes me want to say, \"Pass!\") April 18Detention Center - Visitor's Room Athena: Lord Tenma! Your attorneys are here to see you, Your Malevolence! Tenma: ......... Apollo: Umm......... Tenma: .........Why are you speaking like that? Athena: Oh, Mayor Tenma! You've returned...! Tenma: Yes, well, Jinxie came by earlier to apply a new charm to my head. It seems to be suppressing the demon within me. Apollo: That's a relief. Maybe we'll actually get somewhere this time. Tenma: So, what can I do for you today? Apollo: We'd like to ask about the rumor that Jinxie is possessed. Tenma: Ah! Apollo: She allegedly left the yokai evidence at the scene while under a demon's power. At least, that's what the prosecution is going to claim at tomorrow's trial. Tenma: .................. Heh heh heh... Apollo: Huh? Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! No match is this warding charm for me! Apollo: Aagh! Th-The charm! Athena: Tenma Taro's back! Tenma: Those foolish mortals! They shall regret blaming that child for my doings! Apollo: Argh, I blew it! That question brought that yokai back. (And he probably won't drop the act until Jinxie's name is cleared either.) Talk Rumor about Jinxie Apollo: We'd like to ask you about something your aide Florent L'Belle mentioned. Did you know Jinxie is rumored to be possessed? Tenma: I know not of what you speak. Apollo: You're not trying to protect Jinxie, are you? Tenma: I, Tenma Taro, demon lord of the yokai, protect a mere mortal? Caw caw-caw-caw! No affections do I possess for your race of humans. Apollo: Please! We already proved there was a third part disguised as a yokai at the scene. But if you deny that tomorrow, we'll never be able to clear Mayor Tenma's name. Tenma: .........But I have already told you, I know not of what you speak! Athena: I don't think we'll get anything more out of him. Apollo: It's all over unless we can somehow prove that Jinxie didn't plant that yokai evidence. Athena: .........Hey, Apollo? I think I've got this one. I think I can prove that she didn't do it. Apollo: Really? Athena: Sure! I should be able to use psychology to explain that whole possession thing. Apollo: Knock yourself out, then! (Wow, Athena's really something. I can really count on her when it counts!) The real story (appears after \"Rumor about Jinxie\") Athena: Mayor Tenma, Jinxie isn't possessed. I believe her so-called possession episodes are a form of somnambulism. Apollo: Somnambulism? You mean sleepwalking? Athena: Yes, I believe she is exhibiting a rare form of the disorder. It's usually brought on by repressed stress. Mr. Mayor, didn't her symptoms start soon after she began her job in Nine-Tails Vale? Tenma: ...Hrmmm. When the child visited last... ...she did speak of dreading yokai, and how they rob her of sleep each night. Athena: I knew it! That lack of sleep is causing her to enter an unconscious state. And that means she can't be trying to protect you -- at least not on a conscious level. Apollo: So then, the Tenma Taro that was spotted at the manor wasn't Jinxie. Tenma: Sleepwalking, eh? Hrmmm. That would, indeed, explain the matter. Apollo: Look! Tenma Taro's spirit! It's left the mayor's body. Athena: Can you tell us the truth now, Mayor Tenma? Tenma: Very well. It's the least I could do for a superb exorcist such as you. Feathers and tracks (appears after \"The real story\") Leads to: \"Mayor Tenma, you didn't leave those feathers and tracks at the scene, did you?\" Athena: Mayor Tenma, you didn't leave those feathers and tracks at the scene, did you? Tenma: I did not. Neither I nor Jinxie have anything to do with that. That was... the killer's doing, no doubt. Athena: I knew it! Tenma: You suspect Florent is behind all this? But why? Did he really want Nine-Tails Vale that badly? Apollo: Can you think of any reason why? Tenma: Hmm... Looking back, he did seem fixated on Tenma Taro for a spell. Ah! Could it be...?! Perhaps he was... attempting to release Tenma Taro. Apollo: That's crazy! Are you saying that yokai is real? Tenma: Whatever the case, Tenma Taro brings nothing but pain and misfortune. It's as the superstitions warn. You must not gaze upon him nor free him from his prison! Apollo: B-But... (How can people actually believe that?!) Athena: Well, at least we know who's behind this whole Tenma Taro thing now. Apollo: Yeah, and I think we need to have another nice, long chat with Mr. L'Belle. Guard: You d-d-dinner is ready, Your Malevolence! Tenma: Ah, an offering to the demon king. You may place it right there. Guard: The kitchen crew poured their heart and soul into making it. Tenma: Did they now? Souls happen to be a favorite of mine. Just, hold the hearts next time! Caw caw-caw-caw! Guard: Y-Yes, Your Malevolence! I'll remember that! Apollo: (How long is he planning to keep up this yokai charade?) Well, we've already talked to Mr. Filch and Mayor Tenma, so... Why don't we go see Florent L'Belle next? Now that we know the truth... ...he won't be able to claim that the Tenma Taro was Jinxie or the mayor anymore! Athena: But the real question is: how are we going to get him to admit it was him? Detention Center (before clearing \"Taro's true identity\" Talk option in Kyubi Manor - Foyer) Talk Feathers and tracks Athena: Mayor Tenma, you didn't leave those feathers and tracks at the scene, did you? Tenma: I did not. Neither I nor Jinxie have anything to do with that. That was... the killer's doing, no doubt. Athena: I knew it! Tenma: You suspect Florent is behind all this? But why? Did he really want Nine-Tails Vale that badly? Apollo: Can you think of any reason why? Tenma: Hmm... Looking back, he did seem fixated on Tenma Taro for a spell. Ah! Could it be...?! Perhaps he was... attempting to release Tenma Taro. Apollo: That's crazy! Are you saying that yokai is real? Tenma: Whatever the case, Tenma Taro brings nothing but pain and misfortune. It's as the superstitions warn. You must not gaze upon him nor free him from his prison! Apollo: B-But... (How can people actually believe that?!) Athena: Well, at least we know who's behind this whole Tenma Taro thing now. Apollo: Yeah, and I think we need to have another nice, long chat with Mr. L'Belle. April 18Kyubi Manor - Foyer L'Belle: Okay! Now, let's PRACTICE that AGAIN, Filchy! From the top! Filch: Errr... Mr. L'Belle was in the foyer at the time of the crime... ...and when we, uhh... heard a scream, uhh... Aw, heck! What was the next part again? Aaaargh! L'Belle: You have the memory capacity of a FLEA! This is the THIRTIETH TIME, you know! Now, a hundred times more and we're done! Apollo: (What on Earth are they practicing?) Filch: Aww, I ain't cut out for this. ......Whoopsie daisy! L'Belle: Ouuuw! Filch: Oh, begging yer pardon, Mr. L'Belle, sir. It's just, all this practice-- Yipes! L'Belle: Unbelievable! What if you had sullied MY outfit with those GRUBBY paws of yours? Apollo: ......... (Did Filch filch L'Belle's wallet just now...?) Athena: So... what do you think they're up to this time, Apollo? L'Belle: Hm? Oh, it's YOU two. Eavesdropping, are we? Pffft, you peasants are SO tacky. Well, what do YOU want with ME? Apollo: (Your confession to being the Tenma Taro imposter would be nice right about now.) Talk Taro's true identity Leads to: \"Mr. Filch filled me in on a conversation you two had.\" Present Hand Cream Apollo: (Wait, this is our trump card. Better not show it off too soon.) L'Belle: You wanted something? Apollo: Oh, um... No, never mind. L'Belle: Pffft. Apollo: Mr. Filch filled me in on a conversation you two had. And about how you told him not to say a word about seeing Tenma Taro. L'Belle: ......... Filchy, you FOOL! Filch: Yipes! L'Belle: I TOLD you nothing good would come of you RUNNING your mouth! Apollo: So why did you want to keep Mr. Filch quiet like that, Mr. L'Belle? L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Why to PROTECT darling little Jinxie, of course. Apollo: But Jinxie was never really possessed. She was sleepwalking. Being asleep at the time, she couldn't have been consciously trying to protect the mayor. That also means she couldn't have possibly been Tenma Taro. L'Belle: Interesting... But where ARE you going with this? Apollo: ...Since you asked so politely... I believe you have a different reason for trying to keep Mr. Filch quiet. That reason would be to deflect doubt away from the one who was really Tenma Taro. L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha! Now THIS is getting interesting! Are YOU insinuating that I'M Tenma Taro? So SORRY to disappoint, but I'm NOTHING of the sort! Filch: That's right! Mr. L'Belle even told me Tenma Taro was a jinx, so why would he-- Youw-ouw-ouw-ouw-ouw-ouch! L'Belle: I SAID Tenma Taro was JINXIE, you fool! Honestly! You have the memory capacity of a FLEA! Practice it a hundred more times! (Changed from [Honestly! You have the memory capacity of a FLEA! Practice it a hundred times more times [sic]!] in the original release) Filch: Yiiipes! Apollo: So, um, have you been called to testify tomorrow? L'Belle: Yes, and I'm SO looking forward to my COURTROOM debut. But you'll JUST have to wait until then, ah ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (Oh, I'll be waiting -- with a special piece of evidence I've been saving just for you.) L'Belle: FILCHY! Wake up, you lazy bones! Filch: Huh? What? Was I sleeping? *yawn* Musta been that sweet cologne o' yours, Mr. L'Belle. Made me right sleepy, it did. L'Belle: Well, it's TIME for your LESSON on what to do and say tomorrow. Filch: Oh, I'm beggin' ya! Not another lesson! I ain't cut out for this thinkin' and rememberin' stuff! Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh! Right up the schnozzola! L'Belle: Keep quiet and do EXACTLY as I say! Filch: Noooooo! Pleeeaaase! Anything but another lessooooooooon! Athena: There they go... Missed our chance to get the truth out of him. Apollo: Yeah, but we'll get the proof we need in court tomorrow, one way or another! (All that's left now is that lie Jinxie told. We'd better go clear that up before tomorrow.) Athena: You think they're done questioning Jinxie? Apollo: Maybe. Let's see if she's over on Yokai Lane shopping for more charms. April 18Nine-Tails Vale - Yokai Lane Jinxie: Accursed Nine-Tailed Fox! The time for settling the score is nigh! My grudge has but festered over time. At last, vengeance will be mine! Grrr... Grrr... Athena: She must be possessed -- er, sleepwalking again! Apollo: (...Maybe if I speak softly, I won't startle her and get a charm plastered on my forehead.) Pssst... Jinxie? Jinxie: ......Huh?! ......Oh, hello, Mr. Demon Lawyer. Ah! My charms must've fallen off again. Apollo: (Phew... Guess I can avoid a charm slap by toning down my Chords of Steel.) Athena: Are they done questioning you, Jinxie? Jinxie: Uh-huh. And on the way back, I stopped here to buy a new charm that was just released. Apollo: Yeah, which one? Jinxie: Oh, um, the one with the Nine-Tails Fox and Tenma Taro. It shows them dancing together! Apollo: Really?! Two bitter rivals dancing together? Jinxie: Uh-huh. It's a charm for rebuilding burnt bridges! Apollo: Oh, right. For the municipal merger issue. Jinxie: No, it's for the Demon Lawyer and the Insomniac Prosecutor. It'll stop you two from fighting like you did in court this morning. Apollo: We weren't fighting. It was just a spirited debate. It's what we lawyers-- Ack! Jinxie: No fighting. Apollo: *sigh* Charm-slapped again. Athena: Apollo, if you're done playing around, let's find out what she was lying about! Talk What you remember Apollo: Jinxie, it seems like you're starting to remember things. You already said the feathers and tracks weren't there when you discovered the crime. Have you remembered anything else that seems important? Jinxie: Eek! L-Like what? Apollo: Tell us what you saw that day. Maybe you'll remember something else this time. Jinxie: ...Eek! When I opened the door, Papa and Alderman Kyubi were collapsed in the Fox Chamber. That's when Papa told me to call an ambulance and the police. That's all he said before he passed out in the chair. BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: (I knew it... She's holding something back.) Present Bracelet Jinxie: That's all he said before he passed out in his chair. Perceive trembling finger on charm on \"That's all he said\" Apollo: Apollo: You were very nervous when you said, \"That's all he said,\" weren't you? I know because I saw your fingers move as if you were going to slap someone with a charm. Jinxie: Huh?! Apollo: Listen to me, Jinxie. This is very important. Did Mayor Tenma say anything else to you? Jinxie: I-It was... It was nothing. He was just talking in his sleep... Apollo: Talking in his sleep? So you admit that he DID say something else! Jinxie: E-Eeeeeek! How could you tell?! Only... Only a demon could have such powers! Leads back to Talk options Perceive wrong area Apollo: Jinxie: Eek! Apollo: Arrragh! Jinxie: D-Don't shout like that. Nearly scared the wits out of me. Uhh... And d-don't stare at me like that, either. It's creepy... Apollo: (Guess that wasn't right.) Leads back to Talk options What you remember (after perceiving) Leads to: \"Uuuh... Uuuuuuuh...\" Jinxie: Uuuh... Uuuuuuuh... L-Like I said, he was just talking in his sleep! I mean, why else would Papa say something like that! Apollo: Could you be a little more specific? Jinxie: Before he f-fainted, he said... \"Forgive me, Jinxie. I killed Alderman Kyubi.\" Apollo: He said whaaaaaaaaat?! Athena: The mayor actually confessed to the crime?! Jinxie: B-But he didn't mean it. He couldn't possibly have known what he was saying! He was probably possessed or maybe he was in the middle of a nightmare! Apollo: A nightmare? No, THIS is a nightmare...! (This is one statement I wish I'd never heard. What in the world are we going to do now?) Apollo: Return to the basics? Phoenix: That's right. Always believe in your client, no matter what happens. That is a lawyer's greatest and most trusted weapon. Apollo: (Right... Just believe in my client, even if all I can see ahead is darkness and despair.) Athena: Jinxie, does Prosecutor Blackquill know about your father's confession? Jinxie: I didn't mention it when he was questioning me. I mean, there's no way Papa's the killer! Athena: Why would the mayor confess like that? Apollo: Could he really have been dreaming, or simply delirious? Athena: Who knows, but I sure feel like I'M in a living nightmare right now. Apollo, what are we going to do about tomorrow's trial? The crime scene was locked tight until Jinxie arrived, and our client's even confessed! Not only that, Jinxie has been accused of planting the yokai evidence. Both the mayor and Jinxie are going to prison if we don't do something! Apollo: (I know, I know...) Well, let's see here... Our lack of a third party in the locked room is a major problem. Jinxie has testified that when she first opened the door... ...Alderman Kyubi and Mayor Tenma were the only people she saw in the Fox Chamber. Athena: But the real killer must've been hiding in there as well. Apollo: Considering the room was locked tight, that's the only logical explanation. Athena: Our mystery person must've then fled the Fox Chamber when it was opened. And that's when Jinxie saw what she thought was Tenma Taro! Jinxie: B-But... Papa and the alderman were the only people there. I didn't see anyone else. Apollo: (What's going on here? L'Belle's extremely pale, but he's far from transparent. So just how did he hide himself at the scene of the crime?) Athena: Whatever it takes in court tomorrow, Apollo... ...we have to take down that dirty, rotten \"Tenma Taro\" Florent L'Belle! Apollo: Right. We'll get him with a legal exorcism, Justice style! To be continued Nothing to examine during investigation Athena: Apollo, it doesn't look like there's anything particularly interesting here. Examine insignificant area on evidence Apollo: Nothing particularly interesting here. Area already examined Apollo: (We've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around.)\nThe Monstrous Turnabout Image Gallery TranscriptPart 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4April 19, 9:30 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 4Day 2Court Is Now In SessionAll RiseJudge: Court is back in session for the trial of Damian Tenma.Apollo: Apollo Justice, defense team leader, is ready, Your Honor!Athena: Athena Cykes, assistant defender, is ready, too, Your Honor. Je suis prêt!Judge: As chipper as ever, I see. And in French, no less! ...And the prosecution?Blackquill: .........Judge: Very well, then. By the way, I asked Detective Fulbright to provide sturdier shackles today. There will be no more of your funny business this time, Prosecutor Blackquill!Blackquill: ...Hmph.Judge: Now, your opening statement, if you would. I believe it's standard procedure for the prosecution to handle it.Athena: Looks like the judge is really bringing it today.Apollo: He probably realized how Blackquill played him. That was one mean game of Simon Says.Athena: Yeah, His Honor has to fight to defend his honor today.Blackquill: .........Your Baldness... It's plain to see that you've always dreamed of delivering an epic opening statement.Judge: I have? Hmm... I don't know if I'd say that.Blackquill: Why, of course you have. I saw it in your eyes the last time you gave the opening statement. That was the look of one who yearns deeply for the thrill of an epic opening statement. For decades now, you have been watching opening statements from your bench. They were the crown jewels of the court -- the one thing you could not possess!Judge: The crown jewels... of the court?Blackquill: Now, at long last, they are within your grasp. How could you possibly refuse?Judge: ......Oh, uh, so you don't mind if I do it, then?Blackquill: I'll make a special exception, just this once.Athena: Here we go again.Apollo: Yep, more of Blackquill's mind games.Judge: Well, in that case, I think I might go ahead and make the opening statement myself. *ahem* In yesterday's session, we learned the shocking truth that... ...the victim Alderman Rex Kyubi was The Amazing Nine-Tails. We also learned that... ...The Amazing Nine-Tails was a key figure in the yokai craze and anti-merger protests. It was further revealed that upon learning Rex Kyubi's secret identity... ...Mayor Damian Tenma murdered him. The fact that the crime took place in a tightly locked room was also brought to light. And the only people in that tightly locked room were the defendant and victim. The defense proposed the existence of a hypothetical third party... ...but further investigation revealed no proof of a third party who had escaped the room.Blackquill: ...Ergo?Judge: We must conclude that the evidence against the defendant is... well... conclusive. Eek! D-Did I say something wrong?Blackquill: ...That was quite astonishing. You've truly outdone yourself this time.Judge: Oh, heh heh. One more thing to boast about to my grandchild!Apollo: (Well, this was not an unexpected turn of events...)Judge: Now then, it seems the prosecution has called a new witness to testify.Blackquill: The inexplicable yokai evidence left at the scene of the crime... Well, does that not demand some sort of explanation?Judge: The feathers and tracks? Weren't those left by the mayor while he was possessed?Blackquill: That was but an act to protect his daughter.Judge: Oh! Uh... yes, of course! I had suspected as much.Apollo: (Wait, did he actually believe the mayor's \"award-winning\" performance?)Blackquill: His daughter was the one who planted the yokai evidence. Ergo, the true identity of the yokai in the manor was the manor's maid, Jinxie Tenma.Apollo:Apollo: The prosecution is engaging in mere conjecture!Blackquill: Hmph. Would you care for some witness testimony, then? For I am ready to prove that the little scamp is the one behind the Tenma Taro farce.Apollo: (Witness testimony? I'll bet he means Filch and that creep L'Belle.)Judge: Very well, then. Bailiff, would you bring in the first witness?Judge: Mr. Filch, you made quite the hasty exit yesterday. See that it doesn't happen again today.Filch: Eh heh heh. Been known for my hasty retreats since I was a kid. Bit of a trademark o' mine.Judge: Indeed. You managed to give a total of five bailiffs the slip.Filch: Like those amateurs could ever nab me, eh heh heh. Yiiipes!Blackquill: Perhaps we should shackle you by the neck. That would keep you in place.Filch: Yipes! No, please, I'm liable to rip my own head off if I start running!Blackquill: .........Your statement. Now.Filch: Yes, sir, Mr. Blackhead, sir!Athena: He may beat a hasty retreat, but there's no escaping Prosecutor Blackquill.Apollo: Yeah, Blackquill doesn't strike me as the give-up-easy type.Judge: Now then, Mr. Filch, your testimony please. Specifically, the true nature of the yokai you saw in the manor shortly after the crime.Witness Testimony-- The Yokai Is Jinxie --Filch: Tenma Taro's really that little maid gal. Ain't no doubt about it! I mean, the Tenma Taro I saw was just a lil' thing 'bout her size! But the little runt had a big ol' staff. I seen it when she came into the foyer! Betcha she stole it from the Forbidden Chamber after stumbling on the crime scene. She was gonna use it to wallop me on account o' my fierce reputation, I just know it!Judge: So, Tenma Taro was short in stature. And that's because it was Ms. Jinxie Tenma all along?Filch: You betcha! Besides, all the rest in the manor were way taller than her.Blackquill: Feigning height is but an easy thing... ...but a big ox like the defendant could never pass for short.Apollo: What if the Tenma Taro impersonator was walking on their knees?Filch: Weren't no knee walking. I seen it myself!Judge: Hmm... Then perhaps that yokai really was Ms. Tenma, after all.Blackquill: All monsters are naught but tricks, either of the mind or the cheap parlor variety.Judge: So, you're saying she created an illusion like one of those magical eye things?Blackquill: Precisely. Human senses are easily deceived. Take the fellow in the cell next to me. Each night, he cries and screams about some ghost he thinks he sees. But in truth, it was simply the janitor.Judge: Ho ho ho. Prosecutor Blackquill just gave up the ghost, literally!Blackquill: The janitor's deathly complexion and all-white attire are, no doubt, partially to blame. That and the fact that he constantly mutters about taking vengeance for this or that.Apollo: (That...... actually sounds like a real ghost to me.)Judge: The defense may now cross-examine the witness.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Yokai Is Jinxie --Filch: Tenma Taro's really that little maid gal. Ain't no doubt about it!Press Apollo: Apollo: Mr. Filch, you and Mr. L'Belle mentioned something about a practice yesterday. Do you deny this so-called lesson was about what you were supposed to say in court? Filch: N-No, ya got it all wrong! Apollo: Then could you tell the court exactly what sort of lesson it was? Filch: Oh, um... it was... Uh... it was... What was it again? Yiiipes! Ah, now I remember! Math! Ya know, numbers 'n' stuff! Apollo: (He's completely under Blackquill's control, too...) Filch: Anyway, that Tenma Taro was that little maid gal, so what's the difference?Filch: I mean, the Tenma Taro I saw was just a lil' thing 'bout her size!Press Apollo: Apollo: I take it you got a good look at how tall the Tenma Taro impersonator was? Filch: Eh heh heh, you betcha. I got a habit o' sizing people up. I can even give ya a primer on how to pull it off. All under the table, natch. I got a knack for figuring out where people's pockets are and how much money they have. I size 'em real good before I relieve them of their valuables! Apollo: (He just admitted to being a pickpocket right here in court.) Judge: Does the witness hold that this Tenma Taro entered the foyer? Filch: Darn right I do.Filch: But the little runt had a big ol' staff. I seen it when she came into the foyer!Press Apollo: Apollo: Well... you're not going to brush it all off by claiming the perp was short! Filch: Eh heh heh. Musta hit a raw nerve 'cause ya ain't that tall yerself! Apollo: (Look who's talking, Mr. I've-got-to-stand-on-a-box-just-to-testify!) Anyway, Mr. Filch, correct me if I'm wrong... ...but didn't you say the Tenma Taro you saw had a staff? Filch: Cross my heart, hope to die! I know 'cause it went a jingle and a jangle. Apollo: And where do you suppose that staff came from? Filch: Errr... The staff, ya say? Well, I uh...Filch: Betcha she stole it from the Forbidden Chamber after stumbling on the crime scene.Press Apollo: Apollo: I suppose you mean to say that Jinxie Tenma entered the Forbidden Chamber to get one. Filch: Well, I ain't never seen a staff like that in the manor! So it had to be the Forbidden Chamber! Apollo: (Oh, really? The stench of L'Belle is thick in the air today.) Athena: Jinxie entered the Forbidden Chamber after the incident... ...then she took the staff and tried to cover up her actions by pretending to be Tenma Taro. I guess that's what Filch is trying to say...? Apollo: (Could Jinxie have even entered the Forbidden Chamber if she wanted to...?) Judge: There IS one thing I was wondering about. Why did that yokai have a staff in the first place? Filch: Eh heh heh. Well, I've got my hunches about that.Present Forbidden Chamber Key Apollo: Leads to: \"It would seem that Tenma Taro was, in fact, not this innocent little girl.\"Filch: She was gonna use it to wallop me on account o' my fierce reputation, I just know it!Press Apollo: Apollo: Wallop you? And why would the so-called yokai want to do that? Filch: That little maid gal never did like me! She always high tails it when I come 'round or she sticks these weird papers on my noggin! Apollo: (She probably thinks of him as the dreaded tanuki monster of Kyubi Manor or something.)Athena: We need to prove that Jinxie isn't Tenma Taro. But I've no idea how we're going to do that.Apollo: All we have to do is prove that it was impossible for Jinxie to turn into Tenma Taro. And that might be easier than you think.Athena: Really?Apollo: (Now's our chance. Our chance to expose the real Tenma Taro for all to see!)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Trucy Wright\nDescription: An aspiring magician who Mr. Wright adopted when duty called.\nCharacter 1\nName: Jinxie Tenma\nDescription: The maid of Kyubi Manor and a friend of Trucy.

To this day, it is said that he slumbers even still within the Forbidden Chamber. Man: Night, night, alderman... Sweet dreams! At long last... The revival of Tenma Taro is at hand. A few months prior to the courthouse bombing... April 17, 12:13 PMWright Anything Agency Apollo: Hm. Guess I'm a little early. Trucy: Oh, hey, Apollo! Getting an early start today? Apollo: Yeah! This is the first job I've had in a while after all! Trucy: Well, aren't we all fired up! Apollo: Well, it's not every day I get a call from Mr. Wright. What kind of work is it anyway? Mr. Wright didn't mention any details. Trucy: Work? Is that how he put it? Apollo: (Don't tell me he just wants me to clean the toilet again.) Trucy: You've really become a fixture around here, Apollo. Apollo: (Come to think of it, it's been almost a year since I was hired. A lot's happened since then... ...But I've settled in nicely despite a few bumps in the road.) Apollo: My name is Apollo Justice. I've been practicing law for about a year, but I still have a lot to learn. This is the Wright Anything Agency, and it's where I work. Don't let the name fool you -- it's definitely a law agency. Trucy: But don't forget that this place is a \"talent agency\" too, Polly! Apollo: Uhh, it's the \"law agency\" part of this office that's usually forgotten... This is Trucy Wright, a budding magician... ...and adopted daughter of the agency's owner, Phoenix Wright. She sometimes makes me help with her magic tricks. Trucy: And what's wrong with that? You're one of the agency's \"talents\" as well! Apollo: I was under the impression that I was a lawyer... Trucy: Oh, we'd better hurry. Doesn't look Daddy's going to make it, so let's get going. Apollo: Huh? Where are we going? What about the job he mentioned? Trucy: This IS the job, Polly! You're supposed to keep me company today! Now, come on! Apollo: Another day of not being a lawyer. Should've seen this coming. Trucy: Well, this is the \"Wright ANYTHING Agency,\" y'know. And there's no law-related work at the moment, so... Apollo: (Tell me again why I chose to \"work\" here?) Where is Mr. Wright, anyway? Trucy: Daddy said something about going to meet an acquaintance. But don't worry. Just focus on your job, and I'll tell you exactly what you need to know. Well, let's go. We don't have all day! Apollo: Wait a second! (*sigh* And another day of \"anything goes\" begins at the Wright Anything Agency...) April 17, 1:30 PMNine-Tails Vale - Yokai Lane Apollo: Whew... So, what are we doing way up here in the mountains? Trucy: This is Nine-Tails Vale. Everyone's been talking about the yokai craze here. Apollo: Yokai? Oh, you mean Japanese monsters? Guess that explains all these weird things... Speaking of which, wasn't Nine-Tails Vale founded by Japanese immigrants? Trucy: Yeah. They're holding a festival to boost tourism over at the alderman's manor. My friend who works there invited us. That's why we're here! Apollo: In other words, I'm your chaperon because your dad was too busy. Trucy: Daddy said that with those horns of yours, you'd make a great addition to their festival. I mean, you look just like a Japanese demon! Wasn't that so thoughtful of him, Polly?! Apollo: I could do without thoughtfulness like that. Trucy: Oh, it's almost time! Come on, Polly! The festival grounds are this way. Apollo: (Alright, I guess it's time to move to the \"Kyubi Manor's Garden\"...) Talk The monster craze Apollo: This monster craze... Come to think of it, I think I heard about it on TV. It's supposedly how Nine-Tails Vale made a comeback from the brink of fiscal disaster. Trucy: Hmm... Our agency could sure use something positive like that. Oh, I know! Let's jump on board the monster craze! You and daddy would be a perfect comedy duo! You could call yourselves Agni & Rudra, Demon Kings of Comedy! Daddy sets them up, and you knock 'em down! Hey, I think we hit the jackpot with this idea! Apollo: Um... Sorry, but I plan on staying a lawyer. Trucy: You do?! Apollo: (You don't have to act so surprised by that.) What to do Apollo: Hey, Trucy? Have you seen my attorney's badge? Trucy: How could you lose something so important? Sometimes I really wonder about you, Apollo. Apollo: This is so weird. I wonder if I dropped it somewhere. Trucy: Oh, look! What are these panties doing here? Apollo: Forget about panties. I'm looking for my badge. Trucy: 3, 2, 1... Ta-dah! Did you forget? These are my magic panties! Apollo: ......Hey! That's my attorney's badge! Wow! How'd you do that? Trucy: I set it all up while we were back at the office. Apollo: Wow, I didn't even-- Wait, you took my badge?! Present Attorney's Badge Apollo: Check it out. Trucy: You're so lucky, Apollo. Everyone can see what you do with just a flash of your badge. Apollo: What about you, Trucy? People can tell you're a magician by the way you're dressed. Trucy: Yeah, but I can't always dress like this. Like when I'm at school and stuff. Apollo: You could always show you're a magician by making things appear or disappear. Trucy: You mean like this? 3, 2, 1... Ta-dah! Apollo: Umm, magic or no, aren't you a little old to be showing those things in public? Trucy: Hmm... Then maybe I'll become a lawyer, too. Apollo: You're abandoning your dream just like that?! April 17, 2:05 PMKyubi Manor - Garden Apollo: Wow, this place is really something. Trucy: It definitely feels like a different world here. ???: Trucy. Trucy: Jinxie! Apollo: And this is? Trucy: My friend, Jinxie Tenma. She's the one who invited us. She just happens to be the maid here. Jinxie: ...Two horns. A love of red. Are you a demon? Apollo: No, ha ha. I'm Apollo Justice! Nice to meet you! Jinxie: Eeeeeek! He IS a demon! Apollo: What the--! Jinxie: Be gone, foul beast! Trucy: Hee hee! You look great, Polly. Fills in some of that space on your forehead! Apollo: Argh... What is this thing? Trucy: It's a warding charm. Jinxie puts them on all the monsters she finds. Apollo: Um, but I'm not a monster. Trucy: Maybe I should have told her you're a good demon. Apollo: Or you could just say I'm human. Jinxie: *shiver* The red demon, emissary of the Underworld. Apollo: (I got up early to do my hair for this?) Um, can I take this off now? Jinxie: So you can eat me? Apollo: I'm not going to eat you! Jinxie: Eek! Forgive me, O terrible one! Trucy: Tone down your Chords of Steel, Apollo. You're scaring her out of her wits! Apollo: Um, don't worry. I'm already full. Jinxie: Please stay that way. Apollo: (Great, now I'm playing along, too.) Talk Nine-Tails Vale Apollo: Um, so I wanted to ask you about Nine-Tails Vale... Jinxie: Eeeeeek! Apollo: Aaaaugh! Jinxie: Be gone, foul demon! Trucy: Looks like you've been demonized, Polly, literally! Apollo: I'm starting to wonder if I really am a demon myself. Um... Jinxie: Eek! Please don't eat me. I have food if you're hungry. Apollo: This isn't working. We won't get anything out of her until we set the record straight. Trucy: Hmmm... If only we had some way to prove you're not as scary as you look. Apollo: (Ouch, unnecessary roughness... Looks like I have to present some proof. Proof that I'm one hundred percent human! (Changed from [Proof that I'm 100% human!] in the original release)) Present Attorney's Badge Apollo: Would you mind taking a look at this? Jinxie: Eeeeek! No, thank you! Be gone, foul demon! Apollo: Ack, banished again. Trucy: That's what you get when you flash a girl like that -- even if it was just your badge. Apollo: Sheesh, you make it sound like I'm some kind of creep. Attorney's Badge (after clearing \"Nine-Tails Vale\" Talk option) Leads to: \"Um, I wanted to show you this.\" Apollo: Um, I wanted to show you this. Jinxie: Eek! What is it?! Apollo: It's my attorney's badge. You see? I'm not a demon, I'm a lawyer. Jinxie: Really?! ...You're a lawyer? Apollo: (Whew... Maybe now she'll stop calling me a demon.) Jinxie: Does it protect you from Enma Dai-O's judgment? Apollo: Who's Enma Dai-O? Trucy: I read somewhere that he's the demon lord who punishes the dead for their sins. (Changed from [I read somewhere that's [sic] he's the demon lord who punishes the dead for their sins.] in the original release) Uh-oh! I think now she thinks you're a demon lawyer from hell, Polly! Apollo: Can I go back to being just a normal demon?! Jinxie: Please... Please don't boil me in a scalding cauldron. I'd prefer a Turkish bath if possible. Apollo: (A Turkish bath? Isn't that more sauna than bath?) Trucy: Don't worry, Jinxie, he's a good demon. He'll save you if you ever go astray! Jinxie: Eek! Please, Mr. Demon Lawyer, sir, have mercy on my soul! Apollo: Argh! I told you, I'm not a demon! And Trucy, you're just making things wors--! (Ack!) Umm... You just leave that Enma Dai-O to me. Trucy: Isn't that great, Jinxie?! Jinxie: Uh-huh. I'm no longer scared to cross into the afterlife. Apollo: (Will someone tell these two I'm human, already!) Talk Nine-Tails Vale Trucy: So, Jinxie, I hear this village is the epicenter of the monster craze. Jinxie: Uh-huh. Barely anyone had even heard of it before, but now it's packed with tourists. Apollo: Really? So, the monster craze is the reason behind today's festival? Jinxie: It was the alderman's idea. But I'd be careful if I were you. There are lots and lots of yokai prowling about Nine-Tails Vale. Apollo: Prowling about? You mean like wild animals or something? Jinxie: Uh-huh. And they're hungry, too. Apollo: Man-eating monsters?! And they're all over the place? Jinxie: Uh-huh. In fact, there was one at the manor yesterday. I heard the doorbell ring, but when I opened the door, nobody was there. It was the Ding-Dong Demon! How else could you explain it? Apollo: Well... When I was a kid, my friends used to play this prank called Ding-Dong Ditch. Jinxie: Well, that doesn't prove yokai aren't real. There's even one here at the manor. The demon Tenma Taro -- he's imprisoned in the Forbidden Chamber. Apollo: Tenma... Taro? The Forbidden Chamber? Tenma Taro (appears after \"Nine-Tails Vale\") Leads to: \"Um, about that yokai you said was imprisoned here at the manor. Is it true?\" Present Attorney's Badge Jinxie: So you really are a demon lawyer. Ummm... So, then, you must know Enma Dai-O, the Appraiser of Souls. What's he like? Apollo: What's he like?! Well, uh... he's um... He's bald, has a white beard, and... Jinxie: A-A-And what? Apollo: He shouts, \"Guilty!\" and \"Order!\", while banging his gavel. I call him \"The Judge.\" Jinxie: Oh, wow, he's as scary as I thought. Apollo: Nah, he's just an old man who's wiser than you might think. Apollo: Um, about that yokai you said was imprisoned here at the manor. Is it true? Jinxie: Uh-huh. He's a super evil demon named Tenma Taro. Here, take a look at this scroll. Tenma Taro's the dark demon you see here. He's super evil and super scary. Apollo: So that's the yokai imprisoned in the Forbidden Chamber? Jinxie: Uh-huh. He was defeated by the village guardian yokai, the Nine-Tailed Fox... ...and locked away forever. Apollo: So... you're saying Tenma Taro is still trapped inside the Forbidden Chamber? Jinxie: Uh-huh. But he's just biding his time until he can escape. Still, we should be perfectly safe! Because there's a reeeally powerful sealing charm on the door keeping it shut tight! Apollo: (What a... charming security system.) Jinxie: You can keep the scroll if you want. The alderman gave me this, but just holding it gives me the chills, so... Apollo: Ah, uh, thanks, Jinxie. (Maybe I'll give this to Mr. Wright.) Yokai Legend Scroll added to the Court Record. Apollo: So... I was wondering... Are those things on your forehead also warding charms, Jinxie? Jinxie: Yes, they're to prevent evil things from getting inside me. Papa told me to wear them. Apollo: Evil things? Trucy: Apollo, don't you dare take those charms off her forehead! They HAVE to stay there... forever! Got it?! Apollo: (I wonder what would happen if I did take them off...?) Jinxie: It's time for me to get back to work. Trucy: Thanks for inviting us, Jinxie! Jinxie: You're welcome. Oh, and before I forget... There's going to be a surprise event today. Even I don't know what's to expect, but it's sure to be fun. Apollo: (Better not be a yokai parade. She'd probably drop dead from fright.) Jinxie: .........Hm? .........Eeeeek! Apollo: Ahhh! D-D-Demon! (Oh, wait... It's just someone in a suit... right?) Jinxie: T-T-Tenma T-Taro! Apollo: Tenma Taro? (The demon from the Forbidden Chamber?) Jinxie: Eeeeeek! Please don't hurt me! Be gone! Be gone! Be gone! Tenma Taro: Hissssssss! Better watch out little girl, or I'll snatch you away! Jinxie: Eek! Charm charm charm...! Where's that \"Die and Go To Heaven\" charm?! Trucy: Oh, she put it on her own forehead this time! Apollo: ...She sure gives up quick. (Huh? Why's everyone hiding their faces?) Villager: Hey, you there! You mustn't stare at Tenma Taro like that! Lower your eyes! He'll steal your soul if you're not careful! Apollo: Huh? (Steal my soul? Seriously?) ???: Your devilry stops here and now, Tenma Taro! Apollo: Now what?! Trucy: Look, Apollo! There's somebody up on the roof! ???: Ah-ha ha ha ha ha! Villager: That booming laugh! Could it be...! ???: My nine golden tails are proof of my unassailable righteousness! With my band of one hundred minions, I vanquish evil from the land! (Changed from [With my band of 100 minions, I vanquish evil from the land!] in the original release) I am the wrestler of righteousness! Ya-ha! Wrestler: The golden lord of yokai, The Amazing Nine-Tails, is here! Fear not, good little boys and girls! For I shall defeat Tenma Taro! Ah-ha ha ha ha ha! Ah-ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Villager: Hurray! Hurray! It's The Amazing Nine-Tails! Wrestler: Up to your no good tricks again, eh, Tenma Taro?! Well, not on my watch! Tenma Taro: Aaaaaaaaaaaah! Wrestler: A-ha ha ha ha ha ha! There's nothing to fear now, my child! I have banished Tenma Taro! You and your people can now live in peace! Jinxie: Th-Thank you, Mr. Amazing Nine-Tails, sir! Wrestler: Now, I must be off! Another match and another foe to vanquish, await! Apollo: W-What was that all about? Did that wrestler just chase off a yokai? Looked like he came out of the alderman's manor. Jinxie: That was The Amazing Nine-Tails! He's a pro wrestler from right here in Nine-Tails Vale. But no one knows his true identity! Apollo: (Jinxie sure seems chipper all of a sudden.) What was all that about him banishing Tenma Taro? Jinxie: That was a yokai exorcism. It's an annual ritual where Tenma Taro is released, to remind us of his wickedness. In the end, the Nine-Tailed Fox drives Tenma Taro out, and purifies our village. But The Amazing Nine-Tails did the honors this year! Apollo: (So that was the big surprise, huh? The Amazing Nine-Tails and Tenma Taro, huh... Well, whatever floats her boat.) Jinxie: Oh, would you look at the time. I'd better get back to work. Please excuse me. Apollo: She's a strange one, all right. Trucy: I think she's sweet in her own special way. (Changed from [I think she's sweet in own her [sic] special way.] in the original release) Apollo: (Knowing Trucy, she probably has lots of friends who are \"sweet\" in their own way.) Trucy: Well, we still have some time to kill. Might as well see the rest of Nine-Tails Vale while we're here. Apollo: The fun never stops, does it? .............................. .............................. April 17, 3:40 PMKyubi Manor - Garden Trucy: I think I bought nearly every yokai souvenir that was for sale. Apollo: I know, because my wallet's running on empty. Trucy: Hm? What's with all the commotion over there? Apollo: Huh? Hey, isn't that your friend Jinxie?! I hope everything's okay. Jinxie: I-I-It's t-t-terrible! Th-Th-Thththth...! The--! The--! Trucy: Calm down, Jinxie! Tell us what happened. Jinxie: Th-Th-The demon T-Tenma T-Taro... ...He killed Alderman Kyubi! Apollo: Whaaaaaat?! Trucy: Wait, killed as in dead? Jinxie: Yes. And Tenma Taro did it! Apollo: Tenma Taro?! You stay here while I go have a look. Jinxie: P-Please, wait! Apollo: Huh...? Ack! Jinxie: It's a... Tenma Taro Warding Charm. It should protect you, but please... be careful. The alderman's in the Fox Chamber at the top of the main staircase. Apollo: Okay, got it! Tenma Taro Warding Charm slipped into pocket. April 17Kyubi Manor - Fox Chamber Anime cutscene Apollo: A-Are you all right?! Man: Wh-Who are you...? Apollo: H-Help! Someone call an ambulance! Apollo: The police arrived soon after that, at which point I returned to the festival grounds. Apparently, the man impaled by the spear was already dead. But there was one other person there, and he was immediately rushed to the hospital. April 17Kyubi Manor - Garden Apollo: Thank goodness the other man's going to be fine. Sounds like he'd only been unconscious. Trucy: You think Jinxie's going to be okay? Apollo: I'm sure she'll be back to her old self in no time. At least she's calm enough for the police to question her for now. (And I'd sure love to know what crazy animal left those feathers and tracks...) Trucy: Oh, look, here comes Jinxie. Jinxie: ...Hi, Trucy. ...Hi, Mr. Demon Lawyer. Apollo: Heya... Feeling any better? ...I was wondering if you're up to filling us in on what happened... Talk About what happened Apollo: So, the man with the spear in his chest was already dead? Jinxie: Uh-huh. It was Alderman Kyubi. When I found him, he was already... Apollo: (So the victim was the village alderman...) And the one who was found alive? Who was he? Jinxie: Damian Tenma. He's the mayor of the neighboring city, Tenma Town. They arrested him. *sob* Apollo: So... he's the killer? Ack! Jinxie: Nuh-uh! Papa didn't kill anyone! Apollo: Papa? As in... your father? Trucy: That's right. Jinxie's dad is mayor of Tenma Town. Apollo: No way! Jinxie: Errr... Yes, way, but he's innocent. Apollo: (This just got way more complicated. The victim was the alderman of Nine-Tails Vale. And Jinxie's father, the mayor of Tenma Town, was arrested for the crime. Sounds like we have some investigating to do.) Trucy: I know this is difficult, Jinxie, but you need to hang in there! Jinxie: I know. I'll try my best. Apollo: Would you mind telling me a little more about the victim? The alderman (appears after \"About what happened\") Leads to: \"So the victim was the village alderman? What can you tell me about him?\" Present Yokai Legend Scroll Jinxie: They sell those at the village souvenir shop. Apollo: They really went all out, making it look like a real scroll and all. Jinxie: By rolling it up like that, you can't see Tenma Taro's picture. It's so you don't lose your soul if you accidentally gazed upon him. Even if it is a souvenir, no one in this village wants to accidentally see what's inside! Apollo: I've heard of losing or selling your soul for many things, but for the price of a souvenir? Jinxie: I wonder how many innocent shop girls have fallen victim. *shivers* Apollo: Wouldn't it be better not to sell them at all? Tenma Taro Warding Charm Jinxie: That warding charm is my supernatural security system. It protects me from yokai -- ghosts, demons, and other things that go bump in the night! Just the other day, I was chased down by a demented camera demon. But I drove him back with my trusty warding charm! Apollo: (Camera demon? Sounds more like an overexcited tourist.) Jinxie: Still, I suppose it's not nice to repel every yokai I meet. I mean, there are some that aren't all bad. I learned that today. Apollo: (Um... Why is she staring at me like that?) Apollo: So the victim was the village alderman? What can you tell me about him? Jinxie: His name was Rex Kyubi. They say his family has ties to the legendary Nine-Tailed Fox. He was really kind, and he always looked out for me. He was a former pro wrestler, and I even heard he knew The Amazing Nine-Tails. Apollo: (A former pro wrestler, huh... Hmm... That's something to keep in mind.) With your father being mayor and all, I guess you're originally from Tenma Town, huh? So then, why did you come work here? Trucy: It was to overcome your fears, right, Jinxie? Jinxie: Uh-huh. Plus, Mama was from Nine-Tails Vale, though she's no longer with us. She loved these flowers. I always wanted to live where Nine-Tails flowers grew. Trucy: Wow, what a beautiful flower. And with exactly nine petals, too! Jinxie: Just looking at them gives me courage, even when I'm scared of yokai. Nine-Tails Flower added to the Court Record. Apollo: Jinxie, when you first told us what happened, you said the killer was a demon. Jinxie: Uh-huh. The warding charm on the Forbidden Chamber's door... It's been... removed. Apollo: (The Forbidden Chamber's door? That big door that was barred shut? There wasn't a charm on it when I checked it out, so I guess it was removed by someone...) Jinxie: That's how Tenma Taro escaped! Ooh... Ooooooh! But when... when I try and remember what happened, it all goes... fuzzy. Trucy: Jinxie, you should do get some rest. You've been through a lot today. Apollo: (Between the warding charm being removed, and the black feathers and weird tracks... ...I could see how a superstitious person might think a demon was the killer.) Trucy: Apollo! Maybe this is your chance. Apollo: Chance for what? Trucy: To do the right thing and defend Jinxie's dad in court! Apollo: Who, me? Wouldn't a man like Mayor Tenma have access to more experienced lawyers? Jinxie: Umm... You wanna know what the detectives said? They doubted there was a lawyer who could get a not-guilty verdict in this one. Apollo: (Sounds like they're expecting an open and shut case.) Trucy: Don't worry, Jinxie! If anyone can prove your dad's innocence, it's Polly! Apollo: Wha--?! Trucy: You'll accept the case, won't you, Polly! Jinxie: Ooh... It's all over, isn't it? I'll... I'll be all alone... for the rest of my life. Apollo: (Oh, right... Jinxie already lost her mother.) ...All right. Jinxie, leave your father's defense to me! Trucy: Atta boy, Polly! Jinxie: You're going to help Papa, Mr. Demon Lawyer? Apollo: Yep, because that's what lawyers do. (Plus, no toilet cleaning for a while!) I'll do whatever it takes to make sure your father walks away a free man! Jinxie: Th-Thank you, Mr. Demon Lawyer! I can tell you're one of the good ones. Red Demons are usually so mean. Apollo: (It's been awhile, but I'll be fine! Ready or not, here comes Justice! Guess I oughta go and meet my new client.) Ah, but before I forget... (Better jot this down in my notebook.) Trucy: Hey, Apollo, what's the notebook for? Apollo: Oh, I just thought I should jot down some stuff about the case. And so I don't misplace them, I'm putting my Notes in the Court Record. I guess it's what you would call a \"To-Do\" list. Trucy: Oh? Sounds handy. Apollo: (To read my notes, I just open the Court Record with [R / RB / E]. Then I can switch between the tabs using [L / LB / Q] and [R / RB / E].) Trucy: Oh, I almost forgot! So, about Jinxie's father... No matter how scary he seems, promise me you'll resist the urge to run away! Apollo: Wait, what? Jinxie: His angry glare can paralyze you with fear. Trucy: And some claim he can even shoot laser beams from his eyes. Jinxie: Well, maybe Papa isn't really THAT scary... Apollo: (A paralyzing stare... Laser beams from his eyes... He sounds like some kind of monster.) Trucy: Hm, I think it's about time I see Jinxie off. I'll head back to the office after I'm done. Apollo: Okay, thanks. April 17Detention Center - Visitor's Room Apollo: Ah, visiting hours. Perfect timing. (Hope he's not as scary as he sounds...) ???: ...Who are you? Apollo: (Yikes!) S-So you're Damian Tenma, r-right?! I'm, uhh... I'm Apollo Justice, attorney-at-law! I'm here to, uhh... I'm here to help! Huh? Aaaaaaaaaaah! (Lemme outta here!) S-Sorry, sorry! I get a little loud sometimes! Tenma: How... incredibly... RUDE! Apollo: Umm, sorry. Did I do something to offend you? Tenma: A visitor when all others shun me like a common criminal! And here I am with nothing to offer! I am the epitome of rude! Apollo: (.........Wait, so he wasn't mad at me?) Tenma: Unworthy as I am, I, Damian Tenma, shall breach these walls... ...so that I may treat my benefactor to some tea, and maybe some cookies, too. Apollo: No, wait! We can do tea and cookies after we prove your innocence! How about you start by telling me what happened? Tenma: Hrmmm... I see. So tea and cookies can wait, can they? Apollo: (Whew, that was close. We don't need \"jailbreak\" added to the list of charges. Seems like a good guy, but with a face like that, I can see why he's misunderstood.) Talk Reason for arrest Apollo: Mayor Tenma. Do you mind if I ask why you were arrested? Tenma: ! Grrrrrr! Apollo: Whoa! S-Sorry! I guess some things are better left unsaid! Tenma: Bah! Apollo: Excuse me? Tenma: To think a public paragon such as I could be treated like this! This arrest should have never happened! Apollo: Go on... Tenma: I fear the ill effects it will have on our youth! Now I've but one choice. I must leave here at once, if only to protect the moral fiber of our youth! Apollo: No, wait! You can protect the moral fiber of our youth after you've been declared not guilty! Tenma: Hrmmm... I suppose you're right. Apollo: (Phew... Our youth just came this close to quite a scare.) Tenma: My fingerprints were on the spear that killed Alderman Kyubi. That's why I was arrested. Apollo: Your prints were on the murder weapon? That's never good. Any idea how they got there? Tenma: None. For I hardly remember a thing, you see. I was fast asleep at the time. Someone must have slipped me a sleeping pill or something. What's worse, somebody clobbered me on the head. Apollo: I see... A drug induced slumber, and a blow to the head. No wonder you hardly remember a thing. Tenma: ............Ho. Apollo: (Huh? Was that some kind of strange laugh?) Well, I think we can safely assume your prints were planted while you were unconscious. Motive Apollo: What do the police have on you as far as a motive is concerned? Tenma: Truth be told, there's been a bit of trouble between the alderman and I as of late. Apollo: Oh? Was it personal in nature? Tenma: Nothing like that. It's a long story... ...but suffice to say, I've been pushing to merge Nine-Tails Vale with Tenma Town. Surrender Nine-Tails Vale to Tenma Town now!!! Apollo: Yikes! Tenma: ...That's what I told him. Apollo: (I'd like to tell YOU to stop shouting like that, but I'm too scared!) So, um, that's the motive the police have established for the alderman's murder? Tenma: Indeed it is. After all, Alderman Kyubi was dead set against a municipal merger. Apollo: And that's why they think you killed him, he was in your way. Tenma: Arrrrrrgh! Cuuuurrrrssseeees! Apollo: Um, M-Mayor Tenma? Are you okay...? Tenma: Jinxie! Forgive me! I never meant to worry you like this! Apollo: It'll work out fine! Just leave it to me! (If only it really were that easy. I don't even know where to start...) Present Attorney's Badge Tenma: ......Thank you for agreeing to defend me. Apollo: Oh, no thanks required. Just doing my job. Tenma: ............ ............ Apollo: (He's even scarier when he's not saying anything.) Um... Nice day today, huh? Tenma: ............Hrmmm. Apollo: I, um, love nice days like these. It's, uh, perfect lawyering weather, heh heh heh! Tenma: The trial......... is tomorrow. Apollo: Yes, right, the trial! (Why do I keep blabbering on like that?) Tenma Taro Warding Charm Apollo: Those charms on your head... They're the same as this one, correct? Tenma: Indeed they are. Jinxie applied them after the murder. She said they would keep Tenma Taro from possessing me. Apollo: Oh, right! (So it's not some creepy fashion statement.) Still, there are an awful lot of them. Tenma: That there are. Truth be told, my head's feeling a bit... itchy. Apollo: Can't you just peel them off? Tenma: Jinxie did this for me. I could not hurt her feelings like that. Apollo: (He really cares for his daughter.) Anything else Apollo: I wanted to show you this. Tenma: ! Apollo: Aaagh! Sorry! Tenma: ............... Apollo: (I hate when he clams up like this.) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: Thank you for meeting with me, Mayor Tenma. Tenma: Please, wait. My daughter, Jinxie... Apollo: Yes? Tenma: She... she already lost her mother. And now with me being held in here, I fear she'll be terribly lonely. I hesitate to ask, but......... I beg you, be a friend to her in her time of need. Apollo: Leave it to me! Trucy and I will look out for your daughter! Tenma: I shall rest a little easier, then. You know, you remind me of some of the new friends Jinxie has been talking about. Apollo: New... friends? Tenma: Yes. It seems she's made some new friends since she started working in Nine-Tails Vale. They're quite the unusual bunch, too. There's a lady with an exceptionally long neck... ...a young lad with an incredibly long tongue, and many other interesting characters. Apollo: (Friends? Sounds more like a bunch of monsters to me!) Tenma: Now, if you would excuse me. It appears my time is up. Apollo: (Whew... Why am I so tired? I must've been more tense than I thought... Still, I'm glad he didn't turn out to be as scary as he looks!) A call? ...Oh, it's Mr. Wright. Justice here. Phoenix: Apollo, is that you? Apollo: Hi, Mr. Wright. What can I do for you? Phoenix: Trucy told me you've taken on a new case. Apollo: Oh, that. It was kinda spur of the moment. (He's actually calling ME about a case?) Phoenix: That's fine, but I have a favor to ask. Apollo: Sure. What is it? Phoenix: I'm at the airport right now. There was someone I had to meet. A new addition to the agency, actually. Her name's Athena Cykes, and she just passed the bar. Apollo: (That's right. I remember hearing about her coming to join us. Guess that was today.) Phoenix: She took off as soon as I told her you needed help with a case. It was like there was no stopping her. Apollo: Wait... Whaaaaaat! Where is she now? Phoenix: Probably somewhere in Nine-Tails Vale by now. That's where that favor I mentioned comes in. I need you to go find her. Apollo: But I've never even met her before. What does she look like? Phoenix: She'll be the girl in the yellow suit sporting an attorney's badge. Apollo: Okay, I'll find her. A new addition to the agency... (Well, I'd better get back to Nine-Tails Vale quick.) Wright Anything Agency Talk Any ideas? Apollo: Trucy, I'd like to hear your thoughts on what happened. Trucy: You do? Does that mean I can join the investigation? Apollo: I could sure use your help, but remember what Mr. Wright said? \"Trucy, you're in high school now, so you need to focus.\" Trucy: Right... I guess I better pull it together. It's time to forget everything else and just focus on my magic tricks! Apollo: Wait, no! He was talking about your schoolwork! What to do Trucy: Welcome to Trucy's Two Cents! Go ahead, ask me anything! Apollo: Oh, um, okay... Jinxie's always plastering charms on my forehead. What should I do? Trucy: That's an easy one, Apollo. Just do this... 3, 2, 1... Ta-dah! Apollo: Do what...? ......Ack! Trucy: See! She won't be able to stick any more on if there's already one there. Problem solved! Apollo: How's that a solution? Either way, I still have a charm plastered on my forehead! Present Attorney's Badge Apollo: Check it out. Trucy: You're so lucky, Apollo. Everyone can see what you do with just a flash of your badge. Apollo: What about you, Trucy? People can tell you're a magician by the way you're dressed. Trucy: Yeah, but I can't always dress like this. Like when I'm at school and stuff. Apollo: You could always show you're a magician by making things appear or disappear. Trucy: You mean like this? 3, 2, 1... Ta-dah! Apollo: Umm, magic or no, aren't you a little old to be showing those things in public? Trucy: Hmm... Then maybe I'll become a lawyer, too. Apollo: You're abandoning your dream just like that?! Tenma Taro Warding Charm Trucy: Jinxie's warding charms... Hm, what if I incorporated it into my act? Might be fun. Apollo: You mean like having charms come out of your magic panties? Trucy: Exactly! And then I'd have them fly off and stick to audience members' foreheads! Apollo: Somehow, I don't think that would go over so well. Trucy: Then how 'bout I have them stick on my assistant? That would be you, Polly! Apollo: How does that make it any better?! And I'm not your assistant! Trucy: What?! But I could've sworn you were. Apollo: Where in the world did you get that idea? Anything else Trucy: Okay! Watch me make that disappear! Apollo: No, wait! That's crucial evidence! Trucy: But I wanted to show you my new disappearing trick! Oh, I know! If it's really so important, how about I make more of it appear! Apollo: Fabricating evidence is even worse than making it disappear! Trucy: Oh, well. Too bad. April 17Nine-Tails Vale - Yokai Lane ???: I. Already. Told. You! I'm a lawyer assigned to the case! I need to study the crime scene, so if you would please tell me where Kyubi Manor is...! Policeman: You can't fool me! You're just some delinquent high school student playing hooky! ???: You stupid, pig-headed...! This attorney's badge isn't just for show, you know! Apollo: (Looks like I just found Ms. Athena Cykes.) Athena: Tsk! Why won't you believe me?! Don't expect me to defend you in court if you ever get arrested! Policeman: Well, I'm the one who usually does the arresting, so... Say, shouldn't you be getting back to school? Athena: I already told you, I'm a lawyer, not a student! Policeman: That's it! Enough of your lies! You're coming with me! Athena: Aaah! Get your hands off of me! Anime cutscene Apollo: .........Urnngh... Think you can watch out for the bystanders next time...? Athena: Whoops! Are you okay? Apollo: I think so. (But that police officer's out cold.) Athena: I am SO sorry! I do that when people suddenly grab me. It's like a reflex or something. Apollo: (Reflex? Sounds more like a felony!) You're Athena Cykes, I take it? Athena: That would be me. And you are? Apollo: I'm Apollo Justice. I work at the Wright Anything Agency. Athena: The Wright Anything Agency? What a fishy sounding name. Apollo: ...It's a long story, but it IS a law office, among other things. Didn't Mr. Wright explain it to you? Athena: Oh, right, THAT Wright! So then, you must be...! Where have you been?! I've been looking all over for you! Apollo: (I could say the same thing to you.) Well, here I am. Now how about telling me a little bit about yourself. Mr. Wright didn't really tell me much... as always. Athena: .........Ah, of course! Feel free to ask away! Talk Athena Cykes Apollo: So, Athena, I hear you just passed the bar. Athena: That's right! And here's my shiny new badge to prove it. Isn't it beautiful? Apollo: Oh, so you must be a bit younger than me. Athena: Heh heh heh. A bit more than you might think, in fact! I'm only eighteen! Apollo: E-Eighteen? How in the world did you become a lawyer at that age? Athena: I skipped a few grades while I was an exchange student in Europe. And I got my license to practice law while I was over there. Apollo: All I can say is, wow... (She must be a genius or something.) Athena: I also studied analytical psychology! Thought it might help me be a better lawyer. Apollo: (Psychology helps her be a better lawyer? How exactly does that work?) The client Athena: So, tell me about our client. What are they like? Apollo: Oh, right, you haven't met him yet. Well... Apollo: ...And that about sums it up. Athena: He's more worried about his daughter than himself. What a wonderful father. *sniffle* Apollo: Wait, are you crying? Athena: I'm not cr-crying! There was something in my eye! Apollo: (Um, they're called \"tears\"...) Athena: Moving right along... Let's get down to business! Helping our client is priority number one! Psychology (appears after \"Athena Cykes\") Apollo: So, Athena, you mentioned studying psychology. Athena: That's right! I've always wanted to bring analytical psychology into the courtroom. The power of psychology will bring a breath of fresh air to the legal system. Apollo: Oh, really? So how do you plan on using it to defend our client? Athena: ...Um, well, for example, I can try to listen in on a witness's inner voice... ...and then analyze their psychological state with the help of my trusty partner Widget! Apollo: Widget...? Athena: This device around my neck here! Say hi, Widget! Widget: Hi Widget! Apollo: IT TALKS?! Athena: Whoa, you need a volume knob! Anyway, the little guy will sometimes say what I'm feeling. Widget: Awk-ward... Athena: Don't worry, you'll get used to it. Apollo: Now THAT I seriously doubt. Present Attorney's Badge Athena: Yep! That's your attorney's badge, all right! Its dull, grimy look makes me think of all the courtroom battles you've faced so far! I hope mine will look like that someday! Look out legal world, Athena Cykes is psyched and ready to go! Apollo: ......... (Actually, I just haven't polished it lately... Maybe I should keep that to myself. No need to deflate her dreams about \"work\" just yet.) Yokai Legend Scroll Athena: What an interesting picture! It looks like a one-on-one monster smack down! It must've been quite a battle. Which yokai do you think is stronger? Apollo: Seems to me Tenma Taro's ability to fly would give him an edge over the Nine-Tailed Fox. Athena: But the Fox has powerful legs. He'd pounce before Tenma Taro knew what hit him! Apollo: He won't be pouncing on anyone after he's dropped from way up in the sky! Athena: Errr... B-But the Nine-Tailed Fox is gold-colored! Gold is way better than black, so I'm sure he'd win! Apollo: What do colors have to do with anything? (Besides, everyone knows red is the best.) Anything else Athena: *sigh* Sorry, Apollo. Nothing's coming to mind. But give me an hour and I'll have it analyzed Cykes style! I'll get started on it right now! Apollo: No need for that! I was just wondering. After clearing all Talk options: Athena: ...Oh, I almost forgot. I have something you might be interested in. I got in on my way here. Think it might have something to do with our case? Apollo: A special edition covering our case? That was quick. Athena: That's the whole point of special editions, isn't it? To be the first to get the scoop? ¡Rápido! (Changed from [That's the whole point of special editions, isn't it? To be the first to get the scoop? Rapido!] in the original release) Apollo: Right... Well, let's see what it says here... (What's the deal with the Spanish?) Tenma Taro was seen.... wha--? He was seen flying through the sky?! Athena: Yeah, somebody happened to snap that photo near Nine-Tails Vale. The article goes on to say it might be connected to our case. Apparently, that photo was shot right after the murder occurred. Apollo: Well, there were black feathers and strange tracks at the crime scene. I'm not surprised the locals think a yokai was involved. Athena: Wait a second... Yokai as in one of those Japanese monsters? Mein Gott! You don't actually think it was a supernatural murder, do you? Apollo: Ha ha ha, n-no, of course not. (Now German? Why not plain old English?) Special Edition Paper added to the Court Record. Athena: ¡Ándale, Apollo! Let's get cracking on that crime scene already! (Changed from [Andale, Apollo! Let's get cracking on that crime scene already!] in the original release) Talk The investigation Apollo: Okay, what's next on the list? Athena: Investigating the crime scene, what else?! Well, what are we waiting for?! Last one there is a rotten egg! Apollo: We don't have to run all the way there. Athena: Okay... Then how about speed walking?! Apollo: (Why does this have to be a competition at all?) Present Special Edition Paper Athena: Looks like this paper doesn't shy away from stories on strange creatures. Apollo: Really? What does it say? Athena: They claim to have produced photos of Gourdy and a Kappa water sprite thingie. And just the other day, they got one of Konaki Jiji crying his poor old eyes out... ...followed by that infamous shot of Tenma Taro. Apollo: I don't know about a Kappa, but I bet the Konaki Jiji... ...is just a shot of someone's grandpa lost and crying up in the mountains. Athena: That's not very nice! They should have helped him instead of publishing his picture! April 17Kyubi Manor - Foyer Athena: Do you hear that? It sounds like a TV or something. Oh, look! There's a TV in that little room in the corner. TV: In other news... The mysterious masked wrestler The Amazing Nine-Tails... ...has been confirmed missing according to sources close to the wrestler. It appears he disappeared sometime after the special event held in Nine-Tails Vale today. He also failed to appear at a match today where he was scheduled to defend his title. Local villagers say his disappearance may be connected with Tenma Taro's recent escape. Apollo: So, that wrestler's gone missing. ???: Hey, you two! You don't belong in here! Athena: Eek! Apollo: Don't worry, there's nothing suspicious-- ???: What about them there horns o' yours? They look mighty suspicious if ya ask me! Apollo: Horns?! That's my hair...! Anyway, we're lawyers, and we're here to-- ???: Ah! You're them lawyers come to defend Mayor Tenma, ain't ya?! Eh heh heh. Shoulda reckoned what with that expensive-looking bracelet ya got there. The name's Phineas Filch. Filch: I'm the caretaker here. Pleased to meetcha, eh heh heh. Apollo: Um, same here. Athena: Wow, talk about a quick change of heart. Filch: So, tell me, Demon Lawyer! Betcha use them demonic horns of yours to scare the bejeebers outta witnesses, huh? Come here, ya lil' horned demon, you! Apollo: Youch! These horns, er... I mean, my hair isn't meant to threaten anyone! Filch: They ain't? Seems a mighty big waste o' perfectly good horns if ya ask me. Then again, ain't none o' my business, so... Apollo: *sigh* (That was fast. Guess he's done with me.) Filch: Well, I'd best get back to work! Athena: Athena: Halt! Stop right there! Filch: Huh? Me? Athena: Apollo, your bracelet's gone! Apollo: Ah! Filch: Don't ya worry, Mr. Lawyer, sir! I'll check the lost 'n' found later! Apollo: .........Somehow, I don't think that will be necessary. Just check your wrist right now. Filch: Arrrrrrrrrgh! The cat's outta the bag! Apollo: (It was barely in the bag in the first place!) Athena: That was a pretty pathetic attempt. Filch: S-S-Sorry! I'm sooooo sooooo sorry! Just couldn't control myself! Please, forgive me! I'm beggin' ya! Apollo: (Sheesh, I almost feel sorry for him now.) Athena: What should we do about him, Apollo? Apollo: Well, I got my bracelet back, and he seems sorry enough, so... Filch: I knew ya'd understand, Mr. Lawyer, sir! Ya obviously got a big heart! As big as the wad o' cash in your wallet, I hope, eh heh heh! Apollo: You leave my wallet out of this. Filch: Ho HO! Athena: Hey! Didn't you just finish apologizing for stealing from us?! Filch: Run away, run away! Head for the hills! Athena: Get back here, you! Apollo: (Talk about a quick escape.) ...Hm? Looks like he dropped a few things. Looks like a pair of diagrams. This one's of the crime scene, and here's one of the foyer. Athena: He left his shoes behind, too. Apollo: The guy's the living definition of a bumbling thief. Athena: Let's hang on to his shoes. We can give them back next time we see him. As for the diagrams, I say we keep them! Apollo: They look like something the police might draw. Wonder where the caretaker got them? Crime Scene Diagram added to the Court Record. Foyer Diagram added to the Court Record. Apollo: Now then, as I recall... ...the Fox Chamber should be at the top of those stairs. April 17Kyubi Manor - Fox Chamber Athena: Whoa! Where'd all these black feathers and weird tracks come from?! Apollo: The popular opinion seems to be that they're from Tenma Taro. Athena: You mean the great evil has returned? Apollo: Even if he did, I'd be laughed out of the courthouse trying to indict him. ???: Hey, who are you and what are you doing here? This is a crime scene! Apollo: And who are YOU? Are you with the police? ???: I asked first! Who are YOU and what are you doing here?! On second thought... I'm placing you under arrest for disturbing a crime scene! Apollo: Ack! Under arrest?! B-B-But... ???: Save it for the boys back at HQ! Now, come quietly or else! I don't want to be late for lunch! Apollo: P-Please, wait! We're Mayor Tenma's lawyers! ???: Well why didn't you just say so! So you're the lawyers I heard about. Ha ha ha! I almost took you two in! You two sure were suspicious, though! Athena: I don't know how many more times I can take being called suspicious in one day... Apollo: Sorry, we didn't catch your name. Fulbright: My name? I'm Bobby Fulbright! The heroic detective who defends our good citizens from evil! The champion of justice who comes running whenever you're in need! And my catchphrase? It's \"In justice we trust!\" Apollo: Hoo boy... (This guy's a story and a half...) Fulbright: So! What can I do for you? Talk Investigating the scene Apollo: So, would it be okay if we had a look around? Fulbright: Certainly not! No unauthorized personnel allowed! Apollo: Couldn't you make an exception? Fulbright: Cease and desist at once, or you'll have to deal with my little friend here! Apollo: Ack! (Yikes! Is he reaching for his...?!) Fulbright: In justice we trust! Apollo: ...! (Phew, it's just his badge.) Fulbright: You may be Mayor Tenma's attorneys, but you still need authorization to cross a police line! Athena: Apollo, let's see if we can't change his mind! Apollo: Good luck! Let me know how it goes! (I bet he's as dense as heroes come...) Persuasion (appears after \"Investigating the scene\") Leads to: \"You're wasting your time and mine! Nobody's crossing this line without authorization!\" Present Anything Fulbright: Justice need backup sometimes, too! So I don't mind you asking for help, but you should start by thinking things over yourself. After all, the road to justice starts with your own first step! Ha ha ha! Apollo: If you don't have any information to offer, you could just say so. Fulbright: You're wasting your time and mine! Nobody's crossing this line without authorization! I'm a wall of justice keeping injustice -- that would be you -- at bay! Apollo: *sigh* I knew it. Look, there's just us and you here, right? Fulbright: Justice and me, you say? Apollo: Th-That's right...? Fulbright: Are you trying to say that justice and I aren't enough to keep you out?! Apollo: Um, what? Athena: ...! No, silly! We're saying that you're an inspiration in our quest for justice! Fulbright: No!!! It can't beeeee!!! Apollo: You have him on the ropes now, Athena! Athena: Um, if we were on the side of justice, would you let us through? Fulbright: B-B-But, guarding the crime scene is a part of justice, too! Athena: Sure... but only a bad guy would stand in the way of justice, right? Fulbright: Aaaaargh! Whose justice is the most just here? Apollo: Well, we can't have a fair and just trial without a thorough investigation, so... Fulbright: Hrmmm... Oh, Lady Justice...! What would you have me dooooo?! Athena: I think we really got to him. Apollo: Yeah, he seems pretty neurotic as far as champions of justice go. (Changed from [Yeah, he's [sic] seems pretty neurotic as far as champions of justice go.] in the original release) Athena: Our pleas for justice must've had a huge impact. It's tying him up in knots! Now's our chance to start looking around. Apollo: (After all that about authorized personnel only... this was surprisingly easy.) Fulbright: Hrmmm... Should I stop them or let them through? Whose justice is more just? Athena: Well, let's get to work! We're supposed to be finding clues related to the crime, right? (Changed from [We're supposed to being [sic] finding clues related to the crime, right?] in the original release) Apollo: Right. A search of the crime scene should turn up some evidence we can use at the trial. Let's try viewing the crime scene from different angles. Athena: You never know what's hiding just around the corner, right? So we move the cursor with [left analog stick / WASD]... (Changed from [Wait, but how do we go about changing our perspective?] in the original release) Apollo: And change our perspective with [right analog stick left/right / left/right arrow keys]. (Changed from [Touch the arrows on the bottom screen or press left or right on [D-Pad].] in the original release) If there's a particular spot you want to examine, just give it a tap. Athena: Okay, let's leave no stone unturned! Nous allons commencer! Let's get started! Examine Forbidden Chamber door Apollo: The Forbidden Chamber... They say the demon Tenma Taro was imprisoned in there before his \"escape.\" Athena: Think we could get this door open? Apollo: It's worth a try. Hrrrgh! ...No good. It's shut tight! I don't even see a key hole. Seems pretty hopeless. Fulbright: In justice we trust! Apollo: Yikes! Fulbright: Did I just hear the voice of someone in need?! Allow me to fill you in! This door simply will not open! We've tried and tried, but it won't budge! It's an essential part of the culture found in this manor, so we can't blow it up either! Apollo: (So, an unopenable door. Right.) Fulbright: According to Ms. Jinxie Tenma, it was shut tight when she came across the crime scene. Athena: Thanks for the tip, Detective Fulbright. We didn't expect you to be so helpful. Fulbright: Aaaaaaaaaaargh! Forget I just said that! Apollo: (So, the Forbidden Chamber was shut tight at the time of the murder. Sounds like something I'd better keep in mind.) Outline on table Apollo: So, this is where Alderman Kyubi's body was found. Athena: Apparently, the murder weapon -- a spear -- had Mayor Tenma's prints on it. Apollo: That's not good. Fulbright: Never fear, Detective Fulbright is here! Apollo: Yikes! Fulbright: Of course, I can't offer you any information on my investigation, so... In the name of justice, I must say goodbye! Apollo: Umm... What was that all about? Armchair on right Athena: Wow! This is a pricy-looking chair! Apollo: Apparently, the mayor was found drugged and unconcious in it. Athena: Really?! Apollo: Yeah, and when he came to, he was arrested for murder. Talk about your rude awakenings. Athena: So, he's the prime suspect in a crime he knows nothing about?! Widget: That stinks! Athena: Oh, poor Mr. Tenma. *sniffle* He must be feeling so scared and confused. Apollo, it's up to us to save him! Apollo: (It's like she's on her own emotional roller coaster.) Fox statues Athena: Look! This statue only has one tail. Apollo: Maybe it's the Nine-Tailed Fox's sidekick. I bet the number of tails represents a yokai's power. Athena: So... if you had two, Apollo, I'd only have one? Apollo: Wait. What? Athena: ...Not that it means you're better than me, got it?! Apollo: Like I said, what? Armchair on left Apollo: There's something wedged under this chair. Let's see if we can't lift it up and... Fulbright: Freeze! Apollo: Yikes! Fulbright: No disturbing crime scene evidence! Even if you ARE the mayor's lawyers. Apollo: (He does have a point there.) Athena: Hey Detective Fulbright, did you hear about the attack over on Yokai Lane? I hear an elderly woman was assaulted by a strange yokai shaped like a roll of cloth! Fulbright: And you waited till now to tell me?! I better get over there at once. In justice we trust! Athena: ...That was surprisingly easy. Okay, Apollo, now's our chance to look around some more. Apollo: (The more I get to know her, the scarier she gets. Hope she never finds MY weakness.) Cloth under armchair Apollo: Whatever this is, it's stuck on tight. Athena: Looks like a large bloodstained cloth. Apollo: The blood's probably the alderman's, but it's pretty far from his body. Wonder how it got here... (And why does this seem important?) Back of folding screen Apollo: (Nothing much to see on this side. Maybe I should go check the other side.) Weapons Athena: This one's a spear, but what about this one? It looks like a giant pair of pliers. Apollo: Looks like something a demon might use. Saw something like that in a manga once. Athena: Really? What are they used for? Apollo: Oh, things like pinching through cheeks... Athena: Eeeuuuw! Apollo: Pulling out tongues... Widget: Stop, stop! Apollo: Oh, and you should see what they can do to a person's eyes-- Athena: Okay, okay, I get the idea! But I'm sure THIS thing is just a simple can opener or something like that! Apollo: Demons eat canned food? I always wondered what they are besides people. Feathers and tracks Apollo: These weird tracks must've been made when someone stepped in the alderman's blood. Athena: Maybe the killer inadvertently made them when they were fleeing? They're pretty big tracks, almost bird-like. The feathers also point to a bird. Apollo: Then it must be one big bird! And not one of the friendly yellow type, either! Athena: Maybe it's some mutant bird creature! Apollo: So, your theory is a giant mutant bird murdered Alderman Kyubi with a spear? Athena: It's more plausible than saying a monster or yokai did it. Apollo: Sorry to burst your bubble, but a giant spear-wielding bird is by definition a monster! Front of folding screen Athena: It's a folding screen. I wonder what they were using it for. Apollo: I read that the Japanese used to use these in drafty rooms, but now they're just for show. Athena: You mean like... like my attorney's badge. *sniffle* Widget: Poor Athena... Apollo: (That cop treating her like a child must've really bothered her.) Clock above door Athena: Apollo, what words come to mind when you watch that pendulum in there? Apollo: Hmm... Unsteady and umm... restless. Athena: That's a direct representation of your current state of mind. Apollo: Wait! That was some kind of psychological test?! Athena: My diagnosis? This strange case has made you anxious, causing you to lose your cool. Apollo: You're actually not that far off the mark. Broken statue behind door Apollo: Hm? There's something behind the door. Whatever it is, it looks like it's broken. Probably broke when the door was opened. Why would anybody put something there? Athena: Yeah, that wasn't very smart. Apollo: Maybe it was Jinxie. She was the first one to discover the body. She must have heard the screams and come running in here in a panic. Athena: Well, look at you, Apollo! Now you're using analytical psychology, too! Apollo: I am? Athena: Wow, you really learn quick! But I guess I shouldn't be surprised. You're the ace attorney of Wright Anything Agency! Apollo: (I can't tell whether she's serious or not. Now, if Trucy said something like that, I'd immediately know she was messing with me.) Intact statue behind door Athena: Doesn't this tanuki statue remind you of the manor's caretaker, Phineas Filch? Apollo: This raccoon-looking thing? Yeah, it does look like him! Athena: Ooh, I just got the best idea! We should knock it over! It might transform back into Mr. Filch! Apollo: Mr. Filch is mischievous, but he's not magical, you know. Athena: Way to waste a brilliant idea, Apollo. Air vent Apollo: Huh, that looks like an air vent. It's pretty high up there. Athena: What if you got a running start and jumped? Apollo: I doubt even a high-jumper could make it. Athena: Argh! Don't rule it out before you try it! Besides, I'm an excellent jumper. Apollo: Even so, that must be about nine feet high. Athena: Like I said, you don't know until you try, Monsieur Justice! Apollo: (She doesn't know when to give up and when to stop using foreign words.) Trophies Athena: Look, trophies! Ooh! This one was awarded to Alderman Kyubi! \"The Amazing Nine-Tails, Yokai Div. Winner, Tenma Town Pro Wrestling Tournament.\" Apollo: Yokai Division? I didn't know you could have a division of one. Athena: Apollo, you should enter the tournament next time! And I have the perfect name for you! The Mysterious Firebrand! A mild-mannered masked lawyer by day... demonic masked wrestler by night! Apollo: No one's going to hire a masked lawyer, Athena. Window Apollo: Hey, this window opens. And outside... we have ourselves a steep cliff. Athena: The window only opens about six inches -- not wide enough for anyone to get in or out. Look, Apollo! There's something caught in the window frame! It looks like gold fur. What a pretty color! It must be from some kind of animal! Apollo: Wonder what it's doing here. Did Alderman Kyubi have a pet fox? Golden Fur added to the Court Record. Window (subsequent times) Apollo: What's this gold fur caught in the window frame here? Could it be from some rare gold-colored fox found only in Nine-Tails Vale? Athena: You think a fox squeezed out of this window? Apollo: Nothing's getting out that way. There's a steep cliff on the other side. Athena: Hmm... It's one mystery after another. Statue next to armchair Apollo: Hmm... What do we have here? Looks like a statue of the Nine-Tailed Fox and Tenma Taro battling it out. Athena: Eek! Careful, Apollo, it's got blood on it! Apollo: Really? ...Hey, you're right. Wonder if it's the alderman's blood? Athena: How can you remain so calm after seeing all this blood? Apollo: Well, this isn't the first time I've seen something like this, so... Athena: You're no fun at all! At least act surprised or grossed out or something for my first case! Apollo: I'm already a lawyer. You want me to be an actor, too? Fox and Demon Statue added to the Court Record. Statue next to armchair (subsequent times) Apollo: Hmm... What do we have here? Looks like a statue of the Nine-Tailed Fox and Tenma Taro battling it out. Athena: Eek! Careful, Apollo, it's got blood on it! Apollo: Really? ...Hey, you're right. Wonder if it's the alderman's blood? Athena: How can you remain so calm after seeing all this blood? Apollo: Well, this isn't the first time I've seen something like this, so... Athena: You're no fun at all! At least act surprised or grossed out or something for my first case! Apollo: I'm already a lawyer. You want me to be an actor, too? Yokai figurines left of the window Athena: Look! A cat with two tails! Apollo: No such thing. Athena: Oh, and this lady has a really long neck! Ha ha ha! How funny is that! Apollo: There's no way a creature like that could ever exist. She'd have a tough time swallowing. Athena: Apollo... I bet you were one of those kids who didn't believe in Santa Claus. Apollo: What's that got to do with anything? After examining Forbidden Chamber door, outline on table, cloth under armchair, window, and statue next to armchair: Apollo: (Guess that about wraps it up.) Now if only we could get that detective to tell us what he knows... Athena: Hey, Apollo... Do you hear something? Apollo: Hm? .........I don't hear anything. Athena: Oh, right. Your hearing must not be as sensitive as mine. Apollo: Um, what are you talking about? Athena: A whooshing sound, like wind rushing through a narrow strait. And the echo of someone's voice... \"In... In...\" Fulbright: IN JUSTICE WE TRUST! Athena: Aaaaaaaaah! Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Someone's got a sharp set of ears! That was the sound of my righteous voice reverberating through the air duct! Athena: I heard it through the air ducts? Fulbright: Yeah, check it out. Apollo: But why would she hear you through there? Fulbright: Why don't we go to the diagram? As you can see, that vent is connected to an air duct that leads out into the hallway! The wind must've rushed through there... ...and carried my monologue with it straight to your ears! Athena: And what a... unique monologue it was. I was just thinking... Maybe the killer made their escape through the air duct or something! Fulbright: Heh heh heh, a cute theory, but I don't think so. The air duct in the hallway is low enough to climb into, that much is true. But as you can see, the vent in the ceiling is very high. Nine feet high, in fact. (Changed from [9 feet high, in fact.] in the original release) I highly doubt that there's any way to get up there without a ladder or something. And I don't see anything of the sort in this room, do you? Athena: Hmm... I guess you're right. Apollo: Speaking of things in this room... Fulbright: Yeah? Apollo: Can you tell us what you guys turned up, Detective Fulbright? Fulbright: Not on my watch, buddy! In the name of justice, I cannot reveal facts pertaining to the prosecution's case! Apollo: Aw, come on, throw us a bone here. Athena: Excuse me, Detective Fulbright, but I recall you saying earlier... ...that you would come running whenever we were in need. Fulbright: Yurk! I suppose I did say that! Helping those in need is what justice is all about, but... But keeping information out of enemy hands is also a form of justice! Hmm... Aaaaargh! Which justice is the most just? Why is this always so hard! Athena: Hmm......... Well, how about this? Let's do a little give and take. I mean, serving the public is part of justice, too, right? You know, like the police motto? \"To serve and protect.\" Apollo: (I doubt leaking information to the defense team falls under that motto.) Fulbright: Yes, of course! I must serve as well as protect! (Changed from [Yes, of course! I must serve and [sic] well as protect!] in the original release) Okay, I will share some information. ...In the name of justice! Athena: We did it, Apollo! Apollo: Yeah, we did it, all right. (But I'm not sure that was entirely ethical...) Talk Details of the case Apollo: Was it Ms. Jinxie Tenma who first discovered the crime scene? Fulbright: That's right. And this photo shows what she saw when she opened the door. Ms. Tenma had a key, allowing her immediate access. Apollo: A key? So, then, the Fox Chamber was locked? Fulbright: Yes, and Ms. Tenma had the only key to its door. Apollo: Really? So, Alderman Kyubi didn't have a key to the Fox Chamber? Fulbright: Actually, he had a master key for most of the doors in the manor, but... It disappeared after his murder. Athena: Disappeared? You think the killer took it?! Fulbright: It could very well be connected to the murder. We're looking into the possibility now. But it's the timing of Ms. Tenma's discovery that I think is most important. Of course, I'm not going to share that information with you, ha ha ha! Athena: You think you're some kind of champion of justice, but you're just plain old mean! Fulbright: I won't fall for that, you shameless rascal! I only help good little boys and girls! Athena: Shameless rascal? Who even says that? Apollo: Well, I wouldn't exactly call you a good little girl, either. Crime Photo added to the Court Record.

Feathers and tracks Apollo: Those feathers and tracks look like something a yokai might leave behind. Fulbright: You don't actually think the murderer was some sort of monster, do you? Athena: What's the name of that creature in the Forbidden Chamber? Tenma... something... Because from the black feathers and big tracks, it looks like that creature did it. Fulbright: Our prime suspect would, no doubt, love to pin the blame on some imaginary creature. Athena: Can Tenma whatchamacallit even be made a victim of slander? Apollo: (I doubt the mayor would do something as childish as blaming a boogieman.) Athena: So, the most likely scenario so far is... ...that Tenma guy left the feathers and tracks behind... ...to make it look like yokai Tenma was the killer. Apollo: ...Wait, what? Now I'm as confused as you! (At any rate, I doubt Mayor Tenma would plant evidence like that.) Suspects Apollo: So, Mayor Tenma is your only suspect? Fulbright: That's right. Even his name, Damian Tenma, makes him sound like a villain. And he's really scary looking, too. Apollo: Wait, are you telling me that's why he was arrested? Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Don't be ridiculous! He was the only one without an alibi. Apollo: Oh, is that so? Fulbright: Yup. Other than the victim, the suspect, and Ms. Tenma, the only others around were... ...Mr. Filch and Mayor Tenma's aide, and the two of them were together at the time. Apollo: (Filch... The guy who tried to steal my bracelet. Just living up to his name, I guess. We should go talk to him again when we have a chance.) What about Jinxie? She's not being suspected at all? Fulbright: She may have no alibi whatsoever... but she also has no motive. It's unfathomable that she would murder the alderman, and pin the crime on her father. Besides, do you really think a little girl could lift up this huge spear? Apollo: True enough. That spear looks even bigger than her. Present Attorney's Badge Apollo: Um, so this is my attorney's badge. Fulbright: No, no! Present it with more confidence and conviction! Like this... In justice we trust! Apollo: Okay, um, how's this... Apollo Justice, attorney at law! H-Here comes Justice! Fulbright: That was amazing! But you know what they say, practice makes perfect. Let's see you do it ten more times! Apollo: Okay, I'll try my best! Athena: Um, Apollo? What are you doing? Apollo: (Ack! How'd he talk me into this?!) Anything else Fulbright: Justice need backup sometimes, too! So I don't mind you asking for help, but you should start by thinking things over yourself. After all, the road to justice starts with your own first step! Ha ha ha! Apollo: If you don't have any information to offer, you could just say so. After clearing all Talk options: Fulbright: That's about all I can reveal at this time. Well? You must admit, Damian Tenma appears to be the most likely suspect. Apollo: (I admit it looks bad, but I'm still not buying it.) Fulbright: Oh, and one more thing... I must warn you about the prosecutor. Apollo: The prosecutor assigned to Mayor Tenma's trial? Fulbright: That's the one. He's -- how shall I put it -- not what you'd expect. That is unless you've faced a convicted killer serving hard time as a prosecutor before. Apollo: What the--?! Is this some kind of joke? Talk The prosecution Leads to: \"Can I ask why a man imprisoned for murder is serving as prosecutor?\" Apollo: Can I ask why a man imprisoned for murder is serving as prosecutor? Fulbright: Because he's mastered the use of psychology in courtroom battles. Everyone's talking about how this murder was the work of some strange creature. But yokai are nothing more than a figment of the imagination. They're baloney! Who better to prove that than a master of psychology? He's the best man for the job. Apollo: But he's a convicted murderer! No matter how you look at it, that's just insane! Fulbright: Well, the chief prosecutor personally assigned him, so... ...none of us are in a position to question the matter, ha ha ha! Apollo: (This really is the dark age of the law.) Athena: This prosecutor... He wouldn't happen to go by the name \"Blackquill,\" would he? Fulbright: Bingo! Simon Blackquill. So, you HAVE heard of him? Athena: ...You could say that. Apollo: (What's that supposed to mean?) Fulbright: Well, I bet you don't know his unofficial title. Ever heard of the \"Twisted Samurai\"? That's Prosecutor Blackquill! Apollo: The \"Twisted Samurai\"...? Is that because he's a criminal? Fulbright: Well... Yes and no. You could say it also has to do with the effect his crime had on things. Apollo: How so...? Fulbright: His conviction is what twisted and warped the legal world into this dark age of the law. Apollo: What?! And HE of all people is going to stand in court tomorrow?! Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Never fear! I myself will be there to protect you! Apollo: ......... (That's reassuring, I guess...) Fulbright: Well, you kids knock yourselves out! Can't wait to see how you do tomorrow! Athena: Wait, Detective Fulbright. I've been meaning to ask you something. Um... Why are you barefoot? This doesn't look like the sort of place where you need to take your shoes off... Fulbright: Hm? Ah! Ahhhhhh! I hadn't even noticed. Why AM I barefoot? Apollo: (You honestly hadn't noticed until just now?!) .........Wait a second. Those shoes we found earlier... Excuse me, Detective Fulbright. These wouldn't happen to be your shoes, would they? Fulbright: Yes! Yes they are! My favorite pair, in fact! Thank you for bringing them to me. You must truly be on the side of justice! Apollo: (Don't tell me Mr. Filch actually stole from a detective?) Athena: Stealing shoes right off of someone's feet... That's pretty amazing. Apollo: I find it more amazing that Detective Fulbright didn't notice. (Well, looks like we've gotten all we can out of the detective, so let's see... Maybe we should go have a word with Mr. Filch. I want to hear what his \"alibi\" is.) April 17Kyubi Manor - Foyer Filch: This is just awful! T-Terrible, I say! S-Somebody, help! Athena: Oh, look, it's mister-- what was it again? Finch? Filch: No, no, no! The name's Filch, Phineas Filch! Apollo: (Keep on pilfering and you may wind up a jail bird instead.) So what seems to be the problem, Mr. Filch? Filch: Oh, it's just terrible! Terrible, I tell ya! Come quick! Apollo: O-Okay...? (What's the deal with him all of a sudden?) Apollo: Looks like some kind of mask. Filch: I-It's The Amazing Nine-Tails's mask! Apollo: The Amazing Nine-Tails...? (Oh, right -- the wrestler who appeared during the festival's special event...) What's his mask doing here? Filch: He'd never take off his mask like this! Someone musta killed 'im! Apollo: Whaaa--?! Wh-Who would do such a thing? Athena: Let's go talk over there in private. Apollo: Hm? Look... There's some white hair caught up inside this mask... Amazing Nine-Tails Mask added to the Court Record. Apollo: So, what makes you believe that The Amazing Nine-Tails has been murdered? Filch: Ya really wanna know, eh? You're a studious one, ain't ya! Eh heh he! Apollo: Yes, I mean, no. Er, I mean, just tell me, please. Filch: Well, it's like this. I'd dreamed o' becoming a wrassler myself! Hey, how 'bout ya join me in the quest for the champion's belt?! Whadda team! Me in my bandit's mask and you in that demon mask of yours! Apollo: Demon mask? Heh heh. Wonder if I could make it big. Athena: Apollo, let's save your pro wrestling debut until after the trial. Apollo: Huh?! Oh, no no! I wasn't actually... (Argh! Why did I let him pull me off topic like that?!) Athena: Come on, Apollo -- ask him about The Amazing Nine-Tails's murder already! Talk The Amazing Nine-Tails Filch: The Amazing Nine-Tails is our village's savior, and don't ya forget it! His trademark's a gold cape made to look like nine fox tails! He whirls through the ring, smacking down Tenma Town wrestlers left 'n' right! He sparked the monster craze, revitalizing Nine-Tales [sic] Vale in the blink of an eye. Yep, saved our village from becoming a ghost town. Now it's a yokai town, eh heh heh. Apollo: Huh, The Amazing Nine-Tails really does sound, well... amazing. Filch: Yeah, pretty amazing, huh? That's why he's worshipped like a hero 'round here! I'm proud to be from the same village as him. Athena: Come to think of it, you look kind of monster-like yourself, Mr. Filch. Guess it makes sense since you're from the same village as The Amazing Nine-Tails! Filch: Eh heh heh... I know! A lot o' people have told me I look like a yokai. Apollo: (Since when was that a compliment?) Ouch! What's the big idea! Filch: Eh heh heh... Check your pocket. Apollo: Hey, how'd you do that?! Filch: Keep it. I got lots more. Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy added to the Court Record. Apollo: So, you keep saying that the Amazing Nine-Tails was killed. What's the story behind that? The Amazing Nine-Tails (subsequent times) Filch: The Amazing Nine-Tails is our village's savior, and don't ya forget it! His trademark's a gold cape made to look like nine fox tails! He whirls through the ring, smacking down Tenma Town wrestlers left 'n' right! He sparked the monster craze, revitalizing Nine-Tales [sic] Vale in the blink of an eye. Yep, saved our village from becoming a ghost town. Now it's a yokai town, eh heh heh. Apollo: Huh, The Amazing Nine-Tails really does sound, well... amazing. Filch: Yeah, pretty amazing, huh? That's why he's worshipped like a hero 'round here! I'm proud to be from the same village as him. Athena: Come to think of it, you look kind of monster-like yourself, Mr. Filch. Guess it makes sense since you're from the same village as The Amazing Nine-Tails! Filch: Eh heh heh... I know! A lot o' people have told me I look like a yokai. Apollo: (Since when was that a compliment?) Amazing Nine-Tails's Death (appears after \"The Amazing Nine-Tails\") Apollo: Are you saying he was murdered because his mask washed up along the river outside? Filch: That's only part o' it. The main reason is no one's seen 'im since the special event. The word 'round Nine-Tails Vale is he was killed by Tenma Taro. Apollo: You villagers really are superstitious, aren't you? Filch: That we are. We love conspiracy theories, too, like the mayor's diabolical plot. Apollo: The mayor? Of Tenma Town? What is he plotting? Filch: Rumor has it he's planning on releasing Tenma Taro. That's why he wants the merger. He'll open the Forbidden Chamber once he's in control. Apollo: That's quite a tale. Filch: Ain't finished yet! There was only one person who could stop the mayor. Our hero, The Amazing Nine-Tails! He vowed to battle the mayor of Tenma Town and stop the municipal merger! Apollo: ......... (I couldn't make this stuff up if I tried.) Athena: Apollo! We still have to ask him about the alderman's murder, remember? About the alderman's murder (appears after \"Amazing Nine-Tails's Death\") Apollo: Mr. Filch, would you mind telling us what you were doing at the time of the murder? Filch: I was in the caretaker's office guarding the entrance like Mr. Kyubi said I should. And I made double sure no one came in. I have a clear view of the foyer from where I work. Apollo: (He must be talking about this small room in the upper right. It definitely looks like you can keep track of the comings and goings from there.) And you have an alibi to back your statement up, Mr. Filch? Filch: Eh heh heh. I do, indeed! I was with Mayor Tenma's aide. Florent L'Belle's his name. Apollo: So, the two of you were together... That's a pretty sound alibi, all right. And nobody came in or out of the manor around the time of the murder? Filch: Kept watch here the whole time. Didn't see a soul pass by. And if anyone did, that there security camera woulda spotted 'em. Apollo: (So no one came in or out around the time of the murder... That means we're dealing with someone who was already inside when it happened.) So, do you think this mask is the real deal? Filch: Without a doubt. This here's the mask worn by The Amazing Nine-Tails. Apollo: What about that white hair I found inside the mask? Athena: Wait! I just thought of something! Remember the golden animal fur we found at the crime scene? Could it have come from this mask? Look! There's even a spot where some fur is missing. Apollo: Hmm... Then this places this mask at the crime scene at some point in time. Which means......... (What does this mean? Someone with white hair who is linked with the murder and is against the merger? No way...! Could The Amazing Nine-Tails and the alderman actually be...?!) Athena: Something wrong, Apollo? You should see the look on your face! Apollo: Oh, no, it's n-nothing. (Maybe Jinxie could tell us something, since she works here...) Golden Fur reattached to The Amazing Nine-Tails's mask. About the alderman's murder (subsequent times) Apollo: Mr. Filch, would you mind telling us what you were doing at the time of the murder? Filch: I was in the caretaker's office guarding the entrance like Mr. Kyubi said I should. And I made double sure no one came in. I have a clear view of the foyer from where I work. Apollo: (He must be talking about this small room in the upper right. It definitely looks like you can keep track of the comings and goings from there.) And you have an alibi to back your statement up, Mr. Filch? Filch: Eh heh heh. I do, indeed! I was with Mayor Tenma's aide. Florent L'Belle's his name. Apollo: So, the two of you were together... That's a pretty sound alibi, all right. And nobody came in or out of the manor around the time of the murder? Filch: Kept watch here the whole time. Didn't see a soul pass by. And if anyone did, that there security camera woulda spotted 'em. Apollo: (So no one came in or out around the time of the murder... That means we're dealing with someone who was already inside when it happened.) Present Amazing Nine-Tails's Mask Filch: Hey, that there's The Amazing Nine-Tails's mask! Yer aiming to sell it, aint ya?! Why you sneaky, lily-livered-- Apollo: No, I'm not trying to sell it. It could be a key piece of evidence. Filch: Aw, too bad. Thought I'd hook ya up with this buyer I know. Apollo: Wait, you WANT me to sell it?! Anything else Apollo: You mind if I ask you about this? Filch: Hm? Oh, that... Right, right... Apollo: Well, does it ring a bell? Filch: Eh heh heh heh... Oh, it's ringing, all right. Ya wanna thank me for all my hard work, and I humbly accept! Apollo: No, this isn't a gift! (Should've known this was a dead end.) Kyubi Manor Garden or Detention Center Talk Any ideas? Apollo: Come up with anything yet? Athena: Oh! O-Of course I have! But it's not quite ready for primetime. Apollo: Huh? Athena: The truth will only be revealed once we've dotted all our i's and crossed all our t's. In other words, it's still just a theory, so I don't think I should say anything yet. It's the dilemma any great detective must face! Widget: Whatever! Athena: Tsk! Widget! Apollo: (So basically, you have no ideas. Thanks for nothing.) About the murder Apollo: What are your thoughts on the case so far? Athena: Well... I think our killer is most likely highly intelligent and stone-cold cool. I mean, just look how they killed the alderman: one decisive thrust, no hesitation. Apollo: And you know this how? Psychology? Athena: That's right! I've profiled the killer based on the evidence we found at the scene! I can almost picture the killer in my mind... A terrifying face twisted from hatred toward the victim... Big, bulging eyes full of murderous intent... A horrible gash-like mouth from ear to ear... And... wings, black and sinister. Apollo: Wings? That sounds like Tenma Taro! Athena: On second thought, scratch psychology. That last part was just my imagination. Apollo: You think?! Present Amazing Nine-Tails's Mask Athena: So who do you think is the man behind The Amazing Nine-Tails mask? Apollo: Well, there was that white hair we found inside the mask. I have a feeling it's going to be a valuable clue. Athena: We should run a DNA test on it. Ooh! And what if the results show that the hair's not human? Don't you think it's fun to fantasize about stuff like that? Apollo: Sure, as long as you're prepared to have that fantasy shattered by the results, too. Athena: In that case, let's forget about the DNA testing! After clearing \"About the alderman's murder\" Talk option in Kyubi Manor - Foyer: April 17Nine-Tails Vale - Yokai Lane Apollo: Oh, look, there's Jinxie. Jinxie: Milk, cheese, yogurt, ice cream, and... Apollo: (Sounds like she's out grocery shopping. She must really like dairy products.) Jinxie: ...a charm to make a better milkshake and another to cure my lactose intolerance. Apollo: (Maybe she should just stick to soy milk.) Jinxie! Hey, it's me! Jinxie: Eek! It's th-th-the demon lawyer! Apollo: Ack! (Not another warding charm... *sigh*) Athena: Um, Apollo? Who is she? Apollo: Oh, right. This is your first time meeting each other. This is Jinxie, Mayor Tenma's daughter. She was the first to discover the crime scene. Athena: Oh, so she's the one who--! Um, hello. My name's Athena Cykes. I'll be helping Apollo defend your father at his trial. Pleased to meet you! Jinxie: P-Pleased to meet you, too. Uhh... Um, where's Trucy? Apollo: She went back to the office ahead of us. But don't worry. Athena and I are on the case! Jinxie: W-W-Wait, how do I know you didn't...! ...That you d-d-didn't gobble her up alive! Apollo: Relax, I didn't eat her up! And I wouldn't do such a thing in the first place! Jinxie: Oh, poor little Trucy! *sniffle* Apollo: (I'm about ready for some tears of frustration myself.) Athena: She's quite an, um, interesting character, huh, Apollo... Talk The incident Apollo: Jinxie, do you remember any more of what happened? Jinxie: Not much. ...At least not yet. Apollo: But you do think Tenma Taro was the killer, right? That yokai we saw at the festival? Jinxie: I don't know anything about that! Apollo: Huh? But you said Tenma Taro murdered the alderman. ...It's okay, Jinxie. You can tell me-- Yikes! What was that for?! Jinxie: People see things when they don't get enough sleep. There's no such thing as monsters. Apollo: Huh?! (What's gotten into her?) So, if there are no monsters, you admit I'm human? Jinxie: No, you're still a demon! Apollo: ............ Oh, I give up. Athena: It seems like Jinxie doesn't want to talk about Tenma Taro for some reason. Apollo: But that's precisely what we need to know more about... Besides, she definitely thought there was a yokai there in the Fox Chamber. Jinxie, about this charm... Jinxie: Ah! That's...! Apollo: You gave me this when I was heading off to the scene of the crime. You thought Tenma Taro was the murderer. That's why you gave this to me, right? Jinxie: Errr... That's true, but... Apollo: If there's anything else you could tell us, it would really help. And it will help your father, too! Jinxie: Umm... All right, then. Tenma Taro did it? (appears after \"The incident\") Apollo: Why do you think Tenma Taro's the killer? Jinxie: I saw him. Saw him with my own eyes. Tenma Taro was right there in the manor! He escaped his prison... ...and ran right by me! Athena: Whaaaaaat?! Apollo: Jinxie, tell us everything you saw! Jinxie: I called the police after I stumbled on the scene. I was just about to head back to the festival grounds when... ...I saw Tenma Taro. It was right around here. He was running right at me! I was... I was paralyzed with fear. But there was no one around to help me. *shiver* The foul beast raced right by me toward the foyer. Apollo: Toward the foyer? Athena: Mr. Filch and Mr. L'Belle were supposedly in the foyer at the time. That means they would've seen Tenma Taro, too. Apollo: Sounds like we'd better get their statements. (Considering Jinxie's mental state, her eyes could've been playing tricks on her.) Athena: Um... Apollo? Remember the picture in this paper? Someone caught Tenma Taro flying through the air. I wonder if it's the same Tenma Taro Jinxie says she saw. Apollo: ...Don't be ridiculous! Jinxie: *shiver* Tenma Taro IS the killer. And he can fly, too. The Amazing Nine-Tails Apollo: (Jinxie works at the alderman's manor, so maybe she can shed some light on this.) So, no one knows The Amazing Nine-Tails's true identity? Jinxie: Uh-huh. They say no one's ever seen him without his mask. Apollo: Doesn't that make you want to know even more? Jinxie: Uh-huh. That's why matches where wrestlers try to expose their opponent are so popular. Apollo: Wait... you mean expose, as in strip them naked? Jinxie: Eek! You even think like a demon! ...The only thing the winner removes is the loser's mask. To have your mask torn off is the worst humiliation a wrestler could suffer! That's why their masks are more important to them than life itself. So you see, these unmasking matches are life and death battles for the wrestlers. Apollo: (That means this mask didn't just happen to wash up along the riverbank. There's got to be a story behind it.) Jinxie: No one can stop The Amazing Nine-Tails! Apollo: (Bet she'd be shocked to find out he's really the alderman.) The Tenma Taro you saw (appears after \"Tenma Taro did it?\") Apollo: About the yokai you saw at the scene of the crime... Anything else stand out? Jinxie: Actually, I heard this strange jangly sound. Athena: A jangly sound? Can you be a little more specific? Jinxie: My memory's kind of fuzzy... But I vaguely recall seeing Tenma Taro holding a staff or something like that. Maybe that's what was making the strange sound. Apollo: Does Tenma Taro usually carry a staff? Jinxie: Good question. I've never heard anything like that and it's not shown on the scroll. Apollo: How about in other documents? Any of them show Tenma Taro with a staff? Jinxie: This is the only known document depicting Tenma Taro. After all, those who needlessly depict the demon are forever cursed. (Changed from [After all, those who needless [sic] depict the demon are forever cursed.] in the original release) Apollo: Then what's the deal with the Tenma Taro you saw, Jinxie? Yokai Legend Scroll updated in the Court Record. Jinxie's Statement added to the Court Record. The Tenma Taro you saw (subsequent times) Apollo: About the yokai you saw at the scene of the crime... Anything else stand out? Jinxie: Actually, I heard this strange jangly sound. Athena: A jangly sound? Can you be a little more specific? Jinxie: My memory's kind of fuzzy... But I vaguely recall seeing Tenma Taro holding a staff or something like that. Maybe that's what was making the strange sound. Apollo: Does Tenma Taro usually carry a staff? Jinxie: Good question.

Jinxie: This is the only known document depicting Tenma Taro. After all, those who needlessly depict the demon are forever cursed. (Changed from [After all, those who needless [sic] depict the demon are forever cursed.] in the original release) Apollo: Then what's the deal with the Tenma Taro you saw, Jinxie? Present Nine-Tails Flower Jinxie: The Nine-Tailed Fox is famous for imprisoning Tenma Taro, but legends say that he also... ...gave us the Nine-Tails Flower, and that he still watches over the village to this day. Apollo: Wow, coming here is like traveling to ancient Japan with all the strange beliefs and all. All those yokai, the Nine-Tails Flower, the Forbidden Chamber, and the list goes on. Jinxie: Uh-huh. It was like I should've been born here. Too bad the population is shrinking. But there's an effort underway to protect the yokai. It also helps the local economy. Apollo: Protect the yokai? You mean like endangered species? Jinxie: Uh-huh. There're even plans to create a yokai wildlife park in the near future. Apollo: Now I'm really starting to wonder about this place. Crime Photo Apollo: Jinxie, I wanted to show you this-- Athena: Wait, Apollo! You can't show that to her. Having her father arrested was bad enough. Jinxie: Huh? Did you say something? Apollo: (Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.) Oh, um, never mind. Amazing Nine-Tails's Mask Apollo: (Wait, Jinxie's a huge fan of The Amazing Nine-Tails. She'd probably freak out if I showed her this mask without the guy in it.) Athena: What are you thinking?! It would crush her if she figured out her favorite wrestler is dead. Apollo: Guess I'll spare her the grief, although she really could use a reality check. Jinxie: ? Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy Jinxie: Ah! Th-Th-That's The Amazing Nine-Tails! He... he lives in the mountains right outside the village. But he often comes to visit. Apollo: Really? He doesn't sound very secret or reclusive to me. Jinxie: No, he's not. In fact, he visits the village bathhouse all the time. Athena: No way! The Amazing Nine-Tails goes to public bathhouses?! Jinxie: Uh-huh. But like a true wrestling legend, he never takes his mask off. Apollo: He takes baths in his mask? Jinxie: Uh-huh. And he also has a towel that says, \"Wrestlers Wanted!\" Apollo: If I saw a naked guy in a mask and a message like that on his towel, I'd run the other way. Jinxie's Statement Jinxie: I saw... him... Tenma Taro. It nearly scared me to death. Athena: Do you see a lot of monsters, Jinxie? Jinxie: Uh-huh. *shivers* In fact, I encountered the Sunekosuri this morning. *shivers* Apollo: Sune... kosuri? You know, I don't know that one. Tell me about it. Jinxie: It's a mean little beast that trips you by bumping into your shins. I keep tripping all the time because of that pesky little thing! When it gets really bad, I stick Sunekosuri warding charms on my shins! Apollo: Um, how about investing in some shin guards, and watching your step instead? Anything else Jinxie: What's this? A Tsukumogami? Apollo: Tsukumo... gami? Jinxie: A yokai that inhabits objects that have been used for a really long time. The Red Demon and a Tsukumogami... What a strange combination. Apollo: (Is everything to her some supernatural phenomenon?) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: Why didn't you tell me you saw Tenma Taro earlier? Jinxie: Actually... Mr. L'Belle told me not to tell. Apollo: Mr. L'Belle? Jinxie: Papa's aide. Apollo: (Oh, right. The other guy who was supposedly in the foyer at the time of the crime.) And what exactly did he tell you? Jinxie: \"Keep the village superstitions in mind... ...before you go talking about seeing Tenma Taro at the time of the crime.\" Apollo: Village superstitions? Jinxie: They say you must not gaze upon Tenma Taro. But in the event that you do look... ...and then tell anyone what you saw, Tenma Taro will claim your soul. Apollo: And that's something everyone here knows? (Sounds like a bunch of baloney to me.) Jinxie: Uh-huh. Everyone from babies to the village elders know about it. But I didn't because I'm not from around here. Apollo: Hey, come to think of it... Apollo: (Huh? Why's everyone hiding their faces?) Villager: Hey, you there! You mustn't stare at Tenma Taro like that! Lower your eyes! He'll steal your soul if you're not careful! Apollo: Huh? (Steal my soul? Seriously?) Apollo: (The guy at the special event thing said almost the exact same thing.) Athena: Apollo, do you think this L'Belle guy actually believes in Tenma Taro? Apollo: I seriously doubt it. He's not even from Nine-Tails Vale. Athena: Then why would he try to keep Jinxie from talking? Apollo: Good question. I think we'd better go have a word with him. Athena: Time to unmask this monster of a mystery. Jinxie: The last time I saw Mr. L'Belle, he was relaxing in the foyer. Athena: Bueno! Next stop, the manor foyer! With any luck, he'll be there waiting for us! April 17Kyubi Manor - Foyer Athena: There's no one here. Guess our luck isn't so good when it comes to Mr. L'Belle. Apollo: Maybe he's out for a walk or something. (Hmm? Somebody left something on the sill of the caretaker's office window.) Oh, it's a TV program guide. Athena: Looks like someone circled a pro wrestling match. Filch: Hey, whaddya think you're doing! Athena: Eek! I-I-It's a...! Oh, Mr. Filch! Wh-What can we do for you? Apollo: (I bet she was going to scream, \"Monster!\" which really isn't much of a stretch...) Filch: Ain't nothing I need you to do for me. But what business do ya got with my TV listings? Apollo: Oh, no, it just caught my eye. Can I ask if you watched this pro wrestling program today? Filch: Yep, 'twas a match between a couple o' rank amateurs, though. It was a complete disaster. I reckon even I coulda done better than that. Apollo: (I seriously doubt that.) TV Listings added to the Court Record. Apollo: (Almost forgot. There's something I wanted to ask him.) Mr. Filch, did you see anything unusual around the time of the murder? For example, Tenma Taro or something like that? Filch: Huh?! T-Tenma Taro?! Apollo: So you did see him? Filch: Errr... My, how clean and shiny your forehead is again today, Mr. Lawyer, sir! Bet ya shine it up every day real purty like. The ladies must love it, eh heh heh. Apollo: Don't change the subject! And FYI, that was a seriously bad attempt at flattery. Jinxie said she saw Tenma Taro flee toward the foyer. So you must've seen him too if you were here! Filch: Yi-Yi-Yiiiiiiiiipes! Apollo: (Wow, I really pushed a button there!) Well, did you see anything or not? ???: ???: That is quite enough. I must ask that you not pester my friend anymore. Filch: Yipes! Forgive me for being pestered, sir! Apollo: And you are? ???: I am Florent L'Belle... L'Belle: ...beau divine and PERSONAL aide to Mayor Damian Tenma. Apollo: (Beau divine? More like yokai grotesque. This place is crawling with monsters.) L'Belle: OH! Excuse YOU! Apollo: Ack! Wh-What the heck was that for?! L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! It was just a little cologne. You had a look of stinky sweat about you. It's from my OWN original brand of cosmetics called \"Je suis L'Belle!\" *sniff sniff sniff* Oh, what a heavenly scent. Apollo: Ugh. I think you just paralyzed my olfactory receptors. L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! I suppose such a scent WOULD be difficult for a peasant to appreciate. I'll have you know, THAT is Brand No. 5 \"Bonjour.\" It's MY way of introducing myself. Enjoy! Apollo: (Where's my bottle of \"Adieu\" so I can return the favor?) Enough about the cologne. Please tell us what you saw around the time of the murder. Talk Keeping Jinxie quiet Apollo: I heard you're the one who told Jinxie not to mention that she saw Tenma Taro. L'Belle: Why that little--! So, she told you she saw the demon, did she? Athena: Mr. L'Belle, do you mind if I ask whether you believe in the village superstitions? (Changed from [Mr. L'Belle, do mind [sic] if I ask whether you believe in the village superstitions?] in the original release) L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Oh, PU-LEASE! I was merely trying to keep with traditions. Nevertheless, I will say this... I wouldn't stick MY nose into this whole Tenma Taro business if I were you. Bad things happen to those who do. THAT much is true. He is one... scary... monster. Apollo: That's crazy! You really expect me to believe that monsters are real? L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Well, YOU'RE real, and YOU sure look like a monster. Apollo: (Look who's talking!) So, Mr. L'Belle, you didn't see Tenma Taro? Aaah! L'Belle: Little Jinxie has an ACTIVE imagination. Isn't that right, Phineas? Filch: That's right. I didn't see nothing, especially not Tenma Taro! L'Belle: As for ME, I only see things of beauty. That's why I can barely see you. ...Pwh! Ah ha ha ha! Apollo: (I've got two words for this guy: total freak.) Your alibi Apollo: Could I ask you what you were doing at the time of the crime? L'Belle: In other words, you'd like to hear MY alibi. Tsk, to think you'd suspect ME of all people! Apollo: Oh, no, it's just a formality. We ask everyone the same questions. Aaah! L'Belle: How DARE you doubt me! That's an affront to beauty itself! You OBVIOUSLY can't see straight! Apollo: Urnngh... Like that spritz really helped...! L'Belle: What were WE doing, you ask? Go ahead, Filchy, answer the question. Filch: Errr... At the time of the crime, we were... um... uh... in this here foyer! L'Belle: Exactly! Good answer, Filchy, good answer! Filch: Eh heh he. Just repeating whatcha told-- Youch! L'Belle: You've said QUITE enough! Apollo: (.........What is WITH these two? Great, now he's got me talking like that.) Present Tenma Taro Warding Charm L'Belle: Yes? That's a warding charm, but why are YOU showing it to ME? Apollo: ............ (Guess it doesn't work on all monsters.) Yurk! L'Belle: Shame on you, thinking THAT would work on ME! Apollo: Blech! L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! You should be honored to be bathed in my beautiful scent, peasant! Apollo: Ack... (Now I really wish it would work.) Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy L'Belle: Pffft, The Amazing Nine-Tails? What's so AMAZING about HIM? I mean, MY glossies are selling WAY better than his. Apollo: You sell glossies of yourself? L'Belle: That's right. I have one for all seven of my hair colors! Apollo: ............ (Well, guess that's it. Civilization over.) L'Belle: Tsk, if you WANT one, you need simply ask. I'll even let you choose the color yourself. Apollo: No, thank you! Anything else L'Belle: Yes? Do you ALWAYS go around sticking your hand in OTHER people's faces? Apollo: Oh, no, I just wanted to show you this. L'Belle: Ah, yes, you DO have something in that grimy paw of yours. But I only have eyes for things of beauty. Now, if you would excuse me. Apollo: (Guess he'll only look at stuff that interests him.) After clearing all Talk options: L'Belle: Are we quite through here? I'm a VERY busy man, you know. Apollo: ...Right. Well, thanks for your help. (So, these two were in the foyer, but didn't see Tenma Taro.) L'Belle: Come along, Filchy. Filch: Where we goin'? Oh, right! Gotta practice them statements for tomorrow! ...Yipes! My eyyyes! L'Belle: You're going to dig your own grave with that big mouth of yours someday! Apollo: ......... (What does he mean, \"practice statements\"?) L'Belle: Now if you would excuse me, it's time to touch up my makeup. (Changed from [Now if would [sic] excuse me. It's time to touch up my makeup.] in the original release) Athena: Apollo, I know this sounds strange... ...but Mr. L'Belle seems unusually preoccupied with Tenma Taro. Apollo: Really? How can you tell? Athena: Well, it's kind of hard to explain. You see, I can read people's emotions from the tone of their voice. Apollo: You mean you have good ears? Athena: Something like that. People's emotions are expressed in the tone of their voice. And my ears can pick up even the subtlest of tones for some reason. Apollo: That's an interesting skill... But what do you mean he's preoccupied with Tenma Taro? Athena: I'm not exactly sure, but it was like he was... obsessed with the thought of Tenma Taro... That's what I picked up from his voice, anyway. Apollo: Everywhere we turn it's Tenma Taro this, Tenma Taro that. Hmm... Athena: We should go talk to the mayor, too. Apollo: Sounds like a plan. (We need to get to the bottom of that rumor about him wanting to release Tenma Taro.) April 17Detention Center - Visitor's Room Athena: Something wrong, Apollo? Where did your enthusiasm go? Apollo: (What am I doing asking the mayor if he has ever thought about releasing Tenma Taro?! At best, he'll think I'm an idiot. At worst... *shudder*) Athena: Oh, he's here! Tenma: ......... Athena: It's so nice to finally meet you! I'm Mr. Justice's partner, Athena Cykes! I'm looking forward to working with you, Mr. Tenma... Taro! Tenma: Hm?! ...Oh, yes. I look forward to working with you, too. Apollo: (Eek! Glad he didn't mind Athena calling him by a completely wrong name!) Athena: Apollo, he's just as kind and gentle-looking as I'd imagined! Apollo: (Lucky for you, after that blunder you just made...) Um, there was something I wanted to talk to you about. There are rumors going around about how you want to or did set Tenma Taro free. Tenma: What utter nonsense! Apollo: Yikes! Tenma: They always assume the worst of me because of the way I look! But those rumors don't have a shred of truth, I tell you! Athena: A little touchy about his appearance, isn't he? Apollo: (What he really needs to work on are his people skills...) Talk Tenma Taro's revival Apollo: Um... So rumor has it that you want to push the merger through... ...in order to release Tenma Taro. Of course, that's a bunch of baloney, isn't it? Tenma: Grrrrrr! Apollo: Ack! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry if I offended you! Tenma: So, that's the talk around town, is it?! Apollo: I can see how that would make you angry. Tenma: .........What if Jinxie's schoolmates start teasing her about this? Apollo: Huh? Tenma: I must break out of here at once! Her tormentors must be taught a lesson! Apollo: No, wait! First, we have to get you a not-guilty verdict. Tenma: Don't try to stop me! This is about a father's duty to his darling daughter. Hold tight, sweet Jinxie! Daddy's coming to save you! Apollo: Relax! We'll look out for your daughter until we can get you free. Tenma: Hrmmm... Is that so? You don't need me to... go straighten things out myself? Apollo: (Whoo boy... They'd probably call in the SWAT team if he showed up at her school. Oh, right. I ought to ask about the reason behind the merger.) Why the merger? (appears after \"Tenma Taro's revival\") Apollo: It seems like you were rather forceful in pushing for the municipal merger. Did you really want Nine-Tails Vale that badly? Tenma: Yes, well, it's quite an attractive prize in terms of tourism. BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: (Wait... Am I feeling what I think I'm feeling?) Tenma: Sure, I played a bit of hardball, but only when I deemed it necessary. Apollo: (I knew it. My bracelet's reacting!) Athena: What is it, Apollo? Apollo: Mayor Tenma may not be telling the whole truth. Athena: Really? How can you tell? Apollo: People invariably tense up when they lie. That's where my bracelet here comes in. I can sense when the person I'm talking to is feeling tense... ...because it begins to feel tight on my arm. Athena: Noooooo waaaaaay! You can do that?! Apollo: Wait, so you believe me? Just like that? Athena: Sure. Each of us has our own special gifts. Apollo: (Oh yeah. Athena has a gift, too: her special sense of hearing...) Athena: Still, what do you think the mayor's lying about? Apollo: I don't know, but it's our job to find out. (It's been a while since my bracelet last reacted like this. Let's see if I still remember how to do this... First I touch my bracelet ([X / Y / R])... Right! Now let's give it a whirl!) Present Bracelet Yes, I remember this feeling of intense concentration! The ability to see the smallest twitch, the slightest frown that no one else can see... Now, Mayor Tenma was lying somewhere in that statement he just made. And when he lied, a certain \"habit\" made itself clear just under his right eye. I just have to shift my viewpoint up and focus on that area! Pan to right eyelid Leads to: \"All right, I've got him now.\" Apollo: All right, I've got him now. His nervous tell should appear when he's trying to pull the wool over my eyes. (Changed from [His tic should appear when he's trying to pull the wool over my eyes.] in the original release) I've gotta pore over every word he says, and wait for it to appear. (Changed from [I've gotta pour [sic] over every word he says, and wait for his tic to appear.] in the original release) And when it does, I'll \"Perceive\" ([X / Y / R]) it! Tenma: Yes, well, it's quite an attractive prize in terms of tourism. Perceive right eyelid on \"in terms of tourism.\" Apollo: Leads to: \"Mr. Mayor, please, you can trust us with the truth.\" Perceive wrong area Apollo: Apollo: Something is upsetting you right now... Is that not correct?! I know because of that telltale habit of yours. Tenma: ......... Apollo: .........Well? Ack! Tenma: ......... I get that often. Am I really that strange? Apollo: Oh, no, no. Th-That's not what I meant. I didn't mean to imply there was anything wrong with you! Athena: Well done, Apollo. Now both of you are upset! Apollo: (Argh, let's try that again.) Leads back to presenting bracelet Apollo: Mr. Mayor, please, you can trust us with the truth. Tenma: The truth? I don't understand. Apollo: When you mentioned tourism... ...the bottom of your right eye started twitching. Tenma: What nonsense is this?! So what if it did?! Apollo: Please, tell us more about your merger bid. Tenma: What more is there to tell? Apollo: Why were you really seeking to merge with Nine-Tails Vale? Tenma: I already told you: tourism. The monster craze really revitalized the village, making it quite the prize. Apollo: You really don't trust us, do you? Tenma: What are you talking about? The village has been hot property ever since the monster craze started, has it not? Apollo: I think you've yet to realize that what you're saying contradicts the facts. You say that the monster craze really revitalized Nine-Tails Vale, so... ...you felt it would be an attractive prize for its tourism. But that would contradict this. Present Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy Apollo: Leads to: \"The monster craze in Nine-Tails Vale is a very recent phenomenon.\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: This evidence proves you're not being entirely truthful with us. Aaaack! S-Sorry, sorry! I take it all back! Tenma: ...Oh, forgive me. There was a fly that was driving me crazy. Apollo: If that's how he deals with flies, I'd hate to see him when he's really angry. Tenma: So, you think I'm not being entirely truthful? Apollo: Y-Yes... yes, sir. (This guy is seriously scary!) Leads back to: \"I think you've yet to realize that what you're saying contradicts the facts.\" Apollo: The monster craze in Nine-Tails Vale is a very recent phenomenon. It was sparked when The Amazing Nine-Tails rose up against the municipal merger. The village was practically a ghost town before then. Tenma: Argh! Apollo: So, you see, you couldn't have possibly seen it as an attractive prize for its tourism. What's the REAL reason behind your push to merge Tenma Town with Nine-Tails Vale, huh? Tenma: W-Well, umm... uhh... Ah... Ah... Arrrrrrrrrgh! Why the merger? (after perceiving) Apollo: Are you ready to tell me the truth now? Tenma: Honesly, I never wanted to pursue the merger in the first place. But I had no choice if I wanted to protect my darling little Jinxie. Apollo: Protect her from what? Tenma: I received a threat. It said either I go through with the merger or my Jinxie dies. Apollo: What?! Athena: How awful! Who would do such a thing? Tenma: I don't know. But whoever blackmailed me must be connected to the murder. Apollo: Wait, so you think the blackmailer and the killer could be one and the same? Tenma: Alderman Kyubi was immensely popular, so you have to ask, who would want him dead? The blackmailer who wanted the merger at all costs had all the motive in the world. Athena: But why go from blackmail to murder?! The merger protests won't disappear just because the alderman was killed. Apollo: Ah! (Could it be...!) What if there was another reason for the murder? Athena: Like what? Apollo: Maybe the blackmailer discovered Alderman Kyubi's secret identity! And his secret identity was a threat to the blackmailer's merger scheme! Athena: What do secret identities have to do with anything, Apollo? Apollo: (I have evidence revealing the alderman's secret identity. Maybe it's time to use it.) Present Crime Photo Apollo: Um... this is a photo of the crime scene. You didn't happen to see a yokai there, did you? Tenma: ...What in the world are you talking about? Apollo: Oh, no, I'm not saying I believe in monsters or anything, aha ha ha. Tenma: ......... Apollo: I-I'm sorry! Tenma: ............... Hrmm... Apollo: Heh heh... (Please, somebody let me out of here!) Ummm... so did you see one? You know, like, I don't know, Tenma Taro or... Never mind, just forget it, heh heh! Tenma: ............Huh... Huh huh... Huh. Apollo: (Is he laughing at me, with me, or even laughing at all? It's kinda hard to tell.) Amazing Nine-Tails Mask (after clearing \"Why the merger?\" Talk option after perceiving) Leads to: \"Mayor Tenma, please take a look at this if you would.\" Apollo: Mayor Tenma, please take a look at this if you would. Tenma: That's...! That's The Amazing Nine-Tails's mask! What is the meaning of this?! Apollo: This mask was almost definitely at the crime scene. And there was some white hair inside. Tenma: White hair... you say? Apollo: There was but one person with white hair in the manor that day. Tenma: Wha... What are you saying!? Apollo: You know which man I'm talking about, right? I'm talking about Rex Kyubi -- The Amazing Nine-Tails himself! Athena: No way! Tenma: The alderman was--! Impossible! Athena: Wait! Come to think of it, Alderman Kyubi WAS a former pro wrestler! So the blackmailer turned killer when he discovered the alderman's secret identity! Apollo: Um, didn't I just say that? But yeah, The Amazing Nine-Tails was a threat to the blackmailer's scheme. He opposed the merger and as a result, single-handedly sparked the monster craze. Athena: Even so, what was the mask doing at the crime scene? Apollo: There had been an event at the manor... ...and maybe Alderman Kyubi had taken part in it... if you get my drift. Tenma: This is absurd! Apollo: Mr. Mayor, do you have proof of the threat that was made against you? Tenma: Yes, a blackmail letter. Unfortunately, it disappeared after the murder. I'd been carrying it around in my briefcase but now, it's suddenly vanished. Apollo: The blackmailer must've taken it with them after they killed the alderman. (Well, at least we've clearly established the killer's motive.) (Was not an inner monologue in the original release) Guard: Mayor Tenma, visiting hours are over. Tenma: It would appear this meeting is adjourned. Athena: .........Apollo, do you really think the Tenma Taro that Jinxie saw is the killer? Apollo: I don't know. All I know is there is no such thing as monsters. Athena: What about that newspaper article? Could the killer have purposely freed Tenma Taro to do their dirty work? Apollo: Oh, come on! There wasn't any Tenma Taro to release in the first place! Athena: Yes, but the only suspects the police have right now are the mayor and a yokai. Apollo: (We'll probably be arguing whether there was a yokai involved in court tomorrow.) *sigh* I can already see that look of disbelief on the judge's face. Athena: Apollo? Are you all right? Apollo: I'm fine! I'm fine! I'll, um... I'll think of something! (I'd better because I can't very well say a flying demon was the killer. At this point, the only thing I know for sure is tomorrow is going to be one doozy of a trial.) To be continued (Changed from [To Be Continued] in the original release) Nothing to examine during investigation Apollo: Nothing of particular interest here. Area already examined Apollo: (We've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around.) The Monstrous Turnabout Image Gallery Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 April 18, 9:15 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Apollo: You okay, Athena? You've been really antsy ever since we got here. Athena: I-I'm just excited. This IS my first real court case after all! Apollo: (Yeaaah, a real ball of excitement she is... I know just what she needs.) ATHENA!!! Athena: Eek! Didn't you ever learn about indoor and outdoor voices? Apollo: I'm just trying to show you the best way to relieve your pre-trial jitters. Athena: By scaring the daylights out of me? Apollo: No, I find that shouting \"I'm fine!\" in a loud voice really relieves stress. It's part of my \"Chords of Steel\" voice workout, and a must before every trial. Athena: Y-You want me to shout? Here? Apollo: That's right. Here, I'll go first, then you try. I'm Apollo Justice and I'm fine!!! Athena: All right, um... I-I'm Athena Cykes... ...and I'm fine!!! ............Hmm... I think that actually worked! Apollo: I thought it might help. Always works for me. An old friend of mine from junior high and I say it all the time. Athena: I see... A proven remedy to calm the soul. I like it! Hey, how about we finish off with... ...a race around the courthouse! Apollo: The point is to relieve stress, not get totally exhausted! Phoenix: What's with all the racket, you two? Apollo: Ah, Mr. Wright. Heh heh, just a little voice workout. Hey, what's with the suit? Phoenix: Oh, this? I was thinking about getting my attorney's badge back, that's all. Apollo: That's all?! That's huge news! ...But why now? Phoenix: I have a feeling I'll be needed in the courtroom again sometime soon. But we can talk about that another time. Apollo: (No fair. Inquiring minds want to know. But wow... I'm so used to him in his usual laid-back clothes... That suit makes him look like a million dollars.) Phoenix: By the way, have you heard about the prosecutor assigned to this case? Apollo: Yeah, he's serving time, but before that, he was a prosecutor. He also uses psychology...? Phoenix: That's right. I've heard the rumors about how he was back before his conviction. Using the power of suggestion, he could make even the most stalwart defendants confess. Apollo: (Psychology in the courtroom. Been hearing a lot about that lately.) So, he must be a pretty scary guy, considering he's a prison inmate and all. Phoenix: So they say. They also say he'll cut you down if you talk too much. Apollo: Ack! I knew he was gonna be bad news! Phoenix: Ha ha ha, it's probably just hyperbole, at least I hope for your sake. Apollo: Wait, so is it true or not? Phoenix: Let's just say you should be concise and choose your words carefully. ...If you'd like to keep that head of yours attached to the rest of your body, that is. Apollo: Yikes! (Better tone down my Chords of Steel, too.) Phoenix: So, are you all ready? It might be a good idea to check the Court Record again before stepping into the ring. Apollo: ...Right, Mr. Wright! B-But I'm fine! Phoenix: I'll be watching from the gallery. Good luck! Apollo: Thanks! Athena: Okay, let's do this! Apollo: (The odds of pulling this off are ridiculously low, but that's nothing new. Believe in our client. Seek the truth. That's all we can do. Hang in there, Mayor Tenma, here comes Justice!) April 18, 9:30 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 4 Day 1Court Is Now In SessionAll Rise Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Damian Tenma. Apollo: Apollo Justice, defense team leader, is ready, Your Honor! Judge: I'd know that big, booming voice anywhere. As chipper as ever, eh, Mr. Justice? But who is the young lady next to you? Athena: I'm Athena Cykes, Mr. Justice's junior partner, and fresh out of law school! Judge: Well, now, full of beans, too, eh? Excellent! Makes an old man feel young again. Now for the prosecution. Hmm... It appears the prosecution is not ready yet. Fulbright: Never fear, for I shall explain! It's just a minor procedural complication, Your Honor. The prosecutor for this case is being escorted from prison as we speak. Judge: Prison? Oh, yes, of course. I almost forgot that he is currently serving time. Anime cutscene Officer: Yup, Prosecutor Blackquill's an inmate! But even a convicted murderer's still got a job to do and duties to perform. ???: ......... Apollo: Um... who's that with his back to us over there? Athena: That's him. I'm sure of it. ...Prosecutor Blackquill. Judge: *ahem* Is the prosecution ready? Blackquill: ...............Hmph. ......Enough jabbering. Get on with it already. Judge: Aah! Of course, forgive me! Apollo: (Urngh! Why are all the people related to this case so scary?!) Judge: Very well, Prosecutor Blackquill. Your opening statement if you please. Aah! Wh-What's the matter?! Blackquill: ......Must we continue to fritter away time like this? It is all right there in the indictment. An opening statement... would be pointless. Judge: Pointless? Oh, um... well... Apollo: Looks like the cat -- or in this case, the prosecutor -- has the judge's tongue. Judge: But, but... we need an opening statement as an overview of the case at hand. Blackquill: Hmph. Well, then, Your Baldness, if it's so very important, why don't you do the honors? Judge: Who?! Me?! Blackquill: There's a term for people who whine and fuss about how they need silly, useless things... ...and then decide they no longer want them once it's theirs: a selfish old fool. Judge: Huh?! Athena: Wait, was that the prosecution's opening statement? Blackquill: Hmph. Old dotards such as you are a plague upon the young. I pity your poor grandchildren, or is it great grandchildren? Judge: ! All these years, I thought the opening statement was the prosecutor's job... ...but I suppose I could give it a try. Might be a nice change of pace. (Changed from [...but I suppose I could give it try. [sic] Might be a nice change of pace.] in the original release) Apollo: What?! (He actually fell for that?!) Athena: That must've been the power of suggestion Mr. Wright was talking about. Judge: *ahem* The opening statement, huh... Hmm... Let's see here... The victim was one Rex Kyubi, alderman of Nine-Tails Vale. And the defendant, Damian Tenma, mayor of Tenma Town, is accused of his murder. Blackquill: ...And why, pray tell, was the mayor arrested? Judge: His prints were on the murder weapon. Plus, he had a motive: the elimination of the biggest roadblock to the municipal merger. The caretaker and the secretary, other potential suspects, both have alibis. And his daughter, who was also in the vicinity at the time of the incident, has no motive. Blackquill: So, in a nutshell...? Judge: I'd have to say the charges against the defendant are incontrovertible. Blackquill: Bravo, Your Baldness. Your years of experience shine bright like your head. Judge: Ho ho ho. Flattery will get you everywhere. Athena: He's playing Simon Says with the judge! Judge: Moving right along now, let's hear from our first witness for today, Detective Fulbright. Judge: Witness, please state your name and occupation. Fulbright: I am the detective assigned to this case, Bobby Fulbright! Oh, and I'll also be keeping tabs on old Blackquill here. Judge: I also heard you would provide protection if it ever came to that. Blackquill: ............Hmph. It would seem that I have been sorely underestimated. Apollo: (Wait, who's protecting who from what?) Fulbright: Still, I truly believe anyone can turn their life around, even ol' Blackquill here. Blackquill: Fool Bright! Save your platitudes for funerals. Get on with your statement. Fulbright: Ha ha ha! That's the spirit! Justice must be swift and true. I see it in your eyes! There IS hope for your rehabilitation and return to society! I will never give up on you! Athena: Prosecutor Blackquill doesn't seem to intimidate Detective Fulbright. Apollo: Well, you know what they say: ignorance is bliss. Athena: Oh, so that's why Detective Fulbright was assigned to Blackquill. He's so oblivious! Judge: Now, let's have your first statement, Detective Fulbright. Fulbright: You got it! But first, I'd like to say to the defense that justice will ultimately prevail! Witness Testimony -- About the Murder -- Fulbright: Alderman Kyubi was murdered with a spear that had been on the wall. The fingerprints of the defendant, Damian Tenma, were found on the murder weapon. At the time, Alderman Kyubi was asleep from a drug he unwittingly ingested. Mayor Tenma attacked his helpless victim, impaling him like a human shish kebob! But the sudden pain jolted the victim awake, and he grabbed a statue and struck back! Apollo: Alderman Kyubi had been slipped some kind of sleep-inducing drug? Fulbright: That's right. The accused was scared because the alderman was a former pro wrestler. So he slipped him a drug to make sure he'd be out cold and defenseless! Here's the autopsy report to prove it! Kyubi's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Judge: And the victim managed to attack his attacker, despite being impaled by a spear?! That sounds almost superhuman. Is it even possible? Fulbright: Well, he WAS a former pro wrestler, after all! That spear was probably nothing more than a mosquito bite to him! Apollo: Apollo: Not so fast! Don't try to brush it all off by saying the alderman had been a pro wrestler. Do you really expect us to believe he could fight back after being skewered by a spear? Blackquill: Hmph. Never heard of the incredible feats of which man is capable of in a pinch, have you? Like the samurai of yore, wrestlers can battle through intense pain. It sharpens their senses. I used to talk about it with a former wrestler I met in the clink. Apollo: I dunno... It still sounds a little far-fetched. Blackquill: Does it now? ......Then perhaps we should test the theory on you with the edge of my blade! Apollo: (I didn't sign up for this!) Blackquill: ............Hmph. And so your life is spared... for now. Apollo: (Please let those shackles be made of titanium... I don't want to die.) Fulbright: Ha ha! My investigations are as thorough as they are foolproof, or my name isn't Fulbright! I vow to resign immediately if I ever make a false arrest! Blackquill: The accused's prints were on the weapon. And he's the one person without an alibi. Quite decisive evidence. Wouldn't you agree, Your Baldness? Judge: Hmm... The defendant IS sounding guiltier by the minute. Apollo: (He has the judge leaning toward a guilty verdict, and the trial's just barely begun!) Blackquill: Hmph. What's more, a curious rumor about the accused is making the rounds. They say he seeks the merger for the purpose of freeing Tenma Taro from his imprisonment. Truth be told, I can think of no real reason to show interest in that backwards burg. Perhaps he's a complete nutter and really does seek to release an imaginary demon. Either way, he is raving mad and more than capable of murdering the alderman. Man: That mayor is a strange one, all right. I heard he went to a blood drive, but instead of donating, he tried to make a withdrawal! Judge: Order! There will be no gossiping in my court! Blackquill: Your Baldness. Please take a gander at those charms plastered around his cranium. I hear they're meant to keep him safe from possession by the demon Tenma Taro. Then again... Perhaps he's already under the demon's spell. Behold! The lunatic appears poised to lunge at you at any moment. Judge: Eeeep! Athena: Athena: The rumors and quirks of Mayor Tenma have no relevance to this case! Besides, those charms on his head... they're... they're just a fashion statement! ...I think. Judge: Hmm... Come to think of it, such things don't seem relevant to the case, do they? Athena: The prosecution will refrain from dragging our client's reputation through the mud! Blackquill: Oh, what a dreadfully fearsome lass we have here. Apollo: Whew, thanks for that lifeline, Athena. Athena: Careful, Apollo. He has the judge dancing in the palm of his hand! The power of suggestion is one of the more powerful tools in Simon Blackquill's arsenal. He's trying to manipulate everyone's impressions to suit his objectives. Apollo: (This guy really is bad news.) Judge: In any case, it seems the victim did manage to defend himself, despite being impaled. What sort of weapon did he used against his attacker? Fulbright: None other than this statue right here! Judge: It appears to be a statue of two strange creatures locked in battle. Blackquill: Two yokai to be exact. On one side is the Nine-Tailed Fox and on the other Tenma Taro. Quite interesting if you think about it. It's as though this very case were rendered in art. Apollo: Fox and Demon Statue updated in the Court Record. Judge: Mr. Justice, you may proceed with your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- About the Murder -- Fulbright: Alderman Kyubi was murdered with a spear that had been on the wall. Press Apollo: Apollo: So, those weapons on the wall of the Fox Chamber... I presume those are real? Don't you think keeping real weapons around like that is rather dangerous? Fulbright: No matter what he collected, the alderman insisted it be the real deal. For instance, he had a real demon's club in his possession. Apparently, one of his ancestors claimed it after defeating a demon in battle. Apollo: Wha--?! (That's got to be an old wives' tale.) Fulbright: Ha ha ha! The alderman had pure, unadulterated justice flowing in his veins! Whatever he did, he did it right! We've... lost a real champion of justice in his death! Blackquill: Hmph. Nothing but claptrap and balderdash if you ask me. Now stop your bleating and tell us about the weapon. Fulbright: Your wish is my command! Fulbright: The fingerprints of the defendant, Damian Tenma, were found on the murder weapon. Press Apollo: Apollo: It doesn't make sense, if you think about it. Prints could be easily wiped off. Fulbright: Hm. You do have a point there. Blackquill: I'd venture to say, he did NOT wipe off the prints because he COULD not. Apollo: What do you mean? Blackquill: ......... Athena: Looks like he wants YOU to figure it out. Well, don't just stand there! Show him who's boss! Apollo: (I'm... totally lost... so why don't you just tell me the answer already?!) Athena: I don't think he saw that plea for help. Fulbright: You feeling all right, kid? Running a fever, perhaps? Apollo: (I wish trials came with a reset button.) Judge: Well, the specifics may yet come to light. Please proceed, Detective Fulbright. Fulbright: At the time, Alderman Kyubi was asleep from a drug he unwittingly ingested. Press Apollo: Apollo: Come to think of it, a coffee cup was found on the floor. Was the sedative in his coffee...? Fulbright: Bingo! We found traces of a sleeping agent all over the inside of the cup! Blackquill: And that is why he was out cold. That is until he leapt to his feet upon being impaled by the mayor. Apollo: What an awful way to wake up. Blackquill: Heh. A rather stimulating eye opener if you ask me. I, too, would have risen to the attack, for to die in battle is the samurai way. Paradise awaits fallen heroes, but that hole in his stomach would make eating a challenge... Fulbright: Prosecutor Blackquill, please! Those morbid jokes of yours have no place in this court! Blackquill: ............Hmph. Says the jester in detective's guise. Fulbright: Moving right along...! Fulbright: Mayor Tenma attacked his helpless victim, impaling him like a human shish kebob! Press Apollo: Apollo: So, the alderman was drugged because he was really strong? Fulbright: Did you see those rock hard muscles of his? I'm surprised the spear even managed to pierce that armor-like musculature! I admit, I'm completely jealous of that righteous body of his, ha ha ha! Apollo: Well, he did look pretty buff, even in that suit he had on. Blackquill: Quite a difference when compared with a yellowbelly like you. Apollo: Yellowbelly? Who even says that anymore? Athena: Yeah, and the color's all wrong, too......... Ooh, I know! How about a squishy red tomato! Apollo: I move to strike both of your comments from the record! Judge: Mr. Justice's character is not the issue here. Now, let's get back to what happened after the far more muscular alderman was impaled. Fulbright: Yes, well, your average person would likely have died on the spot. Fulbright: But the sudden pain jolted the victim awake, and he grabbed a statue and struck back! Press Apollo: Apollo: Could he really have attacked his attacker after being impaled with that huge spear? Fulbright: Absolutely! After all, he was once a pro wrestler. The injustice of being drugged, then speared was answered with a righteous counterattack! Apollo: But does being a former pro wrestler make him superhuman? Fulbright: Absolutely! After all, he was one of the good guys, like a superhero on the side of justice. Even though he was retired, he could still don his superhero guise in times of need! Apollo: Apollo: You need to lay off the comic books, detective! We're talking about real life here. Blackquill: Setting aside the halfwit's flights of fancy, the fact is this. The court-ordered post mortem concluded the victim moved after his skewering. Apollo: (So, he found the strength somehow to attack his attacker, huh?) Present Fox and Demon Statue Apollo: Leads to: \"Did the alderman really strike the mayor?\" Athena: Detective Fulbright's testimony sounds airtight. No wonder he's so confident. Apollo: No, he only thinks it's airtight. It's up to us to poke some holes in it. That part about the alderman fighting back sounds like a big hole waiting to be poked. Apollo: Did the alderman really strike the mayor? Fulbright: What?! Are you questioning my sense of justice?! Apollo: Your so-called \"justice\" need to find itself a pair of legs to stand on. You claim the alderman struck back after the mayor put a spear through him. But the statue he supposedly used to defend himself creates a major hole in your theory. Judge: It would appear that the defense has a counter-argument. Very well, let's hear what the defense thinks is odd about the detective's statue theory. Kyubi fought unarmed Apollo: Well, the alderman was a former pro wrestler, so why would he even use it as a weapon? He could've defended himself with his bare hands! I mean, that's what pro wrestlers do! Blackquill: Hmph. You've a lot of nerve... ...but will you raise an objection in the face of swift punishment as solicitors are wont to do? Apollo: Um... Well... Not if I deserve it...? Judge: And you do! The defense will look before they leap next time! Is that understood? Apollo: Sorry, Your Honor! Can I try that again? Leads back to: \"Very well, let's hear what the defense thinks is odd about the detective's statue theory.\" There are no fingerprints Leads to: \"There are no fingerprints on this supposedly crucial piece of evidence.\" It's not broken Apollo: If the statue really was used as a weapon, why are there no signs of breakage? Athena: Um, Apollo? When was the last time you had your eyes examined? The statue is clearly broken. See the area around their hands? Apollo: Ah! Eh heh heh, guess I missed that. Judge: I'm afraid I can't let that one slide without a penalty. Apollo: Please, let me try that again! (Detective Fulbright claims that the alderman used the statue to attack the mayor. But there's a hole in his theory!) Leads back to: \"Very well, let's hear what the defense thinks is odd about the detective's statue theory.\" Apollo: There are no fingerprints on this supposedly crucial piece of evidence. And if you look at the crime scene photo... ...you'll notice that the alderman isn't wearing gloves. Judge: Yes, I believe he is quite gloveless indeed. Apollo: If he touched the statue with his bare hands, he should've left some fingerprints! Detective Fulbright, you DID take that into account during your investigation, didn't you? Fulbright: Arrrrrrgh! This can't be happening! D-D-Did I arrest the wrong maaaaan?! Athena: You did it, Apollo! You knocked Detective Fulbright off his high horse! Apollo: Well, it's just one point in our favor. Athena: Who do you suppose clubbed the mayor if it wasn't the alderman? Apollo: Hmm... Well, if it wasn't the alderman... ...that means someone else must've clubbed the mayor. Athena: You mean there was a third party there in the Fox Chamber? Apollo: Exactly! And this could be the big break we've been looking for! Judge: Hmm... There does seem to be a hole in the prosecution's argument. Prosecutor Blackquill, would you care to respond to the defense's assertion? Blackquill: Hmph. Apollo: (The least you could do is look at me while being dismissive.) Blackquill: Your mind is as dull as an unhoned blade, Justice-dono. Apollo: Justice... dono? (He's been watching too many samurai flicks.) Blackquill: It will take far more than that to cut down Simon Blackquill. A whelp such as you has no hope against my superior swordsmanship. Apollo: This is a trial, not a swordfight, Prosecutor Blackquill! Blackquill: Hmph. There is a perfectly good explanation for the lack of prints on the statue. You might recall that bloodstained cloth found at the scene of the crime. Well, it just so happens... that the blood was the mayor's. Apollo: So, um... what are you getting at? Blackquill: Hone your mind, boy! Why was there blood on that cloth? Solve that riddle and you shall see that the hole you thought you found is but an illusion. Apollo: Now let's see... How was that cloth used...? Was it used... By Kyubi as a head covering Apollo: The alderman was probably wearing it over his head. Athena: Wha--?! Blackquill: Do you truly think the alderman would show up to a meeting over the fate of his village... ...wearing this ridiculous-looking cloth over his head? Apollo: Sure. They had a festival that day, didn't they? Who's to say he didn't party a little too hard and just forgot to take it off?! Blackquill: ............... Judge: ............... Apollo: Okay, fine. So maybe he didn't do that... Can I try one more time? Leads back to: \"Now let's see... How was that cloth used...? Was it used...\" To wipe up blood Apollo: Maybe the cloth was used to wipe as much of the mayor's blood as possible off the statue. And in the process, the culprit inadvertently erased the alderman's fingerprints as well. Blackquill: Blackquill: But the mayor did not bother to wipe away his own fingerprints on the murder weapon. Why would he wipe down one weapon but not the other? Careful, now. Use what little brains you have left before you speak. Apollo: Gimme a do-over on that one! Please! Leads back to: \"Now let's see... How was that cloth used...? Was it used...\" To wrap the statue Leads to: \"Maybe the alderman wrapped the statue in the cloth.\" Apollo: Maybe the alderman wrapped the statue in the cloth. In short, he wasn't touching the statue directly when he used it to strike back at the mayor. Ah! Blackquill: ...Precisely. Bully for you, boy. Apollo: Aw, it was nothing. Athena: Apollo, don't let him start manipulating you, too! You just closed the hole for the prosecution! Apollo: I did? ............Ack, I did! Blackquill: Right. That a statue wrapped in cloth would leave no fingerprints is as plain as day. But this also proves there are no holes in our theory of the alderman striking back. Apollo: .........Oops. Arrrrrrrrrgh! Fox and Demon Statue updated in the Court Record. Blackquill: Now do you see how dull your mind is? Apollo: I'll make sure to sharpen it next time. Blackquill: A particularly frightening inmate once told me that... ...he always tenderly honed his blades before he went to work, like the samurai of yore. Judge: Samurai? Sounds more like a homicidal maniac to me! Blackquill: Actually, he was working in the prison kitchen at the time. Apollo: (Wait, so the inmate was a murdering samurai prison chef?) Judge: Hmm... It would seem that the victim and his killer were the only ones there after all. Apollo: (I was kinda attached to that hole... Now what?) Athena: Apollo, I just thought of something. If they didn't find anyone's fingerprints on the statue... ...who's to say someone other than the alderman didn't hit the mayor with it? Apollo: Why didn't I think of that! Anybody could've NOT left prints on it! Blackquill: Hmph. Then who, pray tell, struck the mayor with the statue? Please, illuminate us with your wisdom, young lady. Athena: There's only one answer -- the real killer! Blackquill: Prove the existence of this \"real killer\" then. What evidence have you? Athena: Oh, I'll give you evidence, all right! Apollo: Athena, are you sure about this? (Changed from [Athena, are sure [sic] about this?] in the original release) Athena: To borrow your words, Apollo, I'm fine! Take a look at this! Black feathers and tracks, allegedly from a yokai, were found at the scene. I believe they're from the third party who struck the mayor with that statue. Judge: Is the defense actually suggesting some sort of monster killed that alderman?! Athena: That's exactly what I'm suggesting! Apollo: Apollo: No, Athena! You just lost what little credibility we had left! Athena: .........Aah! Sorry, sorry! Guess I got carried away. Judge: Mr. Justice, we've no time to deal with objections between members of the defense. Apollo: Sorry, Your Honor. It's just, this kid's still, well, a kid... Athena: Ouch... You meanie! I'm reporting this to Mr. Wright! Judge: So, is this court to believe the feathers and tracks are from a \"yokai\" as you put it? Apollo: Uhh, no, Your Honor. I believe they are a fabrication. The real killer wanted us to believe some sort of monster murdered the alderman. Judge: Hmm, interesting. And why do you suppose the killer would do that? Apollo: Umm.... Why, indeed? Judge: Mr. Justice, you seem as new to this as your partner is. Apollo: Ouch... (This, I'm not reporting to Mr. Wright...) Blackquill: Hoy, Fool Bright, explain to His Baldness what these brats are missing. You know, the who and why behind those feathers and tracks. Apollo: Wha--?! (You mean you can explain all that?!) Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Our investigative prowess is without equal! Apollo: (I'm starting to think I chose the wrong profession.) Judge: Very well, let's hear about these so-called yokai feathers and tracks. Witness Testimony -- Feathers and Tracks -- Fulbright: This entire case centers on one man's attempt to crush opposition to the municipal merger! Mayor Tenma panicked when The Amazing Nine-Tails helped embolden the protestors. So he stoked the villagers' fears by fabricating a monster! The strange feathers and tracks he planted made it look like a yokai was the killer. Apollo: Those feathers and tracks stoked the villagers' fears? (Changed from [Those feathers and tracks stoked the villager's [sic] fears?] in the original release) Fulbright: Absolutely! He knew exactly how to prey on their superstitious minds. Blackquill: Those feathers only gave weight to the idea that the alderman was slain by a demon. The accursed demon Tenma Taro, that is. Judge: Tenma who? Blackquill: Tenma Taro -- the legendary demon locked away in the village's Forbidden Chamber. From a young age, the villagers are taught to fear the great, black-feathered demon. And thus were they blinded to other, more plausible explanations. Apollo: Apollo: Hold on for a second. Before we start letting our imaginations run wild... Isn't there someone else that could be considered a suspect? Judge: Mr. Justice, please explain yourself. Apollo: On the day of the incident, there was a special event held at Kyubi Manor. And as part of this event, there was someone dressed in the likeness of Tenma Taro. Obviously this person is a much more likely suspect than any legendary demon! Blackquill: Blackquill: Dullard. You are playing right into the killer's mind games. Apollo: What? Blackquill: Listen here. The feathers and tracks were merely red herrings. The villagers believe the murder to be the work of the real Tenma Taro. However, the police believe that the person in the Tenma Taro suit is the killer. Apollo: Ahh! Blackquill: The defendant sought to sow this confusion in order to deflect blame away from himself. However, he was knocked unconscious by the alderman... ...and thus our mentally deficient mayor was caught red-handed at the scene of the crime. Apollo: Apollo: Do you honestly believe Mayor Tenma would do something so stupid?! Blackquill: Blackquill: The evidence speaks for itself. ...Fool Bright! Fulbright: Right. It was the mayor's last-ditch effort to stop the opposition before things got crazy. The Amazing Nine-Tails was fueling both the yokai craze and the anti-merger movement. Plus, he's one of the better-known masked wrestlers, and the hometown favorite. That's why the mayor panicked and set out on the path of injustice. Judge: But do the people of Nine-Tails Vale really believe a yokai is behind the crime? Fulbright: Yokai sightings are an everyday event there, so I wouldn't be surprised if they did. Judge: Hmm... I must say... A crime that preys upon innocent, impressionable minds. Blackquill: Just so. A particularly silver-tongued inmate once had the following words for me. The innocent of heart are the easiest prey. Judge: You don't say? Was this inmate a con artist? Blackquill: .........No. He was framed for the murder of his beloved. I actually felt sorry for the poor chap. Apollo: (Wait, so he wasn't the predator, but rather the prey?) Judge: Yes, well... Now then, the defense may proceed with their cross-examination. Cross Examination -- Feathers and Tracks -- Fulbright: This entire case centers on one man's attempt to crush opposition to the municipal merger! Press Apollo: Apollo: Detective Fulbright, is the anti-merger movement really that strong? Fulbright: Oh, absolutely! They parade around in yokai costumes shouting, \"Down with Mayor Tenma!\" And just the other day, they stormed Tenma City Hall, claiming it was a den of vipers! Blackquill: Hmph. But when the accused showed his face... ...the angry mob scattered like leaves upon an autumn wind. For you see, lowly yokai are no match for Tenma Taro, the Dark Lord of their kind. Athena: Wait, are the villagers scared of Mayor Tenma or Tenma Taro? I'm confused. Apollo: I think he means Mayor Tenma. It's easy to get the wrong impression about the guy. Judge: Detective Fulbright, why do you suppose the defendant would commit such an act? Fulbright: Mayor Tenma panicked when The Amazing Nine-Tails helped embolden the protestors. Press Apollo: Apollo: The Amazing Nine-Tails... No one knows his true identity, right? Fulbright: That's right. And he was a lone wolf, or in other words, he didn't belong to a wrestling federation. He appeared like a shooting star, defeating one Tenma Town wrestler after another. And before anyone knew it, he was a champion! Blackquill: Like the samurai of yore, surrounded thick with enemies, he cut them down one by one. It was a complete and utter loss of face for Tenma Town Pro Wrestling. Fulbright: He was amazing! If ever there was a real superhero, it would be him! I dream of becoming a true champion of justice like him someday! Athena: I bet Detective Fulbright would be a great pro wrestler. He could even team up with Prosecutor Blackquill. Apollo: A police detective and a prisoner in chains? .........You know, I think people would actually pay to see that. I know I would. Fulbright: Ha ha ha. So you DO understand the greatness that is The Amazing Nine-Tails! Fulbright: So he stoked the villagers' fears by fabricating a monster! Press Apollo: Apollo: Did the murder and yokai evidence really stoke the villagers' fears? Fulbright: Absolutely! It had an immediate effect! The presumed return of the dreaded Tenma Taro has them shaking in their boots! Judge: Oh my, is it really that bad?! Blackquill: Hmph, that superstitious lot? It's as if Jack the Ripper had been set loose in their village. The mere thought of that demon lurking about is enough to spark a mass exodus. Judge: I see... That's a very persuasive argument. Apollo: (The mere thought of His Honor buying into Simon the Psycho-Slasher's words... ...makes me want to spark my own exodus out of the courtroom right about now.) Fulbright: So you see, there can be only one reason why anyone would plant those feathers and tracks! Fulbright: The strange feathers and tracks he planted made it look like a yokai was the killer. Press Apollo: Apollo: ...But it doesn't add up. If what you say is true, why top it off with murder? Fulbright: Hm? What do you mean? Apollo: You claim that our client planted the yokai evidence to stoke the villagers' fears. If so, then why not stop there? Why murder Alderman Kyubi? Judge: Hmm... Excellent point. Apollo: It is, isn't it! So, Your Honor agrees there was no reason for the murder, correct?! Blackquill: Blackquill: Perhaps the killing was on the spur of the moment. (Changed from [Perhaps the killing was spur of the moment.] in the original release) Apollo: You're saying it wasn't premeditated? Blackquill: From the outset, I had no intention of paying heed to any of your babble. However, the fact is, the mayor made a startling discovery. Apollo: A startling discovery? (Why don't I like the sound of that?) Blackquill: Alderman Kyubi's secret identity. Athena: Apollo... I think Prosecutor Blackquill has figured out the alderman's secret identity. But even if he has, why would it be a motive for the mayor to commit murder? Apollo: (...This is not good!) Blackquill: This patch of fur was discovered at the crime scene. It's from the mask worn by The Amazing Nine-Tails. Therefore, we can conclude that this mask was at the crime scene. Judge: Oh, my. But why would it have been there? Blackquill: The victim was a former pro wrestler and a member of the anti-merger movement. ...Need I say more? Judge: Well, um............ Ah! C-Could it really be?! Blackquill: Hmph. Your Baldness has had an epiphany I see. Our victim, Rex Kyubi, was The Amazing Nine-Tails! And the mayor's discovery of such was his motive for murder! Apollo: Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Judge: Order! Order!!! What a shocking development. A motive clearer than crystal clear! Athena: What do we do now, Apollo?! Apollo: I didn't think they'd tie the alderman's secret identity to the mayor's motive for murder! Blackquill: At last we've reached my real point: why did the alderman have to forge a secret identity? Does it not pique your interest, Your Baldness? Judge: I admit it does... It IS odd that he had to create this other persona... ...just to secretly participate in the anti-merger movement. Blackquill: Very astute of you, Your Baldness. Fulbright: Right, now take a look at this! If you value your dearest's life, you will merge Nine-Tails Vale with Tenma Town. This blackmail letter was found in Alderman Kyubi's pocket! Apollo: Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaat!!! Blackquill: At present, the alderman's wife is in the hospital. And that letter is clear evidence the mayor was blackmailing him by threatening her life. Athena: Wait, didn't the blackmail letter sent to Mayor Tenma go missing... ...right after the alderman's murder? Apollo: You think maybe the killer took the letter from the mayor after the murder... ...and planted it into the alderman's pocket? Athena: It's possible... but we don't have any proof that that's what happened. Apollo: (Talk about being up the creek without a paddle...) Blackmail Letter added to the Court Record. Fulbright: Mayor Tenma would've made a clean getaway if he'd just left after planting the yokai things. But he was knocked out cold by his sudden decision to kill The Amazing Nine-Tails! Judge: So, it was The Amazing Nine-Tails's counterattack that brought the entire crime to light. Apollo: Wait a sec... (Fulbright's claiming that the mayor killed the alderman after planting the yokai evidence. And that the mayor was knocked out cold immediately after that?) Detective Fulbright, please add your previous statement to your testimony! Adds statement \"Mayor Tenma killed the sleeping alderman after planting the feathers and tracks.\" Press (subsequent times) Apollo: Apollo: So, you're saying our client hadn't planned on killing the alderman? Fulbright: That's right. The motive only came after he discovered the alderman's secret identity! Apollo: W-Well, I guess that does make sense. Athena: What do we do now, Apollo?! Apollo: I didn't think they'd tie the alderman's secret identity to the mayor's motive for murder. Fulbright: Let's get on with the testimony, shall we! Fulbright: Mayor Tenma killed the sleeping alderman after planting the feathers and tracks. Press Apollo: Apollo: So let me get this straight. You believe the mayor planted the yokai evidence before the murder, not after? Fulbright: Absolutely! And then he was knocked out cold by the alderman's last punch! He wouldn't have had a chance to plant the evidence after that! Apollo: (Hmm... Something's not right here.) Present Crime Photo Apollo: Leads to: \"Detective Fulbright, your sense of justice is anything but fair!\" Apollo: (Hard to believe that a stiff, humorless man like the mayor could be behind such a stunt.) Athena: Argh... We have to do something, Apollo, before they pin it all on the mayor! Apollo: Then we're going to need to prove that Mayor Tenma didn't plant that yokai stuff. Athena: How are we supposed to do that? Apollo: Detective Fulbright, your sense of justice is anything but fair! Fulbright: What's this?! You are question my justice again?! Apollo: Yes, and I'm going to prove it to you. Take a look at this photo. Judge: This... is the crime scene photo. And just what does this prove? Apollo: It proves when the feathers and tracks were planted. Fulbright: But I already told you, they were planted before the murder! The defendant planted the yokai evidence, then was knocked out cold while killing his victim! Apollo: But that would be impossible. If you look right here, it's clear when the feathers and tracks were left at the scene. Present tracks Apollo: Leads to: \"Aren't you just pointing to the yokai feathers and tracks, Mr. Justice?\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: There's clearly something wrong... right around here. Judge: The only thing clear to me is that the defense is barking up the wrong tree. Blackquill: Hmph. Really up a tree now, aren't we? Judge: Yes, and a stiff penalty should help you learn that correct assertions don't grow on them. Apollo: Ugh... I wonder if bandages do... (There is clearly something wrong with the assertion that... ...the feathers and tracks were there before the murder.) Leads back to: \"If you look right here, it's clear when the feathers and tracks were left at the scene.\" Judge: Aren't you just pointing to the yokai feathers and tracks, Mr. Justice? Apollo: Yes. See how the feathers are on top of the blood, and the tracks were made in blood? In other words, the yokai evidence could've only resulted AFTER the murder. Fulbright: Th-Then the mayor must've planted the evidence after killing the alderman! Apollo: But you said it yourself, the mayor had been knocked unconscious thereafter. There would've been no time for him to plant any evidence at all! Therefore! There must've been someone else besides the mayor and the alderman at the crime scene! Fulbright: Arrrrrrgh! There must be some mistake! Judge: Order! Order!!! Fulbright: Wh-Where's your evidence?! You can't possibly have any, can you?! Ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: Evidence? Oh, I have evidence. In fact, I have an eye-witness's testimony for you. Fulbright: You do?! But hooooow?! Was my vaunted sense of justice really just half-baked? Athena: He's taking this really hard. Judge: Hmm... Mr. Justice. What is this testimony regarding a third party that you claim to have? Apollo: I have it right here, Your Honor. It's the sworn testimony of Mr. Tenma's daughter. The witness, Jinxie Tenma, saw a yokai in the hallway after stumbling upon the scene. It was the demon Tenma Taro... He's the source of those feathers and tracks! Judge: ......... Blackquill: ......... Fulbright: ......... ......... Apollo: .........Will somebody please say something? Judge: ...The defense will explain to the court exactly what he means. Fulbright: You... You dare to mock this court and justice itself?! You're unfit to bear your name, boy! Blackquill: You Baldness, it appears our defense attorney here is delirious from exhaustion. Athena: Athena: Apollo! Think of something, quick, before you're held in contempt of court! Apollo: What do you think I'm trying to do?! Before you decide whether I should step down, please... hear me out...? Judge: Very well, Mr. Justice, I'm all ears. But you had better explain yourself well. What was this yokai you were talking about? Apollo: It's all in this statement here -- Jinxie Tenma asserts that she saw Tenma Taro. After she discovered the crime scene and called the police... ...she came around a corner in the hall. It was around here... ...that she saw Tenma Taro fleeing toward the foyer! The defense asserts that whoever was impersonating this monster... ...is the one who left those feathers and tracks behind, intentionally or otherwise! Judge: Wh-Whaaaaaat?! Fulbright: How incredibly unjust! Why haven't I heard about this before?! Man: The defense just proved there was someone else! Woman: So the mayor isn't the killer? Man: Was it all just a set up? The prosecutor IS a convicted felon, after all. Athena: Apollo! The momentum has shifted in our favor! Apollo: Good. Now let's keep it that way! Blackquill: Blackquill: ............Hmph. Little do you realize... ...that though you are in the midst of a fray, your sword is broken. Apollo: My sword? (I didn't know I had one to break.) Are you implying there's a problem with my claim? Blackquill: Consider this: if that yokai impersonator had indeed fled toward the foyer... ...that fool and that fop would have seen him. Apollo: Fool and fop? Oh, you mean Filch and L'Belle. Hmm, now that you mention it... Blackquill: Both Phineas Filch and Florent L'Belle were in the foyer at the time. But they haven't stated that they saw a yokai, have they? Did you ever consider that yokai was but a figment of a scared little girl's imagination? Apollo: Argh. Why DIDN'T those two see the Tenma Taro impersonator pass by? Athena: Why don't we ask them ourselves? Apollo: I was just about to say that myself. No, really, I was! The defense would like to call Mr. Phineas Filch, caretaker of Kyubi Manor, to the stand! I just know he must have seen something! Judge: Hmm... I suppose we can't ignore the fact that the little girl believes she saw a monster. I trust you have no objections to Mr. Justice's request, Prosecutor Blackquill? I understand that Mr. Filch is enjoying a nap out in the lobby. Blackquill: Hmph. I knew that tanuki was a rare find. But when we captured him, I didn't think he'd end up a witness. Do with him as you will. Apollo: (D-Did he just say captured? No, wait. I don't want to know.) Judge: Very well, then. Bailiff, please go wake Mr. Filch and escort him to the witness stand. Judge: Will the witness state his name and occupation, please. Filch: The name's Filch, Phineas Filch, caretaker of Kyubi Manor. Oh, and... This is for you, Your Lordship. Just a little something I though ya might like. Judge: Oh, my, what a fabulous pair of shoes! And \"Your Honor\" will do just fine, Mr. Filch. Apollo: ...Ah! It's those shoes again! Athena: Um... Don't they belong to Detective Fulbright? Apollo: Don't tell me Filch stole them again. Filch: They're all yours, Your Honorship, sir. Judge: What?! But they seem awfully expensive. Filch: Yep, too expensive for me, but I reckon they'd be perfect for someone like Your Honorship. Judge: Hmm... It's a kind gesture, but legal ethics dictate I can't accept such gifts. Filch: Aw, ethics smethics. Just take 'em if ya want 'em. Polished 'em up real nice for ya, too. Judge: I'm sorry about the shoes, Mr. Filch, but I WILL accept your testimony. The court would like to hear whether you saw Tenma Taro in the foyer after the murder. Witness Testimony -- Guarding the Foyer -- Filch: At the time of the murder I was on guard duty in the foyer, just like Mr. Kyubi asked. (Changed from [At the time of the murder I was on guard duty in the foyer, just like Mr. Kyubi's [sic] asked.] in the original release) I was making sure no one -- fair, foul, fishy, or otherwise -- could get to our guest. I was still in my office keeping a good watch when the murder happened after 3 PM. But I didn't see nothing outta the ordinary, no siree! Blackquill: That yokai you keep jabbering on about was but a phantom of a little girl's dreams. Apollo: So, you're telling this court you never saw anyone dressed up like Tenma Taro? Filch: Yep! Was guarding the whole time. That's the truth, the holy truth, 'n' nutter-butter the truth! And Tenma Taro? Bah, ya don't really believe in all that yokai mumbo jumbo, do ya? I certainly don't! BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: Hm? (My bracelet, it's...) Athena: Something the matter, Apollo? Apollo: My bracelet keeps squeezing my arm. Athena: Really? So you think Mr. Tanuki-- er, I mean, Filch has been lying to us? Apollo: I wouldn't rule it out. (Now, if I could just zero in on a tell -- some sort of nervous habit...) ???: *Screech!* Apollo: A-Aaaaaaagh! What in the--?! (W-What's a hawk doing in here!?) Blackquill: Allow me to introduce my trusty cohort, Taka. He seems to have taken quite a liking to the courthouse. Made it his new home, in fact. Apollo: ...He doesn't live with you... you know, in jail? (Who's ever heard of a courthouse bird?) Blackquill: Taka simply loathes trickery and fraud. And that queer power of yours seems to have offended my dear, bosom buzzard. Apollo: This isn't some sort of trick or-- Aaaaaaaaaagh! (I won't be able to spot squat like this!) Filch: Wh-What the heck's goin' on 'round here?! Run for the hills! Judge: N-No pets or other animals allowed in the courtroom! Taka: *Screech!* Judge: Ack! Somebody help! Blackquill: Oh, he's merely having a bit of sport. He won't harm you, save when truly famished. Judge: In that case, Prosecutor Blackquill, you will ensure your feathered friend is properly fed. Athena: Looks like we have to do this the old-fashioned way. Apollo: We'll be fine... I think. (If there was someone dressed as Tenma Taro there, Filch should've seen him. We'll just have to put our faith in Jinxie's statement for now.) Judge: Mr. Justice, please proceed with your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- Guarding the Foyer -- Filch: At the time of the murder I was on guard duty in the foyer, just like Mr. Kyubi asked. (Changed from [At the time of the murder I was on guard duty in the foyer, just like Mr. Kyubi's [sic] asked.] in the original release) Press Apollo: Apollo: Mr. Filch, why did Alderman Kyubi have you handle guard duty? Filch: Eh-heh heh... 'Cause he trusts me. I AM the manor's caretaker, after all. Apollo: So, you took said guard duty seriously? Filch: Eh-heh heh... Lemme tell ya something about me. I'm-- Yipes! Blackquill: Listen here, you little tanuki. Get straight to the point and be quick about it. The court wishes to hear what you did or didn't see in the foyer, and naught else. Filch: Y-Yes, of course, sir! Right away, sir! Apollo: (Blackquill's got him completely under his thumb.) Filch: Like I said, I was guarding the foyer entrance that day! Filch: I was making sure no one -- fair, foul, fishy, or otherwise -- could get to our guest. Press Apollo: Apollo: So no one could get to him... Sounds like security was pretty tight. Filch: That's 'cause there's always lotsa sneaks 'n' thieves 'round festival time. Apollo: And the solution was to entrust the manor's security to a thief? That's not even funny. Athena: Maybe it's a matter of stopping thieves by hiring one. After all, it takes one to know one. Apollo: I dunno, it seems more like letting the fox guard the henhouse to me. Judge: Hmm. So, the witness testifies that he took his guard duty seriously? Filch: Yes, sir, Your Honorship, sir! Filch: I was still in my office keeping a good watch when the murder happened after 3 PM. Press Apollo: Apollo: Did you really keep an eye on the foyer the entire time?! Filch: *sigh* Poor old Filchy... Been working hard my whole life... ...only to be smeared by some greenhorn in his fancy-schmancy suit and silly haircut. Ah! Sorry, sorry, Mr. Blackquill, sir! Didn't mean to get off subject there! Apollo: (Sheesh... Blackquill didn't even say anything.) Filch: To answer your question, yes, I kept an eye -- no, both of 'em, in fact -- on the foyer! Present TV Listings Apollo: Leads to: \"Don't lie to the court like that, Mr. Filch.\" Filch: But I didn't see nothing outta the ordinary, no siree! Press Apollo: Apollo: Could you describe to the court who you would consider fishy looking? Filch: Someone all fidgety and shifty-like, you know, like they're about to steal something. Apollo: (He......... just described himself.) Athena: I wonder why Mr. Filch didn't see Tenma Taro. Apollo: Maybe Jinxie only thinks she saw Tenma Taro. Or... Athena: Maybe Mr. Filch is lying. Apollo: And if he's lying, we might be able to spot a contradiction in his testimony. Apollo: Don't lie to the court like that, Mr. Filch. Filch: Hey, it ain't right to bushwhack a fella like that! Apollo: Unfortunately for you, I have evidence that proves you're lying. If you look at this TV listing here, you'll see that at the time of the crime... ...there was a pro wrestling match scheduled -- something you'd never miss. Filch: Ack! I didn't watch that one, no siree! I was doing my job, just like I was s'pposed to! Apollo: (This guy doesn't know when to give up.) Mr. Filch. Someone even circled the match. It was you, right? Filch: Yipes! Apollo: Not only that, you even told me you watched it. You said, and I quote: \"It was a complete disaster.\" Filch: Hrrrgh! Apollo: So, do you admit to slacking off?! Filch: Y-Y-You can't trick me with your rudy poo lawyer talk! I'm one of them professional-types, too! I can do double-duty, watching TV and the foyer at the same time! Apollo: (The only thing Filch can claim to be a professional of is \"professional thief\"...) Judge: Mr. Justice. You would have this court believe the witness was slacking off? Apollo: That's correct. He claims to have been watching TV and the foyer at the same time. But that's nothing but a bald-faced lie! Judge: Bald, you say? But I'M not the one who's lying! Perhaps you meant the witness, Mr. Justice? And in that case, let's see what evidence you can offer. You claim Mr. Filch is lying about watching TV and the foyer simultaneously. Now, prove it. Present Foyer Diagram Apollo: Leads to: \"Please take a look at the direction the TV is facing in this diagram.\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: This piece of evidence here clearly exposes Mr. Filch's lie. Judge: Hm? How does that prove anything? Apollo: Oh, it, um... (Whoops! Way off on that one!) Heh heh, sorry. Don't know what I was thinking. Judge: Yes, well, I have moments like that myself. Apollo: (Whew, looks like he'll let this one slide.) Judge: But random guesses and speculation must be punished! Apollo: Yargh! Athena: Apollo! We should think about how Mr. Filch was when he was watching TV! Apollo: Please, lemme try that one again! Judge: The defense will look before they leap this time. So, what do you have for us, Mr. Justice? Leads back to: \"You claim Mr. Filch is lying about watching TV and the foyer simultaneously. Now, prove it.\" Apollo: Please take a look at the direction the TV is facing in this diagram. Now, unless Mr. Filch has eyes where his right ear should be... ...I'd think it would be impossible to watch the foyer entrance and the TV at the same time. Judge: Why, yes! Someone watching TV there couldn't possibly see the entrance! Apollo: Exactly. And that means, Mr. Filch... ...you were slacking off and were NOT watching the foyer as you claim! Filch: Yiiipes! The bag's outta the cat! Er, I mean, other way 'round! Judge: Order! Order! Order!!! But Mr. Justice, is Mr. Filch's less-than-stellar work ethic relevant to this case? Apollo: It's very relevant, because while he was slacking off watching TV... ...there really could've been a Tenma Taro impersonator in the foyer! Blackquill: Apollo: What now?! Blackquill: Granted, this tanuki was lax in his duties, but he still had the foyer entrance covered. Apollo: What are you talking about? Blackquill: .........This. Apollo: Um... I'm not a mind reader. Ack! Blackquill: Auditory sense. His eyes may have been slacking off, but his ears were still hard at work. Right, tanuki? Filch: ...They were? ............Er, I mean, yes! Yes they were! Apollo: But you already admitted to slacking off. Now you say you weren't? Filch: My eyes might be lazy, but my ears ain't. I woulda heard anyone in the foyer, eh-heh. Ya see, the foyer floor and stairway get all creaky squeaky when someone walks on 'em! Creak, creak, creak! Loud enough to wake the dead, I reckon! Apollo: So, you're saying you didn't hear anybody walk by? Filch: Yep! My ears were working fulltime. So, who's the liar now, ya no-good shyster! Apollo: A lying thief calling me a shyster. This HAS to be the low point of my fledgling career... Filch: Gotta hand it to ya, Mr. Blackquill, sir, ya really are something else, eh-heh heh! I mean, ya don't miss a thing. And them bags under yer eyes? They're darker than mine! Blackquill: Fair warning, Mr. Filch. Taka is particularly fond of tanuki. Should you lie to this court again, you may suddenly find yourself on the menu. Filch: Yiiiiiipes! Please don't eat me, Mr. Taka, sir! Judge: The witness will henceforth testify truthfully under penalty of painful bird attacks! And with that in mind, the court requests that the witness revise his testimony accordingly. Witness Testimony -- Ears Working Overtime -- Filch: It's true, I was watching a pro wrestling match on the office TV. My eyes mighta been slacking off, but my ears? They were working overtime. The floor there's all creaky squeaky-like. No way I woulda missed someone walking by. So ya see, there weren't no Tenma Taro in the foyer. Blackquill: Superstition is the religion of feeble minds. Understand? A simple, rational explanation is best. Forget yokai, demons, and such. We must use common sense, for lacking that, our entire world would be but upside-down. Apollo: (Says the convict prosecutor who is totally a sign of the end times for the legal world.) Filch: And besides, if there were any yokai roaming about, I'd nab 'em 'n' sell 'em to the zoo! Athena: I wonder whether Jinxie was just seeing things. Apollo: That seems to be the general consensus, but I'm sticking to my guns. Athena: But if we can't prove she saw Tenma Taro, the mayor's sure to be convicted! Apollo: Then we'd better hope my guns fire bullets, not BBs... Judge: The defense may cross-examine the witness. Cross Examination -- Ears Working Overtime -- Filch: It's true, I was watching a pro wrestling match on the office TV. Press Apollo: Apollo: You ARE paid for your work, aren't you? So, how do you justify watching TV on the job? Filch: A-A-Arrgghh! B-B-B-But...! It ain't easy being me! I mean, I can't watch TV when we have visitors and there's no way to record stuff! Apollo: (Sorry, am I supposed to be consoling you over your first-world problems?) Athena: If those are his only problems, he should consider himself lucky. Apollo: I guess pro wrestling's serious business to Mr. Filch. Filch: My eyes mighta been slacking off, but my ears? They were working overtime. Press Apollo: Apollo: You lied earlier about taking your guard duty seriously, didn't you? Filch: Oh, uh, that? Ain't no harm in bending the truth a little, right? Blackquill: Listen to me, you little tanuki. Lie again and Taka shall feast upon that forked tongue of yours. Taka: Screech! Filch: Yiiipes! Sorry! Just lemme keep my tongue! Apollo: (At least leave it until we get the truth out of him, in any case.) Blackquill: You were negligent in your duties, were you not? Filch: Yes, sir, I was sir! But it ain't like that... Filch: The floor there's all creaky squeaky-like. No way I woulda missed someone walking by. Press Apollo: Apollo: So, you have pretty good ears, Mr. Filch? Filch: As good as they come, I'd say. Ain't nothin' to hear a creaky floor. Plus, that Tenma Taro makes a sound when he goes by. It's like a jingle jangle. Apollo: Jingle jangle? How does he do that? Filch: It's that staff o' his. That's what jingle jangles. Athena: What's he talking about, Apollo? Apollo: Beats me, but I guess Tenma Taro has a staff that makes noise. Athena: Come to think of it, didn't Jinxie mention something like that, too? She said she saw Tenma Taro holding a staff-like object that made a jangly sound. Apollo: I guess that's the source of the noise then... Judge: Well, Mr. Justice? Mr. Filch says Tenma Taro \"jingle jangles.\" Would you consider that vital information? Very important Apollo: Extremely vital! I request that it be added to his testimony! Adds statement \"If Tenma Taro was to pass by, his staff woulda gone jingle jangle.\" Not so important Apollo: (Doesn't seem particularly important to me.) No, Your Honor. I don't think it's of any importance. Judge: Very well. The witness may continue with his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press (after adding statement) Apollo: Apollo: Could someone walk by without making a sound? Filch: Nope, not even a ninja. That's 'cause even the tiniest mouse makes that floor creak, eh-heh. Real creaky squeaky, it is! Blackquill: I can vouch for the tanuki's keen ears. He came running from across the building the moment Fool Bright dropped his wallet. And true to his name, Filch filched it before Mr. Less-Than-Bright knew what happened. Apollo: That's some scary good hearing. Filch: Wads o' cash or expensive shoes on the pavement... Sounds like that don't get by ol' Filch's ears. Got years o' practice, eh-heh heh. Athena: Remind me not to bring anything of value to the manor next time. Apollo: The sound of shoes makes sense, but wads of cash? What does that sound like? ...Anyway, it sounds like they need to hire somebody to take care of their caretaker. Filch: If Tenma Taro was to pass by, his staff woulda gone jingle jangle. Press Apollo: Apollo: So, Tenma Taro's staff makes a distinctive sound? Filch: Yep, like a jingle and a jangle. Athena: Wait, Jinxie said something like that. Something about Tenma Taro making a jangly sound. Apollo: Hmmm... I think we're missing something here, but I can't quite put a finger on it. (Perhaps I should take a look at the Court Record again...) Present Yokai Legend Scroll Apollo: Leads to: \"Tenma Taro's staff would make a jangly sound, you say?\" Filch: So ya see, there weren't no Tenma Taro in the foyer. Press Apollo: Apollo: Please tell the court, what did Jinxie see if not Tenma Taro? Filch: She's always going on about seeing this yokai or that. Just an active imagination, I reckon. She won't even come near me 'cause she thinks I'm some sorta tanuki monster! Athena: Can't say I blame her. Apollo: So, Mr. Filch, you'd chalk it up to a child's active imagination? Filch: Yep. No Tenma Taro or anyone else got in or outta Kyubi Manor on my watch. Athena: Apollo, what could this mean? Do you think Jinxie was just seeing things? Apollo: Well, if that's the case, the details she provided were pretty impressive. But if we're to continue believing Jinxie's statement... Athena: We'll have to uncover Filch's lie? Apollo: Right, or.... find out why he can't tell the truth. Apollo: Tenma Taro's staff would make a jangly sound, you say? Well, I'm going to say that your story doesn't add up. Judge: Is there something the defense would like to share with the court? Apollo: Mr. Filch, you say that you didn't see Tenma Taro on the day of the incident. Why then, did you assume just now that Tenma Taro would be holding a staff? Filch: Huh? Apollo: You see, the Tenma Taro Jinxie saw held a staff in his hands. And she described its sound just like you did -- as a kind of jangly sound. Filch: Yeah, so he was holding a staff. What's yer point? Apollo: Apollo: The point is that Tenma Taro doesn't use a staff. Not normally. Filch: What are you talking about? Apollo: You see, this is the only known document depicting Tenma Taro. Is there a staff in that picture, Mr. Filch? Judge: You're right! There's no staff! Not even a cane or a walking stick! Filch: Ack! Judge: So, the question is, why does the witness think Tenma Taro uses a staff? Apollo: I believe the answer will overturn the prosecution's case on the most basic level! Blackquill: .........Well now, this IS getting interesting. Judge: All right, Mr. Justice, it's time to show the court where you're going with this. Please tell the court why Mr. Filch believes Tenma Taro carries a staff. The scroll is wrong Apollo: Maybe the scroll is incorrect. There could be an older drawing that shows Tenma Taro with a staff. And Mr. Filch could have seen that. Blackquill: Hmph. If that were the case... ...then the fact that the witness believes Tenma Taro had a staff would not be an issue. Apollo: Oh, in that case, I retract my previous statement. Judge: Not so fast, Mr. Justice. You must be held accountable for your flights of fancy! Apollo: Argh! Athena: Ouch. A legal smack down... Apollo: (Filch believes Tenma Taro has a staff... ...despite the fact that Tenma Taro has never been drawn that way! So how could he have possibly known about the staff?) Judge: Let's try that again, Mr. Justice. Leads back to: \"Please tell the court why Mr. Filch believes Tenma Taro carries a staff.\" He actually saw Tenma Taro Leads to: \"Mr. Filch actually saw Tenma Taro right after the crime occurred!\" Filch is a scatterbrain Apollo: Mr. Filch obviously has a few screws loose. So, it's no surprise he would make a mistake like that! Filch: Now, hold it right there! As caretaker o' Kyubi Manor, I keep every screw nice 'n' tight! Apollo: (I rest my case.) Judge: With an assertion like that, this court wonders whether the defense has a screw loose, too. Here's a penalty to make sure you keep your screws in tighter next time. Apollo: (Filch believes Tenma Taro has a staff... ...despite the fact that Tenma Taro has never been drawn that way! So how could he have possibly known about the staff?) Judge: Let's try that again, Mr. Justice. Leads back to: \"Please tell the court why Mr. Filch believes Tenma Taro carries a staff.\" Apollo: Mr. Filch actually saw Tenma Taro right after the crime occurred! That's the only way he could possibly know about the staff! Filch: B-B-Busted again! Blackquill: Bloody hell! You duplicitous little--! Apollo: (Yes! How'd that feel, Blackquill? Not so fun when you're on the receiving end of the blade, is it!) Admit it, Mr. Filch! You DID see Tenma Taro that day, didn't you? Filch: Um... Uhhhhhh... Apollo: Well?! Filch: I'm beggin' ya! Please don't make me say it! Apollo: But you clearly did see Tenma Taro! Stop stalling and testify to that fact! Filch: No can do! No way, no how! You ain't got no idea how terrifying he can be! Apollo: ...He? (Mr. Filch still won't admit seeing Tenma Taro, even though everyone already knows he did. The question now is, why?) Athena: Mr. Filch is scared to death! Apollo: Is that why he can't admit the truth? Athena: Hmm... Come to think of it... Jinxie: They say you must not gaze upon Tenma Taro. But in the event that you do look... ...and then tell anyone what you saw, Tenma Taro will claim your soul. Athena: Jinxie wouldn't admit to seeing Tenma Taro after hearing about the village superstitions. She said that if she told anyone that she had seen Tenma Taro, he'd claim her soul. Apollo: Wait, you think Filch believes that, too? Filch: Ah! So Mister Big-Time, City-Slicker Lawyer has heard about 'em?! Them old village superstitions? Judge: Will the defense please explain what the witness is talking about? Apollo: The people of Nine-Tails Vale believe some pretty strange things. And their superstitions may be the reason our witness here can't admit the truth... ...the truth that he really did see Tenma Taro. Filch: D-Darn straight, that's why! It's all right here! Apollo: Ignoring the superstitions will cost you your soul? Filch: See?! That's why us folks in Nine-Tails Vale can't talk about seeing Tenma Taro! Village Superstitions added to the Court Record. Apollo: That clears up one mystery. The killer took advantage of the superstitions by wearing a Tenma Taro costume. They knew that that way no one could talk about him, so it was as if he never existed! The defense holds that this Tenma Taro impersonator is the true killer! Judge: Whaaat?! Blackquill: Blackquill: Hmph! Superstitions, you say? What kind of a fool would actually believe such rubbish? And would that using some silly fairy tale could so easily expose the culprit. (Changed from [And would that using some silly fairy tale so easily expose the culprit.] in the original release) You'll need to come up with a more rational, common-sense explanation than that! Apollo: Apollo: Your common sense seems awfully narrow-minded to me, Prosecutor Blackquill! Blackquill: Blackquill: Try living in my world of narrow cells, mortal danger, and dark, sleepless nights! There is no lack of superstitions in the clink, but few are those who truly believe in them! Apollo: Apollo: Well, the village superstitions are real enough to the people of Nine-Tails Vale! A life or death superstition might even make you a believer! Blackquill: ............Grr! Raaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwrrrrrrrrrrrr! Judge: Order! Order, I say!!! Blackquill: You fool of a tanuki! Two times now, your lies have cost me! Filch: S-S-Sorry, sorry! I promise not to do it again! Blackquill: ...Taka, my fine-feathered friend, have at him! Filch: Yiiipes! He's gonna eat me alive! Head for the hills! Apollo: Ah! He took off. Judge: B-B-Bailiff! What are you waiting for?! After him -- and with your fastest men! Athena: That's certainly not something you see every day. Judge: Well, it would seem a new and important fact has come to light. A third party disguised as the yokai Tenma Taro was at the scene. And now we have two witnesses who can attest to that fact. Any objections, Prosecutor Blackquill? Blackquill: .............................. .............................. Apollo: Uh-oh... Athena: Wha--?! Judge: Huh? ............Ahhhhhh! Apollo: His shackles...! Urk! (I... I'm too young to die!) Blackquill: Justice-dono, long has it been since I've been forced to draw my blade. You had best say your prayers. Judge: Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek! D-Detective, do something! Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Have no fear, Fulbright is here! When the going gets tough, the champion of justice gets going! Apollo: Apollo: Then get going, already, before he kills us! Fulbright: Oh, but I stand in awe of Simon Blackquill, for it is his sense of justice that set him free! Judge: Objection! Objection! I object to Detective Fulbright's definition of justice! Blackquill: Blackquill: Hmph. I'm not in the habit of cutting down unarmed cowards. Judge: Oh, w-well, in that case, Prosecutor Blackquill, can I ask you to, umm, you know... Apollo: (I think the judge forgot he's in charge here.) Blackquill: So, Justice-dono's assertion is this: Tenma Taro is the real killer, not Mayor Tenma. According to him, there was a yokai at the scene of the crime. Apollo: Right! And that yokai, or rather, whoever was impersonating him, killed Alderman Kyubi! Blackquill: Apollo: Ack! Blackquill: Care to explain why Jinxie, being the first to discover the murder... ...did not see your alleged killer yokai there in the Fox Chamber? Apollo: What? (He's right, she said nothing about Tenma Taro being in the Fox Chamber...) Blackquill: .........Hmph. Let me enlighten you. That little scamp heard a dying scream right before she opened the chamber door. Apollo: ...And your point is...? Blackquill: Upon opening the door, she found a freshly skewed murder victim -- the alderman... ...and the homicidal maniac who had killer him -- the mayor. Apollo: No, there must've been someone dressed up like Tenma-- Aagh! Blackquill: Then why does that little scamp claim not to have seen a yokai in the Fox Chamber? Judge: Hmm... Considering her father is accused of murder... ...surely she would've mentioned any third party that might have been in the room. Apollo: I don't understand. Why didn't she see Tenma Taro inside the Fox Chamber? Blackquill: Hmph. There is but one way to find out: Ask Jinxie Tenma whether she saw your killer yokai at the scene of the crime. Apollo: Uh-oh... Blackquill: The final battle draws nigh. Only one of us will leave here alive. Heh heh heh. Long has my blade thirsted for blood. At long last, it shall be sated! Apollo: Wait, this IS still a trial, right? Blackquill: Show me what you're truly capable of, Justice-dono! Judge: V-Very well, then. Both parties no doubt need some time to regroup... ...so the court will take a 10-minute recess in order to-- Aagh! Blackquill: ...Three minutes. Judge: I-I'm sorry, but... a three-minute recess? Blackquill: Just so. Plenty of time if your destination of intent is the loo. Judge: The loo? You mean the bathroom? Apollo: (Sheesh... At least include enough time to wash our hands.) Blackquill: See that you take no more than three minutes. All latecomers will be punished. Judge: Y-Yes, sir! I hereby declare a three-minute recess before the battle begins! Athena: I declare Prosecutor Blackquill the winner of this round of Simon Says... Apollo: Doesn't bode well for us if the prosecutor is running the show, does it...? April 18, 10:40 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Athena: He busted out of his shackles. Apollo: Yeah, what was that about? Guess they don't make shackles like they used to. Athena: Better be careful, Apollo. You've really brought out the samurai in him. Especially after you proved there was a Tenma Taro impersonator at the manor. Apollo: What's with that guy and the whole samurai act, anyway? Tenma: Such fine swordsmanship... That is no mere act. Mr. Justice, it's high time I challenge this jailhouse prosecutor to a duel! Apollo: No, wait! Let's save the dueling until after we prove your innocence! Tenma: Hrmmm... I suppose it could wait till later. Apollo: (*sigh* Does ANYONE remember we're conducting a trial here?) Athena, I'm gonna go wash up. Athena: Remember what Blackquill said, Apollo. Don't be late! April 18, 10:43 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 4 Judge: Now then, I believe our next witness is Ms. Jinxie Tenma, a maid at Kyubi Manor. I believe we can proceed now -- if the witness is ready, that is. Jinxie: N-N-Nurarihyon! Leader of the One Hundred Demons! He really does exist! Athena: Wow... That is one well-polished tray... Judge: The witness will show her face while in court, or her testimony will be inadmissible. Jinxie: Eek! Judge: What is it, my child?! Jinxie: Be gone, Nurarihyon, Leader of the One Hundred Demons! Judge: Ho ho ho. You think I'm a yokai? Well, I WAS once known as a judicial monster of sorts. The beast of the bar, the demon of due process, if you will. Jinxie: Eek! My charm has no effect... Athena: The demon of due process? Not sure I can see that one... Blackquill: .........Now, you little scamp. Jinxie: Yes? Blackquill: I trust you know why you're here. Jinxie: .........B-B-Bags. Blackquill: Bags? Oh, that tricksy tanuki? Try the noodle stand. And go enjoy a big bowl of tanuki tail noodles why you're at it. Apollo: (Everyone's a comedian.) Jinxie: No... I meant YOUR bags. The ones under your eyes. You must have trouble sleeping. (Changed from [No... I meant YOUR bags. The one's [sic] under your eyes. You must have trouble sleeping.] in the original release) Here. This charm will keep Azukiarai away. Blackquill: Azukiarai? The yokai that washes azuki beans? The only thing needing washing will be your father's neck before I take his head clean off! Jinxie: Azukiarai often keeps people up at night with the noise he makes washing beans. But if you stick this charm on your forehead, you won't hear him anymore. Blackquill: .........I-Is that so? Well, thank you. Athena: Looks like Prosecutor Blackquill got more than he bargained for. Apollo: They're bad enough alone, but together, those two are just plain creepy. Judge: Your testimony, if you please, Ms. Tenma. Specifically, whether or not you saw Tenma Taro when you discovered the crime scene. Witness Testimony -- What Jinxie Saw -- Jinxie: Did I see Tenma Taro in the Fox Chamber? Well, when I opened the door... *shiver* I saw... I saw... Yes! Now I remember! Y-Y-Yokai! Yokai! Right there in that room! Apollo: So there was a yokai at the scene of the crime! Jinxie: *shiver* Uh-huh, lots... and lots of them! Apollo: Wait, more than one yokai? Did Tenma Taro happen to be among them? Jinxie: I don't know! I just don't know! All I know is the room was swimming in yokai! Kasha, Nurikabe, Setotaisho! Eeek! They were all there! Judge: Well this is an unexpected turn of events. We've gone from no yokai to a flood of them. Blackquill: This is ludicrous. You would have this court listen to this delusional little scamp's testimony?! Apollo: Yurk! Athena: Athena: Your Honor! I believe her memory is simply clouded by fear! But a quick therapy session should ease her mind. With the court's permission, of course. Judge: What a fabulous idea! Please proceed, Ms. Cykes. Apollo: You sure you know what you're doing, Athena? Athena: She's obviously not herself. The trauma of discovering that crime scene... ...and fear of testifying have her dazed and confused. A regular ball of confusion! But my analytical psychology-based approach should be able to help. Judge: Any objections, Prosecutor Blackquill? Shall we let Ms. Cykes proceed? Blackquill: ............Hmph. It makes no difference to me. Do as you will, but I doubt we shall get any viable testimony. She'd be better served by bearing witness to the sword skills I forged in a distant land! Athena: Hmph! I'll show you! Jinxie: Did I see Tenma Taro in the Fox Chamber? Jinxie: Well, when I opened the door... *shiver* I saw... I saw... Jinxie: Yes! Now I remember! Jinxie: Y-Y-Yokai! Yokai! Right there in that room! Athena: Found something! Hmm... Looks like an out-of-control emotion. Apollo: Um, Athena? What exactly are we looking at here? Athena: Oh, this? It's one of Widget's functions. Right here you can see images and emotions extracted from the witness's voice. Apollo: Whoa! You mean that little thing can do all this?! Widget: Pretty cool, huh?! Apollo: (And here I thought it was just some kids' toy.) Athena: Unfortunately, all I'm getting is an overflow error right now. See how Sad is brightly lit there at the bottom left? She's under an uncontrollable amount of distress, which is masking her other emotions. It seems the sheer terror she experienced has made her a confused mess. Apollo: So all those yokai she thinks she saw are a product of rampant emotions? Athena: Yes, that's right. Her fear has instilled in her hallucinations and false memories. She's seeing normal everyday objects as monsters in her mind. It's a form of schizophrenic hallucination brought on by emotional trauma. And the trauma in Jinxie's case is fear. Apollo: (So she was, and still is, seeing ordinary objects as yokai...) Athena: We'll have to find the root cause of her extreme fear before I can treat it. Now, let's see... Apollo, can you point out the yokai on the wheel of fire? She seems particularly terrified of that one. Start by pressing Probe ([L / LB / Q]). (Changed from [Start by tapping Probe (L) on the bottom screen.] in the original release) Next, point to what's causing Jinxie's out-of-control emotion. Finally, hit Probe again ([X / Y / R]) to try and get to the heart of the matter! (Changed from [Finally, tap Probe again (X) to try and get to the heart of the matter!] in the original release) Apollo: (Okay, let's give this a try.) Jinxie: Y-Y-Yokai! Yokai! Right there in that room! Probe Cat Monster on a Wheel of Fire Apollo: Leads to: \"Jinxie, what's the name for that yokai on a wheel of fire?\" Apollo: Jinxie, what's the name for that yokai on a wheel of fire? Jinxie: Th-That's... a Kasha, a yokai that steals the bodies of the recently deceased! I bet it came to steal the alderman's! Apollo: It's almost creepy how well that fits the actual situation. Athena: Exactly! It's a form of hallucination where the patient can't see things for what they are! There must be something at the scene of the crime that she's mistaking for a Kasha! Apollo, you need to point out what she thought was a yokai on a wheel of fire! Apollo: (Hmm... I think I know the answer now.) Jinxie, that wasn't a Kasha you saw. Could you have possibly mistaken this for a Kasha? Present chandelier Apollo: Leads to: \"The light fixture?\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: This is what you mistook for a Kasha! Athena: What? That thing? Apollo: No? Jinxie: I'd never mistake that for a Kasha! Apollo: Really? Athena: You have to consider what a Kasha looks like, Apollo. Think, brightly blazing wheel near the ceiling. Apollo: (Okay... Let's give this another try.) Leads back to: \"Could you have possibly mistaken this for a Kasha?\" Jinxie: The light fixture? Apollo: This one right here. It has a flame design and is up there on the ceiling. There was never a yokai on a wheel of fire. The Kasha you saw was just a light fixture! Jinxie: Eeeeeek! Athena: That's one memory back to normal! Nice job! Now that you've got the hang of it, it should be a cinch to point out the rest! Apollo: Jinxie! What about this white wall-like monster? Jinxie: Th-That's Nurikabe! It's a wall monster that blocks your way or leads you astray! Apollo: That's no yokai, Jinxie! It's a folding screen! Jinxie: Eeeeek! Apollo: And this racoon dog isn't a tanuki monster, it's just the statue of one! Jinxie: Eeeeeeeeek! Apollo: And look! These are just coffee cups. And this right here? It's nothing more than a fox statue! Jinxie: Eeeeeeeeeeeek! I don't know what I was thinking! NOISE LEVEL50% Athena: You did it, Apollo! Her extreme fear is under control now! Jinxie: It was all just my eyes playing tricks on me. There weren't any yokai after all! Athena: See! A clear-cut statement. That's the power of my psychology and your intuition, Apollo! And just like we thought, there never really were any yokai in the Fox Chamber! Blackquill: .........Right. There never really were any yokai there. So, the defense is asserting the exact opposite of their original assertion? Apollo: ............Wait. Um, Jinxie? What about Tenma Taro? Jinxie: There wasn't anyone there dressed up as Tenma Taro, or any other yokai, either. I remember it clearly now. Apollo: You've-- Athena: Gotta-- Apollo: Be-- Jokiiiiiiiiiing!!! Judge: Order! Order in the court! Apollo: I think we just dug our own grave. Blackquill: Allow me to push you on in. It's the least I can do. Apollo: Nooo...! Athena: Apollo! Can I interrupt your freak-out for just a minute? I'm still picking up some noise! It's an unexpected emotion! Apollo: Does that mean Jinxie hasn't remembered everything yet? Athena: Exactly! We should be able to get something else out of her! I'll enter the new information we have and run an update! Jinxie: Did I see Tenma Taro in the Fox Chamber? Jinxie: I was so scared when I entered the room... Jinxie: ... my legs gave out and I fell to the floor. Pinpoint Sad marker Apollo: Leads to: \"The amount of fear you felt is rather low despite your legs having given out from fright.\" Jinxie: There in the Fox Chamber I saw... *shiver* Jinxie: ...the alderman dead on a table and papa collapsed in a chair. Jinxie: Nobody else was there! And that includes Tenma Taro! Apollo: Wait. What am I supposed to do? Athena: Try to find the emotions that contradict her statements. Apollo: So if I find a contradictory emotion, I should point it out? Athena: That's right. But it's not just contradictory emotions you should look out for. You should also keep an eye out for sudden changes in an emotion's intensity. Her emotions might get stronger or weaker as you move from statement to statement. It's important to compare how the same emotion changes throughout the testimony. Apollo: Contradictory emotions and changes in intensity... Okay, I'll give it a shot. Apollo: The amount of fear you felt is rather low despite your legs having given out from fright. Could something have lessened your fear? Jinxie: Actually, I did experience a sudden burst of courage at that moment. Apollo: You did? Where did it come from? Jinxie: Um... uh... Let me think... Oh, it was Mama. I suddenly felt as if she was there with me. Athena: Okay, I'll enter, \"Sudden burst of courage.\" Now, let's see... Ah! Look! Apollo, the noise is all gone! Jinxie seems to have remembered everything now! NOISE LEVEL0%BYE BYE Apollo: A sudden burst of courage... Now where could that have come from? Jinxie, was there something that gave you a sudden burst of courage? Jinxie: Um, yes there was, b-but... um... I, uh... I realized I had done something naughty when I thought about it later. Athena: Any idea what could have given Jinxie that courage? Apollo: Well, there IS one piece of evidence that comes to mind. I wonder if she saw something like it at the scene of the crime. Jinxie, did your sudden burst of courage have anything to do with this? Present Nine-Tails Flower Apollo: Leads to: \"Jinxie, you didn't happen to see a Nine-Tails Flower there at the scene, did you?\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: Could it have been this?! Jinxie: ...Huh? Apollo: (Oh... That's not encouraging...) Athena: The evidence you presented seems to have produced confusion rather than courage. Apollo: Guess I got that one wrong. Athena: Well, if at first you don't succeed... You know the rest, Apollo! Leads back to: \"Jinxie, did your sudden burst of courage have anything to do with this?\" Apollo: Jinxie, you didn't happen to see a Nine-Tails Flower there at the scene, did you? Jinxie: Ah! The demon lawyer strikes again. I can't hide anything from you. I found a small case with a picture of a Nine-Tails Flower on it. I liked it so much, I kept it! Apollo: You what?! You can't remove evidence from a crime scene! Judge: That's right, young lady. Removing evidence is a big no-no. Now, the witness will produce said evidence this instant! Jinxie: S-Sorry, sorry... Judge: Hmm... It does seem to be some sort of case. Oh, look, something slid out. It... appears to be a key! Blackquill: Might I have a look, Your Baldness? Hmmm......... Ah! This is none other than the master key to Kyubi Manor. Judge: Are you certain of this, Prosecutor Blackquill? Blackquill: It matches the serial number of the key that went missing after the murder. Apollo: A master key... that went missing? (Why don't I like the sound of that...?) Blackquill: Our little scamp here has stumbled upon an article of unimaginable consequence. Apollo: That's a little melodramatic, don't you think? Blackquill: Hmph. Heed these words, for I shall say them but once. The sole key to the Fox Chamber has been in this little scamp's constant possession. Ergo, she was the sole person who could use it before, during, and after the murder. Which leaves the master key as the only other key that could have opened the chamber. But this master key... ...was found in a room that had been locked by this girl. Apollo: And your point is? Blackquill: Until Jinxie Tenma opened the Fox Chamber with her key... ...the room had been locked tight from the outside world. And there was no one else in there, save the victim and his killer. I trust you have figured it out for yourself by now. A killer other than Mayor Tenma himself would be utterly inconceivable! Apollo: Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Athena: Athena: How... could... this... happen...?! Nnrrrrrrgh...! Judge: The defense's assistant will refrain from growling her frustrations! Apollo: A-Athena, are you all right? Athena: Ugh! I know Mayor Tenma's innocent, but there's nothing we can do! Widget: This sucks! Blackquill: ...Cykes-dono. Allow me to put you out of your misery. Athena: Can I decline your offer? Blackquill: Abandon your client and your misplaced faith in him. Let the relief of a clear head and a clean conscious come rushing in. That will make the inevitable guilty verdict far easier to accept. Apollo: (Great. Now he's playing Simon Says with us! Well, he's not going to fool us with his stupid mind games! (Changed from [Well, he's not going fool [sic] us with his stupid mind games!] in the original release)) Athena, don't fall for his tricks! Athena: Uuh... Now I'M the one who's dazed and confused. I can't even think straight. Apollo: Hey, are you all right?! (She fell right into his trap!) Blackquill: Now, I suggest you make a mad dash from the courtroom and into the wild blue yonder. Only by running shall your mind be cleared and your conscious cleansed. Athena: All right, I'll be back in 10! Apollo: Apollo: Stay with me, Athena! Don't let yourself be twisted by that samurai! Athena: Apollo? Judge: Mr. Justice? ...I heard the word objection, but what is it you object to? Apollo: Huh...? Oh, right... (That objection was more of a reflex than anything else... ...though I was hoping something would come to me while I was trying to stop Athena...) Judge: The court is waiting, Mr. Justice. Though as it stands now... ...I'll be forced to declare your client guilty and your legal skills suspect if this is it. Now, do you have anything that could overturn the prosecution's case? Apollo: Um, well... Actually, I do! I'm Apollo Justice, and I'm fine! Athena: Apollo! You do have something more than your Chords of Steel, don't you? Apollo: Not really, but we'll be fine! Athena: B-B-But...! Apollo: (I've got absolutely nothing, but that's never stopped me before! I have to explain how the real killer could have escaped that locked room. Because it's all over if I don't!) Athena: Apollo, this calls for a new approach! Try to think outside the box! Apollo: Or in this case, inside the box! (And what a doozy that locked room is, too.) Judge: Well, Mr. Justice? Do you have anything that can counter the prosecution's argument? Apollo: Y-You bet I do! The real killer must have escaped from the locked room one way or another! Blackquill: Vague conjecture shall only earn you a taste of my blade, Justice-dono. Apollo: Err... (Time to do or die, literally!) Judge: The defense will now explain how it would be possible to escape the locked room. Athena: Y-You sure about this, Apollo? Can you really explain what happened? Apollo: I-I'm fine! We just need to think this whole escaping-a-locked-room thing over from the beginning! So... let's see. If the killer had escaped... ...how could they have done so? Athena: The choices are pretty limited. The room has a window, but... ...it doesn't open wide enough for anyone to get through, and there's a sheer cliff outside. As for the air vent... ...it's up too high and there's nothing you could stand on to reach it. And needless to say... ...the Forbidden Chamber wouldn't open no matter what we did, so that's out. Apollo: Yeah, that's why we gotta keep the solution simple. Like they say, simple is best. (Changed from [Yeah, that [sic] why we gotta keep the solution simple. Like they say, simple is best.] in the original release) We need to rule out all of the absolutely impossible escape routes. Then, whatever's left just might lead us to how the Fox Chamber was compromised! Your Honor! The defense proposes that the killer escaped through here! Present Fox Chamber door Apollo: Leads to: \"The hallway door? Well, yes, I suppose that would be the only way out.\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Judge: Hmm... And just how did the killer escape through there, Mr. Justice? Your reasoning skills seem as questionable as your proposed escape route. Apollo: Ack! I wish I could escape right now. Judge: I'm afraid there's no escaping a penalty for your random guessing, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Um, could I try that one again? Leads back to: \"Your Honor! The defense proposes that the killer escaped through here!\" Judge: The hallway door? Well, yes, I suppose that would be the only way out. Blackquill: .........Hmph. It would appear you've already forgotten. The only available key until Jinxie Tenma came on scene was within that locked room. How would one exit the Fox Chamber, and then lock it without a key? Hmm? Apollo: I should've seen this coming... Athena: Remember Apollo, keep it simple. Apollo: Simple, right. I could understand if the killer had exited the room with the key, but... Judge: Well, Mr. Justice? The prosecution has some fine Japanese steel waiting unless you explain yourself quickly. Apollo: I-I'm fine! I can explain myself! The reason the Fox Chamber's hallway door was locked was because... Tenma locked it from inside Apollo: Mayor Tenma locked it himself after the killer fled the scene... ...just in case the killer decided to return. That would explain why the room was locked! Judge: Yes, I see... Then again, wouldn't Mayor Tenma have mentioned that himself? Apollo: Oh, uh, maybe it slipped his mind because of that blow to his head? Aaaaaagh! Blackquill: ...Hmph. I have already considered and investigated such possibilities. Apollo: You have? Blackquill: The mayor's fingerprints were not found on the door or its doorknob. The only fingerprints found belonged to the alderman. Ergo, the mayor did not so much as touch the door. Apollo: (Oops.) Okay, then how about... Leads back to: \"The reason the Fox Chamber's hallway door was locked was because...\" It locked on its own Apollo: Maybe the door closed accidentally... on its own. (Changed from [Maybe the door closed accidently [sic]... on its own.] in the original release) Ack! Blackquill: The killer will never be identified if we attribute key moments to mere chance. Perhaps that spear just happened to fly off of the wall and impale the alderman, too. And perhaps that sedative just happened to make its way into his coffee. Mere chance could explain any number of things. Apollo: Right, um... next idea, then... Leads back to: \"The reason the Fox Chamber's hallway door was locked was because...\" The perp locked it from outside Leads to: \"What if the door was locked from the outside?\" Apollo: What if the door was locked from the outside? In other words, the killer took the key through the hallway door, then locked it-- Youch! Blackquill: Consider this: The master key was found inside the tightly locked Fox Chamber. Any assertion that the key was removed from that room is a blatant contradiction of fact. Athena: Exiting the room before locking the door WOULD require taking the key outside. But the key was found inside the room, which does seem like a contradiction. Apollo: If only we could explain both. Like, how the key could be inside the room AND be used to lock the door from outside. Judge: Well, let's see if the defense can respond before Prosecutor Blackquill draws his sword. (Changed from [Well, let's see if the defense can response [sic] before Prosecutor Blackquill draws his sword.] in the original release) How could the master key be at the crime scene, despite the room being locked tight? Slipped it in when the door was opened Apollo: Maybe someone threw it in from the hallway when Jinxie opened the door? That would explain-- Aaah! Blackquill: .........Hmph. Perhaps we should ask the little scamp herself. When you opened the Fox Chamber, did you witness anyone throw the master key inside? Jinxie: Sorry. I didn't see anyone else there. Apollo: Oh... Blackquill: What a pity. Or perhaps you intend to accuse the witness of murder? Judge: You leave me no choice. A penalty for random speculation and lack of foresight. Apollo: Ugh. (How could've someone gotten the key into that locked room?) Judge: Let's try that again. Leads back to: \"How could the master key be at the crime scene, despite the room being locked tight?\" Threw it in from outside Leads to: \"What if someone threw it into the room from outside -- you know, something like...\" Changed the lock Apollo: If the door had been rebuilt after the key was placed in the room... ...that would explain how it got there! Judge: Hmm... And the original door? Where did that disappear to? Apollo: Well, I guess it's highly unlikely that the door was rebuilt in the first place, so-- Ack! Judge: Penalty! Apollo: Ugh. (How could've someone gotten the key into that locked room?) Judge: Let's try that again. Leads back to: \"How could the master key be at the crime scene, despite the room being locked tight?\" Apollo: What if someone threw it into the room from outside -- you know, something like... ...go out the hallway door, lock the room, and then toss the key back in through the window. That would explain how the master key could be inside the locked room! Blackquill: ...And where would you throw it from? There is a cliff outside the Fox Chamber's window. Throwing the key in from there is an impossibility. Apollo: .........Oh! Right... Ack! Athena: I wonder if the key could've been tossed in from somewhere other than the window. Apollo: Somewhere other than the window? Hmm... Could the key have been tossed in through somewhere other than the window? Present Air Duct Apollo: Leads to: \"The air vent?\" Present window Apollo: Apollo: I propose the key was tossed in through the window! Blackquill: It seems the defense has developed a case of amnesia. A sheer cliff lies just outside that window. No one tossed in anything through there. Apollo: What if you threw it in from the bottom of the cliff? I bet you could get it in if you threw it as hard as you could? Blackquill: ...Hmph. I'm afraid you would still have no ground to stand on, just as with your case. For you see, a raging river lies at the bottom of that cliff. Judge: A penalty for the amnesia-prone attorney! Apollo: Ugh. (So the key didn't get in through the window. Guess I'd better rethink this.) Leads back to: \"Could the key have been tossed in through somewhere other than the window?\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: I propose the key was tossed in through here! Judge: Hmm... And how would that even be possible? Apollo: Oh, um... Very carefully, Your Honor? Judge: ......... The defense will refrain from tossing around vague answers to key questions. Apollo: Ack! Judge: Let's try that again. How could the key have wound up in that locked room? Apollo: (Well, if it isn't the window, from where else could it have been thrown inside?) Leads back to: \"Could the key have been tossed in through somewhere other than the window?\" Judge: The air vent? Apollo: Yes. The window may be out of the question, but the air vent's not! Athena: Oh, that's right! The Fox Chamber's air duct... ...leads out into the hallway. Apollo: That's right. The real killer entered the air duct from the vent outside the Fox Chamber... ...then dropped the key into the room through the vent inside the chamber! Blackquill: Hrgh! That's preposterous! Athena: Ooh, that explains how the key got in there after it was used to lock the door perfectly! Judge: Mr. Justice! Um... I'm afraid I'm a bit confused... Apollo: Don't worry! I'll explain it so even Your Honor can understand. First, the real killer, disguised as Tenma Taro, murdered the alderman in the Fox Chamber. Then, they fled the room through the hallway door and locked it. Next, they entered the air duct from the vent outside in the hallway. Finally, the killer tossed the key into the room through the air vent in the ceiling there! All that was left to do after that was go back through the duct and flee the manor! Well, Your Honor?! Could that be any clearer?! Judge: Amazing! Even I could follow that! Athena: The judge seems really pleased. Apollo: That explains everything! The real killer was someone dressed up like Tenma Taro. And there WAS someone else other than the mayor and the alderman in that room! Man: Hey, it looks like that lawyer has beaten the jailbird prosecutor! Man: Whoa! That was a total turnabout! Woman: That massive forehead of his seems so much more attractive now! Judge: Order! Order! Order, I say!!! Apollo: Now that I've proved a possible third party, I don't see how our client could be guilty! Blackquill: Blackquill: ..........A valiant effort, Justice-dono, but your final thrust missed its mark. Apollo: Huh? Blackquill: Both that little scamp and the tricksy tanuki saw the yokai after it left the room. But then what? Did that irksome yokai simply go through the foyer and waltz right out the front door? Apollo: Th-That's exactly what happened! The killer fled from the-- Youch! Blackquill: But that is impossible -- without being spotted by the foyer's security camera, that is. The electric eye here would have captured any pesky little yokai trying to escape. However, there is no sign of Tenma Taro anywhere in the security footage. Apollo: Wh-Wh-What?! Blackquill: Save for the foyer entrance, there is no other way to flee the manor, is there? Apollo: I don't feel so good. Athena: Athena: Wait! I believe there IS one other way to escape besides the foyer entrance! There's a large window in the foyer. It's possible to escape through there without being seen by the security camera. Apollo: Hey, you're right! Blackquill: Blackquill: Hmph. Must I point out every crucial detail to the defense? It seems you lack not only brains, but investigative prowess to boot. That is the cliff side of the manor. The only killer escaping that way would be a dead one. Athena: N-Nooooooooon! Apollo: Wait... So the killer didn't escape out the foyer window? Widget: What the heck, right? Blackquill: ....Ha! I suppose your next proposal is the killer sprouted wings and flew off into the sunset? Apollo: (That would mean the killer really was a yokai...) Athena: ...If only we had some sort of evidence that could point to a flying killer. Apollo: Who's saying we don't? (As completely far-fetched as it might be...) Athena: WHAAAT?! You're saying you can prove the killer could fly?! Apollo: Whoa! I thought I was the one with the Chords of Steel! Judge: Oh, I can't wait to hear this. Apollo: Um, Your Honor...? Judge: What evidence do you have that the killer flew away? Present Special Edition Paper Apollo: Leads to: \"Take a look at this special edition paper.\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: This piece of evidence shows that the killer yokai flew through the sky! Blackquill: ............ Apollo: ............ Blackquill: ............ Apollo: Never mind. Lemme try that again. Judge: Mr. Justice! You wouldn't be trying to escape without a penalty, would you?! Apollo: (I know we have some kind of evidence of a flying yokai.) Blackquill: Justice-dono, surrender yourself now or suffer the death of a thousand cuts. Apollo: N-Never! Leads back to: \"What evidence do you have that the killer flew away?\" Apollo: Take a look at this special edition paper. Judge: \"Tenma Taro: Real or Flight of Fancy?\" ...What does this article prove, Mr. Justice? Apollo: The photo in that article was taken shortly after the murder. Maybe the yokai in that photo is the killer shortly after they fled out of the window...? Judge: M-Mr. Justice! You're not seriously suggesting--! Apollo: Oh, I'm serious! I mean, it all adds up! The killer, disguised as Tenma Taro, flew away! You know, by some way or another! Blackquill: Blackquill: It is your brain that has flown the coop. (Changed from [It is your brain that has flow [sic] the coop.] in the original release) That image is naught but trick photography or some other form of artifice. Apollo: Okay, then, how about the Tenma Taro figure Mr. Filch saw? It just vanished into thin air? Blackquill: .........No, there is a rational, common-sense explanation for that. That infernal yokai our tricksy tanuki witnessed never reached the entrance. He -- or should I say she -- turned back before the camera's electric eye. Apollo: ......She? (I don't like where this is going one bit!) Blackquill: Now, the fact that we know the yokai had come from the Fox Chamber... ...means that it was likely either Mayor Tenma or his daughter Jinxie Tenma. However, we know that Mayor Tenma was already unconscious at that time. Apollo: *gulp* (Not good. Not good at all!) Blackquill: Do you understand the gravity of the situation now, Justice-dono? The falsified yokai remnants... ...and the appearance of \"Tenma Taro\" were the work of one individual. And that individual is none other than Jinxie Tenma! Apollo: ............ Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh! Nooooooooooooooooooooooo! Judge: Order! Order! The defense will stop competing for the greatest freak-out ever! Blackquill: The little scamp was, no doubt, simply trying to protect her father. And it's no wonder that her superstitious mind conjured up this mad masquerade. Judge: Prosecutor Blackquill's assertion makes perfect sense to me. It's far more convincing than saying the killer escaped by flying out of the window. Blackquill: Hmph. Did you truly believe this could end any other way? Apollo: (Did we fall right into his trap?) Athena: What do we do now, Apollo? Apollo: Our case no longer stands without a real yokai. If only we had one. Blackquill: Bailiff, seize her! It is time I interrogated her as the samurai of yore would. ???: Apollo: M-Mayor Tenma? Tenma: ......... Blackquill: Hmph. This farce is over. How does it feel, seeing your own daughter accused of a cover-up most foul? Tenma: ......... Tenma Taro's true identity is-- Blackquill: Now, now, Mr. Mayor. It would be futile at this point to claim you were the yokai. After all, you had been knocked out cold by a blow to the skull. Slipping into a yokai costume and roaming about the manor would be all but impossible. Tenma: ......... Blackquill: Consider this well. As it stands, your daughter will be arrested for obstruction of justice. But if you confess, the prosecution would be willing to overlook her little yokai farce. Judge: Confess? The defendant intends to confess?! Apollo: Wait! Athena: Apollo! Prosecutor Blackquill's up to his mind games again! Apollo: Mayor Tenma! No! Don't fall for his twisted words! If you're sent away for murder, Jinxie will be left all alone! Tenma: .........The real killer is... Athena: Mayor Tenma's going to confess unless we do something! Apollo: (But... But I can't prove how the real killer could've flown away...) Tenma: ............ Caw caw-caw-caw! Look upon me and despair, for ripe is the time for my return. Apollo: Hm? (Uh-oh... I should watch what I wish for.) Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! Foolish mortals! I am Tenma Taro, the yokai you seek! Apollo: Um... M-Mayor Tenma? Tenma: Silence! I am Tenma Taro -- freed from the bonds binding me to the Forbidden Chamber! Behold! The return of the Demon King! Apollo: Wh-What the--?! Athena: Demon King...?! Judge: Well then, I think it's time for me to... ...t-take a vacatioooon! The witness will...! Um... He will explain himself! Are you saying you're Tenma Taro, the yokai we've been chasing this whole time? Tenma: Indeed, it is I, Tenma Taro, the one whom you seek -- come to reveal the truth. This child is Tenma Taro, you say? Hah! What nonsense! Apollo: So, Mayor Tenma... is a yokai now? Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! His body is now mine! Judge: So, you're saying that Mayor Tenma is... being possessed by you? And that the yokai that Jinxie Tenma and Phineas Filch saw... ...and the one captured in the newspaper photo... Those were all you? Tenma: The accursed power of these warding charms prevents me from revealing my true form. Apollo: ......... Blackquill: Your Baldness! .........Can this not be interpreted as an admission of guilt?! Judge: Well, a confession by a yokai would be quite unprecedented. Blackquill: Be that as it may, the defense's case has been overturned. Apollo: Huh? What?! Blackquill: You claimed the yokai that little scamp saw was some third party -- the true killer... ...the one who escaped from the locked Fox Chamber, but it was the accused all along. Apollo: Argh! Blackquill: Ironic, is it not? Your yokai turned out to be real in a manner of speaking. For the alderman's killer is none other than Mayor Tenma! And the yokai at the scene? That, too, was Mayor Tenma, or should I say, our dear Tenma Taro! The pieces have all fallen into place. Apollo: H-How so, Prosecutor Blackquill? Blackquill: Hmph. It seems I must spell it out for you. Mayor Tenma killed the alderman in the Fox Chamber -- which was locked at the time. He then removed the warding charms from the Forbidden Chamber's door... ...but then fell unconscious from the blow the alderman had delivered to his head. That's when his daughter Jinxie Tenma stumbled on the scene of the crime. The little scamp fled in terror, whereupon the spirit of Tenma Taro... ...freed at last from the charm's warding effect, took possession of the mayor. The newly freed Tenma Taro then fled from the Fox Chamber. So, you see, the yokai Jinxie Tenma saw was her father possessed by Tenma Taro. Apollo: Apollo: But when we arrived on scene, the mayor was found unconscious! How's that possible if he was supposed to have flown out the foyer window?! Blackquill: Then, what? Do you mean to say the maid of Kyubi Manor, Jinxie Tenma, was Tenma Taro? Apollo: ............Oh. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Tenma: Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! That, too, is easily explained. Flew about for a time did I, but presently tired, I made for the Forbidden Chamber. But alas, exhaustion took me unaware in the Fox Chamber, and I knew no more. Blackquill: Hmph. It would seem the pieces are still in place. Apollo: (Is Blackquill up to his tricks again?) Judge: I-I don't know what to say. Is the defendant a real live...? Man: So that rumor about Mayor Tenma is true? I knew yokai were real! Man: You mean he really did kill the alderman just so he could release Tenma Taro?! Judge: Order! Order!!! Athena: Now he's got everyone in the courtroom believing in yokai! Apollo: It's Simon Says on steroids! He wants to convict our client any way he can -- even if it means blaming a yokai! Blackquill: The proverbial ducks are all in a row. You should now have no qualms about finding the accused guilty, Your Baldness. Judge: Hmm... This is one of the most bizarre cases in my entire career. Otherworldly, in fact. Can yokai even be prosecuted under our legal system? Apollo: Apollo: Mayor Tenma is just pretending to be Tenma Taro to protect his daughter. Plus, I already proved how a third party could have escaped from the locked room! A verdict at this point would be premature! Judge: Hmm... Since both sides have raised valid points, I've no choice but to-- Blackquill: Blackquill: Hmph! This is the dark age of the law where defense attorneys are not to be trusted. This is but a ploy to gain time for them to fabricate evidence! How will I sleep tonight... ...knowing you will not let the run rise on the mayor's day of reckoning, Justice-dono? Apollo: Apollo: I won't fabricate any evidence! Blackquill: Blackquill: Then prove it by joining me. A night in the clink will ensure you will not succumb to temptation! Apollo: How about I just promise not to succumb to anything? Blackquill: We have both evidence and a confession. The killer is this yokai before us. It is beyond dispute. A guilty verdict is all but-- Uuuwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Apollo: What's wrong with him? Fulbright: Prosecutor Blackquill! We've had enough of your hijinks! The foundation of justice is fair play, and you are in serious violation of that! Blackquill: *huff* *huff* What in the devil was that? Fool Bright! Have you tampered with my shackles in some manner? Fulbright: Ha ha ha ha! It seems you found that quite shocking. It's my special Jolt of Justice device. Each press is a shocking reminder to behave. Blackquill: You shall pay for this. I, Simon Blackquill, vow to-- Uuuwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Fulbright: Your Honor! You need not fear now! I believe Prosecutor Blackquill will remain on his best behavior. Apollo: ...A bit late with the reassurances, aren't we, Detective? Judge: W-Well, in that case... *ahem*... This concludes today's deliberations. The prosecution and the defense will use this opportunity to further their investigations. This court is adjourned! To be continued Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: That statement clearly contradicts the evidence! Blackquill: ...Hmph. I object to you on personal grounds. The sole contradiction lies in what your faulty logic dreamt up just now. Apollo: Ack! Judge: Objection overruled. The defense will think twice before making such erroneous statements! Apollo: (It seems that statement didn't particularly conflict with the evidence.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: Consider the evidence. There's obviously something wrong with that statement! Blackquill: Your gall knows no bounds. It's shocking, really. Apollo: What's that supposed to mean?! Blackquill: You stand there, brazely objecting to perfectly factual statements... One does not see such shameless behavior that often. Judge: A penalty for our shameless attorney! Apollo: (Oh, no. Looks like Blackquill is turning the judge against me.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: The evidence is at complete odds with the witness's testimony! Blackquill: ...........................Your Baldness. Judge: Wh-Who, me? Blackquill: What do you make of this objection of his? Judge: Oh, I don't know if I should, um, well... Blackquill: I've no patience for vagaries. Now, answer my question. Judge: Y-Yes, sir! The defense's objection was clearly misguided! Blackquill: Bravo. Nicely done. Judge: Ho ho ho. It seems our misguided attorney has earned himself a penalty. Apollo: (Erk... I better look before I leap next time!) Consult (when evidence must be presented) Athena: Hmm... There has to be a contradiction here somewhere. Apollo: (Too bad I'm drawing a blank.) Athena: There was a statement that I thought was a little strange, but... ...I wouldn't bet my life on it. Apollo: .........And which statement would that be? Since I'm the one betting my life on it. Athena: Hee hee hee. Okay, if you must know, I'll show you the one I'm thinking of. Apollo: (Time to swallow my pride and let her lend a hand.) (There must be an inconsistency in the testimony Athena's pointing out!) Consult (when statements must be pressed) Athena: Hmm... I can't flag any inconsistencies. Apollo: So there haven't been any contradictions in the testimony so far... That can mean only one thing... Athena: Time to press the witness! Apollo: Right. We'll have to work to get the testimony we need. Let's press the heck out of any statements that stick out. Pinpoint wrong emotion (during Mood Matrix segment \"What Jinxie Saw\") Apollo: Apollo: Hmm... This seems like an unnatural reaction... Athena: Really? Because I don't see it that way. Apollo: So it isn't unexpected given her testimony? Athena: Hello? Is there anybody in there? Just nod if you can hear me. Apollo: (Yes, there is someone at home, and that someone is going to try that again.) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's argument is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims! This court finds the defendant, Damian Tenma... Guilty The Monstrous Turnabout Image Gallery Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 April 18, 1:20 PMWright Anything Agency Athena: Having a yokai testify in court is unprecedented to say the least. Apollo: \"I am Tenma Taro, the yokai you seek!\" How could such a straight-laced man like Mr. Tenma suddenly become a demon? Athena: Yeah, it's strange. Even worse, Prosecutor Blackquill is playing along. *sigh* I can't even think straight anymore. I need to go out for a run! See you in a bit! Apollo: Wait! What about the--! ...Investigation. Trucy: Back! ...Eek! Athena: Whoa, whoa! Trucy, welcome back. Oh, you're in your stage outfit. Back from work? Trucy: Yep! I really nailed this new magic trick I've been working on! ...I also heard about those tricks that were conjured up in court earlier today. You know, the demon-out-of-nowhere trick and Polly's tightrope-style defense trick! Apollo: I was seriously considering a disappearing act of my own after all that craziness. ...Anyway, our next trick is to find a suspect other than the mayor. I know the killer must've used the air duct in the escape. Athena: And whoever did that was the Tenma Taro that Mr. Filch and Jinxie saw. Apollo: Right. Maybe there's some evidence in the air duct. Athena: The real fight starts right now! Trucy: Hey, before you go, let me make the evidence you no longer need disappear! 3, 2, 1... Ta-dah! Unnecessary evidence has disappeared into Trucy's magic panties. Apollo: (I wonder where all that stuff goes?) Athena: Okay, let's get over to the scene of the crime! ¡Vámonos, Apollo, Vámonos! (Changed from [Vamonos, Apollo, Vamonos!] in the original release) April 18Kyubi Manor - Fox Chamber Athena: Detective Fulbright! Mind if we search the air duct? Fulbright: Well, since you really are on the side of justice, I suppose I can let you... Plus, my own sense of justice has been called into doubt, so... Athena: Wonder if he's been like this ever since the trial. Apollo: Well, his sense of justice HAS been beaten to a pulp. It'll probably take a while for him to recover. Athena: I sorta feel bad for him, but we have work to do! Let's go get the evidence we need! Apollo: The air duct is the key. We know the Tenma Taro impersonator used it to make an escape. After murdering the alderman, the killer left the Fox Chamber through the hallway door. Then, after locking the door from the outside... ...the killer entered the air duct in the hallway. Finally, the killer dropped the key into the Fox Chamber through the air vent here... ...then went back through the duct and fled the manor. That's how the illusion of no one entering or leaving the locked room was created! Athena: If the killer passed through the air duct, maybe we'll find some evidence there. Apollo: Yeah, maybe some black feathers or something like that. Well, here's our vent. It's awfully high up. Athena: Don't worry, I brought a stepladder! Happy hunting! Apollo: (How nice of her to volunteer me for the job.) Whoa, it's pitch black in here. Well, here goes nothing! *cough, cough* *wheeze* *sputter* *cough, cough* There's a thick layer of dust in here! *cough, cough* *wheeze* *sputter* *cough, cough* ............ ...I don't... get it. Athena: Find anything? Yikes! Apollo, what happened?! You're covered in dust! Apollo: Yeah, dust... Lots of dust. Athena: So, what'd you find? Apollo: You know how dust collects on something when nobody uses it for a long time? Athena: Yeah, like Mr. Wright's desk back at the office. Apollo: Right... You think it'd be possible to crawl over that sort of dust without leaving a trail? Athena: I seriously doubt it... Wait, you're not suggesting--! No one's gone through that duct lately?! Apollo: Kinda looks that way. And if it's true, Mayor Tenma is going to be fingered as the killer. Athena: B-B-But...! Apollo: (If we don't turn things around quickly...) Fulbright: In justice we trust! Apollo: Ack! Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Sorry, Mr. Justice! But it seems your justice was not the most just, after all! It is MY sense of justice that has prevailed! Apollo: Argh! Athena: Detective Fulbright sure seems chipper all of a sudden. Apollo: Ugh. And I'm back to my old devastated self. Fulbright: Aw, come on! Where's that never-say-die spirit? Bring it on, Mr. Lawyer Man! Bring it on! Apollo: Let me suffer in peace. Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Justice prevails once more! Athena: It's not over yet! And besides... Kicking someone when they're down is what bad guys do! Fulbright: Ack! A-Are you calling me a... a bad guy?! Me? Bobby Fulbright, champion of justice?! Athena: Then how about some information on the investigation? We need some help here! Fulbright: Information? About the investigation? All right! But I won't have you calling me a bad guy ever again! Understood?! Athena: We did it, Apollo! Apollo: Yeah, but how long can we keep this up? Talk The investigation Athena: I can't believe Prosecutor Blackquill would stoop that low! I mean, to pinning the blame on a yokai?! He really wants a conviction at all costs! Apollo: (She could give a yokai a run for its money when she's mad...) Fulbright: Yes, well... I have him writing a self-reflective essay as we speak! Athena: I doubt that'll teach him anything. Apollo: Yeah, he'll probably just write \"Dotard\" a thousand times. Fulbright: That whole yokai business is most likely a ploy to win a conviction. Truth is, Prosecutor Blackquill believes Jinxie Tenma planted that yokai stuff. Planted it in an effort to protect her father -- the real killer. Athena: Yeah, right! I'd like to see him prove it! Fulbright: Whoa! Calm down! He doesn't have any direct evidence, but we did find this. It was at the base of the cliff just outside Kyubi Manor. Apollo: Wait... That isn't the staff Tenma Taro was supposedly carrying, is it? Fulbright: The one and only! Ms. Tenma no doubt tossed it over the cliff when she was done. Athena: No way! W-Well, what about prints?! Fulbright: Nope, no prints, but if she was wearing a costume, there wouldn't be any, anyway. Apollo: Well, prints or no prints, it's not going to work out in our favor. (Sounds like the staff might have belonged to the mansion. But if that's the case... ...then where in the mansion did Tenma Taro get it from?) The Amazing Nine-Tails Apollo: Did Prosecutor Blackquill figure out that the victim was The Amazing Nine-Tails? Fulbright: He did, indeed. He's a sharp one, all right. He figured it out while investigating the municipal merger and the victim's past. The Amazing Nine-Tails sparked the yokai craze and worked against the merger! And Mayor Damian Tenma is the corrupt politician who murdered that great hero! The Amazing Nine-Tails's fans are so angry, they even tried to storm the detention center! Athena: I don't blame them. I mean, their favorite masked wrestling hero was murdered. They must've been shocked when they found out what happened. Apollo: Speaking of which, isn't Jinxie also a fan of The Amazing Nine-Tails? Jinxie: A wrestler's mask is more precious than his own life! He'd never unmask himself in front of others. But there ARE matches where wrestlers battle for the right to remove each other's masks. Jinxie: To have your mask torn off is the worst humiliation a wrestler could suffer! That's why their masks are more important to them than life itself. Athena: She spoke with a passion that only a fan could appreciate. We oughta become fans ourselves and go protest in front of the prison! Apollo: What? No! Did you forget that Mayor Tenma is not only Jinxie's father, but our client!? Athena: Oh, yeah. Fulbright: You be careful, now. You're defending the most hated mayor in history. I just hope you don't find yourself on the wrong end of a figure-four leg lock! Apollo: (Maybe I should wear a mask to hide MY identity.) Present Crime Photo Fulbright: Such a grisly crime scene! I won't rest until that murderous fiend is behind bars! Apollo: So, you still think Mayor Tenma is responsible? Fulbright: That's right! Damian Tenma is an evil fiend who must be banished from this world! Now, take my hand and together we will defeat this evil! Apollo: Um, I think you're forgetting that Mayor Tenma's still my client. Kyubi's Autopsy Report Apollo: So, it was the spear that killed the alderman? Fulbright: That's right. He'd been in a drug-induced sleep, but woke the moment he was impaled. That's when he was struck by his attacker! Apollo: That's almost superhuman. Fulbright: Justice cannot allow evil to exist unopposed! Even if it means sacrificing one's life! Athena: I bet you two could strike back even if you were impaled! I mean, you're so full of justice. Apollo: Really? Or are you just saying that because of my name, Athena? After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: Are there any other new developments we should know? Fulbright: Hm, now that you mention it... Our suspect is suffering partial memory loss, but he DID manage to remember something. Apollo: He did? What did he say? Fulbright: He said he didn't want to speak with us. His exact words were: \"I am under no obligation to speak with you mortals!\" ...and other things of that nature. Apollo: (I wonder what Mayor Tenma remembered.) Fulbright: Too bad you can't go ask him now, 'cause Prosecutor Blackquill's busy questioning him. I know! Why don't you wait down at the playground with the rest of the kids? Ha ha. Athena: What now, Apollo? Apollo: How about regrouping back at the agency? Athena: Good idea. We might get some words of wisdom out of Mr. Wright while we're there. Detention Center, Yokai Lane, Kyubi Manor Garden, or Kyubi Manor Foyer Talk Any ideas? Athena: So the crime scene was locked tight at the time. Ugh, this is a tough one. Apollo: The only people in that locked room were the deceased -- the alderman -- and the mayor. Athena: Maybe the killer hid somewhere in that room. Apollo: But is there really anywhere to hide in the Fox Chamber? The trial Athena: That was quite a day in court. The news just can't stop talking about how the demon Tenma Taro made an appearance! Apollo: There's never an exorcist around when you need one. Athena: Well, I heard the judge actually held an exorcism in his courtroom after that. Apollo: Good. Let's hope it's the last we'll see of that pain-in-the-neck yokai. Athena: I don't know. I have a feeling Tenma Taro could exorcise an exorcist. Apollo: As an attorney defending a demon, I know exactly how that feels. Present Amazing Nine-Tails Mask Athena: I can't believe Alderman Kyubi was The Amazing Nine-Tails! Apollo: Hmm, maybe that's why the killer targeted him. His popularity among the anti-merger faction would have been a major obstacle. Athena: Yeah... Maybe the alderman felt threatened, and that's why he had to disguise himself. Jinxie's Statement Athena: Do you think the Tenma Taro Jinxie saw was the real killer? Apollo: Hmm... It's hard to say at this point. Athena: But if that's not our killer, then what was it doing in the manor? Apollo: ...Maybe it just wanted to use the bathroom. Athena: Huh?! I've heard of monsters in the closet and under the bed. They're in the bathroom, too?! Apollo: No, what I'm saying is the Tenma Taro Jinxie saw was someone dressed up like a yokai. I mean, there is no such thing as monsters in the bathroom. People on the other hand... Athena: Oh, I get it. That was your attempt at a joke. Ha ha, very funny... Apollo: (For someone so competitive and smart, she sure get some crazy ideas.) April 18Wright Anything Agency Apollo: Maybe I'll... go read over some past cases... Athena: And I'll... go do some research on exorcisms... Trucy: Hey, what's with you guys? You seem bummed out. Apollo: How should I put this? It's like we're at the edge of a cliff and the only way is down. Trucy: In other words, business as usual, right? Apollo: Yeah, I suppose so. Except this time, it's like we're bound and gagged, too. Athena: Don't forget blindfolded with our ears plugged up... Trucy: Ooh, and monsters at every turn, huh? Sounds rough... ???: Hey, Apollo. Oh, and Athena's here, too. Athena: Mr. Wright. Phoenix: How goes the investigation, Apollo, Athena? Athena: I think it's safe to say that things have gotten hairier than before. Phoenix: Really? What happened? Talk Our defense Phoenix: I was watching the two of you this morning from the gallery. That was one tough day in court, to say the least. Apollo: I know. I've never had to defend a yokai before. Phoenix: That business about the locked room was another major hurdle. Athena: Yeah, and on top of that, Jinxie was accused of being an accomplice! Phoenix: But at least you figured out how someone could have escaped that locked room. (Changed from [But at least you figured out how someone could have escaped the Forbidden Chamber.] in the original release) Apollo: Yeah, well, we just found out that our reasoning might be a tad... flawed. Phoenix: Oh, really? Well, that's... bad news. Athena: How are we going to get out of this one...? Phoenix: The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles. Athena: Force... a smile? Phoenix: Yeah. My mentor taught me that back when I was still learning the trade. She... also taught me to return to the basics whenever I got stuck. Apollo: Return to the basics? Phoenix: That's right. Always believe in your client, no matter what happens. That is a lawyer's greatest and most trusted weapon. Apollo: The basics... (Always believe in your client, huh...) You and Athena Apollo: So, Mr. Wright, how long have you known Athena? Phoenix: I met her during a trip to Europe. Apollo: Huh!? Y-You were in Europe? (Why haven't I heard about this before?) Phoenix: Yeah, I went there a few times to study the various legal systems over there. Apollo: Oh, okay... Er, wait a minute. I thought you worked as a pianist after you quit practicing law. Phoenix: I did, but an old friend of mine needed help with some legal work from time to time, so... Apollo: Oh, I guess you were never very far from the courtroom, then. Athena: It was like fate brought us together! It's thanks to Mr. Wright that I became a lawyer at all. Phoenix: Ha ha ha. I knew she was lawyer material from the moment I met her. And I have high hopes for her ability to analyze people's emotions. Athena: Aww, it's nothing special. Apollo: (Hmm... Maybe I've underestimated that analytical psychology of hers.) Athena: It's just, I thought that if my special ability could help defend innocent people... ...then I had to do everything in my power to bring it to the courtroom! That's when I really started hitting the books hard! Phoenix: I'm still amazed she actually became a lawyer. And at the tender age of eighteen, no less. (Changed from [And at the tender age of 18, no less.] in the original release) Apollo: Wow, that's almost superhuman. (Or personal -- like she's trying to help somebody she knows.) (Changed from [Or personal -- like she [sic] trying to help somebody she knows.] in the original release) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Your attorney's badge, huh... I used to show mine to everyone, too. Apollo: Why? Phoenix: You know, I never really thought about it. But I could ask you the same question. Apollo: Me? Well, I guess you could say I show it because there's someone to show it to. ...Or something like that. Phoenix: Ah ha ha. When you say it like that, it sounds kind of... I don't know... philosophical? Apollo: Heh heh, I guess it does. (.........Or does it?) Yokai Legend Scroll Apollo: Here's a little souvenir Trucy wanted you to have. Phoenix: Aww, how sweet! I know. I'll hang it in my office once the case is closed. Apollo: I don't know, it's pretty creepy looking. We don't want to freak our clients out. Phoenix: Hmm... You have a point there. Maybe you should hang it in your room, Apollo. Apollo: My room?! I don't want this thing in there! Phoenix: I don't want it, either. It has instant nightmare fuel written all over it. Apollo: Well, Trucy got it for you, so stop trying to pawn it off on me! Phoenix: You know... The more I look at it, the more I wonder if these are your distant relatives. Apollo: Hey... What's that supposed to mean?! Crime Photo Phoenix: So the room was locked tight and the only people in there were the suspect and victim? I headed up a similar case a long time ago. Apollo: Really?! Phoenix: Not only that, the defendant was my assistant. Apollo: What?! Phoenix: And not only that, the prosecutor for that trial loved to swing her whip around in court. Apollo: A whip?! Phoenix: When I saw that whip... man, I thought it was all over. Apollo: Wait, your assistant getting accused of murder hadn't made you think that already...? Anything else Phoenix: Ah ha ha. You're getting good at this, Apollo. Remember, the way you present evidence in court can really have an impact on the trial. Hmm... But your elbow angle's a little off. It should really be more like this. Apollo: I-I'll be fine! I'll be more careful next time. Promise! After clearing all Talk options: Athena: All right! I'm totally pumped up after talking to you, Mr. Wright! It's like you said, the worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles! Phoenix: And don't forget to return to the basics whenever you get stuck. Apollo: (Keep believing in my client. Right!) Um, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes? Apollo: I'm... I'm going to go visit our client again! Phoenix: I think that's a good idea. Apollo: (Alright, time to see what's new down at the Detention Center!) April 18Detention Center - Visitor's Room Athena: Mayor Tenma, we wanted to talk to you about something! Tenma: Caw-shaaaaaaaaw! Athena: Eeek! Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! So, my minions have returned! Athena: Apollo, he still thinks he's a yokai! Apollo: I wonder if we'll ever be able to talk to Mayor Tenma again. Tenma: Silence, peddler of the legal trade! Free me from these imprisoning walls with great haste! Athena: Wow... He's sounding more and more like a real demon with every sentence. I'm starting to wonder if we should even be helping him win his freedom. Apollo: Still, we can't let Mayor Tenma stay possessed, you know what I mean? Tenma: If you can clear me of these charges, I shall help in whatever manner I may. Now, ask of me what you will! Apollo: I suppose it's worth a shot. Talk Feathers and tracks Apollo: Were those feathers and tracks at the scene of the crime really your doing? Tenma: Indeed! The remnants of Tenma Taro, King of the Underworld, they be! The day when I once again dominate the mortal world is at hand, caw caw-caw-caw! Athena: The prosecution claims the feathers and tracks were planted by Jinxie. Tenma: What's this?! I must breach these walls and go defend my little Jinxie at once! Athena: Huh? Mayor Tenma, is that you? Tenma: ! ...Grr! Well, now! Damian appears to still reside within this body. But I should have expected as much from a descendent of mine! Be silent, now, Damian! Apollo: (I guess a little thing like demonic possession won't stop a father's love for his daughter.) You didn't kill Alderman Kyubi, did you? Tenma: I have killed no one! The remnants of my presence have been misconstrued. The murderer is not I! For if I had slain that mortal... ...raging hellfire would have consumed him, leaving naught but ash! Apollo: Yikes! ............S-So... S-So... you're saying, there must have been somebody else there? (Come to think of it, the mayor had mentioned that he'd been clubbed with this statue. I'd better ask about this, too.) What you remembered Apollo: Detective Fulbright mentioned that you might have something new to tell me. Tenma: Indeed, I have. I regurgitated this key but a short while ago. Behold, the key to the Forbidden Chamber! Apollo: Whoa! Is regurgitation one of your demonic powers, too?! Tenma: Bah! I do not waste my powers on such parlor tricks! Take the key from the killer did Damian, whereupon he swallowed it. He sought to bar the killer entry to the Forbidden Chamber. Apollo: (So, he wanted to keep it shut tight?) Tenma: But no fingerprints shall you find upon that key. Apollo: How do you know that? ...Wait. Is THAT another one of your demonic powers, then?! Tenma: Foolish mortal! You would have me, Tenma Taro, act as some asinine alchemist?! I but asked the jailer and my will was done -- quite eagerly, I must add, caw caw-caw-caw! Guard: Always an honor to serve, Your Malevolence! Apollo: (Guess I'm not the only one he scares the living daylights out of.) Athena: Um, can we ask how you use this key? We couldn't find a keyhole anywhere in or around the door. Tenma: Curse that infernal door! But if I had known its manner of opening, long, long ago would I have made my return! Athena: He has a point there. Apollo: Maybe Jinxie knows something about how the whole thing works... Forbidden Chamber Key added to the Court Record. What you remembered (after correctly presenting Fox and Demon Statue) Apollo: Detective Fulbright mentioned that you might have something new to tell me. Tenma: Indeed, I have. I regurgitated this key but a short while ago. Behold, the key to the Forbidden Chamber! Apollo: Whoa! Is regurgitation one of your demonic powers, too?! Tenma: Bah!

Athena: He has a point there. Apollo: Maybe Jinxie knows something about how the whole thing works... Forbidden Chamber Key added to the Court Record. Apollo: (I should question him about the blackmail letter, too. Let's see what he says when I show it to him.) What you remembered (subsequent times) Apollo: Detective Fulbright mentioned that you might have something new to tell me. Tenma: Indeed, I have. I regurgitated this key but a short while ago. Behold, the key to the Forbidden Chamber! Apollo: Whoa! Is regurgitation one of your demonic powers, too?! Tenma: Bah! I do not waste my powers on such parlor tricks!

Athena: He has a point there. Apollo: Maybe Jinxie knows something about how the whole thing works... Blackmail letter (appears after correctly presenting Blackmail Letter) Apollo: Who placed this in the alderman's pocket? Tenma: Hrmmm. Very few were they who knew the letter was in Damian's briefcase. Apollo: So, whoever knew about the blackmail letter being in the mayor's briefcase... ...is a potential suspect in its theft and placement in the alderman's pocket. Tenma: Ah! Could it have been... HIS doing?! Apollo: Mr. Mayor, er... I mean, Mr. Taro! Did you just remember something?! Tenma: Indeed, I did. There was but one other who knew of that letter: Damian's aide Florent L'Belle. Full knowledge of that briefcase's contents did that aide possess. Apollo: Then he may be the blackmailer and the murderer we're looking for! Tenma: That is preposterous! He's a most trusted advisor. He would never betray Damian! Athena: It seems like Mayor Tenma is a bit too trusting of those around him. Apollo: (Still, this is HUGE! Now we know who might've slipped that blackmail letter in the alderman's pocket! Look out, Florent L'Belle, here comes Justice!) Athena: Let's go find Mr. L'Belle and rake him over the coals! Apollo: Thanks for the help. You've just given us a major lead! Blackmail Letter updated in the Court Record. Athena: Hmm... There's something that still bothers me. If Mr. L'Belle is the killer... ...what could have motivated him to open the Forbidden Chamber? Apollo: We should probably search it for clues. Athena: Only one problem. How do you open a locked door that doesn't have a keyhole? Apollo: Let's go talk to Jinxie. Maybe she can help. Blackmail letter (subsequent times) Apollo: Who placed this in the alderman's pocket?

How do you open a locked door that doesn't have a keyhole? Apollo: Let's go talk to Jinxie. Maybe she can help. Present Fox and Demon Statue (after clearing \"Feathers and tracks\" Talk option; before clearing \"What you remembered\" Talk option) Tenma: What, might I ask, is that? Apollo: This statue was found at the scene. Someone hit Mayor Tenma over the head with it. It had been wrapped in a large cloth before the alderman's murder. Tenma: Let me see whether Damian knows about such a thing... Hrmmm, yes... Something wrapped in just such a cloth does he recall. A secret gift from Alderman Kyubi it would seem. He, however, had not a chance to see it till now, for the cloth did conceal it. Apollo: Maybe the cloth fell off or was removed after the mayor was struck. Tenma: Hrmmm, of that Damian does not know. Apollo: (A secret gift? Interesting... Maybe Jinxie knows something about it...?)

Yokai Legend Scroll Tenma: Ages has it been since I've seen that. We often battled it out like this back in the day. Athena: I've been meaning to ask, which one of you was stronger? Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! That would be me, of course! For I am the demon lord of the yokai! Caw-shaaaaaaaaw! Athena: Yeah, but the Nine-Tailed Fox imprisoned you in-- Apollo: Athena! Don't encourage him! It's already hard enough as it is. Athena: Aw, I just wanted to find out which one was really the strongest. Special Edition Paper Tenma: Why, that is a photo of me soaring through the heavens. Hrmm, but look at my wing angle. It's all wrong. Athena: Wow, you're really a stickler for details. Tenma: I even gave a big smile for the camera... ...but so small am I in this shot that one can't even see it! Apollo: Never knew demons were so interested in how they're presented by the media. Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy Tenma: Hrmmm... A descendent of old Nine-Tails, perhaps? It would seem he's doing quite well these days. Apollo: Yeah, he's a huge hit from kids all the way up to their grandparents. Tenma: Hrmmm... It seems I've been resting on my laurels for far too long. It is time I, too, debut in the mortal world and rekindle my struggle against that wily fox. Athena: That's the spirit! You can make your debut as soon as we get you that not-guilty verdict! Tenma: Then I had best return to top form! Pushups and sit-ups should do for now. Caw caw-caw! Apollo: (Is he planning a new career as a pro wrestler?!) Blackmail Letter (after clearing \"What you remembered\" Talk option and correctly presenting Fox and Demon Statue) Tenma: Why this--! This is that accursed blackmail letter that was sent to Damian. Apollo: Apparently, somebody slipped it into the alderman's pocket. We believe someone, probably the killer, stole it from Mayor Tenma's briefcase. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you? Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! You have questions, do you? Very well, ask away, mortal! Anything else Apollo: Umm... I was hoping you'd take a look at this. Tenma: Hrmmm... An offering to me. Quite admirable. But the best thing you could offer me is to win me my freedom! Caw caw-caw-caw! Apollo: R-Right, right... I'll do my best! After clearing \"Blackmail letter\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: April 18Nine-Tails Vale - Yokai Lane Apollo: Hey, isn't that...? Jinxie: Grrr. You dare imprison me? Athena: Jinxie! She's... acting really strange. Jinxie: That loathsome, no-good Nine-Tailed Fox. He shall know the terror that is mine and despair. Grrr... Grrr. You shall pay. Oh, you shall pay dearly! ......All of you! Apollo: J-Jinxie, are you all right? Jinxie: ! Eeeeeek! Apollo: Aaaah! Jinxie: Oh! Is that you, Mr. Demon Lawyer? Apollo: ...Morning, Jinxie. Jinxie: Morning? Isn't it already past noon? And what am I doing here? Last I remember, I lay down to take a nap back at the manor. ......Oh, no! It must've been the Makuragaeshi! Apollo: Makura... gaeshi? Jinxie: Ever wake after a restless night's sleep to find your pillow in an unusual place... ...or that you've been sleeping on the floor or in the hallway? Well, it's that yokai's fault! The Makuragaeshi preys on people when they're asleep! Apollo: ...It sounds like you just need to be tucked in really tight, or maybe a snug sleeping bag. Athena: Jinxie, how come you don't have any charms on your forehead? Jinxie: I don't? Oh, they must've fallen off. Without them, evil things can creep into me. Apollo: (I'd say we had a more than adequate demonstration of that just now...) Jinxie: I'd better reapply them. Apollo: Jinxie, there's something we wanted to ask you. Jinxie: Ah! There was something I wanted to tell you, too! I... I remembered something else! Apollo: You did? What was it? Talk What you remember Apollo: Jinxie, can you tell us what you remembered? Jinxie: Well, after the trial I remembered lots of stuff. But there was one thing I thought was really weird. Apollo: (I'm almost afraid to ask, but here goes...) Really? What? Jinxie: Um... It's about the yokai feathers and tracks. They weren't there when I first opened the door! Apollo: Wait, whaaat?! Are you sure? Jinxie: Uh-huh. My memory's crystal clear now. Apollo: So, you're saying they were left at the crime scene after you found it? Athena: This could spell major trouble, Apollo. Apollo: Why? Athena: Because Jinxie is already accused of leaving the feathers and tracks at the scene. If they weren't there when she discovered the crime scene... ...it will totally fuel the claim that she fabricated the evidence later on. Apollo: Ack! Athena: Jinxie's fuzzy memory of the whole incident is really working against us. The prosecution will probably say she doesn't remember planting the evidence. Good luck rebutting that! Apollo: Oh, man, this is not good. (I sure hope she didn't plant the evidence while she was sleepwalking or something...) The Forbidden Chamber Apollo: Jinxie, you wouldn't happen to know how to open the Forbidden Chamber, would you? That door doesn't even have a keyhole. Jinxie: Well, it's supposed to have a secret mechanism. They say you have to figure it out before the keyhole will appear. Apollo: A secret mechanism?! Really? Jinxie: Uh-huh. It's hidden in the Fox Chamber. But only Alderman Kyubi knew what it was, and how it worked. Apollo: The alderman of Nine-Tails Vale sure loved his secrets. (Changed from [The alderman of Nine-Tails Vail [sic] sure loved his secrets.] in the original release) Athena: Apollo, let's go see if we can find that secret mechanism! Apollo: Whoa, slow down! There's something else I need to ask about. Jinxie, is there only one key to the Forbidden Chamber? Jinxie: Uh-huh. Even the manor's master key won't open it. That's because it's a very special room... that must never be opened. Apollo: Guess that means nobody entered the Forbidden Chamber after the murder. After all, we know Mayor Tenma took the key from the killer and swallowed it, so... Athena: So the mayor's efforts to keep the killer out of the Forbidden Chamber... ...were not in vain! Forbidden Chamber Key updated in the Court Record. The Forbidden Chamber (subsequent times) Apollo: Jinxie, you wouldn't happen to know how to open the Forbidden Chamber, would you? That door doesn't even have a keyhole. Jinxie: Well, it's supposed to have a secret mechanism. They say you have to figure it out before the keyhole will appear. Apollo: A secret mechanism?! Really?

After all, we know Mayor Tenma took the key from the killer and swallowed it, so... Athena: So the mayor's efforts to keep the killer out of the Forbidden Chamber... ...were not in vain! Present Fox and Demon Statue Jinxie: Alderman Kyubi made that statue. It's a token of goodwill... ...I think it was meant to be for Nine-Tails Vale and Tenma Town. Apollo: A token of goodwill? But the two yokai are fighting. Jinxie: Fighting? Oh, I see what you mean! The cup portion is missing. This statue... ...originally depicted the two yokai holding up a cup in celebration. But it sure doesn't look that way now, does it? Apollo: Maybe it broke when it was used to hit Mayor Tenma on the head. Jinxie: That would explain it. I guess the only two people who knew what it really looked like were the alderman and I. Now it's just me, but its symbol of goodwill will be forever etched in my mind! Fox and Demon Statue updated in the Court Record. Fox and Demon Statue (subsequent times) Jinxie: Alderman Kyubi made that statue.

Now it's just me, but its symbol of goodwill will be forever etched in my mind! After clearing all Talk options and presenting Fox and Demon Statue: Apollo: So... is there anything else we should know about, Jinxie? Jinxie: ...No... That's about it... BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: Ack! (My bracelet! It's reacting!) Jinxie, you wouldn't happen to be-- Fulbright: In justice we trust! Apollo: Yikes! Jinxie: Eek! A ghost! Fulbright: Argh! Apollo: Detective Fulbright! What are you doing here? Fulbright: I have business with this young lady, if you must know. Prosecutor Blackquill has asked me to question her. Jinxie: Question me? ...Sorry, not interested. Apollo: Are you here to ask about that whole yokai affair? Fulbright: That's right. Specifically, we want to ask-- Ah, but I can't tell you that, now can I? Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Athena: Oh, come on, please? We're partners in justice, right? Fulbright: No no, Prosecutor Blackquill specifically told me, my questions were of the utmost justice. I will not fall for your lies! In justice we trust! Apollo: The Twisted Samurai sure has him on a short leash. Jinxie: So you're not a ghost? Maybe some sort of urban troll, then? Fulbright: Now, come along, Ms. Tenma. To the station with you! Athena: He took her away. Apollo: (Missed my chance to see what she was lying about.) Athena: Well, at least we found out there's a secret mechanism for opening the chamber! Let's go check it out! Apollo: I just hope they let us in now. April 18Kyubi Manor - Garden L'Belle: Oh, what an absolutely FABULOUS scent! I'm SO glad I had these carnations imported from England. Nothing but the FINEST will do. Perhaps I should place one aside for our DEARLY departed alderman. Athena: Hey, it's Mr. L'Belle! Apollo, let's ask him about you-know-what! Apollo: (Oh yeah, before we search the Fox Chamber we should ask about the blackmail letter.) L'Belle: Why, if it isn't the mayor's little lawyers. What do YOU want with ME? Apollo: Oh, um, there's something we wanted to ask... (Where's that ringing coming from?) L'Belle: You'll HAVE to excuse me. ...Hello? L'Belle here. Apollo: What the--?! (Those things on his shoulders are cell phones?!) L'Belle: ...Yes, about that. You MUST forgive me! This WHOLE matter with Mayor Tenma has been a COMPLETE nightmare. Athena: ......Where do you buy clothes like that? L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Surprised? This is my OWN special design. It's the ULTIMATE in functional beauty. Apollo: Functional beauty? Are you sure about that? Looks a bit unwieldy to me. Ack! L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! You simply don't have an eye for beauty. Apollo: (...If having an eye for beauty means looking like this guy, I'd rather be blind.) L'Belle: So, what DO you want with ME? Talk Did you see Tenma Taro? Apollo: Both Jinxie and Mr. Filch said they saw Tenma Taro. But what about you, Mr. L'Belle? If you were there in the foyer, why didn't you see-- Ack! L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Very well, I ADMIT it. That's right! I, Florent L'Belle, SAW the demon Tenma Taro! Apollo: Hmm... (So he did see something.) Then why did you lie about not seeing him? L'Belle: I was SIMPLY trying to protect dear little Jinxie. Apollo: Protect Jinxie? What do you mean? L'Belle: Why, don't TELL me you haven't heard of that strange little HABIT of hers? Apollo: Which one are we talking about...? L'Belle: The ONE where she wanders around making mischief without knowing WHAT she's doing! Rumor has it she's possessed by Tenma Taro. Apollo: That one's new to me. L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Well, THERE you have it! Anytime you HEAR about a Tenma Taro sighting... ...little Jinxie should be your PRIME suspect. Athena: Tell us more about that rumor! Rumor about Jinxie (appears after \"Did you see Tenma Taro?\") Apollo: So, what was that rumor about Jinxie? L'Belle: They say she's possessed. Not ALL the time, of course. It hits suddenly, then she starts WANDERING around doing strange THINGS. Apollo: I-Is that so...? (Although, come to think of it...) Jinxie: That loathsome, no-good Nine-Tailed Fox. He shall know the terror that is mine and despair. Apollo: (That certainly would explain how she was acting earlier.) L'Belle: Once, she EVEN put on a Tenma Taro costume and wandered around the woods at night. Apollo: She did? Anime cutscene Jinxie: Beware you who sealed me away! Apollo: (Ugh. I wish I'd never asked.) Athena: Does she remember anything while she's possessed? L'Belle: Unfortunately, no. She doesn't seem to remember a THING during these EPISODES. Athena: Memory loss during possession... Hmm... L'Belle: Come to think of it, her MEMORY of the MURDER scene was QUITE fuzzy. I suppose THAT, too, was caused by her possession. Apollo: .........Ah! Then maybe-- L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! So you DO understand! That whole yokai business was ENTIRELY of her own making! Apollo: Now wait a minute! (Although... that yokai evidence wasn't there until after she discovered the crime scene... Did she leave those black feathers and strange tracks there herself?) Athena: Apollo, let's ask Mayor Tenma about Jinxie's episodes the next time we talk with him! Present Jinxie's Statement Apollo: Jinxie thinks she saw Tenma Taro near the scene of the crime. L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! That little dear is ALWAYS talking such nonsense. After all, she's ALWAYS calling you a red demon, is she not? Apollo: Gngh! L'Belle: Plus, she has the nerve to call ME of all people a yokai! She even has a name for me: Baron Powder Face! Pffft! I've NEVER been so insulted! Apollo: (How could anyone look at him and NOT think monster?) L'Belle: Now, if she had named me the BEAUTIFUL Baron Powder Face, I could've forgiven her. Apollo: Wait, THAT's your sticking point?! Blackmail Letter L'Belle: WHAT is THAT? Apollo: It's the blackmail letter, but it wasn't sent to Alderman Kyubi. It was sent to Mayor Tenma. L'Belle: AND? ......Your point BEING? Apollo: Someone took the letter from the mayor's briefcase... ...and then placed it in the alderman's pocket after he was murdered. L'Belle: Oh, you don't say... Apollo: You wouldn't happen to be the one who made the switch, would you? After all, you're the only one who knew that the blackmail letter was in his briefcase... ...so, naturally, you-- Ack! L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! PERHAPS that shot of cologne will MAKE those scales FALL from your eyes! Apollo: Or my eyes fall from their sockets. L'Belle: Is it possible that you would like to FRAME me as a potential SUSPECT? What would MAKE you raise such an OUTRAGEOUS allegation in the first place? Apollo: Oh, uh, well... L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! My ONLY crime is being born as BEAUTIFUL as you see here! In other words, YOU have NOTHING! Now, let me show you what to DO with this garbage! Apollo: Ahhh! You can't destroy evidence like that! L'Belle: What do you mean I CAN'T? I just DID, ah ha ha ha! Feel a little lighter now? Apollo: (You've just won a one-way trip to the top of my \"most annoying people ever\" list, buddy.) After clearing \"Rumor about Jinxie\" Talk option and presenting Blackmail Letter: L'Belle: Are we done with your SILLY questions now? I'm a VERY busy man, you know. Apollo: *sigh* (I guess that's it for now.) L'Belle: Hello, L'Belle speaking! ...Really? You wish to carry MY new product at YOUR store? Oh, but I'm afraid it's my own PRIVATE brand. It's NOT available to the public. ...What? Then I shouldn't advertise it on TV? But I DON'T understand. As THE embodiment of beauty, it is my duty to announce my good looks to the world! Apollo: ......... (Stop the bus. I'm getting off.) L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! EVERYONE wants my EXCLUSIVE \"Je suis L'Belle!\" brand products! It's the crown jewel of MY collection, born of my LONG, RELENTLESS pursuit of beauty! But now that it's become SO popular, it's been an ABSOLUTE nightmare! Apollo: You don't say. L'Belle: Well, they CAN'T have it! It's just for ME! It's not meant for you PEASANTS. Apollo: Peasants? L'Belle: This is my LATEST product! I'm calling it \"Couleur Me L'Belle!\" A DAZZLING hair color that you can wash out with just water! Apollo: (Guess that means you can't sweat.) L'Belle: I have SEVEN colors in all. You can find out more in my commercials and magazine ads. Apollo: (...Yet, it's not available to the public? Great sales strategy there, genius.) Athena: Come to think of it, Mr. L'Belle... ...your hair color's changed since the last time we met. L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! The little lady has QUITE the discerning eye! Here's a little sample. Consider it a gift for one who TRULY appreciates beauty. Athena: Oh, uh... Apollo, what should I do? Apollo: Better take it before you get a face full of cologne. Athena: Good point. ...Wow, thanks, Mr. L'Belle. Couleur Me L'Belle! added to the Court Record. Athena: Okay, let's head over to the Fox Chamber. Apollo: We've still gotta find the secret mechanism for opening the Forbidden Chamber. Present Couleur Me L'Belle! L'Belle: Dazzling hair color that you can wash out with water. Isn't it magnificent? Athena: What if you start to sweat? Won't that wash the color out, too? L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! I assure you, Florent L'Belle, embodiment of beauty, does NOT sweat! Apollo: Then what about rain? Even if you don't sweat, you never know when it might-- Ack! L'Belle: Pffft! Peasants like YOU fail to GRASP the truth. Rain and other forces of nature draw back in awe of my beauty! Apollo: (Sure they're not being repelled back by your narcissism?) Before clearing all Talk options and presenting Blackmail Letter in Kyubi Manor - Garden: April 18Kyubi Manor - Fox Chamber Policeman: Hey, we're trying to conduct an investigation here! Come back later once we're done. Apollo: *sigh* (Oh, well. Guess we'll have to find a way to kill some time.) Athena: Let's go talk to Mr. L'Belle while we wait. Apollo: Okay, there was something I wanted to ask him, anyway. Policeman: If you're looking for Mayor Tenma's aide, I saw him in the garden earlier. We won't be here much longer. Go keep that narcissist company in the meantime. Apollo: *sigh* After clearing all Talk options and presenting Blackmail Letter in Kyubi Manor - Garden: April 18Kyubi Manor - Fox Chamber Apollo: Okay, let's find that secret mechanism for opening the Forbidden Chamber. Athena: Ooh, this is so exciting! I can't wait to see how it works! But do you really think the killer entered the Forbidden Chamber? Apollo: We'll just have to open it to find out. Athena: We should also see if there was anywhere the killer could've hid in this room! Okay, let's get started. ¡Apúrate, Apollo, Apúrate! Examine Forbidden Chamber door Apollo: Still no keyhole, huh. Athena: Yeah, and the door won't budge, just like those spiky bangs of yours. Apollo: Well, all it takes is some water, but I don't think that would work on the door. Athena: Oh, I know! I'll break it down with a body slam! Apollo: Ha ha ha. I seriously doubt you could do that. Athena: Tsk, how do you know if I haven't even tried?! Apollo: No, wait, don't! Athena: Aaaagh... Apollo: (As much as you hate losing, Athena, I think the door would win this match...) Table Athena: Maybe the killer hid under this table! Apollo: That would be a terrible hiding place. The alderman's body would've been right above. Athena: Hmm, maybe you're right. Guess the underside is a bit... Wait, there's something under the table. Apollo: Let's check it out. Lustrous cup Apollo: Hey, look! There's something down here! Athena: It looks like a piece of something. Only question is, a piece of what? Apollo: Hmm... Oh, I know! It might be a piece of this statue. Remember what Jinxie said? The statue originally depicted two yokai holding up a cup. It was a symbol of goodwill. Athena: So, this piece broke off and rolled under the table? Fox and Demon Statue updated in the Court Record. Lustrous cup (subsequent times) Apollo: What have we here... It's the piece that broke off of this statue. Athena: You think it broke off when the mayor was clobbered on the head? Apollo: I'd say that's the most likely explanation. Fox statues Apollo: There's a carving of the Nine-Tailed Fox over the door and statues of him on either side. The way those two statues are glaring, it's like they're guarding the door from us. Come to think of it, there are two foxes on the folding screen as well. It can't be a coincidence, can it...? Athena: Hey, this statue moves! Apollo: Don't get carried away, now. I mean, who knows? It might trigger a trap. Athena: Heh heh. I can handle it. If a spear comes shooting my way, I'll snatch it out of the air! After all, I have the reflexes of a regular karate kid! Apollo: (I guess if you can catch something that fast out of mid-air, you can accomplish anything. Still... There might be something to the fact that these fox statues rotate. Maybe there's something around here that shows the position they should be in.) Feathers and tracks Athena: Look at all these feathers... Apollo: ...And bloody tracks, too. Athena: Then we have Jinxie and Mr. Filch's eyewitness reports... Apollo: ...And a newspaper photo. Athena: Our yokai's definitely not the shy type, that's for sure! Apollo: (This is bad! Mayor Tenma is scary enough without people thinking he's a yokai!) Overturned chair Apollo: I don't think we'll find anything else on this chair. Right Fox Chamber door Athena: I just remembered this mystery novel I once read. The murder occurred in a locked room... ...and the perpetrator made sure to hide behind the room's door when it was opened. Then, when no one was looking, he made his escape. Apollo: A clever trick, but it would've been impossible in this case. See this broken tanuki statue here? The door must've banged into it when it was opened. Athena: Oh, I get it. The killer couldn't have been there because of the statue. Left Fox Chamber door Apollo: Better take a look behind this door, too... Oh, look. The doorknob banged into the wall. Made a big dent, too. That wouldn't have happened if the killer had been hiding there. Athena: Right... I guess that rules out the old hide-behind-the-door trick. Air vent Athena: There really is no escaping here through the air duct. Apollo: And here we went through all the trouble of bringing a ladder to check it out. Athena: That's not a ladder, Apollo. It's a stepladder. Apollo: What's the difference? They both have the word ladder in them. Athena: What's the difference...? ............ Oh, I know! Let's play rock, paper, scissors to decide who's right! Apollo: You're way too competitive. And it's not even related to the original issue, either! Window Apollo: There's a cliff outside this window. Makes it pretty impossible to get out this way. Athena: When I hear things like that, it just makes me want to try! Never say never, right? I bet I could get out this way. Hrrrgh! Apollo: No, wait! Do you have a death wish or something?! Athena: Tsk, it won't even open wide enough for me to squeeze through! Guess I lost that bet. Apollo: That loss just saved your life. Statue next to armchair Athena: This statue originally depicted the two yokai holding up a cup in a gesture of goodwill. Apollo: Maybe Alderman Kyubi was planning on smoothing things over with Mayor Tenma. Athena: But he was murdered instead... ...by somebody who intervened. Apollo: The mayor was only pursuing the municipal merger because he'd been blackmailed. Who knows? If this murder hadn't occurred, maybe they could've come up with a solution. Front of folding screen Apollo: Two foxes standing back to back are depicted on this elegant folding screen. Could this have something to do with the keyhole? Hmm... Wait a minute... Two foxes... There are two fox statues in front of the Forbidden Chamber as well. Athena: Maybe the keyhole will appear if we do something to this folding screen. Hmm... But I don't see anything unusual about it. Apollo: Well, it does have two foxes on it, and there are two fox statues in front of the door. Athena: Then maybe there's a clue somewhere in this room. Let's turn the whole place upside down! Apollo: (She's as excited as a kid in a candy store.) After examining front of folding screen, lustrous cup, Forbidden Chamber door, and fox statues: Athena: Well, I can't think of anywhere else to look. You find anything, Apollo? We'll never find the keyhole to the Forbidden Chamber at this rate. Apollo: There's something about that folding screen. You know how those fox statues in front of the Forbidden Chamber move? That screen might be a clue as to how we're supposed to position them or something. Athena: Hey, I bet you're right! Let's go over that screen with a fine-toothed comb! Examine Front of folding screen Leads to: \"On closer inspection...\" Apollo: On closer inspection... ...I think there's more to this screen than meets the eye. Athena: Let's check every last inch of it! Apollo: I can rotate the folding screen with [right analog stick / arrow keys]. (Changed from [Tap and slide on the bottom screen to rotate the folding screen.] in the original release) And if I spot anything of interest, I can press [A / Space] on it to inspect it further. (Changed from [I can also tap on something of interest to inspect it further.] in the original release) Athena: You can also zoom in and out with [X / B] and [B / M] to get a better look. (Changed from [You can also zoom in and out to get a better look.] in the original release) Now, let's check every last inch of it! Examine front side Apollo: Hey, doesn't it look like the picture here has been cut off on both ends? Athena: Hmm, now that you mention it... Apollo: It looks like there are supposed to be doors on both ends, but they're cut in half. Athena: Maybe those doors symbolize the Forbidden Chamber's door. Apollo: Yeah... It definitely feels like something significant, but the question is, what? Examine keyhole pictures on back (before examining key pictures on back) Apollo: What's this? Looks like a keyhole or something. Athena: You think it could be the keyhole to the Forbidden Chamber? Apollo: No, it's just a picture. Athena: Still, you know what they say: a picture's worth a thousand words. Examine keyhole pictures on back (after examining key pictures on back) Apollo: What's this? Looks like a keyhole or something. Athena: You think it could be the keyhole to the Forbidden Chamber? Apollo: Wait, what about that key drawn on the end of the screen? You think the two are related? Leads to: \"A key and a keyhole? Ooh, I just got an idea!\" Examine key pictures on back (before examining keyhole pictures on back) Apollo: It's a picture of a key. Hmm, that shape looks awfully familiar. Oh, I know! It's shaped like the Forbidden Chamber's key. Athena: Hmm... We're definitely getting warmer... Apollo: Okay, let's take an ever closer look. Examine key pictures on back (after examining keyhole pictures on back) Apollo: It's a picture of a key. Hmm, that shape looks awfully familiar. Oh, I know! It's shaped like the Forbidden Chamber's key. Hmm... Wait! What about that keyhole drawn on the center of the screen? You think the two are related? Leads to: \"A key and a keyhole? Ooh, I just got an idea!\" Athena: A key and a keyhole? Ooh, I just got an idea! If we folded the screen up just right, the key and keyhole should overlap! Apollo: Hey, I think you're right! Athena: Let's give it a try! Apollo: Look, a door! Athena: Yeah, and it's open, too! Apollo: The two foxes are now facing each other, so... Hey, what if we made those fox statues face each other?! Athena: Apollo! Let's go check out the two statues! Apollo: Okay! Help me move the two statues so they face each other -- just like on the screen. Look! A lock appeared! Athena: Now we can use that key! Apollo: Okay, here goes nothing! Apollo: ...It worked! Athena: Time to see why this chamber's so forbidden! Apollo: What secrets could it hold, I wonder...? April 18Kyubi Manor - Forbidden Chamber *creeeeeeeeeak* *thud* Apollo: These doors need some serious oil. Athena: Aaah! That was like nails on a chalkboard! Apollo: Oh, right. Forgot about those super good ears of yours. Look, more feathers... Athena: Eeeeeeeeeeeek! Apollo: What the heck is that...? ...Is that a Tenma Taro... statue? But there's... something odd about it. Athena: Ugh... All I know is I don't like it, but I can't explain why. Apollo: You okay, Athena? You look kinda pale. You're not scared, are you? Athena: What, of this thing? Don't make me laugh, heh heh. Apollo: Really? ......Hey, look! Athena: Wh-What?! What is it?! Apollo: Over there on the left. There's a bunch of staves on that rack. (Changed from [Over there on the left. There's a bunch of staffs on that rack.] in the original release) They kinda look like the staff we saw earlier... Athena: You mean the one Jinxie said she saw Tenma Taro carrying? Apollo: Yeah. I bet our Tenma Taro impersonator really did come in here at some point. Athena: Well? What are we waiting for? Let's search the place! Examine Tenma Taro statue Apollo: Whoa, that's one big statue. Must be something like fifteen feet tall. And look! THIS Tenma Taro has a staff! But the Tenma Taro in the scroll didn't have one. Athena: Hmm... I wonder why. Apollo: I feel like this could be significant, but why...? Let's take a closer look. First, to go around this table here... Athena: Ah! Apollo, are you sure that's a good idea? Apollo: Hey, it looks like there's some sort of compartment in the base of the statue. Athena: Don't open it! Who knows what might be in there! Apollo: It's just a big empty compartment. And from all the dust and cobwebs... ...I'd say it hasn't been opened in a really long time. Athena: That's enough, Apollo. Let's shut it and-- Apollo: Wait, there IS something in here! Looks like some sort of figure. But it's so dusty, I can't tell what it's supposed to be. Wonder what it's doing here. Forbidden Chamber Figure added to the Court Record. Tenma Taro statue (subsequent times) Athena: This statue's probably twice as tall as Prosecutor Blackquill. Apollo: (Yeah, and he towers over me as it is.) Athena: It's like if you took something really scary, like a spider, and made it fifteen feet tall. Apollo: A fifteen-foot tall spider?! Athena: What? I was just exaggerating for dramatic effect. Apollo: Well, Prosecutor Blackquill may be scary, but a fifteen-foot spider is utterly terrifying! Scroll Apollo: Looks like an old scroll... and there's something drawn on it! Unless I'm mistaken, it looks like an old guy... Some sort of monk, maybe? Athena: A monk? What are you talking about? Apollo: You know, people that take walks in the mountains as a form of spiritual training... Athena: Wouldn't that just be a hiker? Apollo: The guy in this picture doesn't look like he's doing it for fun, Athena. Athena: Hmm... Oh look, there's some yellow... thing strapped to his back. Apollo: Whoa! It's turning into Tenma Taro! Athena: What's this scroll getting at? Is this how Tenma Taro was born? Apollo: Well, whatever it is, it's definitely creepy. Scroll (subsequent times) Apollo: The yellow thing the one guy had transformed into Tenma Taro! Athena: Hmm... Or maybe the picture's showing Tenma Taro getting caught in a yokai trap. I bet that yellow thing is a trap to catch the demon before he ravages the entire mountain! Apollo: I highly doubt yokai are things you can catch like a bear or wild boar. Athena: Then maybe that yellow thing is some leftovers that didn't get put in the fridge. They got all gross and moldy and out popped Tenma Taro! Apollo: You have a really active imagination. First off, they probably didn't have fridges back then... ...and second, we'd be swimming in yokai if they spawned that easily. Athena: Okay, Mr. Smarty-Pants, what is it, then? Apollo: Oh, umm... That yellow thing could've been a bomb containing Tenma Taro. And the old guys were terrorists who used yokai to further their cause. Athena: ...Apollo, if I have an active imagination, yours is hyperactive. Feathers Apollo: Black feathers... They looks exactly like the ones in the Fox Chamber. Athena: That means the killer must've been in here at some point. The question is, why? Apollo: Maybe... Maybe the Tenma Taro costume was hidden in here. I mean... ...if someone carried it through the manor, it would've stuck out like a sore thumb. Athena: But when did the killer get in here? The mayor snatched the Forbidden Chamber key when the killer hit him on the head. That means the killer could've only gotten in here before the murder. Apollo: Wow, this is one tough riddle, all right. Lanterns Apollo: A stone lantern... Athena: Like those Japanese garden lamps? Where's the switch? Apollo: Lamps like these are lit by fire not electricity, so there is no switch. Athena: Oh, here it is! Apollo: Whaaat?! Athena: It was hidden out of sight. Apollo: ...I see Tenma Taro's cell has been outfitted with all the amenities a yokai could want. Air vent Apollo: Oh, look. There's an air vent here, too. Athena: I guess even forbidden chambers need proper ventilation. Apollo: Hmm... But I don't think anyone could reach this one, either. Athena: Yeah, and there's nothing to stand on around here. I wonder where this vent leads. Apollo: Well, the Fox Chamber's vent didn't branch this way, so... Athena: Maybe it doesn't have anything to do with this case, after all. Staves Apollo: Hey, there's a bunch of staves here. And it looks like one's missing. The Tenma Taro Jinxie saw must've taken it. Athena: I'd have to agree. These look like the one Detective Fulbright showed us. Apollo: Why do you think there are so many here? Athena: Maybe they're spares. Tenma Taro might be, you know, absent-minded or something. But the fact that he has spare staves handy, well... ...it shows that he's aware of his faults, and is trying to deal with them. Or at least that's my take on it. Apollo: (Maybe this will remind her to deal with her own faults. But I won't hold my breath.) Staves (subsequent times) Athena: These look like the staff Detective Fulbright showed us. Apollo: That must mean that the Tenma Taro Jinxie saw... ...took this staff from here. I wonder what all these staves are doing here in the first place. Gravestone Apollo: Looks like a gravestone or something. Athena: It reads, \"Here lies Tenma Taro, Age 80. Cause of death: Choked on a chicken bone.\" Apollo: *gasp!* Say it ain't so! ...Besides, that sounds more like an autopsy report than an epitaph, if you ask me. Wait, you're joking around because you're scared! It's your coping mechanism! Athena: I'm n-not scared! Widget: Freak-out central! Right here, baby! Athena: Cut it out, Widget! Apollo: (Denial is strong in this one.) Cream bottle on floor Apollo: What's this? Whatever it is, the packaging is really gaudy. And the fact that there's no dust on it means it hasn't been here very long. Athena: Oh! It's hand cream. Let's see what brand it is......... \"Je suis L'Belle!\"?! Apollo: L'Belle?! (What the--?!) But then, wouldn't that mean Mr. L'Belle was here? Athena: I guess so... but why? Apollo: Well, whoever was dressed up like Tenma Taro... ...must have taken a staff from here in the Forbidden Chamber. And that same person probably dropped this hand cream at that time. Athena: In other words, the Tenma Taro impersonator we're looking for is none other than... Apollo: ...Florent L'Belle! This might be a big break for us in court tomorrow. Athena: Now all we have to do is get the truth out of Mayor Tenma! Hand Cream added to the Court Record. Cream bottle on floor (subsequent times) Apollo: Mr. L'Belle's private brand of hand cream. He must've been here in the Forbidden Chamber at some point. Athena: This could be the big break we need. After examining Tenma Taro statue, scroll, feathers, air vent, staves, and cream bottle on floor: Athena: Guess that about wraps it up. What now? Apollo: We should probably talk to some of the witnesses again. Athena: You mean like Mr. Filch... and Jinxie? Apollo: Yeah. I really want to ask Mr. Filch about the village superstitions and Tenma Taro. Talk Any ideas? Apollo: Any good ideas yet, Athena? Athena: Good ideas? You bet I do! Umm... Well, there's that thing. Apollo: Thing? What thing? ............ Athena: ............ Ugh, you saw right through me, didn't you?! Apollo: Huh? You mean you really have nothing for me? Athena: No, sorry! I just got a little carried away! Apollo: (Oh, boy. Bluffing is obviously not her strength.) The real culprit Apollo: Seems we finally have the real killer in our sights. The only person to threaten Mayor Tenma, push for the municipal merger... Athena: ...And to be identified at the manor disguised as Tenma Taro... ...is none other than Mayor Tenma's aide, Florent L'Belle! We're in for a fight tomorrow! Let's banish Tenma Taro, both literally and figuratively! Apollo: Yeah! We'll be fine between the two of us! We'll send that yokai packing, along with that twisted samurai of a prosecutor! Widget: Let's do this! Wright Anything Agency Talk Any ideas? Trucy: I was shocked to hear a demon appeared at your trial. Apollo: You were shocked? I was the one questioning him! Trucy: Wish you would've called me in. Apollo: Really? You would've come to my rescue? Trucy: With a demon like that, your tightrope-style of defense... and my magic tricks, we would've had it all. We could've been The Three Great Illusions! The audience would've been in the palm of our hand! Apollo: I'd settle for convincing the judge with some solid evidence. What to do Trucy: It's everyone's favorite, Trucy's Two Cents! Go ahead, ask me anything! Apollo: My client has turned into a demon. I don't know what he's thinking, and I have no idea what to do. Trucy: Hmm, I think this calls for... placing yourself in the other person's shoes. In other words, think of what it's like to be a demon. That should be easy for you, Polly! Apollo: Right... Okay, here goes......... Jinxie: Eeeeeek! A red demon! Apollo: Aaaaaaugh! Jinxie: Return to the black pit from whence you were spawned! Apollo: It ain't easy being a demon, that's for sure. Trucy: Hm? Fox Chamber Examine Fox statues Apollo: So, the fox statues are part of the keyhole mechanism. Athena: Let's try moving them around. Maybe something will happen! Apollo: But what if it's a trap. Who knows? The ceiling might come crashing down. Athena: Oh, will you relax? If it comes to that, I'll just dash out of the way! Apollo: Yeah, but what about me?! Folding screen Apollo: I would've never guessed the screen was the clue to the keyhole mechanism. That alderman sure was an interesting guy. Athena: I'll say! Makes me want to implement a secret locking mechanism into the office door! Apollo: What, are you planning to turn it into a Forbidden Chamber II or something? Athena: If I were, I'd need a demon to imprison... Apollo: Ha ha, very funny. But no, I'm not going to imprison myself. April 18Kyubi Manor - Foyer Filch: It's the curse, the curse! The curse of Tenma Taro! Athena: Eek! Filch: You outsiders are ignoring them superstitions at OUR peril! Mind yer own business, will ya?! Apollo: Aagh! Youch! What's all this about a curse? Filch: Tenma Taro's gonna curse us all 'less ya stop sticking yer nose where it don't belong! Stop the investigation! Listen to what them superstitions say! Athena: Right... Umm... How about obeying the law... before you go obeying the superstitions? Filch: Huh? Athena: Hey, what are you doing with Widget around your neck? He's mine! You know better than to go around stealing people's stuff like that! Apollo: The same goes for my bracelet! Filch: S-S-Sorry, sorry! I promise I won't do it again! Athena: Tsk, he almost kidnapped my sweet, little Widget. Widget: The big jerk! Filch: I'm sorrrryyyy! Apollo: *sigh* I guess you can't teach an old raccoon dog new tricks. (As long as we have him here, I guess we should ask him about what happened.) Talk Stealing Athena: I can't believe you did that! It's one thing to steal a pair of shoes, but to steal Widget! Widget: Grrr! Filch: Yiiipes! Mercy, mercy! I can't seem to control myself! It's that thieving blood running in my veins! Apollo: Thieving blood? What's that supposed to mean? Filch: Eh heh heh. Glad ya asked. The infamous bandit Azuki Kozo was my grandpappy! Take a gander at this! Apollo: What exactly am I looking at? Looks like another one of those yokai to me. Filch: It's none other than THE Azuki Kozo! Robbed from the rich to give to the poor, he did! And he'd leave one o' these figures at the scene of the crime! What's more, I'm his grandson 'cause he was my grandpappy! Apollo: Wow, you don't say! Filch: Thieves' honor, it's the honest truth! Ah... The sloshing sound of azuki beans scrapping together in the dead o' night... It's the magical sound of dirty money getting washed clean for givin' out to the poor! I'm Azuki Kozo, washer of money, giver-outer of wealth, reborn! Athena: ......... Forget the money. You should be washing yourself of this nasty habit. Apollo: (Wait a second. This figure looks familiar.) Yes! It looks just like that old, dusty figure we found in the Forbidden Chamber. Forbidden Chamber Figure updated in the Court Record. Filch: Hey! Whaddaya doing with that there figure?! Apollo: Oh, this? We found it in the Forbidden Chamber. Looks like it'd been there practically forever. Filch: Hmm... Could mean my grandpappy broke into the Forbidden Chamber way back. Hey, that reminds me. He once told me there's treasure in that there chamber! Apollo: Treasure? Forbidden Chamber Treasure (appears after \"Stealing\") Apollo: What do you know about the treasure in the Forbidden Chamber? Filch: Eh heh heh. Only that it's the greatest get-rich-quick chance in the universe. Grandpappy told me all about it. Said there's an amazing treasure in there! Apollo: There's something amazing in there? (Didn't see anything like that, though.) Your grandfather didn't, by chance, already steal it, did he? Filch: Seein' how there was one o' his figures in there, that just might be. Eh heh heh, that's Grandpappy for ya! Bet he washed that treasure up real good before handing it out to the poor. Apollo: Oh, of course, because he was so righteous... Tenma Taro sighting Apollo: In court, you mentioned seeing Tenma Taro near the scene of the crime. Filch: Sorry I didn't come clean right away, but them superstitions got the better o' me. Apollo: The people of Nine-Tails Vale sure seem like a superstitious bunch. I'm not surprised you wouldn't want to talk about seeing Tenma Taro. Filch: Darn right! Them superstitions scare me outta my wits, I tell you! That's why I'm gonna do exactly what they say from now on. Apollo: So you plan on staying here in Nine-Tails Vale? Filch: Yep. I'm gonna keep living right here 'n' keep with the old ways, just like Grandpappy did. Them superstitions are like a rulebook to me. Apollo: Wait, so you're saying you actually believe in those old wives' tales? Filch: Ain't you been listening to a word I said? Apollo: You're going to do \"exactly what them superstitions say\"? Well, I say that's baloney. Present Village Superstitions Apollo: Leads to: \"It's clearly written right here: \"Ignoring the superstitions will cost you your soul.\"\" Present anything else Apollo: Filch: ............Say, Mr. Lawyer, sir... Apollo: Yeah? Filch: I don't have much school learnin', but I ain't no dummy. That there ain't got nothing to do with me. But I'd be happy to take it off yer hands if ya wanted, eh heh heh heh. Apollo: I don't think so. (Let's try that one again.) I heard every word of what you had to say... ...but I don't believe them for a second. Leads back to: \"You're going to do \"exactly what them superstitions say\"? Well, I say that's baloney.\" Apollo: It's clearly written right here: \"Ignoring the superstitions will cost you your soul. There is, however, one way to save it: your immediate departure from the village.\" Filch: ...Ah. Apollo: So according to this, you shouldn't even be here, let along talking with us. You said you plan on staying right here in Nine-Tails Vale. But if you really believe in the superstitions, you would've been long gone by now. Filch: Uwaaah! Apollo: I know you've been lying to me! Time to come clean, Mr. Filch! Filch: Yiiiiiiiiipes! Tenma Taro sighting (second time) Apollo: You were lying about believing in the superstitions, weren't you? Filch: Sorry, but I didn't have no choice. Apollo: So, what was the real reason why you couldn't talk about seeing Tenma Taro? Filch: It's all that pretty boy's fault -- Mr. L'Belle, if ya know what I mean. He told me not to say a word 'bout seeing Tenma Taro. Said if I did, he'd do to me what them superstitions said would happen. Apollo: So, it was Mr. L'Belle who muzzled you? Why would Mr. L'Belle want to scare you into silence? Filch: Mr. L'Belle was trying to protect that little maid gal! It was on account o' that rumor! The one about her being possessed! Apollo: That rumor again... Athena: I guess we really do have to talk to Mayor Tenma about the possession rumor. Apollo: Ouch! Hey, watch it! Village Superstitions stolen by Phineas Filch! Filch: I'll be taking this back now, eh heh heh heh. Kinda like family to me. Apollo: You could've just asked instead of stealing it... Tenma Taro sighting (subsequent times) Apollo: You were lying about believing in the superstitions, weren't you? Filch: Sorry, but I didn't have no choice. Apollo: So, what was the real reason why you couldn't talk about seeing Tenma Taro? Filch: It's all that pretty boy's fault -- Mr. L'Belle, if ya know what I mean. He told me not to say a word 'bout seeing Tenma Taro. Said if I did, he'd do to me what them superstitions said would happen. Apollo: So, it was Mr. L'Belle who muzzled you? Why would Mr. L'Belle want to scare you into silence? Filch: Mr. L'Belle was trying to protect that little maid gal! It was on account o' that rumor! The one about her being possessed! Apollo: That rumor again... Athena: I guess we really do have to talk to Mayor Tenma about the possession rumor. Present Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy Filch: Hey, I know that picture! That's my Amazing Nine-Tails glossy! How dare you steal from me! Apollo: No, this is the one you gave me. Remember? You said you had lots more. Filch: I did? Well, it was never really mine in the first place, so... You can go ahead and keep it. Apollo: (Don't tell me I'm now guilty of receiving stolen goods...) Azuki Kozo Figure Apollo: So, your grandfather was a famous thief? Filch: That's right. He stole for the rich to give to the poor. Just like your Robin Hood. But in these parts, he's known as Azukikozo! He washes his loot clean before handing it out to the poor. Apollo: (It's hard to imagine Mr. Filch has such noble intentions. I bet he was planning on keeping my bracelet for himself.) After clearing all Talk options: Athena: Was that all we wanted to ask Mr. Filch? Apollo: Yeah, I think that was it. Let's go see \"Mr. Tenma Taro\" one more time. (Just thinking about dealing with that yokai again makes me want to say, \"Pass!\") April 18Detention Center - Visitor's Room Athena: Lord Tenma! Your attorneys are here to see you, Your Malevolence! Tenma: ......... Apollo: Umm......... Tenma: .........Why are you speaking like that? Athena: Oh, Mayor Tenma! You've returned...! Tenma: Yes, well, Jinxie came by earlier to apply a new charm to my head. It seems to be suppressing the demon within me. Apollo: That's a relief. Maybe we'll actually get somewhere this time. Tenma: So, what can I do for you today? Apollo: We'd like to ask about the rumor that Jinxie is possessed. Tenma: Ah! Apollo: She allegedly left the yokai evidence at the scene while under a demon's power. At least, that's what the prosecution is going to claim at tomorrow's trial. Tenma: .................. Heh heh heh... Apollo: Huh? Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! No match is this warding charm for me! Apollo: Aagh! Th-The charm! Athena: Tenma Taro's back! Tenma: Those foolish mortals! They shall regret blaming that child for my doings! Apollo: Argh, I blew it! That question brought that yokai back. (And he probably won't drop the act until Jinxie's name is cleared either.) Talk Rumor about Jinxie Apollo: We'd like to ask you about something your aide Florent L'Belle mentioned. Did you know Jinxie is rumored to be possessed? Tenma: I know not of what you speak. Apollo: You're not trying to protect Jinxie, are you? Tenma: I, Tenma Taro, demon lord of the yokai, protect a mere mortal? Caw caw-caw-caw! No affections do I possess for your race of humans. Apollo: Please! We already proved there was a third part disguised as a yokai at the scene. But if you deny that tomorrow, we'll never be able to clear Mayor Tenma's name. Tenma: .........But I have already told you, I know not of what you speak! Athena: I don't think we'll get anything more out of him. Apollo: It's all over unless we can somehow prove that Jinxie didn't plant that yokai evidence. Athena: .........Hey, Apollo? I think I've got this one. I think I can prove that she didn't do it. Apollo: Really? Athena: Sure! I should be able to use psychology to explain that whole possession thing. Apollo: Knock yourself out, then! (Wow, Athena's really something. I can really count on her when it counts!) The real story (appears after \"Rumor about Jinxie\") Athena: Mayor Tenma, Jinxie isn't possessed. I believe her so-called possession episodes are a form of somnambulism. Apollo: Somnambulism? You mean sleepwalking? Athena: Yes, I believe she is exhibiting a rare form of the disorder. It's usually brought on by repressed stress. Mr. Mayor, didn't her symptoms start soon after she began her job in Nine-Tails Vale? Tenma: ...Hrmmm. When the child visited last... ...she did speak of dreading yokai, and how they rob her of sleep each night. Athena: I knew it! That lack of sleep is causing her to enter an unconscious state. And that means she can't be trying to protect you -- at least not on a conscious level. Apollo: So then, the Tenma Taro that was spotted at the manor wasn't Jinxie. Tenma: Sleepwalking, eh? Hrmmm. That would, indeed, explain the matter. Apollo: Look! Tenma Taro's spirit! It's left the mayor's body. Athena: Can you tell us the truth now, Mayor Tenma? Tenma: Very well. It's the least I could do for a superb exorcist such as you. Feathers and tracks (appears after \"The real story\") Leads to: \"Mayor Tenma, you didn't leave those feathers and tracks at the scene, did you?\" Athena: Mayor Tenma, you didn't leave those feathers and tracks at the scene, did you? Tenma: I did not. Neither I nor Jinxie have anything to do with that. That was... the killer's doing, no doubt. Athena: I knew it! Tenma: You suspect Florent is behind all this? But why? Did he really want Nine-Tails Vale that badly? Apollo: Can you think of any reason why? Tenma: Hmm... Looking back, he did seem fixated on Tenma Taro for a spell. Ah! Could it be...?! Perhaps he was... attempting to release Tenma Taro. Apollo: That's crazy! Are you saying that yokai is real? Tenma: Whatever the case, Tenma Taro brings nothing but pain and misfortune. It's as the superstitions warn. You must not gaze upon him nor free him from his prison! Apollo: B-But... (How can people actually believe that?!) Athena: Well, at least we know who's behind this whole Tenma Taro thing now. Apollo: Yeah, and I think we need to have another nice, long chat with Mr. L'Belle. Guard: You d-d-dinner is ready, Your Malevolence! Tenma: Ah, an offering to the demon king. You may place it right there. Guard: The kitchen crew poured their heart and soul into making it. Tenma: Did they now? Souls happen to be a favorite of mine. Just, hold the hearts next time! Caw caw-caw-caw! Guard: Y-Yes, Your Malevolence! I'll remember that! Apollo: (How long is he planning to keep up this yokai charade?) Well, we've already talked to Mr. Filch and Mayor Tenma, so... Why don't we go see Florent L'Belle next? Now that we know the truth... ...he won't be able to claim that the Tenma Taro was Jinxie or the mayor anymore! Athena: But the real question is: how are we going to get him to admit it was him? Detention Center (before clearing \"Taro's true identity\" Talk option in Kyubi Manor - Foyer) Talk Feathers and tracks Athena: Mayor Tenma, you didn't leave those feathers and tracks at the scene, did you? Tenma: I did not. Neither I nor Jinxie have anything to do with that. That was... the killer's doing, no doubt. Athena: I knew it! Tenma: You suspect Florent is behind all this? But why? Did he really want Nine-Tails Vale that badly? Apollo: Can you think of any reason why? Tenma: Hmm... Looking back, he did seem fixated on Tenma Taro for a spell. Ah! Could it be...?! Perhaps he was... attempting to release Tenma Taro. Apollo: That's crazy! Are you saying that yokai is real? Tenma: Whatever the case, Tenma Taro brings nothing but pain and misfortune. It's as the superstitions warn. You must not gaze upon him nor free him from his prison! Apollo: B-But... (How can people actually believe that?!) Athena: Well, at least we know who's behind this whole Tenma Taro thing now. Apollo: Yeah, and I think we need to have another nice, long chat with Mr. L'Belle. April 18Kyubi Manor - Foyer L'Belle: Okay! Now, let's PRACTICE that AGAIN, Filchy! From the top! Filch: Errr... Mr. L'Belle was in the foyer at the time of the crime... ...and when we, uhh... heard a scream, uhh... Aw, heck! What was the next part again? Aaaargh! L'Belle: You have the memory capacity of a FLEA! This is the THIRTIETH TIME, you know! Now, a hundred times more and we're done! Apollo: (What on Earth are they practicing?) Filch: Aww, I ain't cut out for this. ......Whoopsie daisy! L'Belle: Ouuuw! Filch: Oh, begging yer pardon, Mr. L'Belle, sir. It's just, all this practice-- Yipes! L'Belle: Unbelievable! What if you had sullied MY outfit with those GRUBBY paws of yours? Apollo: ......... (Did Filch filch L'Belle's wallet just now...?) Athena: So... what do you think they're up to this time, Apollo? L'Belle: Hm? Oh, it's YOU two. Eavesdropping, are we? Pffft, you peasants are SO tacky. Well, what do YOU want with ME? Apollo: (Your confession to being the Tenma Taro imposter would be nice right about now.) Talk Taro's true identity Leads to: \"Mr. Filch filled me in on a conversation you two had.\" Present Hand Cream Apollo: (Wait, this is our trump card. Better not show it off too soon.) L'Belle: You wanted something? Apollo: Oh, um... No, never mind. L'Belle: Pffft. Apollo: Mr. Filch filled me in on a conversation you two had. And about how you told him not to say a word about seeing Tenma Taro. L'Belle: ......... Filchy, you FOOL! Filch: Yipes! L'Belle: I TOLD you nothing good would come of you RUNNING your mouth! Apollo: So why did you want to keep Mr. Filch quiet like that, Mr. L'Belle? L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Why to PROTECT darling little Jinxie, of course. Apollo: But Jinxie was never really possessed. She was sleepwalking. Being asleep at the time, she couldn't have been consciously trying to protect the mayor. That also means she couldn't have possibly been Tenma Taro. L'Belle: Interesting... But where ARE you going with this? Apollo: ...Since you asked so politely... I believe you have a different reason for trying to keep Mr. Filch quiet. That reason would be to deflect doubt away from the one who was really Tenma Taro. L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha! Now THIS is getting interesting! Are YOU insinuating that I'M Tenma Taro? So SORRY to disappoint, but I'm NOTHING of the sort! Filch: That's right! Mr. L'Belle even told me Tenma Taro was a jinx, so why would he-- Youw-ouw-ouw-ouw-ouw-ouch! L'Belle: I SAID Tenma Taro was JINXIE, you fool! Honestly! You have the memory capacity of a FLEA! Practice it a hundred more times! (Changed from [Honestly! You have the memory capacity of a FLEA! Practice it a hundred times more times [sic]!] in the original release) Filch: Yiiipes! Apollo: So, um, have you been called to testify tomorrow? L'Belle: Yes, and I'm SO looking forward to my COURTROOM debut. But you'll JUST have to wait until then, ah ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (Oh, I'll be waiting -- with a special piece of evidence I've been saving just for you.) L'Belle: FILCHY! Wake up, you lazy bones! Filch: Huh? What? Was I sleeping? *yawn* Musta been that sweet cologne o' yours, Mr. L'Belle. Made me right sleepy, it did. L'Belle: Well, it's TIME for your LESSON on what to do and say tomorrow. Filch: Oh, I'm beggin' ya! Not another lesson! I ain't cut out for this thinkin' and rememberin' stuff! Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh! Right up the schnozzola! L'Belle: Keep quiet and do EXACTLY as I say! Filch: Noooooo! Pleeeaaase! Anything but another lessooooooooon! Athena: There they go... Missed our chance to get the truth out of him. Apollo: Yeah, but we'll get the proof we need in court tomorrow, one way or another! (All that's left now is that lie Jinxie told. We'd better go clear that up before tomorrow.) Athena: You think they're done questioning Jinxie? Apollo: Maybe. Let's see if she's over on Yokai Lane shopping for more charms. April 18Nine-Tails Vale - Yokai Lane Jinxie: Accursed Nine-Tailed Fox! The time for settling the score is nigh! My grudge has but festered over time. At last, vengeance will be mine! Grrr... Grrr... Athena: She must be possessed -- er, sleepwalking again! Apollo: (...Maybe if I speak softly, I won't startle her and get a charm plastered on my forehead.) Pssst... Jinxie? Jinxie: ......Huh?! ......Oh, hello, Mr. Demon Lawyer. Ah! My charms must've fallen off again. Apollo: (Phew... Guess I can avoid a charm slap by toning down my Chords of Steel.) Athena: Are they done questioning you, Jinxie? Jinxie: Uh-huh. And on the way back, I stopped here to buy a new charm that was just released. Apollo: Yeah, which one? Jinxie: Oh, um, the one with the Nine-Tails Fox and Tenma Taro. It shows them dancing together! Apollo: Really?! Two bitter rivals dancing together? Jinxie: Uh-huh. It's a charm for rebuilding burnt bridges! Apollo: Oh, right. For the municipal merger issue. Jinxie: No, it's for the Demon Lawyer and the Insomniac Prosecutor. It'll stop you two from fighting like you did in court this morning. Apollo: We weren't fighting. It was just a spirited debate. It's what we lawyers-- Ack! Jinxie: No fighting. Apollo: *sigh* Charm-slapped again. Athena: Apollo, if you're done playing around, let's find out what she was lying about! Talk What you remember Apollo: Jinxie, it seems like you're starting to remember things. You already said the feathers and tracks weren't there when you discovered the crime. Have you remembered anything else that seems important? Jinxie: Eek! L-Like what? Apollo: Tell us what you saw that day. Maybe you'll remember something else this time. Jinxie: ...Eek! When I opened the door, Papa and Alderman Kyubi were collapsed in the Fox Chamber. That's when Papa told me to call an ambulance and the police. That's all he said before he passed out in the chair. BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: (I knew it... She's holding something back.) Present Bracelet Jinxie: That's all he said before he passed out in his chair. Perceive trembling finger on charm on \"That's all he said\" Apollo: Apollo: You were very nervous when you said, \"That's all he said,\" weren't you? I know because I saw your fingers move as if you were going to slap someone with a charm. Jinxie: Huh?! Apollo: Listen to me, Jinxie. This is very important. Did Mayor Tenma say anything else to you? Jinxie: I-It was... It was nothing. He was just talking in his sleep... Apollo: Talking in his sleep? So you admit that he DID say something else! Jinxie: E-Eeeeeek! How could you tell?! Only... Only a demon could have such powers! Leads back to Talk options Perceive wrong area Apollo: Jinxie: Eek! Apollo: Arrragh! Jinxie: D-Don't shout like that. Nearly scared the wits out of me. Uhh... And d-don't stare at me like that, either. It's creepy... Apollo: (Guess that wasn't right.) Leads back to Talk options What you remember (after perceiving) Leads to: \"Uuuh... Uuuuuuuh...\" Jinxie: Uuuh... Uuuuuuuh... L-Like I said, he was just talking in his sleep! I mean, why else would Papa say something like that! Apollo: Could you be a little more specific? Jinxie: Before he f-fainted, he said... \"Forgive me, Jinxie. I killed Alderman Kyubi.\" Apollo: He said whaaaaaaaaat?! Athena: The mayor actually confessed to the crime?! Jinxie: B-But he didn't mean it. He couldn't possibly have known what he was saying! He was probably possessed or maybe he was in the middle of a nightmare! Apollo: A nightmare? No, THIS is a nightmare...! (This is one statement I wish I'd never heard. What in the world are we going to do now?) Apollo: Return to the basics? Phoenix: That's right. Always believe in your client, no matter what happens. That is a lawyer's greatest and most trusted weapon. Apollo: (Right... Just believe in my client, even if all I can see ahead is darkness and despair.) Athena: Jinxie, does Prosecutor Blackquill know about your father's confession? Jinxie: I didn't mention it when he was questioning me. I mean, there's no way Papa's the killer! Athena: Why would the mayor confess like that? Apollo: Could he really have been dreaming, or simply delirious? Athena: Who knows, but I sure feel like I'M in a living nightmare right now. Apollo, what are we going to do about tomorrow's trial? The crime scene was locked tight until Jinxie arrived, and our client's even confessed! Not only that, Jinxie has been accused of planting the yokai evidence. Both the mayor and Jinxie are going to prison if we don't do something! Apollo: (I know, I know...) Well, let's see here... Our lack of a third party in the locked room is a major problem. Jinxie has testified that when she first opened the door... ...Alderman Kyubi and Mayor Tenma were the only people she saw in the Fox Chamber. Athena: But the real killer must've been hiding in there as well. Apollo: Considering the room was locked tight, that's the only logical explanation. Athena: Our mystery person must've then fled the Fox Chamber when it was opened. And that's when Jinxie saw what she thought was Tenma Taro! Jinxie: B-But... Papa and the alderman were the only people there. I didn't see anyone else. Apollo: (What's going on here? L'Belle's extremely pale, but he's far from transparent. So just how did he hide himself at the scene of the crime?) Athena: Whatever it takes in court tomorrow, Apollo... ...we have to take down that dirty, rotten \"Tenma Taro\" Florent L'Belle! Apollo: Right. We'll get him with a legal exorcism, Justice style! To be continued Nothing to examine during investigation Athena: Apollo, it doesn't look like there's anything particularly interesting here. Examine insignificant area on evidence Apollo: Nothing particularly interesting here. Area already examined Apollo: (We've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around.)\n-- The Yokai Is Jinxie --Filch: Tenma Taro's really that little maid gal. Ain't no doubt about it!Press Apollo: Apollo: Mr. Filch, you and Mr. L'Belle mentioned something about a practice yesterday. Do you deny this so-called lesson was about what you were supposed to say in court? Filch: N-No, ya got it all wrong! Apollo: Then could you tell the court exactly what sort of lesson it was? Filch: Oh, um... it was... Uh... it was... What was it again? Yiiipes! Ah, now I remember! Math! Ya know, numbers 'n' stuff! Apollo: (He's completely under Blackquill's control, too...) Filch: Anyway, that Tenma Taro was that little maid gal, so what's the difference?Filch: I mean, the Tenma Taro I saw was just a lil' thing 'bout her size!Press Apollo: Apollo: I take it you got a good look at how tall the Tenma Taro impersonator was? Filch: Eh heh heh, you betcha. I got a habit o' sizing people up. I can even give ya a primer on how to pull it off. All under the table, natch. I got a knack for figuring out where people's pockets are and how much money they have. I size 'em real good before I relieve them of their valuables! Apollo: (He just admitted to being a pickpocket right here in court.) Judge: Does the witness hold that this Tenma Taro entered the foyer? Filch: Darn right I do.Filch: But the little runt had a big ol' staff. I seen it when she came into the foyer!Press Apollo: Apollo: Well... you're not going to brush it all off by claiming the perp was short! Filch: Eh heh heh. Musta hit a raw nerve 'cause ya ain't that tall yerself! Apollo: (Look who's talking, Mr. I've-got-to-stand-on-a-box-just-to-testify!) Anyway, Mr. Filch, correct me if I'm wrong... ...but didn't you say the Tenma Taro you saw had a staff? Filch: Cross my heart, hope to die! I know 'cause it went a jingle and a jangle. Apollo: And where do you suppose that staff came from? Filch: Errr... The staff, ya say? Well, I uh...Filch: Betcha she stole it from the Forbidden Chamber after stumbling on the crime scene.Press Apollo: Apollo: I suppose you mean to say that Jinxie Tenma entered the Forbidden Chamber to get one. Filch: Well, I ain't never seen a staff like that in the manor! So it had to be the Forbidden Chamber! Apollo: (Oh, really? The stench of L'Belle is thick in the air today.) Athena: Jinxie entered the Forbidden Chamber after the incident... ...then she took the staff and tried to cover up her actions by pretending to be Tenma Taro. I guess that's what Filch is trying to say...? Apollo: (Could Jinxie have even entered the Forbidden Chamber if she wanted to...?) Judge: There IS one thing I was wondering about. Why did that yokai have a staff in the first place? Filch: Eh heh heh. Well, I've got my hunches about that.Present Forbidden Chamber Key Apollo: Leads to: \"It would seem that Tenma Taro was, in fact, not this innocent little girl.\"Filch: She was gonna use it to wallop me on account o' my fierce reputation, I just know it!Press Apollo: Apollo: Wallop you? And why would the so-called yokai want to do that? Filch: That little maid gal never did like me! She always high tails it when I come 'round or she sticks these weird papers on my noggin! Apollo: (She probably thinks of him as the dreaded tanuki monster of Kyubi Manor or something.)Athena: We need to prove that Jinxie isn't Tenma Taro. But I've no idea how we're going to do that.Apollo: All we have to do is prove that it was impossible for Jinxie to turn into Tenma Taro. And that might be easier than you think.Athena: Really?Apollo: (Now's our chance. Our chance to expose the real Tenma Taro for all to see!)Apollo: It would seem that Tenma Taro was, in fact, not this innocent little girl.Filch: Huh? How you figure that?Apollo: You claim the Tenma Taro you saw had one of those staves from the Forbidden Chamber. But it would've been impossible for Ms. Tenma to get a hold of one!Judge: Care to elaborate, Mr. Justice?Apollo: The mayor swallowed this key shortly after the murder. He wanted to keep the killer out of the Forbidden Chamber.Blackquill: ...What's this?Apollo: This key was deep in the mayor's stomach when Ms. Tenma discovered the crime scene. So you see, it would've been impossible for her to get into the Forbidden Chamber. In short, the Tenma Taro seen holding that staff... ...could not have been Jinxie Tenma!Blackquill: ...Ack!Filch: Aaaaaaargh!Judge: Wh-Whaaaaaat?! B-But...! Then who does the defense believe was impersonating Tenma Taro?!Apollo: Our Tenma Taro impersonator is none other than Mayor Tenma's aide--Blackquill:Blackquill: Such accusations beg evidence. Aside from his ghastly appearance, can you prove he is the yokai we seek?Apollo: Yes, in fact, I can.Judge: Hmm... Very well, let's see where the defense is going with this. Mr. Justice, please show us proof as to the true identity of the Tenma Taro impersonator.Present Hand Cream Apollo: Leads to: \"We found this hand cream in the Forbidden Chamber.\"Present anything else Apollo: Blackquill: Hmph. So, that is the evidence you have to offer? And how, pray tell, does that inform us of who it was that entered the Forbidden Chamber? Apollo: Oh, uh... good question. Athena: Way to walk down a one-way street to a dead end. Judge: The court doesn't need more questions, Mr. Justice. The defense will present evidence that provides answers, and only answers. A penalty for our questionable attorney! Apollo: (I know we have evidence that can prove who was in the Forbidden Chamber.) The killer was the only one who could've entered the Forbidden Chamber. The question before us is simply the \"who\" part of this equation. Leads back to: \"Mr. Justice, please show us proof as to the true identity of the Tenma Taro impersonator.\"Apollo: We found this hand cream in the Forbidden Chamber. And we know that whoever was Tenma Taro took one of the staves out of there. In short... ...I believe whoever this hand cream belongs to is the yokai impersonator we're looking for.Judge: Hmm... But Mr. Justice... ...how do you propose to identity the hand cream's owner?Apollo: I'm glad you asked, Your Honor. The defense requests a fingerprint analysis on this piece of evidence! It might tell us who it belongs to!Judge: Interesting... So, you expect to find the yokai's prints there? Very well, I hereby call a short recess while we wait for the fingerprint results.Blackquill: No need for that, Your Baldness. We have the prints of everyone at the manor that day.Fulbright: You called, Prosecutor Blackquill?!Apollo: (.........Could anyone be more whipped?)Blackquill: Fool Bright! Analyze this for prints. You have three minutes.Fulbright: Your wish is my command!Judge: Very well, then. I guess we'll just wait right here.Blackquill: ......It would seem the fingerprint analysis is complete.Judge: What do the results show?Blackquill: What in the world...!Apollo: They're Florent L'Belle's prints, aren't they?!Blackquill: This... This is absurd!Apollo: Um... Prosecutor Blackquill? (I'm not going to like this, am I...?)Judge: D-Don't tell me... they're Tenma Taro's prints?!Blackquill: Fingerprint analysis has revealed that the prints belong to... ............Phineas Filch.Apollo:Apollo: ...Wait, what? Whaaaaaaaaat!Athena: The Mr. L'Belle wasn't the one who entered the Forbidden Chamber?Blackquill:Blackquill: Why you tricksy little tanuki! Explain yourself, now!Filch: S-S-Sure, th-them prints are mine! I mean, I did pilfer that hand cream from Mr. L'Belle, after all!Apollo: S-So you're the one who entered the Forbidden Chamber?!Filch: S-So what if I did! G-G-Got a problem with it?! Yiiiiiipes!Blackquill: You...... fool of a tanuki!Judge: Order! Order! Mr. Justice, care to explain what this could mean?Apollo: Excellent question... Um, the fact that Mr. Filch was in the Forbidden Chamber... Wait a second... Does this mean the Tenma Taro holding that staff was... Phineas Filch?Filch: Yiiiiiipes! Another cat outta the baaaaaag!Judge: M-Mr. Filch is Tenma Taro?!Apollo: I don't understand. Does this mean... Mr. Filch is the real killer?Judge: The witness will explain himself this instant!Filch: Begging your pardon, Your Honorship, but I was just doing what the alderman told me. He wanted me to be Tenma Taro in the village exorcism ritual.Apollo: Oh, you mean that event at the Nine-Tails Vale festival. So, that was you inside the Tenma Taro costume.Filch: Yep. And after the event, I went to watch that pro wrestling program... ...but it bored me to tears on account o' the wrestlers being complete jobbers.Apollo: (So, he didn't actually watch the entire wrestling match.)Filch: That's when I looked at the Tenma Taro costume and got a great idea! Nobody can tell it's me while I'm wearing it... ...and 'cause o' them superstitions, no matter what I do, the villages [sic] won't say a word!Judge: In other words, you used the superstitions to effectively render yourself invisible.Apollo: Why did you want to enter the Forbidden Chamber in the first place?Filch: 'Cause o' the treasure there! Thought that was my big chance to sneak on in 'n' nab it!Apollo: Treasure?Filch: Eh heh heh. Only that it's the greatest get-rich-quick chance in the universe. Grandpappy told me all about it. Said there's an amazing treasure in there!Apollo: (He went in there not knowing his grandfather had already pilfered it?)Athena: Guess this is one tale that didn't get passed down from grandpappy to grandson.Apollo: Wait, how exactly did you get into the Forbidden Chamber? There was a meeting in the Fox Chamber that day. Plus, the mayor swallowed the only key that could open the Forbidden Chamber's door. You couldn't have possibly gotten in!Filch: I could through the air vent in the foyer! The vent's left o' the alderman's picture. I went on in and made a nice little hole. Used that to get into the air duct that leads to the Forbidden Chamber, I did!Apollo: You what?!Athena: B-But how's that even possible? ...Wait a sec...! Remember that air vent in the Forbidden Chamber? So, Mr. Filch found a way to get into that air duct... ...and that's how he got from the foyer vent to the Forbidden Chamber vent?Judge: Hmm... So, Tenma Taro was nothing more than a cat burglar -- or rather, a tanuki burglar. And we're back to being without anyone to charge for the alderman's murder.Athena: Looks like our so-called yokai is nothing more than one big troublemaker.Apollo: Tell me, Mr. Filch, what did you do after fleeing to the foyer?Filch: I got outta that costume real quick. Woulda just caused trouble at that point!Apollo: And where is that costume now?Filch: Heck if I know. And it ain't my fault if ya never find it.Blackquill: The police searched every nook and cranny. No yokai costume was left in that manor.Apollo: (What if it was tossed outside the manor? ...Ah!) No way! But maybe, just maybe...!Judge: The defense seems to have hit upon an idea. Well, go on, Mr. Justice!Apollo: Okay, here's what I think... Mr. Filch! Did you get rid of the costume here?Present open window Apollo: Leads to: \"Did you toss it out the window?\"Present anywhere else Apollo: Blackquill: I already told you. Every nook and cranny of the manor was searched. No costume was ever recovered. Judge: The defense will remember to pay attention from now on! Apollo: Ack. (If the costume wasn't in the manor, then maybe it was thrown out somewhere.) Leads back to: \"Mr. Filch! Did you get rid of the costume here?\"Apollo: Did you toss it out the window? Because that would certainly explain why it didn't turn up inside the manor!Filch: You think I tossed it out the window? That costume cost me a pretty penny! So why would I go do something like that?!Apollo: (I can think of a few reasons...)Athena: Any bright ideas, Apollo?Apollo: Well, assuming the costume really was tossed out from the window... ...then the next question would be, what happened to it after that? (And if I'm right, I might have just the thing to prove what happened to the costume.) Phineas Filch......... I have just the evidence for you!Filch: Ya do?Apollo: This evidence proves you got rid of your Tenma Taro costume through the window!Present Special Edition Paper Apollo: Leads to: \"Ah, that's...\"Present anything else Apollo: Judge: And just how does that prove he got rid of it? Apollo: It doesn't, does it? Judge: No, it does not. Apollo: Ack. (Back to the drawing board. What would happen if the costume was tossed out the window? I must have some sort of evidence that can show what would happen!) Leads back to: \"This evidence proves you got rid of your Tenma Taro costume through the window!\"Filch: Ah, that's... ...Tenma Taro flying through the sky?Judge: And just how does that prove Mr. Filch threw his costume out the window?Apollo: It's quite simple. That's not Tenma Taro in the photo. It's the costume Mr. Filch threw out.Filch: Aw, that's crazy talk! You ain't serious, are ya?!Apollo: There's a steep cliff right outside the foyer window, meaning the manor is pretty high up. The costume flew through the air after it was tossed out. That's when the photo was taken. In other words, the photo of Tenma Taro really was a flight of fancy!Judge: Wh-Whaaaaaat?!Filch: Yiiiiiiiiiiikes!Judge: Oh, my! So there really never was a yokai.Filch: Aw, I can't keep any o' them cats bagged! Can I still file a claim for the lost costume?Apollo: This more than proves the defense's position. Jinxie Tenma had nothing to do with staging the yokai sighting.Judge: Care to raise any objections, Prosecutor Blackquill?Blackquill: ............None whatsoever. I'll deal with that tricksy tanuki after I've dealt with this case.Apollo: (We... We did it!)Athena: Good going! Now all we have to do is make Florent L'Belle take the stand!Blackquill:Blackquill: Sheathing the sword a bit early, are we not?Apollo: Huh?!Blackquill: Nothing has been proved beyond a doubt. Take this tricksy little tanuki for instance. How do you suppose he was able to exit the Forbidden Chamber?Apollo: Uh... Probably the same way he got in -- through the chamber's air vent!Blackquill: And what of the feathers and tracks at the scene of the crime? They would suggest that the tanuki exited through the chamber door, not the air vent.Apollo:Apollo: But the Forbidden Chamber doesn't open from the inside! So what you're saying makes no sense! ............Right?Blackquill: ......Hmph. Someone on the outside opened the door for you, isn't that right?Filch: Yep, that's right, Mr. Blackjack! The door suddenly sprung right open!Apollo:Apollo: Sprung right open? Who was on the other side?Filch: Didn't get a good look on account o' the sudden glare.Judge: Like how the reflection from my head blinds fellow moviegoers emerging from the dark.Filch: That's when I snatched that staff and made my daring escape! And then that lil' maid gal spotted me as I high-tailed it down the hall!Athena: That means the Forbidden Chamber wasn't opened until after the crime was discovered.Apollo: But wait... We still don't know who opened it. Maybe there really was a third person in the Fox Chamber.Blackquill:Blackquill: Well, you little tanuki? When the Forbidden Chamber opened, did you see the accused passed out there?Filch: Nope. Only one there was the alderman, and he was dead as a doornail.Blackquill: Hmph. If the accused wasn't there, what do you suppose he was up to?Apollo: Uh-oh. I don't like where this is going.Judge: Ah! Don't tell me--!Blackquill: Plainly, the only one who could have opened the Forbidden Chamber was... ...the accused Damian Tenma!Apollo: Arrrgh!Athena:Athena: Wait a second! There had to be somebody else besides Mayor Tenma there!Judge: Really? And who might that be?Athena: Oh, well, that would be...Blackquill:Blackquill: It seems our feisty little lass has forgotten the most important thing: evidence.Athena: I didn't forget...! I was just... testing your attention to details...?Judge: Ms. Cykes! You can't prove your point without proof of some sort! It's a proven fact!Athena: Sorry... Guess I put my foot in my mouth again.Apollo: No, Athena. We're definitely on to something here.Athena: We are?Apollo: Think about it. If Filch was stuck inside the Forbidden Chamber... ...one of the alibis we heard would no longer hold any water! The defense would like to call a new witness to the stand! Someone who knew Mr. Filch was stuck in the Forbidden Chamber! And by virtue of knowing this, has an alibi that no longer adds up!Blackquill: Ah! Not that insufferable--!Judge: Very well. The court will hear what Mr. Justice has to say. Whose alibi no longer adds up?Present Florent L'Belle profile Apollo: Leads to: \"Why, that's... that's the defendant's aide, Florent L'Belle.\"Present anyone else Apollo: Apollo: It's this person right here! Judge: Really?! Please explain, Mr. Justice. How does this person's alibi has vanish [sic] in this case? Apollo: Err... You know how your hand vanishes when you stick it into a dark room? Kinda like that. Judge: ............ Keep making half-baked statements like that... ...and it'll be the court's trust in you that will vanish! Apollo: Oh, uh... just kidding, heh heh. Judge: A penalty to dissuade the very unfunny Mr. Justice from pursuing a career in comedy. Apollo: (We know Filch was in the Forbidden Chamber at the time of the murder. Which means...) Your Honor! There IS someone whose alibi no longer adds up! Judge: Very well. You may try once again. Leads back to: \"Whose alibi no longer adds up?\"Judge: Why, that's... that's the defendant's aide, Florent L'Belle. Didn't he claim to be in the foyer at the time of the crime?Apollo: True, but in his alibi, he also claimed Mr. Filch was in the foyer, too. However, as we all know now, Mr. Filch was NOT there with Mr. L'Belle at that time. In short, Mr. L'Belle's alibi has disappeared!Blackquill: Argh!Apollo: Florent L'Belle's alibi was one big lie! Isn't that right, Mr. Filch!Filch: I reckon there ain't no keepin' that cat in the bag here, neither. It was all Mr. L'Belle's idea. He told me he'd button his lip about me breaking into the Forbidden Chamber. And in return, he said we'd vouch for each other's alibi.Judge: Shame on you, Mr. Filch! Perjury is a serious crime, you know!Filch: Aw, shucks... Mercy, Your Honorship, mercy! Aaaaaaaaagh!Apollo: I also assert that the person who opened the Forbidden Chamber for Mr. Filch... ...was none other than Florent L'Belle! After all, his alibi has just been proven to be a complete fabrication!Judge: ...I see. We will take a twenty-minute recess... ...after which time we will see what Mr. L'Belle has to say for himself.Apollo: (Yes! We're finally going to drag that slippery snake onto the stand!)Blackquill: .........Judge: In the meantime, the prosecution will question Mr. L'Belle about these new allegations!April 19, 10:25 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3Athena: We did it, Apollo! We finally dragged Mr. L'Belle into court!Apollo: ...Yeah.Athena: Hey, why the long face?Apollo: I can't help but feel I'm missing something important. Plus, Prosecutor Blackquill's bound to mount a counterattack.Athena: You really are a worrywart, aren't you? It'll be fine! That mystery figure who opened the Forbidden Chamber for Mr. Filch... ...had to have been Florent L'Belle!Apollo: I know. But that's not what's bugging me. I wish I could put my finger on it, though...Athena: At any rate, the big showdown with Mr. L'Belle is up next, so chin up, Apollo!April 19, 11:00 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 4Judge: Court is back in session. Our next witness is--L'Belle: ...Yes. I'm ACTING on behalf of the mayor in this VERY important matter.Judge: It seems the witness is predisposed at the moment.L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! SURELY you jest! I will hold you to your promise, remember that. Oh, my DEEPEST apologies. This is Florent L'Belle, PERSONAL aide to Mayor Tenma -- or should I say -- the accused.Apollo: (Ouch, like the poor mayor hasn't suffered enough...)L'Belle: Well, what business do YOU have with ME? I'm a VERY busy man, so let's make this as BRIEF as possible.Blackquill: ......Your Baldness.Judge: Ah, right. *ahem* Mr. Filch's testimony has revealed a hole in your alibi. And for this reason... ...you are suspected of having some sort of connection with the case at hand.L'Belle: Pffft. To think I'D be associated with this entirely lurid affair. Well, I'm NOT, so may I go now? I have VERY important matters to attend to.Apollo:Apollo: I don't think so, Mr. L'Belle! Do you realize what a serious crime you've committed?!Judge: Witness, you are being accused of perjury. This is your chance to clear the air.L'Belle: Fine. The truth is I faked my alibi for a VERY good reason. The mayor was OBVIOUSLY the killer, so I created a fake alibi to confuse the matter. You see, as his PERSONAL aide, I felt I HAD to protect him. SORRY! Ah ha ha ha!Apollo: You think this is funny?! Without your alibi, you're a suspect, too! What were you really doing at the time of the crime?!L'Belle: Pffft, PEASANT! How dare YOU accuse ME, one of the BEAUTIFUL people, of being--Athena:Athena: Stop stalling and tell the court what you were really doing at the time of the crime!Blackquill:Athena: ..................Blackquill: .........Enough jabbering. Swords have been drawn. The time for talk is past.Apollo: Swords? What swords?Blackquill: This is a duel to the death. The fate of the accused rests in our hands. Be gone, ye of cowardly heart! The battlefield hath no place for ye!Apollo: Again...?L'Belle: Oh, my.Judge: Spare me, pleeeeease!Apollo: So much for sturdier shackles. Aagh!Blackquill: Those chains hindered my vow that heads would roll this day.Apollo: (This gives \"keeping your head on in court\" a whole new meaning!)Blackquill: Will the witness please deliver the accused's death knell? You know of what I speak.L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Most CERTAINLY. His GOOSE is already COOKED. Time to stick a fork in him!Apollo: (Whatever he has to say can't be good.)L'Belle: As I TOLD Prosecutor Blackquill during the recess... ...I RUSHED right over to the Fox Chamber when I heard little Jinxie scream.Apollo: What?L'Belle: THEN -- drum roll please... ...I saw Mayor Tenma OPENING the Forbidden Chamber doors.Apollo: B-B-But...Blackquill: There you have it. The mystery man who opened the chamber door -- as witnessed by one Phineas Filch... It was the accused. There was never any third party.L'Belle: ......Oh, and THAT'S not all! I heard something QUITE startling there at the scene of the crime!Apollo: \"Startling\" sounds bad...L'Belle: The mayor, who was barely conscious, muttered this... \"Forgive me, Jinxie. I killed the alderman.\" That's right! The mayor ACTUALLY confessed to the murder right then and there!Judge: H-H-He confessed?! Order! Order in the court! This is quite conclusive testimony if it stands!Blackquill: Just so. And quite astonishing, I might add. I only learned of this fact during the recess.L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! I just LOVE surprises, don't you? That's why I saved the best for last. Consider it a gift from ME to YOU!Athena: No way. I don't believe Mr. L'Belle heard the mayor confess.Judge: But... but is this really true? Did Mayor Tenma really confess?Blackquill: It is, indeed. During that last recess, I confirmed it with the mayor's daughter. It would seem Mayor Tenma actually did confess.Judge: Hmm... That testimony is quite favorable to the prosecution's--L'Belle: This is L'Belle. Yes, I called earlier about the PARTY reservations. That's right. And I'll be calling MY little shindig \"Mayor Tenma's Conviction Gala.\" A SPLENDID time is guaranteed for all -- all but the mayor and his defense, ah ha ha ha!Judge: Well, as it seems our witness is a very busy man, let's get right to his testimony. Mr. L'Belle, please tell us what you saw when you came upon the scene of the crime.Witness Testimony-- What L'Belle Saw --L'Belle: I was in the hallway, HIDING in the shadows. THAT'S when I heard the confession. Upon LEARNING of her father's crime, little Jinxie fled without EVER noticing me. Immediately AFTER that, the mayor came to, stood up and opened the Forbidden Chamber! As I ran in TERROR, the demon emerged from his prison! In shock, I FLED down the hallway to my right -- the one with the PHONE at the end.Judge: I must say... this is a shocking revelation... Quite unexpected. To think the defendant actually confessed then and there to his crime!L'Belle: Perhaps the guilt was TOO much to bear, so he confided in his daughter.Judge: You do realize you should not have withheld such crucial testimony from the court!L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Once again, SORRY! It's just, I feared being accused if I mentioned coming upon that MOST unpleasant scene.Apollo: Argh. Why did the mayor's confession have to be brought up by THIS guy...Athena: We better do something before the judge declares the mayor guilty!Blackquill: ...Hmph. As a death row inmate once told me in years gone by... \"There is a time to fight and a time to yield. A time to live, and a time to die.\"Apollo: Arrrgh! (He's laying it on real thick now.)Judge: The defense may now cross-examine the witness.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- What L'Belle Saw --L'Belle: I was in the hallway, HIDING in the shadows. THAT'S when I heard the confession.Press Apollo: Apollo: You claim that the mayor confessed to his daughter. Are you sure about that? L'Belle: PEASANT! You wouldn't DARE ask such a question if you truly understood. TRUE beauty is never wrong. Apollo: It's not? L'Belle: No, beauty is carved DEEP in the DNA. That means I'M programmed to ALWAYS be right, EVEN when I'm wrong. Apollo: I'm not following. L'Belle: These exquisite ears like flowers abloom... These eyes that shine like pearls... This hair like the finest silk... Nothing can corrupt the truth they hold! Apollo: Uh... right... Judge: Hmm... The witness will hurry up and explain this truth of his. Specifically, what did Jinxie Tenma do upon hearing the confession?L'Belle: Upon LEARNING of her father's crime, little Jinxie fled without EVER noticing me.Press Apollo: Apollo: How did Ms. Tenma appear to you? L'Belle: Oh, the poor little thing seemed POSITIVELY heartbroken -- all teary eyed and whatnot. I couldn't help but shed a few tears myself after seeing her like that. Athena: He actually sympathized with Jinxie? Seems like an overly human emotion for him. Apollo: Yeah, because he's the only real monster we've seen so far -- in looks and in character. L'Belle: The NEXT thing I did was check my face in the mirror. Apollo: Checked your face? Why? L'Belle: Pffft! To behold the beauty that is my sadness, why else! Athena: ...Apollo, I'm starting to lose all faith in humanity. Apollo: I know the feeling, but hang in there. At least keep faith in our client. Judge: Let's keep moving, shall we? So what happened next?L'Belle: Immediately AFTER that, the mayor came to, stood up and opened the Forbidden Chamber!Press Apollo: Apollo: He opened the Forbidden Chamber? But why would he do that? L'Belle: Who knows? MAYBE he wanted to free the demon, Tenma Taro? Apollo: Apollo: The courtroom is no place for fairy tales! Remember, you ARE under oath! L'Belle: Hello? L'Belle speaking. ...Yes, I will CERTAINLY explore the matter. Toodles! Now, WHERE were we again? Apollo: You were going to tell us the real reason why the mayor opened the Forbidden Chamber! L'Belle: Oh, yes! Of course. Hello? This is L'Belle. ...A ha ha ha! Good one, sir! You're an ABSOLUTE riot. ...Okay, bye. You were saying? Apollo: Never mind. (This is a waste of time. He's just going to tell more lies.) Judge: The witness will focus on his testimony, not his phone calls. Now, tell the court what you did after you saw the mayor open the Forbidden Chamber. L'Belle: Well, after THAT...L'Belle: As I ran in TERROR, the demon emerged from his prison!Press Apollo: Apollo: What was Mr. Filch like at the time? L'Belle: He was shouting, \"I can't see! I can't see! It's the curse o' Tenma Taro!\" THEN, he took off running like a MADMAN. Apollo: He must've been blinded by the sudden light flooding in. L'Belle: Wrong. Apollo: What? L'Belle: He set EYES upon me... ...and was thus BLINDED by my radiant beauty! Apollo: ......... Athena: ...So, it was the curse of Florent L'Belle, rather than Tenma Taro? L'Belle: Yes, I'm afraid such beauty can be a curse. It's almost criminal. Blackquill: ...The only thing criminal here... is your ceaseless jabbering. Now, get on with your testimony. L'Belle: Oh, forgive me, Your Darkness. Let's see... Oh, yes. I FLED for dear life from Tenma Taro, and...L'Belle: In shock, I FLED down the hallway to my right -- the one with the PHONE at the end.Press Apollo: Apollo: So, after you fled into the hallway with the phone at the end... ...Tenma Taro ran off toward the foyer? L'Belle: PRECISELY. Athena: Notice any inconsistencies, Apollo? Apollo: Well, Jinxie also saw Tenma Taro, right? Athena: She did. She said they passed each other in the hall after she made that call to the police. Apollo: Well, if L'Belle had fled down the hall where that phone is... ...Jinxie would've seen him when she was returning from making her call. Athena: Oh, right. And if she saw him, she would've definitely asked him for help. Apollo: Right. It just doesn't make any sense. (Time to review the evidence.)Present Jinxie's Statement Apollo: Leads to: \"Florent L'Belle, you're lying about having witnessed those events from the hallway!\"Athena: If we don't find some way to poke a hole in his testimony... ...Mayor Tenma is as good as guilty!Apollo: This is bad, very bad.Athena: We need to find an inconsistency, a mistake, some kind of conflict!Apollo: (It's all over if we can't find a flaw in the prosecution's case!)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Trucy Wright\nDescription: An aspiring magician who Mr. Wright adopted when duty called.\nCharacter 1\nName: Jinxie Tenma\nDescription: The maid of Kyubi Manor and a friend of Trucy.

To this day, it is said that he slumbers even still within the Forbidden Chamber. Man: Night, night, alderman... Sweet dreams! At long last... The revival of Tenma Taro is at hand. A few months prior to the courthouse bombing... April 17, 12:13 PMWright Anything Agency Apollo: Hm. Guess I'm a little early. Trucy: Oh, hey, Apollo! Getting an early start today? Apollo: Yeah! This is the first job I've had in a while after all! Trucy: Well, aren't we all fired up! Apollo: Well, it's not every day I get a call from Mr. Wright. What kind of work is it anyway? Mr. Wright didn't mention any details. Trucy: Work? Is that how he put it? Apollo: (Don't tell me he just wants me to clean the toilet again.) Trucy: You've really become a fixture around here, Apollo. Apollo: (Come to think of it, it's been almost a year since I was hired. A lot's happened since then... ...But I've settled in nicely despite a few bumps in the road.) Apollo: My name is Apollo Justice. I've been practicing law for about a year, but I still have a lot to learn. This is the Wright Anything Agency, and it's where I work. Don't let the name fool you -- it's definitely a law agency. Trucy: But don't forget that this place is a \"talent agency\" too, Polly! Apollo: Uhh, it's the \"law agency\" part of this office that's usually forgotten... This is Trucy Wright, a budding magician... ...and adopted daughter of the agency's owner, Phoenix Wright. She sometimes makes me help with her magic tricks. Trucy: And what's wrong with that? You're one of the agency's \"talents\" as well! Apollo: I was under the impression that I was a lawyer... Trucy: Oh, we'd better hurry. Doesn't look Daddy's going to make it, so let's get going. Apollo: Huh? Where are we going? What about the job he mentioned? Trucy: This IS the job, Polly! You're supposed to keep me company today! Now, come on! Apollo: Another day of not being a lawyer. Should've seen this coming. Trucy: Well, this is the \"Wright ANYTHING Agency,\" y'know. And there's no law-related work at the moment, so... Apollo: (Tell me again why I chose to \"work\" here?) Where is Mr. Wright, anyway? Trucy: Daddy said something about going to meet an acquaintance. But don't worry. Just focus on your job, and I'll tell you exactly what you need to know. Well, let's go. We don't have all day! Apollo: Wait a second! (*sigh* And another day of \"anything goes\" begins at the Wright Anything Agency...) April 17, 1:30 PMNine-Tails Vale - Yokai Lane Apollo: Whew... So, what are we doing way up here in the mountains? Trucy: This is Nine-Tails Vale. Everyone's been talking about the yokai craze here. Apollo: Yokai? Oh, you mean Japanese monsters? Guess that explains all these weird things... Speaking of which, wasn't Nine-Tails Vale founded by Japanese immigrants? Trucy: Yeah. They're holding a festival to boost tourism over at the alderman's manor. My friend who works there invited us. That's why we're here! Apollo: In other words, I'm your chaperon because your dad was too busy. Trucy: Daddy said that with those horns of yours, you'd make a great addition to their festival. I mean, you look just like a Japanese demon! Wasn't that so thoughtful of him, Polly?! Apollo: I could do without thoughtfulness like that. Trucy: Oh, it's almost time! Come on, Polly! The festival grounds are this way. Apollo: (Alright, I guess it's time to move to the \"Kyubi Manor's Garden\"...) Talk The monster craze Apollo: This monster craze... Come to think of it, I think I heard about it on TV. It's supposedly how Nine-Tails Vale made a comeback from the brink of fiscal disaster. Trucy: Hmm... Our agency could sure use something positive like that. Oh, I know! Let's jump on board the monster craze! You and daddy would be a perfect comedy duo! You could call yourselves Agni & Rudra, Demon Kings of Comedy! Daddy sets them up, and you knock 'em down! Hey, I think we hit the jackpot with this idea! Apollo: Um... Sorry, but I plan on staying a lawyer. Trucy: You do?! Apollo: (You don't have to act so surprised by that.) What to do Apollo: Hey, Trucy? Have you seen my attorney's badge? Trucy: How could you lose something so important? Sometimes I really wonder about you, Apollo. Apollo: This is so weird. I wonder if I dropped it somewhere. Trucy: Oh, look! What are these panties doing here? Apollo: Forget about panties. I'm looking for my badge. Trucy: 3, 2, 1... Ta-dah! Did you forget? These are my magic panties! Apollo: ......Hey! That's my attorney's badge! Wow! How'd you do that? Trucy: I set it all up while we were back at the office. Apollo: Wow, I didn't even-- Wait, you took my badge?! Present Attorney's Badge Apollo: Check it out. Trucy: You're so lucky, Apollo. Everyone can see what you do with just a flash of your badge. Apollo: What about you, Trucy? People can tell you're a magician by the way you're dressed. Trucy: Yeah, but I can't always dress like this. Like when I'm at school and stuff. Apollo: You could always show you're a magician by making things appear or disappear. Trucy: You mean like this? 3, 2, 1... Ta-dah! Apollo: Umm, magic or no, aren't you a little old to be showing those things in public? Trucy: Hmm... Then maybe I'll become a lawyer, too. Apollo: You're abandoning your dream just like that?! April 17, 2:05 PMKyubi Manor - Garden Apollo: Wow, this place is really something. Trucy: It definitely feels like a different world here. ???: Trucy. Trucy: Jinxie! Apollo: And this is? Trucy: My friend, Jinxie Tenma. She's the one who invited us. She just happens to be the maid here. Jinxie: ...Two horns. A love of red. Are you a demon? Apollo: No, ha ha. I'm Apollo Justice! Nice to meet you! Jinxie: Eeeeeek! He IS a demon! Apollo: What the--! Jinxie: Be gone, foul beast! Trucy: Hee hee! You look great, Polly. Fills in some of that space on your forehead! Apollo: Argh... What is this thing? Trucy: It's a warding charm. Jinxie puts them on all the monsters she finds. Apollo: Um, but I'm not a monster. Trucy: Maybe I should have told her you're a good demon. Apollo: Or you could just say I'm human. Jinxie: *shiver* The red demon, emissary of the Underworld. Apollo: (I got up early to do my hair for this?) Um, can I take this off now? Jinxie: So you can eat me? Apollo: I'm not going to eat you! Jinxie: Eek! Forgive me, O terrible one! Trucy: Tone down your Chords of Steel, Apollo. You're scaring her out of her wits! Apollo: Um, don't worry. I'm already full. Jinxie: Please stay that way. Apollo: (Great, now I'm playing along, too.) Talk Nine-Tails Vale Apollo: Um, so I wanted to ask you about Nine-Tails Vale... Jinxie: Eeeeeek! Apollo: Aaaaugh! Jinxie: Be gone, foul demon! Trucy: Looks like you've been demonized, Polly, literally! Apollo: I'm starting to wonder if I really am a demon myself. Um... Jinxie: Eek! Please don't eat me. I have food if you're hungry. Apollo: This isn't working. We won't get anything out of her until we set the record straight. Trucy: Hmmm... If only we had some way to prove you're not as scary as you look. Apollo: (Ouch, unnecessary roughness... Looks like I have to present some proof. Proof that I'm one hundred percent human! (Changed from [Proof that I'm 100% human!] in the original release)) Present Attorney's Badge Apollo: Would you mind taking a look at this? Jinxie: Eeeeek! No, thank you! Be gone, foul demon! Apollo: Ack, banished again. Trucy: That's what you get when you flash a girl like that -- even if it was just your badge. Apollo: Sheesh, you make it sound like I'm some kind of creep. Attorney's Badge (after clearing \"Nine-Tails Vale\" Talk option) Leads to: \"Um, I wanted to show you this.\" Apollo: Um, I wanted to show you this. Jinxie: Eek! What is it?! Apollo: It's my attorney's badge. You see? I'm not a demon, I'm a lawyer. Jinxie: Really?! ...You're a lawyer? Apollo: (Whew... Maybe now she'll stop calling me a demon.) Jinxie: Does it protect you from Enma Dai-O's judgment? Apollo: Who's Enma Dai-O? Trucy: I read somewhere that he's the demon lord who punishes the dead for their sins. (Changed from [I read somewhere that's [sic] he's the demon lord who punishes the dead for their sins.] in the original release) Uh-oh! I think now she thinks you're a demon lawyer from hell, Polly! Apollo: Can I go back to being just a normal demon?! Jinxie: Please... Please don't boil me in a scalding cauldron. I'd prefer a Turkish bath if possible. Apollo: (A Turkish bath? Isn't that more sauna than bath?) Trucy: Don't worry, Jinxie, he's a good demon. He'll save you if you ever go astray! Jinxie: Eek! Please, Mr. Demon Lawyer, sir, have mercy on my soul! Apollo: Argh! I told you, I'm not a demon! And Trucy, you're just making things wors--! (Ack!) Umm... You just leave that Enma Dai-O to me. Trucy: Isn't that great, Jinxie?! Jinxie: Uh-huh. I'm no longer scared to cross into the afterlife. Apollo: (Will someone tell these two I'm human, already!) Talk Nine-Tails Vale Trucy: So, Jinxie, I hear this village is the epicenter of the monster craze. Jinxie: Uh-huh. Barely anyone had even heard of it before, but now it's packed with tourists. Apollo: Really? So, the monster craze is the reason behind today's festival? Jinxie: It was the alderman's idea. But I'd be careful if I were you. There are lots and lots of yokai prowling about Nine-Tails Vale. Apollo: Prowling about? You mean like wild animals or something? Jinxie: Uh-huh. And they're hungry, too. Apollo: Man-eating monsters?! And they're all over the place? Jinxie: Uh-huh. In fact, there was one at the manor yesterday. I heard the doorbell ring, but when I opened the door, nobody was there. It was the Ding-Dong Demon! How else could you explain it? Apollo: Well... When I was a kid, my friends used to play this prank called Ding-Dong Ditch. Jinxie: Well, that doesn't prove yokai aren't real. There's even one here at the manor. The demon Tenma Taro -- he's imprisoned in the Forbidden Chamber. Apollo: Tenma... Taro? The Forbidden Chamber? Tenma Taro (appears after \"Nine-Tails Vale\") Leads to: \"Um, about that yokai you said was imprisoned here at the manor. Is it true?\" Present Attorney's Badge Jinxie: So you really are a demon lawyer. Ummm... So, then, you must know Enma Dai-O, the Appraiser of Souls. What's he like? Apollo: What's he like?! Well, uh... he's um... He's bald, has a white beard, and... Jinxie: A-A-And what? Apollo: He shouts, \"Guilty!\" and \"Order!\", while banging his gavel. I call him \"The Judge.\" Jinxie: Oh, wow, he's as scary as I thought. Apollo: Nah, he's just an old man who's wiser than you might think. Apollo: Um, about that yokai you said was imprisoned here at the manor. Is it true? Jinxie: Uh-huh. He's a super evil demon named Tenma Taro. Here, take a look at this scroll. Tenma Taro's the dark demon you see here. He's super evil and super scary. Apollo: So that's the yokai imprisoned in the Forbidden Chamber? Jinxie: Uh-huh. He was defeated by the village guardian yokai, the Nine-Tailed Fox... ...and locked away forever. Apollo: So... you're saying Tenma Taro is still trapped inside the Forbidden Chamber? Jinxie: Uh-huh. But he's just biding his time until he can escape. Still, we should be perfectly safe! Because there's a reeeally powerful sealing charm on the door keeping it shut tight! Apollo: (What a... charming security system.) Jinxie: You can keep the scroll if you want. The alderman gave me this, but just holding it gives me the chills, so... Apollo: Ah, uh, thanks, Jinxie. (Maybe I'll give this to Mr. Wright.) Yokai Legend Scroll added to the Court Record. Apollo: So... I was wondering... Are those things on your forehead also warding charms, Jinxie? Jinxie: Yes, they're to prevent evil things from getting inside me. Papa told me to wear them. Apollo: Evil things? Trucy: Apollo, don't you dare take those charms off her forehead! They HAVE to stay there... forever! Got it?! Apollo: (I wonder what would happen if I did take them off...?) Jinxie: It's time for me to get back to work. Trucy: Thanks for inviting us, Jinxie! Jinxie: You're welcome. Oh, and before I forget... There's going to be a surprise event today. Even I don't know what's to expect, but it's sure to be fun. Apollo: (Better not be a yokai parade. She'd probably drop dead from fright.) Jinxie: .........Hm? .........Eeeeek! Apollo: Ahhh! D-D-Demon! (Oh, wait... It's just someone in a suit... right?) Jinxie: T-T-Tenma T-Taro! Apollo: Tenma Taro? (The demon from the Forbidden Chamber?) Jinxie: Eeeeeek! Please don't hurt me! Be gone! Be gone! Be gone! Tenma Taro: Hissssssss! Better watch out little girl, or I'll snatch you away! Jinxie: Eek! Charm charm charm...! Where's that \"Die and Go To Heaven\" charm?! Trucy: Oh, she put it on her own forehead this time! Apollo: ...She sure gives up quick. (Huh? Why's everyone hiding their faces?) Villager: Hey, you there! You mustn't stare at Tenma Taro like that! Lower your eyes! He'll steal your soul if you're not careful! Apollo: Huh? (Steal my soul? Seriously?) ???: Your devilry stops here and now, Tenma Taro! Apollo: Now what?! Trucy: Look, Apollo! There's somebody up on the roof! ???: Ah-ha ha ha ha ha! Villager: That booming laugh! Could it be...! ???: My nine golden tails are proof of my unassailable righteousness! With my band of one hundred minions, I vanquish evil from the land! (Changed from [With my band of 100 minions, I vanquish evil from the land!] in the original release) I am the wrestler of righteousness! Ya-ha! Wrestler: The golden lord of yokai, The Amazing Nine-Tails, is here! Fear not, good little boys and girls! For I shall defeat Tenma Taro! Ah-ha ha ha ha ha! Ah-ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Villager: Hurray! Hurray! It's The Amazing Nine-Tails! Wrestler: Up to your no good tricks again, eh, Tenma Taro?! Well, not on my watch! Tenma Taro: Aaaaaaaaaaaah! Wrestler: A-ha ha ha ha ha ha! There's nothing to fear now, my child! I have banished Tenma Taro! You and your people can now live in peace! Jinxie: Th-Thank you, Mr. Amazing Nine-Tails, sir! Wrestler: Now, I must be off! Another match and another foe to vanquish, await! Apollo: W-What was that all about? Did that wrestler just chase off a yokai? Looked like he came out of the alderman's manor. Jinxie: That was The Amazing Nine-Tails! He's a pro wrestler from right here in Nine-Tails Vale. But no one knows his true identity! Apollo: (Jinxie sure seems chipper all of a sudden.) What was all that about him banishing Tenma Taro? Jinxie: That was a yokai exorcism. It's an annual ritual where Tenma Taro is released, to remind us of his wickedness. In the end, the Nine-Tailed Fox drives Tenma Taro out, and purifies our village. But The Amazing Nine-Tails did the honors this year! Apollo: (So that was the big surprise, huh? The Amazing Nine-Tails and Tenma Taro, huh... Well, whatever floats her boat.) Jinxie: Oh, would you look at the time. I'd better get back to work. Please excuse me. Apollo: She's a strange one, all right. Trucy: I think she's sweet in her own special way. (Changed from [I think she's sweet in own her [sic] special way.] in the original release) Apollo: (Knowing Trucy, she probably has lots of friends who are \"sweet\" in their own way.) Trucy: Well, we still have some time to kill. Might as well see the rest of Nine-Tails Vale while we're here. Apollo: The fun never stops, does it? .............................. .............................. April 17, 3:40 PMKyubi Manor - Garden Trucy: I think I bought nearly every yokai souvenir that was for sale. Apollo: I know, because my wallet's running on empty. Trucy: Hm? What's with all the commotion over there? Apollo: Huh? Hey, isn't that your friend Jinxie?! I hope everything's okay. Jinxie: I-I-It's t-t-terrible! Th-Th-Thththth...! The--! The--! Trucy: Calm down, Jinxie! Tell us what happened. Jinxie: Th-Th-The demon T-Tenma T-Taro... ...He killed Alderman Kyubi! Apollo: Whaaaaaat?! Trucy: Wait, killed as in dead? Jinxie: Yes. And Tenma Taro did it! Apollo: Tenma Taro?! You stay here while I go have a look. Jinxie: P-Please, wait! Apollo: Huh...? Ack! Jinxie: It's a... Tenma Taro Warding Charm. It should protect you, but please... be careful. The alderman's in the Fox Chamber at the top of the main staircase. Apollo: Okay, got it! Tenma Taro Warding Charm slipped into pocket. April 17Kyubi Manor - Fox Chamber Anime cutscene Apollo: A-Are you all right?! Man: Wh-Who are you...? Apollo: H-Help! Someone call an ambulance! Apollo: The police arrived soon after that, at which point I returned to the festival grounds. Apparently, the man impaled by the spear was already dead. But there was one other person there, and he was immediately rushed to the hospital. April 17Kyubi Manor - Garden Apollo: Thank goodness the other man's going to be fine. Sounds like he'd only been unconscious. Trucy: You think Jinxie's going to be okay? Apollo: I'm sure she'll be back to her old self in no time. At least she's calm enough for the police to question her for now. (And I'd sure love to know what crazy animal left those feathers and tracks...) Trucy: Oh, look, here comes Jinxie. Jinxie: ...Hi, Trucy. ...Hi, Mr. Demon Lawyer. Apollo: Heya... Feeling any better? ...I was wondering if you're up to filling us in on what happened... Talk About what happened Apollo: So, the man with the spear in his chest was already dead? Jinxie: Uh-huh. It was Alderman Kyubi. When I found him, he was already... Apollo: (So the victim was the village alderman...) And the one who was found alive? Who was he? Jinxie: Damian Tenma. He's the mayor of the neighboring city, Tenma Town. They arrested him. *sob* Apollo: So... he's the killer? Ack! Jinxie: Nuh-uh! Papa didn't kill anyone! Apollo: Papa? As in... your father? Trucy: That's right. Jinxie's dad is mayor of Tenma Town. Apollo: No way! Jinxie: Errr... Yes, way, but he's innocent. Apollo: (This just got way more complicated. The victim was the alderman of Nine-Tails Vale. And Jinxie's father, the mayor of Tenma Town, was arrested for the crime. Sounds like we have some investigating to do.) Trucy: I know this is difficult, Jinxie, but you need to hang in there! Jinxie: I know. I'll try my best. Apollo: Would you mind telling me a little more about the victim? The alderman (appears after \"About what happened\") Leads to: \"So the victim was the village alderman? What can you tell me about him?\" Present Yokai Legend Scroll Jinxie: They sell those at the village souvenir shop. Apollo: They really went all out, making it look like a real scroll and all. Jinxie: By rolling it up like that, you can't see Tenma Taro's picture. It's so you don't lose your soul if you accidentally gazed upon him. Even if it is a souvenir, no one in this village wants to accidentally see what's inside! Apollo: I've heard of losing or selling your soul for many things, but for the price of a souvenir? Jinxie: I wonder how many innocent shop girls have fallen victim. *shivers* Apollo: Wouldn't it be better not to sell them at all? Tenma Taro Warding Charm Jinxie: That warding charm is my supernatural security system. It protects me from yokai -- ghosts, demons, and other things that go bump in the night! Just the other day, I was chased down by a demented camera demon. But I drove him back with my trusty warding charm! Apollo: (Camera demon? Sounds more like an overexcited tourist.) Jinxie: Still, I suppose it's not nice to repel every yokai I meet. I mean, there are some that aren't all bad. I learned that today. Apollo: (Um... Why is she staring at me like that?) Apollo: So the victim was the village alderman? What can you tell me about him? Jinxie: His name was Rex Kyubi. They say his family has ties to the legendary Nine-Tailed Fox. He was really kind, and he always looked out for me. He was a former pro wrestler, and I even heard he knew The Amazing Nine-Tails. Apollo: (A former pro wrestler, huh... Hmm... That's something to keep in mind.) With your father being mayor and all, I guess you're originally from Tenma Town, huh? So then, why did you come work here? Trucy: It was to overcome your fears, right, Jinxie? Jinxie: Uh-huh. Plus, Mama was from Nine-Tails Vale, though she's no longer with us. She loved these flowers. I always wanted to live where Nine-Tails flowers grew. Trucy: Wow, what a beautiful flower. And with exactly nine petals, too! Jinxie: Just looking at them gives me courage, even when I'm scared of yokai. Nine-Tails Flower added to the Court Record. Apollo: Jinxie, when you first told us what happened, you said the killer was a demon. Jinxie: Uh-huh. The warding charm on the Forbidden Chamber's door... It's been... removed. Apollo: (The Forbidden Chamber's door? That big door that was barred shut? There wasn't a charm on it when I checked it out, so I guess it was removed by someone...) Jinxie: That's how Tenma Taro escaped! Ooh... Ooooooh! But when... when I try and remember what happened, it all goes... fuzzy. Trucy: Jinxie, you should do get some rest. You've been through a lot today. Apollo: (Between the warding charm being removed, and the black feathers and weird tracks... ...I could see how a superstitious person might think a demon was the killer.) Trucy: Apollo! Maybe this is your chance. Apollo: Chance for what? Trucy: To do the right thing and defend Jinxie's dad in court! Apollo: Who, me? Wouldn't a man like Mayor Tenma have access to more experienced lawyers? Jinxie: Umm... You wanna know what the detectives said? They doubted there was a lawyer who could get a not-guilty verdict in this one. Apollo: (Sounds like they're expecting an open and shut case.) Trucy: Don't worry, Jinxie! If anyone can prove your dad's innocence, it's Polly! Apollo: Wha--?! Trucy: You'll accept the case, won't you, Polly! Jinxie: Ooh... It's all over, isn't it? I'll... I'll be all alone... for the rest of my life. Apollo: (Oh, right... Jinxie already lost her mother.) ...All right. Jinxie, leave your father's defense to me! Trucy: Atta boy, Polly! Jinxie: You're going to help Papa, Mr. Demon Lawyer? Apollo: Yep, because that's what lawyers do. (Plus, no toilet cleaning for a while!) I'll do whatever it takes to make sure your father walks away a free man! Jinxie: Th-Thank you, Mr. Demon Lawyer! I can tell you're one of the good ones. Red Demons are usually so mean. Apollo: (It's been awhile, but I'll be fine! Ready or not, here comes Justice! Guess I oughta go and meet my new client.) Ah, but before I forget... (Better jot this down in my notebook.) Trucy: Hey, Apollo, what's the notebook for? Apollo: Oh, I just thought I should jot down some stuff about the case. And so I don't misplace them, I'm putting my Notes in the Court Record. I guess it's what you would call a \"To-Do\" list. Trucy: Oh? Sounds handy. Apollo: (To read my notes, I just open the Court Record with [R / RB / E]. Then I can switch between the tabs using [L / LB / Q] and [R / RB / E].) Trucy: Oh, I almost forgot! So, about Jinxie's father... No matter how scary he seems, promise me you'll resist the urge to run away! Apollo: Wait, what? Jinxie: His angry glare can paralyze you with fear. Trucy: And some claim he can even shoot laser beams from his eyes. Jinxie: Well, maybe Papa isn't really THAT scary... Apollo: (A paralyzing stare... Laser beams from his eyes... He sounds like some kind of monster.) Trucy: Hm, I think it's about time I see Jinxie off. I'll head back to the office after I'm done. Apollo: Okay, thanks. April 17Detention Center - Visitor's Room Apollo: Ah, visiting hours. Perfect timing. (Hope he's not as scary as he sounds...) ???: ...Who are you? Apollo: (Yikes!) S-So you're Damian Tenma, r-right?! I'm, uhh... I'm Apollo Justice, attorney-at-law! I'm here to, uhh... I'm here to help! Huh? Aaaaaaaaaaah! (Lemme outta here!) S-Sorry, sorry! I get a little loud sometimes! Tenma: How... incredibly... RUDE! Apollo: Umm, sorry. Did I do something to offend you? Tenma: A visitor when all others shun me like a common criminal! And here I am with nothing to offer! I am the epitome of rude! Apollo: (.........Wait, so he wasn't mad at me?) Tenma: Unworthy as I am, I, Damian Tenma, shall breach these walls... ...so that I may treat my benefactor to some tea, and maybe some cookies, too. Apollo: No, wait! We can do tea and cookies after we prove your innocence! How about you start by telling me what happened? Tenma: Hrmmm... I see. So tea and cookies can wait, can they? Apollo: (Whew, that was close. We don't need \"jailbreak\" added to the list of charges. Seems like a good guy, but with a face like that, I can see why he's misunderstood.) Talk Reason for arrest Apollo: Mayor Tenma. Do you mind if I ask why you were arrested? Tenma: ! Grrrrrr! Apollo: Whoa! S-Sorry! I guess some things are better left unsaid! Tenma: Bah! Apollo: Excuse me? Tenma: To think a public paragon such as I could be treated like this! This arrest should have never happened! Apollo: Go on... Tenma: I fear the ill effects it will have on our youth! Now I've but one choice. I must leave here at once, if only to protect the moral fiber of our youth! Apollo: No, wait! You can protect the moral fiber of our youth after you've been declared not guilty! Tenma: Hrmmm... I suppose you're right. Apollo: (Phew... Our youth just came this close to quite a scare.) Tenma: My fingerprints were on the spear that killed Alderman Kyubi. That's why I was arrested. Apollo: Your prints were on the murder weapon? That's never good. Any idea how they got there? Tenma: None. For I hardly remember a thing, you see. I was fast asleep at the time. Someone must have slipped me a sleeping pill or something. What's worse, somebody clobbered me on the head. Apollo: I see... A drug induced slumber, and a blow to the head. No wonder you hardly remember a thing. Tenma: ............Ho. Apollo: (Huh? Was that some kind of strange laugh?) Well, I think we can safely assume your prints were planted while you were unconscious. Motive Apollo: What do the police have on you as far as a motive is concerned? Tenma: Truth be told, there's been a bit of trouble between the alderman and I as of late. Apollo: Oh? Was it personal in nature? Tenma: Nothing like that. It's a long story... ...but suffice to say, I've been pushing to merge Nine-Tails Vale with Tenma Town. Surrender Nine-Tails Vale to Tenma Town now!!! Apollo: Yikes! Tenma: ...That's what I told him. Apollo: (I'd like to tell YOU to stop shouting like that, but I'm too scared!) So, um, that's the motive the police have established for the alderman's murder? Tenma: Indeed it is. After all, Alderman Kyubi was dead set against a municipal merger. Apollo: And that's why they think you killed him, he was in your way. Tenma: Arrrrrrgh! Cuuuurrrrssseeees! Apollo: Um, M-Mayor Tenma? Are you okay...? Tenma: Jinxie! Forgive me! I never meant to worry you like this! Apollo: It'll work out fine! Just leave it to me! (If only it really were that easy. I don't even know where to start...) Present Attorney's Badge Tenma: ......Thank you for agreeing to defend me. Apollo: Oh, no thanks required. Just doing my job. Tenma: ............ ............ Apollo: (He's even scarier when he's not saying anything.) Um... Nice day today, huh? Tenma: ............Hrmmm. Apollo: I, um, love nice days like these. It's, uh, perfect lawyering weather, heh heh heh! Tenma: The trial......... is tomorrow. Apollo: Yes, right, the trial! (Why do I keep blabbering on like that?) Tenma Taro Warding Charm Apollo: Those charms on your head... They're the same as this one, correct? Tenma: Indeed they are. Jinxie applied them after the murder. She said they would keep Tenma Taro from possessing me. Apollo: Oh, right! (So it's not some creepy fashion statement.) Still, there are an awful lot of them. Tenma: That there are. Truth be told, my head's feeling a bit... itchy. Apollo: Can't you just peel them off? Tenma: Jinxie did this for me. I could not hurt her feelings like that. Apollo: (He really cares for his daughter.) Anything else Apollo: I wanted to show you this. Tenma: ! Apollo: Aaagh! Sorry! Tenma: ............... Apollo: (I hate when he clams up like this.) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: Thank you for meeting with me, Mayor Tenma. Tenma: Please, wait. My daughter, Jinxie... Apollo: Yes? Tenma: She... she already lost her mother. And now with me being held in here, I fear she'll be terribly lonely. I hesitate to ask, but......... I beg you, be a friend to her in her time of need. Apollo: Leave it to me! Trucy and I will look out for your daughter! Tenma: I shall rest a little easier, then. You know, you remind me of some of the new friends Jinxie has been talking about. Apollo: New... friends? Tenma: Yes. It seems she's made some new friends since she started working in Nine-Tails Vale. They're quite the unusual bunch, too. There's a lady with an exceptionally long neck... ...a young lad with an incredibly long tongue, and many other interesting characters. Apollo: (Friends? Sounds more like a bunch of monsters to me!) Tenma: Now, if you would excuse me. It appears my time is up. Apollo: (Whew... Why am I so tired? I must've been more tense than I thought... Still, I'm glad he didn't turn out to be as scary as he looks!) A call? ...Oh, it's Mr. Wright. Justice here. Phoenix: Apollo, is that you? Apollo: Hi, Mr. Wright. What can I do for you? Phoenix: Trucy told me you've taken on a new case. Apollo: Oh, that. It was kinda spur of the moment. (He's actually calling ME about a case?) Phoenix: That's fine, but I have a favor to ask. Apollo: Sure. What is it? Phoenix: I'm at the airport right now. There was someone I had to meet. A new addition to the agency, actually. Her name's Athena Cykes, and she just passed the bar. Apollo: (That's right. I remember hearing about her coming to join us. Guess that was today.) Phoenix: She took off as soon as I told her you needed help with a case. It was like there was no stopping her. Apollo: Wait... Whaaaaaat! Where is she now? Phoenix: Probably somewhere in Nine-Tails Vale by now. That's where that favor I mentioned comes in. I need you to go find her. Apollo: But I've never even met her before. What does she look like? Phoenix: She'll be the girl in the yellow suit sporting an attorney's badge. Apollo: Okay, I'll find her. A new addition to the agency... (Well, I'd better get back to Nine-Tails Vale quick.) Wright Anything Agency Talk Any ideas? Apollo: Trucy, I'd like to hear your thoughts on what happened. Trucy: You do? Does that mean I can join the investigation? Apollo: I could sure use your help, but remember what Mr. Wright said? \"Trucy, you're in high school now, so you need to focus.\" Trucy: Right... I guess I better pull it together. It's time to forget everything else and just focus on my magic tricks! Apollo: Wait, no! He was talking about your schoolwork! What to do Trucy: Welcome to Trucy's Two Cents! Go ahead, ask me anything! Apollo: Oh, um, okay... Jinxie's always plastering charms on my forehead. What should I do? Trucy: That's an easy one, Apollo. Just do this... 3, 2, 1... Ta-dah! Apollo: Do what...? ......Ack! Trucy: See! She won't be able to stick any more on if there's already one there. Problem solved! Apollo: How's that a solution? Either way, I still have a charm plastered on my forehead! Present Attorney's Badge Apollo: Check it out. Trucy: You're so lucky, Apollo. Everyone can see what you do with just a flash of your badge. Apollo: What about you, Trucy? People can tell you're a magician by the way you're dressed. Trucy: Yeah, but I can't always dress like this. Like when I'm at school and stuff. Apollo: You could always show you're a magician by making things appear or disappear. Trucy: You mean like this? 3, 2, 1... Ta-dah! Apollo: Umm, magic or no, aren't you a little old to be showing those things in public? Trucy: Hmm... Then maybe I'll become a lawyer, too. Apollo: You're abandoning your dream just like that?! Tenma Taro Warding Charm Trucy: Jinxie's warding charms... Hm, what if I incorporated it into my act? Might be fun. Apollo: You mean like having charms come out of your magic panties? Trucy: Exactly! And then I'd have them fly off and stick to audience members' foreheads! Apollo: Somehow, I don't think that would go over so well. Trucy: Then how 'bout I have them stick on my assistant? That would be you, Polly! Apollo: How does that make it any better?! And I'm not your assistant! Trucy: What?! But I could've sworn you were. Apollo: Where in the world did you get that idea? Anything else Trucy: Okay! Watch me make that disappear! Apollo: No, wait! That's crucial evidence! Trucy: But I wanted to show you my new disappearing trick! Oh, I know! If it's really so important, how about I make more of it appear! Apollo: Fabricating evidence is even worse than making it disappear! Trucy: Oh, well. Too bad. April 17Nine-Tails Vale - Yokai Lane ???: I. Already. Told. You! I'm a lawyer assigned to the case! I need to study the crime scene, so if you would please tell me where Kyubi Manor is...! Policeman: You can't fool me! You're just some delinquent high school student playing hooky! ???: You stupid, pig-headed...! This attorney's badge isn't just for show, you know! Apollo: (Looks like I just found Ms. Athena Cykes.) Athena: Tsk! Why won't you believe me?! Don't expect me to defend you in court if you ever get arrested! Policeman: Well, I'm the one who usually does the arresting, so... Say, shouldn't you be getting back to school? Athena: I already told you, I'm a lawyer, not a student! Policeman: That's it! Enough of your lies! You're coming with me! Athena: Aaah! Get your hands off of me! Anime cutscene Apollo: .........Urnngh... Think you can watch out for the bystanders next time...? Athena: Whoops! Are you okay? Apollo: I think so. (But that police officer's out cold.) Athena: I am SO sorry! I do that when people suddenly grab me. It's like a reflex or something. Apollo: (Reflex? Sounds more like a felony!) You're Athena Cykes, I take it? Athena: That would be me. And you are? Apollo: I'm Apollo Justice. I work at the Wright Anything Agency. Athena: The Wright Anything Agency? What a fishy sounding name. Apollo: ...It's a long story, but it IS a law office, among other things. Didn't Mr. Wright explain it to you? Athena: Oh, right, THAT Wright! So then, you must be...! Where have you been?! I've been looking all over for you! Apollo: (I could say the same thing to you.) Well, here I am. Now how about telling me a little bit about yourself. Mr. Wright didn't really tell me much... as always. Athena: .........Ah, of course! Feel free to ask away! Talk Athena Cykes Apollo: So, Athena, I hear you just passed the bar. Athena: That's right! And here's my shiny new badge to prove it. Isn't it beautiful? Apollo: Oh, so you must be a bit younger than me. Athena: Heh heh heh. A bit more than you might think, in fact! I'm only eighteen! Apollo: E-Eighteen? How in the world did you become a lawyer at that age? Athena: I skipped a few grades while I was an exchange student in Europe. And I got my license to practice law while I was over there. Apollo: All I can say is, wow... (She must be a genius or something.) Athena: I also studied analytical psychology! Thought it might help me be a better lawyer. Apollo: (Psychology helps her be a better lawyer? How exactly does that work?) The client Athena: So, tell me about our client. What are they like? Apollo: Oh, right, you haven't met him yet. Well... Apollo: ...And that about sums it up. Athena: He's more worried about his daughter than himself. What a wonderful father. *sniffle* Apollo: Wait, are you crying? Athena: I'm not cr-crying! There was something in my eye! Apollo: (Um, they're called \"tears\"...) Athena: Moving right along... Let's get down to business! Helping our client is priority number one! Psychology (appears after \"Athena Cykes\") Apollo: So, Athena, you mentioned studying psychology. Athena: That's right! I've always wanted to bring analytical psychology into the courtroom. The power of psychology will bring a breath of fresh air to the legal system. Apollo: Oh, really? So how do you plan on using it to defend our client? Athena: ...Um, well, for example, I can try to listen in on a witness's inner voice... ...and then analyze their psychological state with the help of my trusty partner Widget! Apollo: Widget...? Athena: This device around my neck here! Say hi, Widget! Widget: Hi Widget! Apollo: IT TALKS?! Athena: Whoa, you need a volume knob! Anyway, the little guy will sometimes say what I'm feeling. Widget: Awk-ward... Athena: Don't worry, you'll get used to it. Apollo: Now THAT I seriously doubt. Present Attorney's Badge Athena: Yep! That's your attorney's badge, all right! Its dull, grimy look makes me think of all the courtroom battles you've faced so far! I hope mine will look like that someday! Look out legal world, Athena Cykes is psyched and ready to go! Apollo: ......... (Actually, I just haven't polished it lately... Maybe I should keep that to myself. No need to deflate her dreams about \"work\" just yet.) Yokai Legend Scroll Athena: What an interesting picture! It looks like a one-on-one monster smack down! It must've been quite a battle. Which yokai do you think is stronger? Apollo: Seems to me Tenma Taro's ability to fly would give him an edge over the Nine-Tailed Fox. Athena: But the Fox has powerful legs. He'd pounce before Tenma Taro knew what hit him! Apollo: He won't be pouncing on anyone after he's dropped from way up in the sky! Athena: Errr... B-But the Nine-Tailed Fox is gold-colored! Gold is way better than black, so I'm sure he'd win! Apollo: What do colors have to do with anything? (Besides, everyone knows red is the best.) Anything else Athena: *sigh* Sorry, Apollo. Nothing's coming to mind. But give me an hour and I'll have it analyzed Cykes style! I'll get started on it right now! Apollo: No need for that! I was just wondering. After clearing all Talk options: Athena: ...Oh, I almost forgot. I have something you might be interested in. I got in on my way here. Think it might have something to do with our case? Apollo: A special edition covering our case? That was quick. Athena: That's the whole point of special editions, isn't it? To be the first to get the scoop? ¡Rápido! (Changed from [That's the whole point of special editions, isn't it? To be the first to get the scoop? Rapido!] in the original release) Apollo: Right... Well, let's see what it says here... (What's the deal with the Spanish?) Tenma Taro was seen.... wha--? He was seen flying through the sky?! Athena: Yeah, somebody happened to snap that photo near Nine-Tails Vale. The article goes on to say it might be connected to our case. Apparently, that photo was shot right after the murder occurred. Apollo: Well, there were black feathers and strange tracks at the crime scene. I'm not surprised the locals think a yokai was involved. Athena: Wait a second... Yokai as in one of those Japanese monsters? Mein Gott! You don't actually think it was a supernatural murder, do you? Apollo: Ha ha ha, n-no, of course not. (Now German? Why not plain old English?) Special Edition Paper added to the Court Record. Athena: ¡Ándale, Apollo! Let's get cracking on that crime scene already! (Changed from [Andale, Apollo! Let's get cracking on that crime scene already!] in the original release) Talk The investigation Apollo: Okay, what's next on the list? Athena: Investigating the crime scene, what else?! Well, what are we waiting for?! Last one there is a rotten egg! Apollo: We don't have to run all the way there. Athena: Okay... Then how about speed walking?! Apollo: (Why does this have to be a competition at all?) Present Special Edition Paper Athena: Looks like this paper doesn't shy away from stories on strange creatures. Apollo: Really? What does it say? Athena: They claim to have produced photos of Gourdy and a Kappa water sprite thingie. And just the other day, they got one of Konaki Jiji crying his poor old eyes out... ...followed by that infamous shot of Tenma Taro. Apollo: I don't know about a Kappa, but I bet the Konaki Jiji... ...is just a shot of someone's grandpa lost and crying up in the mountains. Athena: That's not very nice! They should have helped him instead of publishing his picture! April 17Kyubi Manor - Foyer Athena: Do you hear that? It sounds like a TV or something. Oh, look! There's a TV in that little room in the corner. TV: In other news... The mysterious masked wrestler The Amazing Nine-Tails... ...has been confirmed missing according to sources close to the wrestler. It appears he disappeared sometime after the special event held in Nine-Tails Vale today. He also failed to appear at a match today where he was scheduled to defend his title. Local villagers say his disappearance may be connected with Tenma Taro's recent escape. Apollo: So, that wrestler's gone missing. ???: Hey, you two! You don't belong in here! Athena: Eek! Apollo: Don't worry, there's nothing suspicious-- ???: What about them there horns o' yours? They look mighty suspicious if ya ask me! Apollo: Horns?! That's my hair...! Anyway, we're lawyers, and we're here to-- ???: Ah! You're them lawyers come to defend Mayor Tenma, ain't ya?! Eh heh heh. Shoulda reckoned what with that expensive-looking bracelet ya got there. The name's Phineas Filch. Filch: I'm the caretaker here. Pleased to meetcha, eh heh heh. Apollo: Um, same here. Athena: Wow, talk about a quick change of heart. Filch: So, tell me, Demon Lawyer! Betcha use them demonic horns of yours to scare the bejeebers outta witnesses, huh? Come here, ya lil' horned demon, you! Apollo: Youch! These horns, er... I mean, my hair isn't meant to threaten anyone! Filch: They ain't? Seems a mighty big waste o' perfectly good horns if ya ask me. Then again, ain't none o' my business, so... Apollo: *sigh* (That was fast. Guess he's done with me.) Filch: Well, I'd best get back to work! Athena: Athena: Halt! Stop right there! Filch: Huh? Me? Athena: Apollo, your bracelet's gone! Apollo: Ah! Filch: Don't ya worry, Mr. Lawyer, sir! I'll check the lost 'n' found later! Apollo: .........Somehow, I don't think that will be necessary. Just check your wrist right now. Filch: Arrrrrrrrrgh! The cat's outta the bag! Apollo: (It was barely in the bag in the first place!) Athena: That was a pretty pathetic attempt. Filch: S-S-Sorry! I'm sooooo sooooo sorry! Just couldn't control myself! Please, forgive me! I'm beggin' ya! Apollo: (Sheesh, I almost feel sorry for him now.) Athena: What should we do about him, Apollo? Apollo: Well, I got my bracelet back, and he seems sorry enough, so... Filch: I knew ya'd understand, Mr. Lawyer, sir! Ya obviously got a big heart! As big as the wad o' cash in your wallet, I hope, eh heh heh! Apollo: You leave my wallet out of this. Filch: Ho HO! Athena: Hey! Didn't you just finish apologizing for stealing from us?! Filch: Run away, run away! Head for the hills! Athena: Get back here, you! Apollo: (Talk about a quick escape.) ...Hm? Looks like he dropped a few things. Looks like a pair of diagrams. This one's of the crime scene, and here's one of the foyer. Athena: He left his shoes behind, too. Apollo: The guy's the living definition of a bumbling thief. Athena: Let's hang on to his shoes. We can give them back next time we see him. As for the diagrams, I say we keep them! Apollo: They look like something the police might draw. Wonder where the caretaker got them? Crime Scene Diagram added to the Court Record. Foyer Diagram added to the Court Record. Apollo: Now then, as I recall... ...the Fox Chamber should be at the top of those stairs. April 17Kyubi Manor - Fox Chamber Athena: Whoa! Where'd all these black feathers and weird tracks come from?! Apollo: The popular opinion seems to be that they're from Tenma Taro. Athena: You mean the great evil has returned? Apollo: Even if he did, I'd be laughed out of the courthouse trying to indict him. ???: Hey, who are you and what are you doing here? This is a crime scene! Apollo: And who are YOU? Are you with the police? ???: I asked first! Who are YOU and what are you doing here?! On second thought... I'm placing you under arrest for disturbing a crime scene! Apollo: Ack! Under arrest?! B-B-But... ???: Save it for the boys back at HQ! Now, come quietly or else! I don't want to be late for lunch! Apollo: P-Please, wait! We're Mayor Tenma's lawyers! ???: Well why didn't you just say so! So you're the lawyers I heard about. Ha ha ha! I almost took you two in! You two sure were suspicious, though! Athena: I don't know how many more times I can take being called suspicious in one day... Apollo: Sorry, we didn't catch your name. Fulbright: My name? I'm Bobby Fulbright! The heroic detective who defends our good citizens from evil! The champion of justice who comes running whenever you're in need! And my catchphrase? It's \"In justice we trust!\" Apollo: Hoo boy... (This guy's a story and a half...) Fulbright: So! What can I do for you? Talk Investigating the scene Apollo: So, would it be okay if we had a look around? Fulbright: Certainly not! No unauthorized personnel allowed! Apollo: Couldn't you make an exception? Fulbright: Cease and desist at once, or you'll have to deal with my little friend here! Apollo: Ack! (Yikes! Is he reaching for his...?!) Fulbright: In justice we trust! Apollo: ...! (Phew, it's just his badge.) Fulbright: You may be Mayor Tenma's attorneys, but you still need authorization to cross a police line! Athena: Apollo, let's see if we can't change his mind! Apollo: Good luck! Let me know how it goes! (I bet he's as dense as heroes come...) Persuasion (appears after \"Investigating the scene\") Leads to: \"You're wasting your time and mine! Nobody's crossing this line without authorization!\" Present Anything Fulbright: Justice need backup sometimes, too! So I don't mind you asking for help, but you should start by thinking things over yourself. After all, the road to justice starts with your own first step! Ha ha ha! Apollo: If you don't have any information to offer, you could just say so. Fulbright: You're wasting your time and mine! Nobody's crossing this line without authorization! I'm a wall of justice keeping injustice -- that would be you -- at bay! Apollo: *sigh* I knew it. Look, there's just us and you here, right? Fulbright: Justice and me, you say? Apollo: Th-That's right...? Fulbright: Are you trying to say that justice and I aren't enough to keep you out?! Apollo: Um, what? Athena: ...! No, silly! We're saying that you're an inspiration in our quest for justice! Fulbright: No!!! It can't beeeee!!! Apollo: You have him on the ropes now, Athena! Athena: Um, if we were on the side of justice, would you let us through? Fulbright: B-B-But, guarding the crime scene is a part of justice, too! Athena: Sure... but only a bad guy would stand in the way of justice, right? Fulbright: Aaaaargh! Whose justice is the most just here? Apollo: Well, we can't have a fair and just trial without a thorough investigation, so... Fulbright: Hrmmm... Oh, Lady Justice...! What would you have me dooooo?! Athena: I think we really got to him. Apollo: Yeah, he seems pretty neurotic as far as champions of justice go. (Changed from [Yeah, he's [sic] seems pretty neurotic as far as champions of justice go.] in the original release) Athena: Our pleas for justice must've had a huge impact. It's tying him up in knots! Now's our chance to start looking around. Apollo: (After all that about authorized personnel only... this was surprisingly easy.) Fulbright: Hrmmm... Should I stop them or let them through? Whose justice is more just? Athena: Well, let's get to work! We're supposed to be finding clues related to the crime, right? (Changed from [We're supposed to being [sic] finding clues related to the crime, right?] in the original release) Apollo: Right. A search of the crime scene should turn up some evidence we can use at the trial. Let's try viewing the crime scene from different angles. Athena: You never know what's hiding just around the corner, right? So we move the cursor with [left analog stick / WASD]... (Changed from [Wait, but how do we go about changing our perspective?] in the original release) Apollo: And change our perspective with [right analog stick left/right / left/right arrow keys]. (Changed from [Touch the arrows on the bottom screen or press left or right on [D-Pad].] in the original release) If there's a particular spot you want to examine, just give it a tap. Athena: Okay, let's leave no stone unturned! Nous allons commencer! Let's get started! Examine Forbidden Chamber door Apollo: The Forbidden Chamber... They say the demon Tenma Taro was imprisoned in there before his \"escape.\" Athena: Think we could get this door open? Apollo: It's worth a try. Hrrrgh! ...No good. It's shut tight! I don't even see a key hole. Seems pretty hopeless. Fulbright: In justice we trust! Apollo: Yikes! Fulbright: Did I just hear the voice of someone in need?! Allow me to fill you in! This door simply will not open! We've tried and tried, but it won't budge! It's an essential part of the culture found in this manor, so we can't blow it up either! Apollo: (So, an unopenable door. Right.) Fulbright: According to Ms. Jinxie Tenma, it was shut tight when she came across the crime scene. Athena: Thanks for the tip, Detective Fulbright. We didn't expect you to be so helpful. Fulbright: Aaaaaaaaaaargh! Forget I just said that! Apollo: (So, the Forbidden Chamber was shut tight at the time of the murder. Sounds like something I'd better keep in mind.) Outline on table Apollo: So, this is where Alderman Kyubi's body was found. Athena: Apparently, the murder weapon -- a spear -- had Mayor Tenma's prints on it. Apollo: That's not good. Fulbright: Never fear, Detective Fulbright is here! Apollo: Yikes! Fulbright: Of course, I can't offer you any information on my investigation, so... In the name of justice, I must say goodbye! Apollo: Umm... What was that all about? Armchair on right Athena: Wow! This is a pricy-looking chair! Apollo: Apparently, the mayor was found drugged and unconcious in it. Athena: Really?! Apollo: Yeah, and when he came to, he was arrested for murder. Talk about your rude awakenings. Athena: So, he's the prime suspect in a crime he knows nothing about?! Widget: That stinks! Athena: Oh, poor Mr. Tenma. *sniffle* He must be feeling so scared and confused. Apollo, it's up to us to save him! Apollo: (It's like she's on her own emotional roller coaster.) Fox statues Athena: Look! This statue only has one tail. Apollo: Maybe it's the Nine-Tailed Fox's sidekick. I bet the number of tails represents a yokai's power. Athena: So... if you had two, Apollo, I'd only have one? Apollo: Wait. What? Athena: ...Not that it means you're better than me, got it?! Apollo: Like I said, what? Armchair on left Apollo: There's something wedged under this chair. Let's see if we can't lift it up and... Fulbright: Freeze! Apollo: Yikes! Fulbright: No disturbing crime scene evidence! Even if you ARE the mayor's lawyers. Apollo: (He does have a point there.) Athena: Hey Detective Fulbright, did you hear about the attack over on Yokai Lane? I hear an elderly woman was assaulted by a strange yokai shaped like a roll of cloth! Fulbright: And you waited till now to tell me?! I better get over there at once. In justice we trust! Athena: ...That was surprisingly easy. Okay, Apollo, now's our chance to look around some more. Apollo: (The more I get to know her, the scarier she gets. Hope she never finds MY weakness.) Cloth under armchair Apollo: Whatever this is, it's stuck on tight. Athena: Looks like a large bloodstained cloth. Apollo: The blood's probably the alderman's, but it's pretty far from his body. Wonder how it got here... (And why does this seem important?) Back of folding screen Apollo: (Nothing much to see on this side. Maybe I should go check the other side.) Weapons Athena: This one's a spear, but what about this one? It looks like a giant pair of pliers. Apollo: Looks like something a demon might use. Saw something like that in a manga once. Athena: Really? What are they used for? Apollo: Oh, things like pinching through cheeks... Athena: Eeeuuuw! Apollo: Pulling out tongues... Widget: Stop, stop! Apollo: Oh, and you should see what they can do to a person's eyes-- Athena: Okay, okay, I get the idea! But I'm sure THIS thing is just a simple can opener or something like that! Apollo: Demons eat canned food? I always wondered what they are besides people. Feathers and tracks Apollo: These weird tracks must've been made when someone stepped in the alderman's blood. Athena: Maybe the killer inadvertently made them when they were fleeing? They're pretty big tracks, almost bird-like. The feathers also point to a bird. Apollo: Then it must be one big bird! And not one of the friendly yellow type, either! Athena: Maybe it's some mutant bird creature! Apollo: So, your theory is a giant mutant bird murdered Alderman Kyubi with a spear? Athena: It's more plausible than saying a monster or yokai did it. Apollo: Sorry to burst your bubble, but a giant spear-wielding bird is by definition a monster! Front of folding screen Athena: It's a folding screen. I wonder what they were using it for. Apollo: I read that the Japanese used to use these in drafty rooms, but now they're just for show. Athena: You mean like... like my attorney's badge. *sniffle* Widget: Poor Athena... Apollo: (That cop treating her like a child must've really bothered her.) Clock above door Athena: Apollo, what words come to mind when you watch that pendulum in there? Apollo: Hmm... Unsteady and umm... restless. Athena: That's a direct representation of your current state of mind. Apollo: Wait! That was some kind of psychological test?! Athena: My diagnosis? This strange case has made you anxious, causing you to lose your cool. Apollo: You're actually not that far off the mark. Broken statue behind door Apollo: Hm? There's something behind the door. Whatever it is, it looks like it's broken. Probably broke when the door was opened. Why would anybody put something there? Athena: Yeah, that wasn't very smart. Apollo: Maybe it was Jinxie. She was the first one to discover the body. She must have heard the screams and come running in here in a panic. Athena: Well, look at you, Apollo! Now you're using analytical psychology, too! Apollo: I am? Athena: Wow, you really learn quick! But I guess I shouldn't be surprised. You're the ace attorney of Wright Anything Agency! Apollo: (I can't tell whether she's serious or not. Now, if Trucy said something like that, I'd immediately know she was messing with me.) Intact statue behind door Athena: Doesn't this tanuki statue remind you of the manor's caretaker, Phineas Filch? Apollo: This raccoon-looking thing? Yeah, it does look like him! Athena: Ooh, I just got the best idea! We should knock it over! It might transform back into Mr. Filch! Apollo: Mr. Filch is mischievous, but he's not magical, you know. Athena: Way to waste a brilliant idea, Apollo. Air vent Apollo: Huh, that looks like an air vent. It's pretty high up there. Athena: What if you got a running start and jumped? Apollo: I doubt even a high-jumper could make it. Athena: Argh! Don't rule it out before you try it! Besides, I'm an excellent jumper. Apollo: Even so, that must be about nine feet high. Athena: Like I said, you don't know until you try, Monsieur Justice! Apollo: (She doesn't know when to give up and when to stop using foreign words.) Trophies Athena: Look, trophies! Ooh! This one was awarded to Alderman Kyubi! \"The Amazing Nine-Tails, Yokai Div. Winner, Tenma Town Pro Wrestling Tournament.\" Apollo: Yokai Division? I didn't know you could have a division of one. Athena: Apollo, you should enter the tournament next time! And I have the perfect name for you! The Mysterious Firebrand! A mild-mannered masked lawyer by day... demonic masked wrestler by night! Apollo: No one's going to hire a masked lawyer, Athena. Window Apollo: Hey, this window opens. And outside... we have ourselves a steep cliff. Athena: The window only opens about six inches -- not wide enough for anyone to get in or out. Look, Apollo! There's something caught in the window frame! It looks like gold fur. What a pretty color! It must be from some kind of animal! Apollo: Wonder what it's doing here. Did Alderman Kyubi have a pet fox? Golden Fur added to the Court Record. Window (subsequent times) Apollo: What's this gold fur caught in the window frame here? Could it be from some rare gold-colored fox found only in Nine-Tails Vale? Athena: You think a fox squeezed out of this window? Apollo: Nothing's getting out that way. There's a steep cliff on the other side. Athena: Hmm... It's one mystery after another. Statue next to armchair Apollo: Hmm... What do we have here? Looks like a statue of the Nine-Tailed Fox and Tenma Taro battling it out. Athena: Eek! Careful, Apollo, it's got blood on it! Apollo: Really? ...Hey, you're right. Wonder if it's the alderman's blood? Athena: How can you remain so calm after seeing all this blood? Apollo: Well, this isn't the first time I've seen something like this, so... Athena: You're no fun at all! At least act surprised or grossed out or something for my first case! Apollo: I'm already a lawyer. You want me to be an actor, too? Fox and Demon Statue added to the Court Record. Statue next to armchair (subsequent times) Apollo: Hmm... What do we have here? Looks like a statue of the Nine-Tailed Fox and Tenma Taro battling it out. Athena: Eek! Careful, Apollo, it's got blood on it! Apollo: Really? ...Hey, you're right. Wonder if it's the alderman's blood? Athena: How can you remain so calm after seeing all this blood? Apollo: Well, this isn't the first time I've seen something like this, so... Athena: You're no fun at all! At least act surprised or grossed out or something for my first case! Apollo: I'm already a lawyer. You want me to be an actor, too? Yokai figurines left of the window Athena: Look! A cat with two tails! Apollo: No such thing. Athena: Oh, and this lady has a really long neck! Ha ha ha! How funny is that! Apollo: There's no way a creature like that could ever exist. She'd have a tough time swallowing. Athena: Apollo... I bet you were one of those kids who didn't believe in Santa Claus. Apollo: What's that got to do with anything? After examining Forbidden Chamber door, outline on table, cloth under armchair, window, and statue next to armchair: Apollo: (Guess that about wraps it up.) Now if only we could get that detective to tell us what he knows... Athena: Hey, Apollo... Do you hear something? Apollo: Hm? .........I don't hear anything. Athena: Oh, right. Your hearing must not be as sensitive as mine. Apollo: Um, what are you talking about? Athena: A whooshing sound, like wind rushing through a narrow strait. And the echo of someone's voice... \"In... In...\" Fulbright: IN JUSTICE WE TRUST! Athena: Aaaaaaaaah! Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Someone's got a sharp set of ears! That was the sound of my righteous voice reverberating through the air duct! Athena: I heard it through the air ducts? Fulbright: Yeah, check it out. Apollo: But why would she hear you through there? Fulbright: Why don't we go to the diagram? As you can see, that vent is connected to an air duct that leads out into the hallway! The wind must've rushed through there... ...and carried my monologue with it straight to your ears! Athena: And what a... unique monologue it was. I was just thinking... Maybe the killer made their escape through the air duct or something! Fulbright: Heh heh heh, a cute theory, but I don't think so. The air duct in the hallway is low enough to climb into, that much is true. But as you can see, the vent in the ceiling is very high. Nine feet high, in fact. (Changed from [9 feet high, in fact.] in the original release) I highly doubt that there's any way to get up there without a ladder or something. And I don't see anything of the sort in this room, do you? Athena: Hmm... I guess you're right. Apollo: Speaking of things in this room... Fulbright: Yeah? Apollo: Can you tell us what you guys turned up, Detective Fulbright? Fulbright: Not on my watch, buddy! In the name of justice, I cannot reveal facts pertaining to the prosecution's case! Apollo: Aw, come on, throw us a bone here. Athena: Excuse me, Detective Fulbright, but I recall you saying earlier... ...that you would come running whenever we were in need. Fulbright: Yurk! I suppose I did say that! Helping those in need is what justice is all about, but... But keeping information out of enemy hands is also a form of justice! Hmm... Aaaaargh! Which justice is the most just? Why is this always so hard! Athena: Hmm......... Well, how about this? Let's do a little give and take. I mean, serving the public is part of justice, too, right? You know, like the police motto? \"To serve and protect.\" Apollo: (I doubt leaking information to the defense team falls under that motto.) Fulbright: Yes, of course! I must serve as well as protect! (Changed from [Yes, of course! I must serve and [sic] well as protect!] in the original release) Okay, I will share some information. ...In the name of justice! Athena: We did it, Apollo! Apollo: Yeah, we did it, all right. (But I'm not sure that was entirely ethical...) Talk Details of the case Apollo: Was it Ms. Jinxie Tenma who first discovered the crime scene? Fulbright: That's right. And this photo shows what she saw when she opened the door. Ms. Tenma had a key, allowing her immediate access. Apollo: A key? So, then, the Fox Chamber was locked? Fulbright: Yes, and Ms. Tenma had the only key to its door. Apollo: Really? So, Alderman Kyubi didn't have a key to the Fox Chamber? Fulbright: Actually, he had a master key for most of the doors in the manor, but... It disappeared after his murder. Athena: Disappeared? You think the killer took it?! Fulbright: It could very well be connected to the murder. We're looking into the possibility now. But it's the timing of Ms. Tenma's discovery that I think is most important. Of course, I'm not going to share that information with you, ha ha ha! Athena: You think you're some kind of champion of justice, but you're just plain old mean! Fulbright: I won't fall for that, you shameless rascal! I only help good little boys and girls! Athena: Shameless rascal? Who even says that? Apollo: Well, I wouldn't exactly call you a good little girl, either. Crime Photo added to the Court Record. Details of the case (subsequent times) Apollo: Was it Ms. Jinxie Tenma who first discovered the crime scene? Fulbright: That's right. And this photo shows what she saw when she opened the door. Ms. Tenma had a key, allowing her immediate access. Apollo: A key? So, then, the Fox Chamber was locked? Fulbright: Yes, and Ms. Tenma had the only key to its door. Apollo: Really?

But it's the timing of Ms. Tenma's discovery that I think is most important. Of course, I'm not going to share that information with you, ha ha ha! Athena: You think you're some kind of champion of justice, but you're just plain old mean! Fulbright: I won't fall for that, you shameless rascal! I only help good little boys and girls! Athena: Shameless rascal? Who even says that? Apollo: Well, I wouldn't exactly call you a good little girl, either. Feathers and tracks Apollo: Those feathers and tracks look like something a yokai might leave behind. Fulbright: You don't actually think the murderer was some sort of monster, do you? Athena: What's the name of that creature in the Forbidden Chamber? Tenma... something... Because from the black feathers and big tracks, it looks like that creature did it. Fulbright: Our prime suspect would, no doubt, love to pin the blame on some imaginary creature. Athena: Can Tenma whatchamacallit even be made a victim of slander? Apollo: (I doubt the mayor would do something as childish as blaming a boogieman.) Athena: So, the most likely scenario so far is... ...that Tenma guy left the feathers and tracks behind... ...to make it look like yokai Tenma was the killer. Apollo: ...Wait, what? Now I'm as confused as you! (At any rate, I doubt Mayor Tenma would plant evidence like that.) Suspects Apollo: So, Mayor Tenma is your only suspect? Fulbright: That's right. Even his name, Damian Tenma, makes him sound like a villain. And he's really scary looking, too. Apollo: Wait, are you telling me that's why he was arrested? Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Don't be ridiculous! He was the only one without an alibi. Apollo: Oh, is that so? Fulbright: Yup. Other than the victim, the suspect, and Ms. Tenma, the only others around were... ...Mr. Filch and Mayor Tenma's aide, and the two of them were together at the time. Apollo: (Filch... The guy who tried to steal my bracelet. Just living up to his name, I guess. We should go talk to him again when we have a chance.) What about Jinxie? She's not being suspected at all? Fulbright: She may have no alibi whatsoever... but she also has no motive. It's unfathomable that she would murder the alderman, and pin the crime on her father. Besides, do you really think a little girl could lift up this huge spear? Apollo: True enough. That spear looks even bigger than her. Present Attorney's Badge Apollo: Um, so this is my attorney's badge. Fulbright: No, no! Present it with more confidence and conviction! Like this... In justice we trust! Apollo: Okay, um, how's this... Apollo Justice, attorney at law! H-Here comes Justice! Fulbright: That was amazing! But you know what they say, practice makes perfect. Let's see you do it ten more times! Apollo: Okay, I'll try my best! Athena: Um, Apollo? What are you doing? Apollo: (Ack! How'd he talk me into this?!) Anything else Fulbright: Justice need backup sometimes, too! So I don't mind you asking for help, but you should start by thinking things over yourself. After all, the road to justice starts with your own first step! Ha ha ha! Apollo: If you don't have any information to offer, you could just say so. After clearing all Talk options: Fulbright: That's about all I can reveal at this time. Well? You must admit, Damian Tenma appears to be the most likely suspect. Apollo: (I admit it looks bad, but I'm still not buying it.) Fulbright: Oh, and one more thing... I must warn you about the prosecutor. Apollo: The prosecutor assigned to Mayor Tenma's trial? Fulbright: That's the one. He's -- how shall I put it -- not what you'd expect. That is unless you've faced a convicted killer serving hard time as a prosecutor before. Apollo: What the--?! Is this some kind of joke? Talk The prosecution Leads to: \"Can I ask why a man imprisoned for murder is serving as prosecutor?\" Apollo: Can I ask why a man imprisoned for murder is serving as prosecutor? Fulbright: Because he's mastered the use of psychology in courtroom battles. Everyone's talking about how this murder was the work of some strange creature. But yokai are nothing more than a figment of the imagination. They're baloney! Who better to prove that than a master of psychology? He's the best man for the job. Apollo: But he's a convicted murderer! No matter how you look at it, that's just insane! Fulbright: Well, the chief prosecutor personally assigned him, so... ...none of us are in a position to question the matter, ha ha ha! Apollo: (This really is the dark age of the law.) Athena: This prosecutor... He wouldn't happen to go by the name \"Blackquill,\" would he? Fulbright: Bingo! Simon Blackquill. So, you HAVE heard of him? Athena: ...You could say that. Apollo: (What's that supposed to mean?) Fulbright: Well, I bet you don't know his unofficial title. Ever heard of the \"Twisted Samurai\"? That's Prosecutor Blackquill! Apollo: The \"Twisted Samurai\"...? Is that because he's a criminal? Fulbright: Well... Yes and no. You could say it also has to do with the effect his crime had on things. Apollo: How so...? Fulbright: His conviction is what twisted and warped the legal world into this dark age of the law. Apollo: What?! And HE of all people is going to stand in court tomorrow?! Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Never fear! I myself will be there to protect you! Apollo: ......... (That's reassuring, I guess...) Fulbright: Well, you kids knock yourselves out! Can't wait to see how you do tomorrow! Athena: Wait, Detective Fulbright. I've been meaning to ask you something. Um... Why are you barefoot? This doesn't look like the sort of place where you need to take your shoes off... Fulbright: Hm? Ah! Ahhhhhh! I hadn't even noticed. Why AM I barefoot? Apollo: (You honestly hadn't noticed until just now?!) .........Wait a second. Those shoes we found earlier... Excuse me, Detective Fulbright. These wouldn't happen to be your shoes, would they? Fulbright: Yes! Yes they are! My favorite pair, in fact! Thank you for bringing them to me. You must truly be on the side of justice! Apollo: (Don't tell me Mr. Filch actually stole from a detective?) Athena: Stealing shoes right off of someone's feet... That's pretty amazing. Apollo: I find it more amazing that Detective Fulbright didn't notice. (Well, looks like we've gotten all we can out of the detective, so let's see... Maybe we should go have a word with Mr. Filch. I want to hear what his \"alibi\" is.) April 17Kyubi Manor - Foyer Filch: This is just awful! T-Terrible, I say! S-Somebody, help! Athena: Oh, look, it's mister-- what was it again? Finch? Filch: No, no, no! The name's Filch, Phineas Filch! Apollo: (Keep on pilfering and you may wind up a jail bird instead.) So what seems to be the problem, Mr. Filch? Filch: Oh, it's just terrible! Terrible, I tell ya! Come quick! Apollo: O-Okay...? (What's the deal with him all of a sudden?) Apollo: Looks like some kind of mask. Filch: I-It's The Amazing Nine-Tails's mask! Apollo: The Amazing Nine-Tails...? (Oh, right -- the wrestler who appeared during the festival's special event...) What's his mask doing here? Filch: He'd never take off his mask like this! Someone musta killed 'im! Apollo: Whaaa--?! Wh-Who would do such a thing? Athena: Let's go talk over there in private. Apollo: Hm? Look... There's some white hair caught up inside this mask... Amazing Nine-Tails Mask added to the Court Record. Apollo: So, what makes you believe that The Amazing Nine-Tails has been murdered? Filch: Ya really wanna know, eh? You're a studious one, ain't ya! Eh heh he! Apollo: Yes, I mean, no. Er, I mean, just tell me, please. Filch: Well, it's like this. I'd dreamed o' becoming a wrassler myself! Hey, how 'bout ya join me in the quest for the champion's belt?! Whadda team! Me in my bandit's mask and you in that demon mask of yours! Apollo: Demon mask? Heh heh. Wonder if I could make it big. Athena: Apollo, let's save your pro wrestling debut until after the trial. Apollo: Huh?! Oh, no no! I wasn't actually... (Argh! Why did I let him pull me off topic like that?!) Athena: Come on, Apollo -- ask him about The Amazing Nine-Tails's murder already! Talk The Amazing Nine-Tails Filch: The Amazing Nine-Tails is our village's savior, and don't ya forget it! His trademark's a gold cape made to look like nine fox tails! He whirls through the ring, smacking down Tenma Town wrestlers left 'n' right! He sparked the monster craze, revitalizing Nine-Tales [sic] Vale in the blink of an eye. Yep, saved our village from becoming a ghost town. Now it's a yokai town, eh heh heh. Apollo: Huh, The Amazing Nine-Tails really does sound, well... amazing. Filch: Yeah, pretty amazing, huh? That's why he's worshipped like a hero 'round here! I'm proud to be from the same village as him. Athena: Come to think of it, you look kind of monster-like yourself, Mr. Filch. Guess it makes sense since you're from the same village as The Amazing Nine-Tails! Filch: Eh heh heh... I know! A lot o' people have told me I look like a yokai. Apollo: (Since when was that a compliment?) Ouch! What's the big idea! Filch: Eh heh heh... Check your pocket. Apollo: Hey, how'd you do that?! Filch: Keep it. I got lots more. Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy added to the Court Record. Apollo: So, you keep saying that the Amazing Nine-Tails was killed. What's the story behind that? The Amazing Nine-Tails (subsequent times) Filch: The Amazing Nine-Tails is our village's savior, and don't ya forget it! His trademark's a gold cape made to look like nine fox tails! He whirls through the ring, smacking down Tenma Town wrestlers left 'n' right! He sparked the monster craze, revitalizing Nine-Tales [sic] Vale in the blink of an eye. Yep, saved our village from becoming a ghost town. Now it's a yokai town, eh heh heh. Apollo: Huh, The Amazing Nine-Tails really does sound, well... amazing. Filch: Yeah, pretty amazing, huh? That's why he's worshipped like a hero 'round here! I'm proud to be from the same village as him. Athena: Come to think of it, you look kind of monster-like yourself, Mr. Filch. Guess it makes sense since you're from the same village as The Amazing Nine-Tails! Filch: Eh heh heh... I know! A lot o' people have told me I look like a yokai. Apollo: (Since when was that a compliment?) Amazing Nine-Tails's Death (appears after \"The Amazing Nine-Tails\") Apollo: Are you saying he was murdered because his mask washed up along the river outside? Filch: That's only part o' it. The main reason is no one's seen 'im since the special event. The word 'round Nine-Tails Vale is he was killed by Tenma Taro. Apollo: You villagers really are superstitious, aren't you? Filch: That we are. We love conspiracy theories, too, like the mayor's diabolical plot. Apollo: The mayor? Of Tenma Town? What is he plotting? Filch: Rumor has it he's planning on releasing Tenma Taro. That's why he wants the merger. He'll open the Forbidden Chamber once he's in control. Apollo: That's quite a tale. Filch: Ain't finished yet! There was only one person who could stop the mayor. Our hero, The Amazing Nine-Tails! He vowed to battle the mayor of Tenma Town and stop the municipal merger! Apollo: ......... (I couldn't make this stuff up if I tried.) Athena: Apollo! We still have to ask him about the alderman's murder, remember? About the alderman's murder (appears after \"Amazing Nine-Tails's Death\") Apollo: Mr. Filch, would you mind telling us what you were doing at the time of the murder? Filch: I was in the caretaker's office guarding the entrance like Mr. Kyubi said I should. And I made double sure no one came in. I have a clear view of the foyer from where I work. Apollo: (He must be talking about this small room in the upper right. It definitely looks like you can keep track of the comings and goings from there.) And you have an alibi to back your statement up, Mr. Filch? Filch: Eh heh heh. I do, indeed! I was with Mayor Tenma's aide. Florent L'Belle's his name. Apollo: So, the two of you were together... That's a pretty sound alibi, all right. And nobody came in or out of the manor around the time of the murder? Filch: Kept watch here the whole time. Didn't see a soul pass by. And if anyone did, that there security camera woulda spotted 'em. Apollo: (So no one came in or out around the time of the murder... That means we're dealing with someone who was already inside when it happened.) So, do you think this mask is the real deal? Filch: Without a doubt. This here's the mask worn by The Amazing Nine-Tails. Apollo: What about that white hair I found inside the mask? Athena: Wait! I just thought of something! Remember the golden animal fur we found at the crime scene? Could it have come from this mask? Look! There's even a spot where some fur is missing. Apollo: Hmm... Then this places this mask at the crime scene at some point in time. Which means......... (What does this mean? Someone with white hair who is linked with the murder and is against the merger? No way...! Could The Amazing Nine-Tails and the alderman actually be...?!) Athena: Something wrong, Apollo? You should see the look on your face! Apollo: Oh, no, it's n-nothing. (Maybe Jinxie could tell us something, since she works here...) Golden Fur reattached to The Amazing Nine-Tails's mask. About the alderman's murder (subsequent times) Apollo: Mr. Filch, would you mind telling us what you were doing at the time of the murder? Filch: I was in the caretaker's office guarding the entrance like Mr. Kyubi said I should. And I made double sure no one came in. I have a clear view of the foyer from where I work. Apollo: (He must be talking about this small room in the upper right. It definitely looks like you can keep track of the comings and goings from there.) And you have an alibi to back your statement up, Mr. Filch? Filch: Eh heh heh. I do, indeed! I was with Mayor Tenma's aide. Florent L'Belle's his name. Apollo: So, the two of you were together... That's a pretty sound alibi, all right. And nobody came in or out of the manor around the time of the murder? Filch: Kept watch here the whole time. Didn't see a soul pass by. And if anyone did, that there security camera woulda spotted 'em. Apollo: (So no one came in or out around the time of the murder... That means we're dealing with someone who was already inside when it happened.) Present Amazing Nine-Tails's Mask Filch: Hey, that there's The Amazing Nine-Tails's mask! Yer aiming to sell it, aint ya?! Why you sneaky, lily-livered-- Apollo: No, I'm not trying to sell it. It could be a key piece of evidence. Filch: Aw, too bad. Thought I'd hook ya up with this buyer I know. Apollo: Wait, you WANT me to sell it?! Anything else Apollo: You mind if I ask you about this? Filch: Hm? Oh, that... Right, right... Apollo: Well, does it ring a bell? Filch: Eh heh heh heh... Oh, it's ringing, all right. Ya wanna thank me for all my hard work, and I humbly accept! Apollo: No, this isn't a gift! (Should've known this was a dead end.) Kyubi Manor Garden or Detention Center Talk Any ideas? Apollo: Come up with anything yet? Athena: Oh! O-Of course I have! But it's not quite ready for primetime. Apollo: Huh? Athena: The truth will only be revealed once we've dotted all our i's and crossed all our t's. In other words, it's still just a theory, so I don't think I should say anything yet. It's the dilemma any great detective must face! Widget: Whatever! Athena: Tsk! Widget! Apollo: (So basically, you have no ideas. Thanks for nothing.) About the murder Apollo: What are your thoughts on the case so far? Athena: Well... I think our killer is most likely highly intelligent and stone-cold cool. I mean, just look how they killed the alderman: one decisive thrust, no hesitation. Apollo: And you know this how? Psychology? Athena: That's right! I've profiled the killer based on the evidence we found at the scene! I can almost picture the killer in my mind... A terrifying face twisted from hatred toward the victim... Big, bulging eyes full of murderous intent... A horrible gash-like mouth from ear to ear... And... wings, black and sinister. Apollo: Wings? That sounds like Tenma Taro! Athena: On second thought, scratch psychology. That last part was just my imagination. Apollo: You think?! Present Amazing Nine-Tails's Mask Athena: So who do you think is the man behind The Amazing Nine-Tails mask? Apollo: Well, there was that white hair we found inside the mask. I have a feeling it's going to be a valuable clue. Athena: We should run a DNA test on it. Ooh! And what if the results show that the hair's not human? Don't you think it's fun to fantasize about stuff like that? Apollo: Sure, as long as you're prepared to have that fantasy shattered by the results, too. Athena: In that case, let's forget about the DNA testing! After clearing \"About the alderman's murder\" Talk option in Kyubi Manor - Foyer: April 17Nine-Tails Vale - Yokai Lane Apollo: Oh, look, there's Jinxie. Jinxie: Milk, cheese, yogurt, ice cream, and... Apollo: (Sounds like she's out grocery shopping. She must really like dairy products.) Jinxie: ...a charm to make a better milkshake and another to cure my lactose intolerance. Apollo: (Maybe she should just stick to soy milk.) Jinxie! Hey, it's me! Jinxie: Eek! It's th-th-the demon lawyer! Apollo: Ack! (Not another warding charm... *sigh*) Athena: Um, Apollo? Who is she? Apollo: Oh, right. This is your first time meeting each other. This is Jinxie, Mayor Tenma's daughter. She was the first to discover the crime scene. Athena: Oh, so she's the one who--! Um, hello. My name's Athena Cykes. I'll be helping Apollo defend your father at his trial. Pleased to meet you! Jinxie: P-Pleased to meet you, too. Uhh... Um, where's Trucy? Apollo: She went back to the office ahead of us. But don't worry. Athena and I are on the case! Jinxie: W-W-Wait, how do I know you didn't...! ...That you d-d-didn't gobble her up alive! Apollo: Relax, I didn't eat her up! And I wouldn't do such a thing in the first place! Jinxie: Oh, poor little Trucy! *sniffle* Apollo: (I'm about ready for some tears of frustration myself.) Athena: She's quite an, um, interesting character, huh, Apollo... Talk The incident Apollo: Jinxie, do you remember any more of what happened? Jinxie: Not much. ...At least not yet. Apollo: But you do think Tenma Taro was the killer, right? That yokai we saw at the festival? Jinxie: I don't know anything about that! Apollo: Huh? But you said Tenma Taro murdered the alderman. ...It's okay, Jinxie. You can tell me-- Yikes! What was that for?! Jinxie: People see things when they don't get enough sleep. There's no such thing as monsters. Apollo: Huh?! (What's gotten into her?) So, if there are no monsters, you admit I'm human? Jinxie: No, you're still a demon! Apollo: ............ Oh, I give up. Athena: It seems like Jinxie doesn't want to talk about Tenma Taro for some reason. Apollo: But that's precisely what we need to know more about... Besides, she definitely thought there was a yokai there in the Fox Chamber. Jinxie, about this charm... Jinxie: Ah! That's...! Apollo: You gave me this when I was heading off to the scene of the crime. You thought Tenma Taro was the murderer. That's why you gave this to me, right? Jinxie: Errr... That's true, but... Apollo: If there's anything else you could tell us, it would really help. And it will help your father, too! Jinxie: Umm... All right, then. Tenma Taro did it? (appears after \"The incident\") Apollo: Why do you think Tenma Taro's the killer? Jinxie: I saw him. Saw him with my own eyes. Tenma Taro was right there in the manor! He escaped his prison... ...and ran right by me! Athena: Whaaaaaat?! Apollo: Jinxie, tell us everything you saw! Jinxie: I called the police after I stumbled on the scene. I was just about to head back to the festival grounds when... ...I saw Tenma Taro. It was right around here. He was running right at me! I was... I was paralyzed with fear. But there was no one around to help me. *shiver* The foul beast raced right by me toward the foyer. Apollo: Toward the foyer? Athena: Mr. Filch and Mr. L'Belle were supposedly in the foyer at the time. That means they would've seen Tenma Taro, too. Apollo: Sounds like we'd better get their statements. (Considering Jinxie's mental state, her eyes could've been playing tricks on her.) Athena: Um... Apollo? Remember the picture in this paper? Someone caught Tenma Taro flying through the air. I wonder if it's the same Tenma Taro Jinxie says she saw. Apollo: ...Don't be ridiculous! Jinxie: *shiver* Tenma Taro IS the killer. And he can fly, too. The Amazing Nine-Tails Apollo: (Jinxie works at the alderman's manor, so maybe she can shed some light on this.) So, no one knows The Amazing Nine-Tails's true identity? Jinxie: Uh-huh. They say no one's ever seen him without his mask. Apollo: Doesn't that make you want to know even more? Jinxie: Uh-huh. That's why matches where wrestlers try to expose their opponent are so popular. Apollo: Wait... you mean expose, as in strip them naked? Jinxie: Eek! You even think like a demon! ...The only thing the winner removes is the loser's mask. To have your mask torn off is the worst humiliation a wrestler could suffer! That's why their masks are more important to them than life itself. So you see, these unmasking matches are life and death battles for the wrestlers. Apollo: (That means this mask didn't just happen to wash up along the riverbank. There's got to be a story behind it.) Jinxie: No one can stop The Amazing Nine-Tails! Apollo: (Bet she'd be shocked to find out he's really the alderman.) The Tenma Taro you saw (appears after \"Tenma Taro did it?\") Apollo: About the yokai you saw at the scene of the crime... Anything else stand out? Jinxie: Actually, I heard this strange jangly sound. Athena: A jangly sound? Can you be a little more specific? Jinxie: My memory's kind of fuzzy... But I vaguely recall seeing Tenma Taro holding a staff or something like that. Maybe that's what was making the strange sound. Apollo: Does Tenma Taro usually carry a staff? Jinxie: Good question. I've never heard anything like that and it's not shown on the scroll. Apollo: How about in other documents? Any of them show Tenma Taro with a staff? Jinxie: This is the only known document depicting Tenma Taro. After all, those who needlessly depict the demon are forever cursed. (Changed from [After all, those who needless [sic] depict the demon are forever cursed.] in the original release) Apollo: Then what's the deal with the Tenma Taro you saw, Jinxie? Yokai Legend Scroll updated in the Court Record. Jinxie's Statement added to the Court Record. The Tenma Taro you saw (subsequent times) Apollo: About the yokai you saw at the scene of the crime... Anything else stand out? Jinxie: Actually, I heard this strange jangly sound. Athena: A jangly sound? Can you be a little more specific? Jinxie: My memory's kind of fuzzy... But I vaguely recall seeing Tenma Taro holding a staff or something like that. Maybe that's what was making the strange sound. Apollo: Does Tenma Taro usually carry a staff? Jinxie: Good question. I've never heard anything like that and it's not shown on the scroll. Apollo: How about in other documents? Any of them show Tenma Taro with a staff? Jinxie: This is the only known document depicting Tenma Taro. After all, those who needlessly depict the demon are forever cursed. (Changed from [After all, those who needless [sic] depict the demon are forever cursed.] in the original release) Apollo: Then what's the deal with the Tenma Taro you saw, Jinxie? Present Nine-Tails Flower Jinxie: The Nine-Tailed Fox is famous for imprisoning Tenma Taro, but legends say that he also... ...gave us the Nine-Tails Flower, and that he still watches over the village to this day. Apollo: Wow, coming here is like traveling to ancient Japan with all the strange beliefs and all. All those yokai, the Nine-Tails Flower, the Forbidden Chamber, and the list goes on. Jinxie: Uh-huh. It was like I should've been born here. Too bad the population is shrinking. But there's an effort underway to protect the yokai. It also helps the local economy. Apollo: Protect the yokai? You mean like endangered species? Jinxie: Uh-huh. There're even plans to create a yokai wildlife park in the near future. Apollo: Now I'm really starting to wonder about this place. Crime Photo Apollo: Jinxie, I wanted to show you this-- Athena: Wait, Apollo! You can't show that to her. Having her father arrested was bad enough. Jinxie: Huh? Did you say something? Apollo: (Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.) Oh, um, never mind. Amazing Nine-Tails's Mask Apollo: (Wait, Jinxie's a huge fan of The Amazing Nine-Tails. She'd probably freak out if I showed her this mask without the guy in it.) Athena: What are you thinking?! It would crush her if she figured out her favorite wrestler is dead. Apollo: Guess I'll spare her the grief, although she really could use a reality check. Jinxie: ? Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy Jinxie: Ah! Th-Th-That's The Amazing Nine-Tails! He... he lives in the mountains right outside the village. But he often comes to visit. Apollo: Really? He doesn't sound very secret or reclusive to me. Jinxie: No, he's not. In fact, he visits the village bathhouse all the time. Athena: No way! The Amazing Nine-Tails goes to public bathhouses?! Jinxie: Uh-huh. But like a true wrestling legend, he never takes his mask off. Apollo: He takes baths in his mask? Jinxie: Uh-huh. And he also has a towel that says, \"Wrestlers Wanted!\" Apollo: If I saw a naked guy in a mask and a message like that on his towel, I'd run the other way. Jinxie's Statement Jinxie: I saw... him... Tenma Taro. It nearly scared me to death. Athena: Do you see a lot of monsters, Jinxie? Jinxie: Uh-huh. *shivers* In fact, I encountered the Sunekosuri this morning. *shivers* Apollo: Sune... kosuri? You know, I don't know that one. Tell me about it. Jinxie: It's a mean little beast that trips you by bumping into your shins. I keep tripping all the time because of that pesky little thing! When it gets really bad, I stick Sunekosuri warding charms on my shins! Apollo: Um, how about investing in some shin guards, and watching your step instead? Anything else Jinxie: What's this? A Tsukumogami? Apollo: Tsukumo... gami? Jinxie: A yokai that inhabits objects that have been used for a really long time. The Red Demon and a Tsukumogami... What a strange combination. Apollo: (Is everything to her some supernatural phenomenon?) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: Why didn't you tell me you saw Tenma Taro earlier? Jinxie: Actually... Mr. L'Belle told me not to tell. Apollo: Mr. L'Belle? Jinxie: Papa's aide. Apollo: (Oh, right. The other guy who was supposedly in the foyer at the time of the crime.) And what exactly did he tell you? Jinxie: \"Keep the village superstitions in mind... ...before you go talking about seeing Tenma Taro at the time of the crime.\" Apollo: Village superstitions? Jinxie: They say you must not gaze upon Tenma Taro. But in the event that you do look... ...and then tell anyone what you saw, Tenma Taro will claim your soul. Apollo: And that's something everyone here knows? (Sounds like a bunch of baloney to me.) Jinxie: Uh-huh. Everyone from babies to the village elders know about it. But I didn't because I'm not from around here. Apollo: Hey, come to think of it... Apollo: (Huh? Why's everyone hiding their faces?) Villager: Hey, you there! You mustn't stare at Tenma Taro like that! Lower your eyes! He'll steal your soul if you're not careful! Apollo: Huh? (Steal my soul? Seriously?) Apollo: (The guy at the special event thing said almost the exact same thing.) Athena: Apollo, do you think this L'Belle guy actually believes in Tenma Taro? Apollo: I seriously doubt it. He's not even from Nine-Tails Vale. Athena: Then why would he try to keep Jinxie from talking? Apollo: Good question. I think we'd better go have a word with him. Athena: Time to unmask this monster of a mystery. Jinxie: The last time I saw Mr. L'Belle, he was relaxing in the foyer. Athena: Bueno! Next stop, the manor foyer! With any luck, he'll be there waiting for us! April 17Kyubi Manor - Foyer Athena: There's no one here. Guess our luck isn't so good when it comes to Mr. L'Belle. Apollo: Maybe he's out for a walk or something. (Hmm? Somebody left something on the sill of the caretaker's office window.) Oh, it's a TV program guide. Athena: Looks like someone circled a pro wrestling match. Filch: Hey, whaddya think you're doing! Athena: Eek! I-I-It's a...! Oh, Mr. Filch! Wh-What can we do for you? Apollo: (I bet she was going to scream, \"Monster!\" which really isn't much of a stretch...) Filch: Ain't nothing I need you to do for me. But what business do ya got with my TV listings? Apollo: Oh, no, it just caught my eye. Can I ask if you watched this pro wrestling program today? Filch: Yep, 'twas a match between a couple o' rank amateurs, though. It was a complete disaster. I reckon even I coulda done better than that. Apollo: (I seriously doubt that.) TV Listings added to the Court Record. Apollo: (Almost forgot. There's something I wanted to ask him.) Mr. Filch, did you see anything unusual around the time of the murder? For example, Tenma Taro or something like that? Filch: Huh?! T-Tenma Taro?! Apollo: So you did see him? Filch: Errr... My, how clean and shiny your forehead is again today, Mr. Lawyer, sir! Bet ya shine it up every day real purty like. The ladies must love it, eh heh heh. Apollo: Don't change the subject! And FYI, that was a seriously bad attempt at flattery. Jinxie said she saw Tenma Taro flee toward the foyer. So you must've seen him too if you were here! Filch: Yi-Yi-Yiiiiiiiiipes! Apollo: (Wow, I really pushed a button there!) Well, did you see anything or not? ???: ???: That is quite enough. I must ask that you not pester my friend anymore. Filch: Yipes! Forgive me for being pestered, sir! Apollo: And you are? ???: I am Florent L'Belle... L'Belle: ...beau divine and PERSONAL aide to Mayor Damian Tenma. Apollo: (Beau divine? More like yokai grotesque. This place is crawling with monsters.) L'Belle: OH! Excuse YOU! Apollo: Ack! Wh-What the heck was that for?! L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! It was just a little cologne. You had a look of stinky sweat about you. It's from my OWN original brand of cosmetics called \"Je suis L'Belle!\" *sniff sniff sniff* Oh, what a heavenly scent. Apollo: Ugh. I think you just paralyzed my olfactory receptors. L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! I suppose such a scent WOULD be difficult for a peasant to appreciate. I'll have you know, THAT is Brand No. 5 \"Bonjour.\" It's MY way of introducing myself. Enjoy! Apollo: (Where's my bottle of \"Adieu\" so I can return the favor?) Enough about the cologne. Please tell us what you saw around the time of the murder. Talk Keeping Jinxie quiet Apollo: I heard you're the one who told Jinxie not to mention that she saw Tenma Taro. L'Belle: Why that little--! So, she told you she saw the demon, did she? Athena: Mr. L'Belle, do you mind if I ask whether you believe in the village superstitions? (Changed from [Mr. L'Belle, do mind [sic] if I ask whether you believe in the village superstitions?] in the original release) L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Oh, PU-LEASE! I was merely trying to keep with traditions. Nevertheless, I will say this... I wouldn't stick MY nose into this whole Tenma Taro business if I were you. Bad things happen to those who do. THAT much is true. He is one... scary... monster. Apollo: That's crazy! You really expect me to believe that monsters are real? L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Well, YOU'RE real, and YOU sure look like a monster. Apollo: (Look who's talking!) So, Mr. L'Belle, you didn't see Tenma Taro? Aaah! L'Belle: Little Jinxie has an ACTIVE imagination. Isn't that right, Phineas? Filch: That's right. I didn't see nothing, especially not Tenma Taro! L'Belle: As for ME, I only see things of beauty. That's why I can barely see you. ...Pwh! Ah ha ha ha! Apollo: (I've got two words for this guy: total freak.) Your alibi Apollo: Could I ask you what you were doing at the time of the crime? L'Belle: In other words, you'd like to hear MY alibi. Tsk, to think you'd suspect ME of all people! Apollo: Oh, no, it's just a formality. We ask everyone the same questions. Aaah! L'Belle: How DARE you doubt me! That's an affront to beauty itself! You OBVIOUSLY can't see straight! Apollo: Urnngh... Like that spritz really helped...! L'Belle: What were WE doing, you ask? Go ahead, Filchy, answer the question. Filch: Errr... At the time of the crime, we were... um... uh... in this here foyer! L'Belle: Exactly! Good answer, Filchy, good answer! Filch: Eh heh he. Just repeating whatcha told-- Youch! L'Belle: You've said QUITE enough! Apollo: (.........What is WITH these two? Great, now he's got me talking like that.) Present Tenma Taro Warding Charm L'Belle: Yes? That's a warding charm, but why are YOU showing it to ME? Apollo: ............ (Guess it doesn't work on all monsters.) Yurk! L'Belle: Shame on you, thinking THAT would work on ME! Apollo: Blech! L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! You should be honored to be bathed in my beautiful scent, peasant! Apollo: Ack... (Now I really wish it would work.) Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy L'Belle: Pffft, The Amazing Nine-Tails? What's so AMAZING about HIM? I mean, MY glossies are selling WAY better than his. Apollo: You sell glossies of yourself? L'Belle: That's right. I have one for all seven of my hair colors! Apollo: ............ (Well, guess that's it. Civilization over.) L'Belle: Tsk, if you WANT one, you need simply ask. I'll even let you choose the color yourself. Apollo: No, thank you! Anything else L'Belle: Yes? Do you ALWAYS go around sticking your hand in OTHER people's faces? Apollo: Oh, no, I just wanted to show you this. L'Belle: Ah, yes, you DO have something in that grimy paw of yours. But I only have eyes for things of beauty. Now, if you would excuse me. Apollo: (Guess he'll only look at stuff that interests him.) After clearing all Talk options: L'Belle: Are we quite through here? I'm a VERY busy man, you know. Apollo: ...Right. Well, thanks for your help. (So, these two were in the foyer, but didn't see Tenma Taro.) L'Belle: Come along, Filchy. Filch: Where we goin'? Oh, right! Gotta practice them statements for tomorrow! ...Yipes! My eyyyes! L'Belle: You're going to dig your own grave with that big mouth of yours someday! Apollo: ......... (What does he mean, \"practice statements\"?) L'Belle: Now if you would excuse me, it's time to touch up my makeup. (Changed from [Now if would [sic] excuse me. It's time to touch up my makeup.] in the original release) Athena: Apollo, I know this sounds strange... ...but Mr. L'Belle seems unusually preoccupied with Tenma Taro. Apollo: Really? How can you tell? Athena: Well, it's kind of hard to explain. You see, I can read people's emotions from the tone of their voice. Apollo: You mean you have good ears? Athena: Something like that. People's emotions are expressed in the tone of their voice. And my ears can pick up even the subtlest of tones for some reason. Apollo: That's an interesting skill... But what do you mean he's preoccupied with Tenma Taro? Athena: I'm not exactly sure, but it was like he was... obsessed with the thought of Tenma Taro... That's what I picked up from his voice, anyway. Apollo: Everywhere we turn it's Tenma Taro this, Tenma Taro that. Hmm... Athena: We should go talk to the mayor, too. Apollo: Sounds like a plan. (We need to get to the bottom of that rumor about him wanting to release Tenma Taro.) April 17Detention Center - Visitor's Room Athena: Something wrong, Apollo? Where did your enthusiasm go? Apollo: (What am I doing asking the mayor if he has ever thought about releasing Tenma Taro?! At best, he'll think I'm an idiot. At worst... *shudder*) Athena: Oh, he's here! Tenma: ......... Athena: It's so nice to finally meet you! I'm Mr. Justice's partner, Athena Cykes! I'm looking forward to working with you, Mr. Tenma... Taro! Tenma: Hm?! ...Oh, yes. I look forward to working with you, too. Apollo: (Eek! Glad he didn't mind Athena calling him by a completely wrong name!) Athena: Apollo, he's just as kind and gentle-looking as I'd imagined! Apollo: (Lucky for you, after that blunder you just made...) Um, there was something I wanted to talk to you about. There are rumors going around about how you want to or did set Tenma Taro free. Tenma: What utter nonsense! Apollo: Yikes! Tenma: They always assume the worst of me because of the way I look! But those rumors don't have a shred of truth, I tell you! Athena: A little touchy about his appearance, isn't he? Apollo: (What he really needs to work on are his people skills...) Talk Tenma Taro's revival Apollo: Um... So rumor has it that you want to push the merger through... ...in order to release Tenma Taro. Of course, that's a bunch of baloney, isn't it? Tenma: Grrrrrr! Apollo: Ack! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry if I offended you! Tenma: So, that's the talk around town, is it?! Apollo: I can see how that would make you angry. Tenma: .........What if Jinxie's schoolmates start teasing her about this? Apollo: Huh? Tenma: I must break out of here at once! Her tormentors must be taught a lesson! Apollo: No, wait! First, we have to get you a not-guilty verdict. Tenma: Don't try to stop me! This is about a father's duty to his darling daughter. Hold tight, sweet Jinxie! Daddy's coming to save you! Apollo: Relax! We'll look out for your daughter until we can get you free. Tenma: Hrmmm... Is that so? You don't need me to... go straighten things out myself? Apollo: (Whoo boy... They'd probably call in the SWAT team if he showed up at her school. Oh, right. I ought to ask about the reason behind the merger.) Why the merger? (appears after \"Tenma Taro's revival\") Apollo: It seems like you were rather forceful in pushing for the municipal merger. Did you really want Nine-Tails Vale that badly? Tenma: Yes, well, it's quite an attractive prize in terms of tourism. BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: (Wait... Am I feeling what I think I'm feeling?) Tenma: Sure, I played a bit of hardball, but only when I deemed it necessary. Apollo: (I knew it. My bracelet's reacting!) Athena: What is it, Apollo? Apollo: Mayor Tenma may not be telling the whole truth. Athena: Really? How can you tell? Apollo: People invariably tense up when they lie. That's where my bracelet here comes in. I can sense when the person I'm talking to is feeling tense... ...because it begins to feel tight on my arm. Athena: Noooooo waaaaaay! You can do that?! Apollo: Wait, so you believe me? Just like that? Athena: Sure. Each of us has our own special gifts. Apollo: (Oh yeah. Athena has a gift, too: her special sense of hearing...) Athena: Still, what do you think the mayor's lying about? Apollo: I don't know, but it's our job to find out. (It's been a while since my bracelet last reacted like this. Let's see if I still remember how to do this... First I touch my bracelet ([X / Y / R])... Right! Now let's give it a whirl!) Present Bracelet Yes, I remember this feeling of intense concentration! The ability to see the smallest twitch, the slightest frown that no one else can see... Now, Mayor Tenma was lying somewhere in that statement he just made. And when he lied, a certain \"habit\" made itself clear just under his right eye. I just have to shift my viewpoint up and focus on that area! Pan to right eyelid Leads to: \"All right, I've got him now.\" Apollo: All right, I've got him now. His nervous tell should appear when he's trying to pull the wool over my eyes. (Changed from [His tic should appear when he's trying to pull the wool over my eyes.] in the original release) I've gotta pore over every word he says, and wait for it to appear. (Changed from [I've gotta pour [sic] over every word he says, and wait for his tic to appear.] in the original release) And when it does, I'll \"Perceive\" ([X / Y / R]) it! Tenma: Yes, well, it's quite an attractive prize in terms of tourism. Perceive right eyelid on \"in terms of tourism.\" Apollo: Leads to: \"Mr. Mayor, please, you can trust us with the truth.\" Perceive wrong area Apollo: Apollo: Something is upsetting you right now... Is that not correct?! I know because of that telltale habit of yours. Tenma: ......... Apollo: .........Well? Ack! Tenma: ......... I get that often. Am I really that strange? Apollo: Oh, no, no. Th-That's not what I meant. I didn't mean to imply there was anything wrong with you! Athena: Well done, Apollo. Now both of you are upset! Apollo: (Argh, let's try that again.) Leads back to presenting bracelet Apollo: Mr. Mayor, please, you can trust us with the truth. Tenma: The truth? I don't understand. Apollo: When you mentioned tourism... ...the bottom of your right eye started twitching. Tenma: What nonsense is this?! So what if it did?! Apollo: Please, tell us more about your merger bid. Tenma: What more is there to tell? Apollo: Why were you really seeking to merge with Nine-Tails Vale? Tenma: I already told you: tourism. The monster craze really revitalized the village, making it quite the prize. Apollo: You really don't trust us, do you? Tenma: What are you talking about? The village has been hot property ever since the monster craze started, has it not? Apollo: I think you've yet to realize that what you're saying contradicts the facts. You say that the monster craze really revitalized Nine-Tails Vale, so... ...you felt it would be an attractive prize for its tourism. But that would contradict this. Present Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy Apollo: Leads to: \"The monster craze in Nine-Tails Vale is a very recent phenomenon.\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: This evidence proves you're not being entirely truthful with us. Aaaack! S-Sorry, sorry! I take it all back! Tenma: ...Oh, forgive me. There was a fly that was driving me crazy. Apollo: If that's how he deals with flies, I'd hate to see him when he's really angry. Tenma: So, you think I'm not being entirely truthful? Apollo: Y-Yes... yes, sir. (This guy is seriously scary!) Leads back to: \"I think you've yet to realize that what you're saying contradicts the facts.\" Apollo: The monster craze in Nine-Tails Vale is a very recent phenomenon. It was sparked when The Amazing Nine-Tails rose up against the municipal merger. The village was practically a ghost town before then. Tenma: Argh! Apollo: So, you see, you couldn't have possibly seen it as an attractive prize for its tourism. What's the REAL reason behind your push to merge Tenma Town with Nine-Tails Vale, huh? Tenma: W-Well, umm... uhh... Ah... Ah... Arrrrrrrrrgh! Why the merger? (after perceiving) Apollo: Are you ready to tell me the truth now? Tenma: Honesly, I never wanted to pursue the merger in the first place. But I had no choice if I wanted to protect my darling little Jinxie. Apollo: Protect her from what? Tenma: I received a threat. It said either I go through with the merger or my Jinxie dies. Apollo: What?! Athena: How awful! Who would do such a thing? Tenma: I don't know. But whoever blackmailed me must be connected to the murder. Apollo: Wait, so you think the blackmailer and the killer could be one and the same? Tenma: Alderman Kyubi was immensely popular, so you have to ask, who would want him dead? The blackmailer who wanted the merger at all costs had all the motive in the world. Athena: But why go from blackmail to murder?! The merger protests won't disappear just because the alderman was killed. Apollo: Ah! (Could it be...!) What if there was another reason for the murder? Athena: Like what? Apollo: Maybe the blackmailer discovered Alderman Kyubi's secret identity! And his secret identity was a threat to the blackmailer's merger scheme! Athena: What do secret identities have to do with anything, Apollo? Apollo: (I have evidence revealing the alderman's secret identity. Maybe it's time to use it.) Present Crime Photo Apollo: Um... this is a photo of the crime scene. You didn't happen to see a yokai there, did you? Tenma: ...What in the world are you talking about? Apollo: Oh, no, I'm not saying I believe in monsters or anything, aha ha ha. Tenma: ......... Apollo: I-I'm sorry! Tenma: ............... Hrmm... Apollo: Heh heh... (Please, somebody let me out of here!) Ummm... so did you see one? You know, like, I don't know, Tenma Taro or... Never mind, just forget it, heh heh! Tenma: ............Huh... Huh huh... Huh. Apollo: (Is he laughing at me, with me, or even laughing at all? It's kinda hard to tell.) Amazing Nine-Tails Mask (after clearing \"Why the merger?\" Talk option after perceiving) Leads to: \"Mayor Tenma, please take a look at this if you would.\" Apollo: Mayor Tenma, please take a look at this if you would. Tenma: That's...! That's The Amazing Nine-Tails's mask! What is the meaning of this?! Apollo: This mask was almost definitely at the crime scene. And there was some white hair inside. Tenma: White hair... you say? Apollo: There was but one person with white hair in the manor that day. Tenma: Wha... What are you saying!? Apollo: You know which man I'm talking about, right? I'm talking about Rex Kyubi -- The Amazing Nine-Tails himself! Athena: No way! Tenma: The alderman was--! Impossible! Athena: Wait! Come to think of it, Alderman Kyubi WAS a former pro wrestler! So the blackmailer turned killer when he discovered the alderman's secret identity! Apollo: Um, didn't I just say that? But yeah, The Amazing Nine-Tails was a threat to the blackmailer's scheme. He opposed the merger and as a result, single-handedly sparked the monster craze. Athena: Even so, what was the mask doing at the crime scene? Apollo: There had been an event at the manor... ...and maybe Alderman Kyubi had taken part in it... if you get my drift. Tenma: This is absurd! Apollo: Mr. Mayor, do you have proof of the threat that was made against you? Tenma: Yes, a blackmail letter. Unfortunately, it disappeared after the murder. I'd been carrying it around in my briefcase but now, it's suddenly vanished. Apollo: The blackmailer must've taken it with them after they killed the alderman. (Well, at least we've clearly established the killer's motive.) (Was not an inner monologue in the original release) Guard: Mayor Tenma, visiting hours are over. Tenma: It would appear this meeting is adjourned. Athena: .........Apollo, do you really think the Tenma Taro that Jinxie saw is the killer? Apollo: I don't know. All I know is there is no such thing as monsters. Athena: What about that newspaper article? Could the killer have purposely freed Tenma Taro to do their dirty work? Apollo: Oh, come on! There wasn't any Tenma Taro to release in the first place! Athena: Yes, but the only suspects the police have right now are the mayor and a yokai. Apollo: (We'll probably be arguing whether there was a yokai involved in court tomorrow.) *sigh* I can already see that look of disbelief on the judge's face. Athena: Apollo? Are you all right? Apollo: I'm fine! I'm fine! I'll, um... I'll think of something! (I'd better because I can't very well say a flying demon was the killer. At this point, the only thing I know for sure is tomorrow is going to be one doozy of a trial.) To be continued (Changed from [To Be Continued] in the original release) Nothing to examine during investigation Apollo: Nothing of particular interest here. Area already examined Apollo: (We've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around.) The Monstrous Turnabout Image Gallery Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 April 18, 9:15 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Apollo: You okay, Athena? You've been really antsy ever since we got here. Athena: I-I'm just excited. This IS my first real court case after all! Apollo: (Yeaaah, a real ball of excitement she is... I know just what she needs.) ATHENA!!! Athena: Eek! Didn't you ever learn about indoor and outdoor voices? Apollo: I'm just trying to show you the best way to relieve your pre-trial jitters. Athena: By scaring the daylights out of me? Apollo: No, I find that shouting \"I'm fine!\" in a loud voice really relieves stress. It's part of my \"Chords of Steel\" voice workout, and a must before every trial. Athena: Y-You want me to shout? Here? Apollo: That's right. Here, I'll go first, then you try. I'm Apollo Justice and I'm fine!!! Athena: All right, um... I-I'm Athena Cykes... ...and I'm fine!!! ............Hmm... I think that actually worked! Apollo: I thought it might help. Always works for me. An old friend of mine from junior high and I say it all the time. Athena: I see... A proven remedy to calm the soul. I like it! Hey, how about we finish off with... ...a race around the courthouse! Apollo: The point is to relieve stress, not get totally exhausted! Phoenix: What's with all the racket, you two? Apollo: Ah, Mr. Wright. Heh heh, just a little voice workout. Hey, what's with the suit? Phoenix: Oh, this? I was thinking about getting my attorney's badge back, that's all. Apollo: That's all?! That's huge news! ...But why now? Phoenix: I have a feeling I'll be needed in the courtroom again sometime soon. But we can talk about that another time. Apollo: (No fair. Inquiring minds want to know. But wow... I'm so used to him in his usual laid-back clothes... That suit makes him look like a million dollars.) Phoenix: By the way, have you heard about the prosecutor assigned to this case? Apollo: Yeah, he's serving time, but before that, he was a prosecutor. He also uses psychology...? Phoenix: That's right. I've heard the rumors about how he was back before his conviction. Using the power of suggestion, he could make even the most stalwart defendants confess. Apollo: (Psychology in the courtroom. Been hearing a lot about that lately.) So, he must be a pretty scary guy, considering he's a prison inmate and all. Phoenix: So they say. They also say he'll cut you down if you talk too much. Apollo: Ack! I knew he was gonna be bad news! Phoenix: Ha ha ha, it's probably just hyperbole, at least I hope for your sake. Apollo: Wait, so is it true or not? Phoenix: Let's just say you should be concise and choose your words carefully. ...If you'd like to keep that head of yours attached to the rest of your body, that is. Apollo: Yikes! (Better tone down my Chords of Steel, too.) Phoenix: So, are you all ready? It might be a good idea to check the Court Record again before stepping into the ring. Apollo: ...Right, Mr. Wright! B-But I'm fine! Phoenix: I'll be watching from the gallery. Good luck! Apollo: Thanks! Athena: Okay, let's do this! Apollo: (The odds of pulling this off are ridiculously low, but that's nothing new. Believe in our client. Seek the truth. That's all we can do. Hang in there, Mayor Tenma, here comes Justice!) April 18, 9:30 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 4 Day 1Court Is Now In SessionAll Rise Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Damian Tenma. Apollo: Apollo Justice, defense team leader, is ready, Your Honor! Judge: I'd know that big, booming voice anywhere. As chipper as ever, eh, Mr. Justice? But who is the young lady next to you? Athena: I'm Athena Cykes, Mr. Justice's junior partner, and fresh out of law school! Judge: Well, now, full of beans, too, eh? Excellent! Makes an old man feel young again. Now for the prosecution. Hmm... It appears the prosecution is not ready yet. Fulbright: Never fear, for I shall explain! It's just a minor procedural complication, Your Honor. The prosecutor for this case is being escorted from prison as we speak. Judge: Prison? Oh, yes, of course. I almost forgot that he is currently serving time. Anime cutscene Officer: Yup, Prosecutor Blackquill's an inmate! But even a convicted murderer's still got a job to do and duties to perform. ???: ......... Apollo: Um... who's that with his back to us over there? Athena: That's him. I'm sure of it. ...Prosecutor Blackquill. Judge: *ahem* Is the prosecution ready? Blackquill: ...............Hmph. ......Enough jabbering. Get on with it already. Judge: Aah! Of course, forgive me! Apollo: (Urngh! Why are all the people related to this case so scary?!) Judge: Very well, Prosecutor Blackquill. Your opening statement if you please. Aah! Wh-What's the matter?! Blackquill: ......Must we continue to fritter away time like this? It is all right there in the indictment. An opening statement... would be pointless. Judge: Pointless? Oh, um... well... Apollo: Looks like the cat -- or in this case, the prosecutor -- has the judge's tongue. Judge: But, but... we need an opening statement as an overview of the case at hand. Blackquill: Hmph. Well, then, Your Baldness, if it's so very important, why don't you do the honors? Judge: Who?! Me?! Blackquill: There's a term for people who whine and fuss about how they need silly, useless things... ...and then decide they no longer want them once it's theirs: a selfish old fool. Judge: Huh?! Athena: Wait, was that the prosecution's opening statement? Blackquill: Hmph. Old dotards such as you are a plague upon the young. I pity your poor grandchildren, or is it great grandchildren? Judge: ! All these years, I thought the opening statement was the prosecutor's job... ...but I suppose I could give it a try. Might be a nice change of pace. (Changed from [...but I suppose I could give it try. [sic] Might be a nice change of pace.] in the original release) Apollo: What?! (He actually fell for that?!) Athena: That must've been the power of suggestion Mr. Wright was talking about. Judge: *ahem* The opening statement, huh... Hmm... Let's see here... The victim was one Rex Kyubi, alderman of Nine-Tails Vale. And the defendant, Damian Tenma, mayor of Tenma Town, is accused of his murder. Blackquill: ...And why, pray tell, was the mayor arrested? Judge: His prints were on the murder weapon. Plus, he had a motive: the elimination of the biggest roadblock to the municipal merger. The caretaker and the secretary, other potential suspects, both have alibis. And his daughter, who was also in the vicinity at the time of the incident, has no motive. Blackquill: So, in a nutshell...? Judge: I'd have to say the charges against the defendant are incontrovertible. Blackquill: Bravo, Your Baldness. Your years of experience shine bright like your head. Judge: Ho ho ho. Flattery will get you everywhere. Athena: He's playing Simon Says with the judge! Judge: Moving right along now, let's hear from our first witness for today, Detective Fulbright. Judge: Witness, please state your name and occupation. Fulbright: I am the detective assigned to this case, Bobby Fulbright! Oh, and I'll also be keeping tabs on old Blackquill here. Judge: I also heard you would provide protection if it ever came to that. Blackquill: ............Hmph. It would seem that I have been sorely underestimated. Apollo: (Wait, who's protecting who from what?) Fulbright: Still, I truly believe anyone can turn their life around, even ol' Blackquill here. Blackquill: Fool Bright! Save your platitudes for funerals. Get on with your statement. Fulbright: Ha ha ha! That's the spirit! Justice must be swift and true. I see it in your eyes! There IS hope for your rehabilitation and return to society! I will never give up on you! Athena: Prosecutor Blackquill doesn't seem to intimidate Detective Fulbright. Apollo: Well, you know what they say: ignorance is bliss. Athena: Oh, so that's why Detective Fulbright was assigned to Blackquill. He's so oblivious! Judge: Now, let's have your first statement, Detective Fulbright. Fulbright: You got it! But first, I'd like to say to the defense that justice will ultimately prevail! Witness Testimony -- About the Murder -- Fulbright: Alderman Kyubi was murdered with a spear that had been on the wall. The fingerprints of the defendant, Damian Tenma, were found on the murder weapon. At the time, Alderman Kyubi was asleep from a drug he unwittingly ingested. Mayor Tenma attacked his helpless victim, impaling him like a human shish kebob! But the sudden pain jolted the victim awake, and he grabbed a statue and struck back! Apollo: Alderman Kyubi had been slipped some kind of sleep-inducing drug? Fulbright: That's right. The accused was scared because the alderman was a former pro wrestler. So he slipped him a drug to make sure he'd be out cold and defenseless! Here's the autopsy report to prove it! Kyubi's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Judge: And the victim managed to attack his attacker, despite being impaled by a spear?! That sounds almost superhuman. Is it even possible? Fulbright: Well, he WAS a former pro wrestler, after all! That spear was probably nothing more than a mosquito bite to him! Apollo: Apollo: Not so fast! Don't try to brush it all off by saying the alderman had been a pro wrestler. Do you really expect us to believe he could fight back after being skewered by a spear? Blackquill: Hmph. Never heard of the incredible feats of which man is capable of in a pinch, have you? Like the samurai of yore, wrestlers can battle through intense pain. It sharpens their senses. I used to talk about it with a former wrestler I met in the clink. Apollo: I dunno... It still sounds a little far-fetched. Blackquill: Does it now? ......Then perhaps we should test the theory on you with the edge of my blade! Apollo: (I didn't sign up for this!) Blackquill: ............Hmph. And so your life is spared... for now. Apollo: (Please let those shackles be made of titanium... I don't want to die.) Fulbright: Ha ha! My investigations are as thorough as they are foolproof, or my name isn't Fulbright! I vow to resign immediately if I ever make a false arrest! Blackquill: The accused's prints were on the weapon. And he's the one person without an alibi. Quite decisive evidence. Wouldn't you agree, Your Baldness? Judge: Hmm... The defendant IS sounding guiltier by the minute. Apollo: (He has the judge leaning toward a guilty verdict, and the trial's just barely begun!) Blackquill: Hmph. What's more, a curious rumor about the accused is making the rounds. They say he seeks the merger for the purpose of freeing Tenma Taro from his imprisonment. Truth be told, I can think of no real reason to show interest in that backwards burg. Perhaps he's a complete nutter and really does seek to release an imaginary demon. Either way, he is raving mad and more than capable of murdering the alderman. Man: That mayor is a strange one, all right. I heard he went to a blood drive, but instead of donating, he tried to make a withdrawal! Judge: Order! There will be no gossiping in my court! Blackquill: Your Baldness. Please take a gander at those charms plastered around his cranium. I hear they're meant to keep him safe from possession by the demon Tenma Taro. Then again... Perhaps he's already under the demon's spell. Behold! The lunatic appears poised to lunge at you at any moment. Judge: Eeeep! Athena: Athena: The rumors and quirks of Mayor Tenma have no relevance to this case! Besides, those charms on his head... they're... they're just a fashion statement! ...I think. Judge: Hmm... Come to think of it, such things don't seem relevant to the case, do they? Athena: The prosecution will refrain from dragging our client's reputation through the mud! Blackquill: Oh, what a dreadfully fearsome lass we have here. Apollo: Whew, thanks for that lifeline, Athena. Athena: Careful, Apollo. He has the judge dancing in the palm of his hand! The power of suggestion is one of the more powerful tools in Simon Blackquill's arsenal. He's trying to manipulate everyone's impressions to suit his objectives. Apollo: (This guy really is bad news.) Judge: In any case, it seems the victim did manage to defend himself, despite being impaled. What sort of weapon did he used against his attacker? Fulbright: None other than this statue right here! Judge: It appears to be a statue of two strange creatures locked in battle. Blackquill: Two yokai to be exact. On one side is the Nine-Tailed Fox and on the other Tenma Taro. Quite interesting if you think about it. It's as though this very case were rendered in art. Apollo: Fox and Demon Statue updated in the Court Record. Judge: Mr. Justice, you may proceed with your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- About the Murder -- Fulbright: Alderman Kyubi was murdered with a spear that had been on the wall. Press Apollo: Apollo: So, those weapons on the wall of the Fox Chamber... I presume those are real? Don't you think keeping real weapons around like that is rather dangerous? Fulbright: No matter what he collected, the alderman insisted it be the real deal. For instance, he had a real demon's club in his possession. Apparently, one of his ancestors claimed it after defeating a demon in battle. Apollo: Wha--?! (That's got to be an old wives' tale.) Fulbright: Ha ha ha! The alderman had pure, unadulterated justice flowing in his veins! Whatever he did, he did it right! We've... lost a real champion of justice in his death! Blackquill: Hmph. Nothing but claptrap and balderdash if you ask me. Now stop your bleating and tell us about the weapon. Fulbright: Your wish is my command! Fulbright: The fingerprints of the defendant, Damian Tenma, were found on the murder weapon. Press Apollo: Apollo: It doesn't make sense, if you think about it. Prints could be easily wiped off. Fulbright: Hm. You do have a point there. Blackquill: I'd venture to say, he did NOT wipe off the prints because he COULD not. Apollo: What do you mean? Blackquill: ......... Athena: Looks like he wants YOU to figure it out. Well, don't just stand there! Show him who's boss! Apollo: (I'm... totally lost... so why don't you just tell me the answer already?!) Athena: I don't think he saw that plea for help. Fulbright: You feeling all right, kid? Running a fever, perhaps? Apollo: (I wish trials came with a reset button.) Judge: Well, the specifics may yet come to light. Please proceed, Detective Fulbright. Fulbright: At the time, Alderman Kyubi was asleep from a drug he unwittingly ingested. Press Apollo: Apollo: Come to think of it, a coffee cup was found on the floor. Was the sedative in his coffee...? Fulbright: Bingo! We found traces of a sleeping agent all over the inside of the cup! Blackquill: And that is why he was out cold. That is until he leapt to his feet upon being impaled by the mayor. Apollo: What an awful way to wake up. Blackquill: Heh. A rather stimulating eye opener if you ask me. I, too, would have risen to the attack, for to die in battle is the samurai way. Paradise awaits fallen heroes, but that hole in his stomach would make eating a challenge... Fulbright: Prosecutor Blackquill, please! Those morbid jokes of yours have no place in this court! Blackquill: ............Hmph. Says the jester in detective's guise. Fulbright: Moving right along...! Fulbright: Mayor Tenma attacked his helpless victim, impaling him like a human shish kebob! Press Apollo: Apollo: So, the alderman was drugged because he was really strong? Fulbright: Did you see those rock hard muscles of his? I'm surprised the spear even managed to pierce that armor-like musculature! I admit, I'm completely jealous of that righteous body of his, ha ha ha! Apollo: Well, he did look pretty buff, even in that suit he had on. Blackquill: Quite a difference when compared with a yellowbelly like you. Apollo: Yellowbelly? Who even says that anymore? Athena: Yeah, and the color's all wrong, too......... Ooh, I know! How about a squishy red tomato! Apollo: I move to strike both of your comments from the record! Judge: Mr. Justice's character is not the issue here. Now, let's get back to what happened after the far more muscular alderman was impaled. Fulbright: Yes, well, your average person would likely have died on the spot. Fulbright: But the sudden pain jolted the victim awake, and he grabbed a statue and struck back! Press Apollo: Apollo: Could he really have attacked his attacker after being impaled with that huge spear? Fulbright: Absolutely! After all, he was once a pro wrestler. The injustice of being drugged, then speared was answered with a righteous counterattack! Apollo: But does being a former pro wrestler make him superhuman? Fulbright: Absolutely! After all, he was one of the good guys, like a superhero on the side of justice. Even though he was retired, he could still don his superhero guise in times of need! Apollo: Apollo: You need to lay off the comic books, detective! We're talking about real life here. Blackquill: Setting aside the halfwit's flights of fancy, the fact is this. The court-ordered post mortem concluded the victim moved after his skewering. Apollo: (So, he found the strength somehow to attack his attacker, huh?) Present Fox and Demon Statue Apollo: Leads to: \"Did the alderman really strike the mayor?\" Athena: Detective Fulbright's testimony sounds airtight. No wonder he's so confident. Apollo: No, he only thinks it's airtight. It's up to us to poke some holes in it. That part about the alderman fighting back sounds like a big hole waiting to be poked. Apollo: Did the alderman really strike the mayor? Fulbright: What?! Are you questioning my sense of justice?! Apollo: Your so-called \"justice\" need to find itself a pair of legs to stand on. You claim the alderman struck back after the mayor put a spear through him. But the statue he supposedly used to defend himself creates a major hole in your theory. Judge: It would appear that the defense has a counter-argument. Very well, let's hear what the defense thinks is odd about the detective's statue theory. Kyubi fought unarmed Apollo: Well, the alderman was a former pro wrestler, so why would he even use it as a weapon? He could've defended himself with his bare hands! I mean, that's what pro wrestlers do! Blackquill: Hmph. You've a lot of nerve... ...but will you raise an objection in the face of swift punishment as solicitors are wont to do? Apollo: Um... Well... Not if I deserve it...? Judge: And you do! The defense will look before they leap next time! Is that understood? Apollo: Sorry, Your Honor! Can I try that again? Leads back to: \"Very well, let's hear what the defense thinks is odd about the detective's statue theory.\" There are no fingerprints Leads to: \"There are no fingerprints on this supposedly crucial piece of evidence.\" It's not broken Apollo: If the statue really was used as a weapon, why are there no signs of breakage? Athena: Um, Apollo? When was the last time you had your eyes examined? The statue is clearly broken. See the area around their hands? Apollo: Ah! Eh heh heh, guess I missed that. Judge: I'm afraid I can't let that one slide without a penalty. Apollo: Please, let me try that again! (Detective Fulbright claims that the alderman used the statue to attack the mayor. But there's a hole in his theory!) Leads back to: \"Very well, let's hear what the defense thinks is odd about the detective's statue theory.\" Apollo: There are no fingerprints on this supposedly crucial piece of evidence. And if you look at the crime scene photo... ...you'll notice that the alderman isn't wearing gloves. Judge: Yes, I believe he is quite gloveless indeed. Apollo: If he touched the statue with his bare hands, he should've left some fingerprints! Detective Fulbright, you DID take that into account during your investigation, didn't you? Fulbright: Arrrrrrgh! This can't be happening! D-D-Did I arrest the wrong maaaaan?! Athena: You did it, Apollo! You knocked Detective Fulbright off his high horse! Apollo: Well, it's just one point in our favor. Athena: Who do you suppose clubbed the mayor if it wasn't the alderman? Apollo: Hmm... Well, if it wasn't the alderman... ...that means someone else must've clubbed the mayor. Athena: You mean there was a third party there in the Fox Chamber? Apollo: Exactly! And this could be the big break we've been looking for! Judge: Hmm... There does seem to be a hole in the prosecution's argument. Prosecutor Blackquill, would you care to respond to the defense's assertion? Blackquill: Hmph. Apollo: (The least you could do is look at me while being dismissive.) Blackquill: Your mind is as dull as an unhoned blade, Justice-dono. Apollo: Justice... dono? (He's been watching too many samurai flicks.) Blackquill: It will take far more than that to cut down Simon Blackquill. A whelp such as you has no hope against my superior swordsmanship. Apollo: This is a trial, not a swordfight, Prosecutor Blackquill! Blackquill: Hmph. There is a perfectly good explanation for the lack of prints on the statue. You might recall that bloodstained cloth found at the scene of the crime. Well, it just so happens... that the blood was the mayor's. Apollo: So, um... what are you getting at? Blackquill: Hone your mind, boy! Why was there blood on that cloth? Solve that riddle and you shall see that the hole you thought you found is but an illusion. Apollo: Now let's see... How was that cloth used...? Was it used... By Kyubi as a head covering Apollo: The alderman was probably wearing it over his head. Athena: Wha--?! Blackquill: Do you truly think the alderman would show up to a meeting over the fate of his village... ...wearing this ridiculous-looking cloth over his head? Apollo: Sure. They had a festival that day, didn't they? Who's to say he didn't party a little too hard and just forgot to take it off?! Blackquill: ............... Judge: ............... Apollo: Okay, fine. So maybe he didn't do that... Can I try one more time? Leads back to: \"Now let's see... How was that cloth used...? Was it used...\" To wipe up blood Apollo: Maybe the cloth was used to wipe as much of the mayor's blood as possible off the statue. And in the process, the culprit inadvertently erased the alderman's fingerprints as well. Blackquill: Blackquill: But the mayor did not bother to wipe away his own fingerprints on the murder weapon. Why would he wipe down one weapon but not the other? Careful, now. Use what little brains you have left before you speak. Apollo: Gimme a do-over on that one! Please! Leads back to: \"Now let's see... How was that cloth used...? Was it used...\" To wrap the statue Leads to: \"Maybe the alderman wrapped the statue in the cloth.\" Apollo: Maybe the alderman wrapped the statue in the cloth. In short, he wasn't touching the statue directly when he used it to strike back at the mayor. Ah! Blackquill: ...Precisely. Bully for you, boy. Apollo: Aw, it was nothing. Athena: Apollo, don't let him start manipulating you, too! You just closed the hole for the prosecution! Apollo: I did? ............Ack, I did! Blackquill: Right. That a statue wrapped in cloth would leave no fingerprints is as plain as day. But this also proves there are no holes in our theory of the alderman striking back. Apollo: .........Oops. Arrrrrrrrrgh! Fox and Demon Statue updated in the Court Record. Blackquill: Now do you see how dull your mind is? Apollo: I'll make sure to sharpen it next time. Blackquill: A particularly frightening inmate once told me that... ...he always tenderly honed his blades before he went to work, like the samurai of yore. Judge: Samurai? Sounds more like a homicidal maniac to me! Blackquill: Actually, he was working in the prison kitchen at the time. Apollo: (Wait, so the inmate was a murdering samurai prison chef?) Judge: Hmm... It would seem that the victim and his killer were the only ones there after all. Apollo: (I was kinda attached to that hole... Now what?) Athena: Apollo, I just thought of something. If they didn't find anyone's fingerprints on the statue... ...who's to say someone other than the alderman didn't hit the mayor with it? Apollo: Why didn't I think of that! Anybody could've NOT left prints on it! Blackquill: Hmph. Then who, pray tell, struck the mayor with the statue? Please, illuminate us with your wisdom, young lady. Athena: There's only one answer -- the real killer! Blackquill: Prove the existence of this \"real killer\" then. What evidence have you? Athena: Oh, I'll give you evidence, all right! Apollo: Athena, are you sure about this? (Changed from [Athena, are sure [sic] about this?] in the original release) Athena: To borrow your words, Apollo, I'm fine! Take a look at this! Black feathers and tracks, allegedly from a yokai, were found at the scene. I believe they're from the third party who struck the mayor with that statue. Judge: Is the defense actually suggesting some sort of monster killed that alderman?! Athena: That's exactly what I'm suggesting! Apollo: Apollo: No, Athena! You just lost what little credibility we had left! Athena: .........Aah! Sorry, sorry! Guess I got carried away. Judge: Mr. Justice, we've no time to deal with objections between members of the defense. Apollo: Sorry, Your Honor. It's just, this kid's still, well, a kid... Athena: Ouch... You meanie! I'm reporting this to Mr. Wright! Judge: So, is this court to believe the feathers and tracks are from a \"yokai\" as you put it? Apollo: Uhh, no, Your Honor. I believe they are a fabrication. The real killer wanted us to believe some sort of monster murdered the alderman. Judge: Hmm, interesting. And why do you suppose the killer would do that? Apollo: Umm.... Why, indeed? Judge: Mr. Justice, you seem as new to this as your partner is. Apollo: Ouch... (This, I'm not reporting to Mr. Wright...) Blackquill: Hoy, Fool Bright, explain to His Baldness what these brats are missing. You know, the who and why behind those feathers and tracks. Apollo: Wha--?! (You mean you can explain all that?!) Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Our investigative prowess is without equal! Apollo: (I'm starting to think I chose the wrong profession.) Judge: Very well, let's hear about these so-called yokai feathers and tracks. Witness Testimony -- Feathers and Tracks -- Fulbright: This entire case centers on one man's attempt to crush opposition to the municipal merger! Mayor Tenma panicked when The Amazing Nine-Tails helped embolden the protestors. So he stoked the villagers' fears by fabricating a monster! The strange feathers and tracks he planted made it look like a yokai was the killer. Apollo: Those feathers and tracks stoked the villagers' fears? (Changed from [Those feathers and tracks stoked the villager's [sic] fears?] in the original release) Fulbright: Absolutely! He knew exactly how to prey on their superstitious minds. Blackquill: Those feathers only gave weight to the idea that the alderman was slain by a demon. The accursed demon Tenma Taro, that is. Judge: Tenma who? Blackquill: Tenma Taro -- the legendary demon locked away in the village's Forbidden Chamber. From a young age, the villagers are taught to fear the great, black-feathered demon. And thus were they blinded to other, more plausible explanations. Apollo: Apollo: Hold on for a second. Before we start letting our imaginations run wild... Isn't there someone else that could be considered a suspect? Judge: Mr. Justice, please explain yourself. Apollo: On the day of the incident, there was a special event held at Kyubi Manor. And as part of this event, there was someone dressed in the likeness of Tenma Taro. Obviously this person is a much more likely suspect than any legendary demon! Blackquill: Blackquill: Dullard. You are playing right into the killer's mind games. Apollo: What? Blackquill: Listen here. The feathers and tracks were merely red herrings. The villagers believe the murder to be the work of the real Tenma Taro. However, the police believe that the person in the Tenma Taro suit is the killer. Apollo: Ahh! Blackquill: The defendant sought to sow this confusion in order to deflect blame away from himself. However, he was knocked unconscious by the alderman... ...and thus our mentally deficient mayor was caught red-handed at the scene of the crime. Apollo: Apollo: Do you honestly believe Mayor Tenma would do something so stupid?! Blackquill: Blackquill: The evidence speaks for itself. ...Fool Bright! Fulbright: Right. It was the mayor's last-ditch effort to stop the opposition before things got crazy. The Amazing Nine-Tails was fueling both the yokai craze and the anti-merger movement. Plus, he's one of the better-known masked wrestlers, and the hometown favorite. That's why the mayor panicked and set out on the path of injustice. Judge: But do the people of Nine-Tails Vale really believe a yokai is behind the crime? Fulbright: Yokai sightings are an everyday event there, so I wouldn't be surprised if they did. Judge: Hmm... I must say... A crime that preys upon innocent, impressionable minds. Blackquill: Just so. A particularly silver-tongued inmate once had the following words for me. The innocent of heart are the easiest prey. Judge: You don't say? Was this inmate a con artist? Blackquill: .........No. He was framed for the murder of his beloved. I actually felt sorry for the poor chap. Apollo: (Wait, so he wasn't the predator, but rather the prey?) Judge: Yes, well... Now then, the defense may proceed with their cross-examination. Cross Examination -- Feathers and Tracks -- Fulbright: This entire case centers on one man's attempt to crush opposition to the municipal merger! Press Apollo: Apollo: Detective Fulbright, is the anti-merger movement really that strong? Fulbright: Oh, absolutely! They parade around in yokai costumes shouting, \"Down with Mayor Tenma!\" And just the other day, they stormed Tenma City Hall, claiming it was a den of vipers! Blackquill: Hmph. But when the accused showed his face... ...the angry mob scattered like leaves upon an autumn wind. For you see, lowly yokai are no match for Tenma Taro, the Dark Lord of their kind. Athena: Wait, are the villagers scared of Mayor Tenma or Tenma Taro? I'm confused. Apollo: I think he means Mayor Tenma. It's easy to get the wrong impression about the guy. Judge: Detective Fulbright, why do you suppose the defendant would commit such an act? Fulbright: Mayor Tenma panicked when The Amazing Nine-Tails helped embolden the protestors. Press Apollo: Apollo: The Amazing Nine-Tails... No one knows his true identity, right? Fulbright: That's right. And he was a lone wolf, or in other words, he didn't belong to a wrestling federation. He appeared like a shooting star, defeating one Tenma Town wrestler after another. And before anyone knew it, he was a champion! Blackquill: Like the samurai of yore, surrounded thick with enemies, he cut them down one by one. It was a complete and utter loss of face for Tenma Town Pro Wrestling. Fulbright: He was amazing! If ever there was a real superhero, it would be him! I dream of becoming a true champion of justice like him someday! Athena: I bet Detective Fulbright would be a great pro wrestler. He could even team up with Prosecutor Blackquill. Apollo: A police detective and a prisoner in chains? .........You know, I think people would actually pay to see that. I know I would. Fulbright: Ha ha ha. So you DO understand the greatness that is The Amazing Nine-Tails! Fulbright: So he stoked the villagers' fears by fabricating a monster! Press Apollo: Apollo: Did the murder and yokai evidence really stoke the villagers' fears? Fulbright: Absolutely! It had an immediate effect! The presumed return of the dreaded Tenma Taro has them shaking in their boots! Judge: Oh my, is it really that bad?! Blackquill: Hmph, that superstitious lot? It's as if Jack the Ripper had been set loose in their village. The mere thought of that demon lurking about is enough to spark a mass exodus. Judge: I see... That's a very persuasive argument. Apollo: (The mere thought of His Honor buying into Simon the Psycho-Slasher's words... ...makes me want to spark my own exodus out of the courtroom right about now.) Fulbright: So you see, there can be only one reason why anyone would plant those feathers and tracks! Fulbright: The strange feathers and tracks he planted made it look like a yokai was the killer. Press Apollo: Apollo: ...But it doesn't add up. If what you say is true, why top it off with murder? Fulbright: Hm? What do you mean? Apollo: You claim that our client planted the yokai evidence to stoke the villagers' fears. If so, then why not stop there? Why murder Alderman Kyubi? Judge: Hmm... Excellent point. Apollo: It is, isn't it! So, Your Honor agrees there was no reason for the murder, correct?! Blackquill: Blackquill: Perhaps the killing was on the spur of the moment. (Changed from [Perhaps the killing was spur of the moment.] in the original release) Apollo: You're saying it wasn't premeditated? Blackquill: From the outset, I had no intention of paying heed to any of your babble. However, the fact is, the mayor made a startling discovery. Apollo: A startling discovery? (Why don't I like the sound of that?) Blackquill: Alderman Kyubi's secret identity. Athena: Apollo... I think Prosecutor Blackquill has figured out the alderman's secret identity. But even if he has, why would it be a motive for the mayor to commit murder? Apollo: (...This is not good!) Blackquill: This patch of fur was discovered at the crime scene. It's from the mask worn by The Amazing Nine-Tails. Therefore, we can conclude that this mask was at the crime scene. Judge: Oh, my. But why would it have been there? Blackquill: The victim was a former pro wrestler and a member of the anti-merger movement. ...Need I say more? Judge: Well, um............ Ah! C-Could it really be?! Blackquill: Hmph. Your Baldness has had an epiphany I see. Our victim, Rex Kyubi, was The Amazing Nine-Tails! And the mayor's discovery of such was his motive for murder! Apollo: Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Judge: Order! Order!!! What a shocking development. A motive clearer than crystal clear! Athena: What do we do now, Apollo?! Apollo: I didn't think they'd tie the alderman's secret identity to the mayor's motive for murder! Blackquill: At last we've reached my real point: why did the alderman have to forge a secret identity? Does it not pique your interest, Your Baldness? Judge: I admit it does... It IS odd that he had to create this other persona... ...just to secretly participate in the anti-merger movement. Blackquill: Very astute of you, Your Baldness. Fulbright: Right, now take a look at this! If you value your dearest's life, you will merge Nine-Tails Vale with Tenma Town. This blackmail letter was found in Alderman Kyubi's pocket! Apollo: Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaat!!! Blackquill: At present, the alderman's wife is in the hospital. And that letter is clear evidence the mayor was blackmailing him by threatening her life. Athena: Wait, didn't the blackmail letter sent to Mayor Tenma go missing... ...right after the alderman's murder? Apollo: You think maybe the killer took the letter from the mayor after the murder... ...and planted it into the alderman's pocket? Athena: It's possible... but we don't have any proof that that's what happened. Apollo: (Talk about being up the creek without a paddle...) Blackmail Letter added to the Court Record. Fulbright: Mayor Tenma would've made a clean getaway if he'd just left after planting the yokai things. But he was knocked out cold by his sudden decision to kill The Amazing Nine-Tails! Judge: So, it was The Amazing Nine-Tails's counterattack that brought the entire crime to light. Apollo: Wait a sec... (Fulbright's claiming that the mayor killed the alderman after planting the yokai evidence. And that the mayor was knocked out cold immediately after that?) Detective Fulbright, please add your previous statement to your testimony! Adds statement \"Mayor Tenma killed the sleeping alderman after planting the feathers and tracks.\" Press (subsequent times) Apollo: Apollo: So, you're saying our client hadn't planned on killing the alderman? Fulbright: That's right. The motive only came after he discovered the alderman's secret identity! Apollo: W-Well, I guess that does make sense. Athena: What do we do now, Apollo?! Apollo: I didn't think they'd tie the alderman's secret identity to the mayor's motive for murder. Fulbright: Let's get on with the testimony, shall we! Fulbright: Mayor Tenma killed the sleeping alderman after planting the feathers and tracks. Press Apollo: Apollo: So let me get this straight. You believe the mayor planted the yokai evidence before the murder, not after? Fulbright: Absolutely! And then he was knocked out cold by the alderman's last punch! He wouldn't have had a chance to plant the evidence after that! Apollo: (Hmm... Something's not right here.) Present Crime Photo Apollo: Leads to: \"Detective Fulbright, your sense of justice is anything but fair!\" Apollo: (Hard to believe that a stiff, humorless man like the mayor could be behind such a stunt.) Athena: Argh... We have to do something, Apollo, before they pin it all on the mayor! Apollo: Then we're going to need to prove that Mayor Tenma didn't plant that yokai stuff. Athena: How are we supposed to do that? Apollo: Detective Fulbright, your sense of justice is anything but fair! Fulbright: What's this?! You are question my justice again?! Apollo: Yes, and I'm going to prove it to you. Take a look at this photo. Judge: This... is the crime scene photo. And just what does this prove? Apollo: It proves when the feathers and tracks were planted. Fulbright: But I already told you, they were planted before the murder! The defendant planted the yokai evidence, then was knocked out cold while killing his victim! Apollo: But that would be impossible. If you look right here, it's clear when the feathers and tracks were left at the scene. Present tracks Apollo: Leads to: \"Aren't you just pointing to the yokai feathers and tracks, Mr. Justice?\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: There's clearly something wrong... right around here. Judge: The only thing clear to me is that the defense is barking up the wrong tree. Blackquill: Hmph. Really up a tree now, aren't we? Judge: Yes, and a stiff penalty should help you learn that correct assertions don't grow on them. Apollo: Ugh... I wonder if bandages do... (There is clearly something wrong with the assertion that... ...the feathers and tracks were there before the murder.) Leads back to: \"If you look right here, it's clear when the feathers and tracks were left at the scene.\" Judge: Aren't you just pointing to the yokai feathers and tracks, Mr. Justice? Apollo: Yes. See how the feathers are on top of the blood, and the tracks were made in blood? In other words, the yokai evidence could've only resulted AFTER the murder. Fulbright: Th-Then the mayor must've planted the evidence after killing the alderman! Apollo: But you said it yourself, the mayor had been knocked unconscious thereafter. There would've been no time for him to plant any evidence at all! Therefore! There must've been someone else besides the mayor and the alderman at the crime scene! Fulbright: Arrrrrrgh! There must be some mistake! Judge: Order! Order!!! Fulbright: Wh-Where's your evidence?! You can't possibly have any, can you?! Ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: Evidence? Oh, I have evidence. In fact, I have an eye-witness's testimony for you. Fulbright: You do?! But hooooow?! Was my vaunted sense of justice really just half-baked? Athena: He's taking this really hard. Judge: Hmm... Mr. Justice. What is this testimony regarding a third party that you claim to have? Apollo: I have it right here, Your Honor. It's the sworn testimony of Mr. Tenma's daughter. The witness, Jinxie Tenma, saw a yokai in the hallway after stumbling upon the scene. It was the demon Tenma Taro... He's the source of those feathers and tracks! Judge: ......... Blackquill: ......... Fulbright: ......... ......... Apollo: .........Will somebody please say something? Judge: ...The defense will explain to the court exactly what he means. Fulbright: You... You dare to mock this court and justice itself?! You're unfit to bear your name, boy! Blackquill: You Baldness, it appears our defense attorney here is delirious from exhaustion. Athena: Athena: Apollo! Think of something, quick, before you're held in contempt of court! Apollo: What do you think I'm trying to do?! Before you decide whether I should step down, please... hear me out...? Judge: Very well, Mr. Justice, I'm all ears. But you had better explain yourself well. What was this yokai you were talking about? Apollo: It's all in this statement here -- Jinxie Tenma asserts that she saw Tenma Taro. After she discovered the crime scene and called the police... ...she came around a corner in the hall. It was around here... ...that she saw Tenma Taro fleeing toward the foyer! The defense asserts that whoever was impersonating this monster... ...is the one who left those feathers and tracks behind, intentionally or otherwise! Judge: Wh-Whaaaaaat?! Fulbright: How incredibly unjust! Why haven't I heard about this before?! Man: The defense just proved there was someone else! Woman: So the mayor isn't the killer? Man: Was it all just a set up? The prosecutor IS a convicted felon, after all. Athena: Apollo! The momentum has shifted in our favor! Apollo: Good. Now let's keep it that way! Blackquill: Blackquill: ............Hmph. Little do you realize... ...that though you are in the midst of a fray, your sword is broken. Apollo: My sword? (I didn't know I had one to break.) Are you implying there's a problem with my claim? Blackquill: Consider this: if that yokai impersonator had indeed fled toward the foyer... ...that fool and that fop would have seen him. Apollo: Fool and fop? Oh, you mean Filch and L'Belle. Hmm, now that you mention it... Blackquill: Both Phineas Filch and Florent L'Belle were in the foyer at the time. But they haven't stated that they saw a yokai, have they? Did you ever consider that yokai was but a figment of a scared little girl's imagination? Apollo: Argh. Why DIDN'T those two see the Tenma Taro impersonator pass by? Athena: Why don't we ask them ourselves? Apollo: I was just about to say that myself. No, really, I was! The defense would like to call Mr. Phineas Filch, caretaker of Kyubi Manor, to the stand! I just know he must have seen something! Judge: Hmm... I suppose we can't ignore the fact that the little girl believes she saw a monster. I trust you have no objections to Mr. Justice's request, Prosecutor Blackquill? I understand that Mr. Filch is enjoying a nap out in the lobby. Blackquill: Hmph. I knew that tanuki was a rare find. But when we captured him, I didn't think he'd end up a witness. Do with him as you will. Apollo: (D-Did he just say captured? No, wait. I don't want to know.) Judge: Very well, then. Bailiff, please go wake Mr. Filch and escort him to the witness stand. Judge: Will the witness state his name and occupation, please. Filch: The name's Filch, Phineas Filch, caretaker of Kyubi Manor. Oh, and... This is for you, Your Lordship. Just a little something I though ya might like. Judge: Oh, my, what a fabulous pair of shoes! And \"Your Honor\" will do just fine, Mr. Filch. Apollo: ...Ah! It's those shoes again! Athena: Um... Don't they belong to Detective Fulbright? Apollo: Don't tell me Filch stole them again. Filch: They're all yours, Your Honorship, sir. Judge: What?! But they seem awfully expensive. Filch: Yep, too expensive for me, but I reckon they'd be perfect for someone like Your Honorship. Judge: Hmm... It's a kind gesture, but legal ethics dictate I can't accept such gifts. Filch: Aw, ethics smethics. Just take 'em if ya want 'em. Polished 'em up real nice for ya, too. Judge: I'm sorry about the shoes, Mr. Filch, but I WILL accept your testimony. The court would like to hear whether you saw Tenma Taro in the foyer after the murder. Witness Testimony -- Guarding the Foyer -- Filch: At the time of the murder I was on guard duty in the foyer, just like Mr. Kyubi asked. (Changed from [At the time of the murder I was on guard duty in the foyer, just like Mr. Kyubi's [sic] asked.] in the original release) I was making sure no one -- fair, foul, fishy, or otherwise -- could get to our guest. I was still in my office keeping a good watch when the murder happened after 3 PM. But I didn't see nothing outta the ordinary, no siree! Blackquill: That yokai you keep jabbering on about was but a phantom of a little girl's dreams. Apollo: So, you're telling this court you never saw anyone dressed up like Tenma Taro? Filch: Yep! Was guarding the whole time. That's the truth, the holy truth, 'n' nutter-butter the truth! And Tenma Taro? Bah, ya don't really believe in all that yokai mumbo jumbo, do ya? I certainly don't! BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: Hm? (My bracelet, it's...) Athena: Something the matter, Apollo? Apollo: My bracelet keeps squeezing my arm. Athena: Really? So you think Mr. Tanuki-- er, I mean, Filch has been lying to us? Apollo: I wouldn't rule it out. (Now, if I could just zero in on a tell -- some sort of nervous habit...) ???: *Screech!* Apollo: A-Aaaaaaagh! What in the--?! (W-What's a hawk doing in here!?) Blackquill: Allow me to introduce my trusty cohort, Taka. He seems to have taken quite a liking to the courthouse. Made it his new home, in fact. Apollo: ...He doesn't live with you... you know, in jail? (Who's ever heard of a courthouse bird?) Blackquill: Taka simply loathes trickery and fraud. And that queer power of yours seems to have offended my dear, bosom buzzard. Apollo: This isn't some sort of trick or-- Aaaaaaaaaagh! (I won't be able to spot squat like this!) Filch: Wh-What the heck's goin' on 'round here?! Run for the hills! Judge: N-No pets or other animals allowed in the courtroom! Taka: *Screech!* Judge: Ack! Somebody help! Blackquill: Oh, he's merely having a bit of sport. He won't harm you, save when truly famished. Judge: In that case, Prosecutor Blackquill, you will ensure your feathered friend is properly fed. Athena: Looks like we have to do this the old-fashioned way. Apollo: We'll be fine... I think. (If there was someone dressed as Tenma Taro there, Filch should've seen him. We'll just have to put our faith in Jinxie's statement for now.) Judge: Mr. Justice, please proceed with your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- Guarding the Foyer -- Filch: At the time of the murder I was on guard duty in the foyer, just like Mr. Kyubi asked. (Changed from [At the time of the murder I was on guard duty in the foyer, just like Mr. Kyubi's [sic] asked.] in the original release) Press Apollo: Apollo: Mr. Filch, why did Alderman Kyubi have you handle guard duty? Filch: Eh-heh heh... 'Cause he trusts me. I AM the manor's caretaker, after all. Apollo: So, you took said guard duty seriously? Filch: Eh-heh heh... Lemme tell ya something about me. I'm-- Yipes! Blackquill: Listen here, you little tanuki. Get straight to the point and be quick about it. The court wishes to hear what you did or didn't see in the foyer, and naught else. Filch: Y-Yes, of course, sir! Right away, sir! Apollo: (Blackquill's got him completely under his thumb.) Filch: Like I said, I was guarding the foyer entrance that day! Filch: I was making sure no one -- fair, foul, fishy, or otherwise -- could get to our guest. Press Apollo: Apollo: So no one could get to him... Sounds like security was pretty tight. Filch: That's 'cause there's always lotsa sneaks 'n' thieves 'round festival time. Apollo: And the solution was to entrust the manor's security to a thief? That's not even funny. Athena: Maybe it's a matter of stopping thieves by hiring one. After all, it takes one to know one. Apollo: I dunno, it seems more like letting the fox guard the henhouse to me. Judge: Hmm. So, the witness testifies that he took his guard duty seriously? Filch: Yes, sir, Your Honorship, sir! Filch: I was still in my office keeping a good watch when the murder happened after 3 PM. Press Apollo: Apollo: Did you really keep an eye on the foyer the entire time?! Filch: *sigh* Poor old Filchy... Been working hard my whole life... ...only to be smeared by some greenhorn in his fancy-schmancy suit and silly haircut. Ah! Sorry, sorry, Mr. Blackquill, sir! Didn't mean to get off subject there! Apollo: (Sheesh... Blackquill didn't even say anything.) Filch: To answer your question, yes, I kept an eye -- no, both of 'em, in fact -- on the foyer! Present TV Listings Apollo: Leads to: \"Don't lie to the court like that, Mr. Filch.\" Filch: But I didn't see nothing outta the ordinary, no siree! Press Apollo: Apollo: Could you describe to the court who you would consider fishy looking? Filch: Someone all fidgety and shifty-like, you know, like they're about to steal something. Apollo: (He......... just described himself.) Athena: I wonder why Mr. Filch didn't see Tenma Taro. Apollo: Maybe Jinxie only thinks she saw Tenma Taro. Or... Athena: Maybe Mr. Filch is lying. Apollo: And if he's lying, we might be able to spot a contradiction in his testimony. Apollo: Don't lie to the court like that, Mr. Filch. Filch: Hey, it ain't right to bushwhack a fella like that! Apollo: Unfortunately for you, I have evidence that proves you're lying. If you look at this TV listing here, you'll see that at the time of the crime... ...there was a pro wrestling match scheduled -- something you'd never miss. Filch: Ack! I didn't watch that one, no siree! I was doing my job, just like I was s'pposed to! Apollo: (This guy doesn't know when to give up.) Mr. Filch. Someone even circled the match. It was you, right? Filch: Yipes! Apollo: Not only that, you even told me you watched it. You said, and I quote: \"It was a complete disaster.\" Filch: Hrrrgh! Apollo: So, do you admit to slacking off?! Filch: Y-Y-You can't trick me with your rudy poo lawyer talk! I'm one of them professional-types, too! I can do double-duty, watching TV and the foyer at the same time! Apollo: (The only thing Filch can claim to be a professional of is \"professional thief\"...) Judge: Mr. Justice. You would have this court believe the witness was slacking off? Apollo: That's correct. He claims to have been watching TV and the foyer at the same time. But that's nothing but a bald-faced lie! Judge: Bald, you say? But I'M not the one who's lying! Perhaps you meant the witness, Mr. Justice? And in that case, let's see what evidence you can offer. You claim Mr. Filch is lying about watching TV and the foyer simultaneously. Now, prove it. Present Foyer Diagram Apollo: Leads to: \"Please take a look at the direction the TV is facing in this diagram.\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: This piece of evidence here clearly exposes Mr. Filch's lie. Judge: Hm? How does that prove anything? Apollo: Oh, it, um... (Whoops! Way off on that one!) Heh heh, sorry. Don't know what I was thinking. Judge: Yes, well, I have moments like that myself. Apollo: (Whew, looks like he'll let this one slide.) Judge: But random guesses and speculation must be punished! Apollo: Yargh! Athena: Apollo! We should think about how Mr. Filch was when he was watching TV! Apollo: Please, lemme try that one again! Judge: The defense will look before they leap this time. So, what do you have for us, Mr. Justice? Leads back to: \"You claim Mr. Filch is lying about watching TV and the foyer simultaneously. Now, prove it.\" Apollo: Please take a look at the direction the TV is facing in this diagram. Now, unless Mr. Filch has eyes where his right ear should be... ...I'd think it would be impossible to watch the foyer entrance and the TV at the same time. Judge: Why, yes! Someone watching TV there couldn't possibly see the entrance! Apollo: Exactly. And that means, Mr. Filch... ...you were slacking off and were NOT watching the foyer as you claim! Filch: Yiiipes! The bag's outta the cat! Er, I mean, other way 'round! Judge: Order! Order! Order!!! But Mr. Justice, is Mr. Filch's less-than-stellar work ethic relevant to this case? Apollo: It's very relevant, because while he was slacking off watching TV... ...there really could've been a Tenma Taro impersonator in the foyer! Blackquill: Apollo: What now?! Blackquill: Granted, this tanuki was lax in his duties, but he still had the foyer entrance covered. Apollo: What are you talking about? Blackquill: .........This. Apollo: Um... I'm not a mind reader. Ack! Blackquill: Auditory sense. His eyes may have been slacking off, but his ears were still hard at work. Right, tanuki? Filch: ...They were? ............Er, I mean, yes! Yes they were! Apollo: But you already admitted to slacking off. Now you say you weren't? Filch: My eyes might be lazy, but my ears ain't. I woulda heard anyone in the foyer, eh-heh. Ya see, the foyer floor and stairway get all creaky squeaky when someone walks on 'em! Creak, creak, creak! Loud enough to wake the dead, I reckon! Apollo: So, you're saying you didn't hear anybody walk by? Filch: Yep! My ears were working fulltime. So, who's the liar now, ya no-good shyster! Apollo: A lying thief calling me a shyster. This HAS to be the low point of my fledgling career... Filch: Gotta hand it to ya, Mr. Blackquill, sir, ya really are something else, eh-heh heh! I mean, ya don't miss a thing. And them bags under yer eyes? They're darker than mine! Blackquill: Fair warning, Mr. Filch. Taka is particularly fond of tanuki. Should you lie to this court again, you may suddenly find yourself on the menu. Filch: Yiiiiiipes! Please don't eat me, Mr. Taka, sir! Judge: The witness will henceforth testify truthfully under penalty of painful bird attacks! And with that in mind, the court requests that the witness revise his testimony accordingly. Witness Testimony -- Ears Working Overtime -- Filch: It's true, I was watching a pro wrestling match on the office TV. My eyes mighta been slacking off, but my ears? They were working overtime. The floor there's all creaky squeaky-like. No way I woulda missed someone walking by. So ya see, there weren't no Tenma Taro in the foyer. Blackquill: Superstition is the religion of feeble minds. Understand? A simple, rational explanation is best. Forget yokai, demons, and such. We must use common sense, for lacking that, our entire world would be but upside-down. Apollo: (Says the convict prosecutor who is totally a sign of the end times for the legal world.) Filch: And besides, if there were any yokai roaming about, I'd nab 'em 'n' sell 'em to the zoo! Athena: I wonder whether Jinxie was just seeing things. Apollo: That seems to be the general consensus, but I'm sticking to my guns. Athena: But if we can't prove she saw Tenma Taro, the mayor's sure to be convicted! Apollo: Then we'd better hope my guns fire bullets, not BBs... Judge: The defense may cross-examine the witness. Cross Examination -- Ears Working Overtime -- Filch: It's true, I was watching a pro wrestling match on the office TV. Press Apollo: Apollo: You ARE paid for your work, aren't you? So, how do you justify watching TV on the job? Filch: A-A-Arrgghh! B-B-B-But...! It ain't easy being me! I mean, I can't watch TV when we have visitors and there's no way to record stuff! Apollo: (Sorry, am I supposed to be consoling you over your first-world problems?) Athena: If those are his only problems, he should consider himself lucky. Apollo: I guess pro wrestling's serious business to Mr. Filch. Filch: My eyes mighta been slacking off, but my ears? They were working overtime. Press Apollo: Apollo: You lied earlier about taking your guard duty seriously, didn't you? Filch: Oh, uh, that? Ain't no harm in bending the truth a little, right? Blackquill: Listen to me, you little tanuki. Lie again and Taka shall feast upon that forked tongue of yours. Taka: Screech! Filch: Yiiipes! Sorry! Just lemme keep my tongue! Apollo: (At least leave it until we get the truth out of him, in any case.) Blackquill: You were negligent in your duties, were you not? Filch: Yes, sir, I was sir! But it ain't like that... Filch: The floor there's all creaky squeaky-like. No way I woulda missed someone walking by. Press Apollo: Apollo: So, you have pretty good ears, Mr. Filch? Filch: As good as they come, I'd say. Ain't nothin' to hear a creaky floor. Plus, that Tenma Taro makes a sound when he goes by. It's like a jingle jangle. Apollo: Jingle jangle? How does he do that? Filch: It's that staff o' his. That's what jingle jangles. Athena: What's he talking about, Apollo? Apollo: Beats me, but I guess Tenma Taro has a staff that makes noise. Athena: Come to think of it, didn't Jinxie mention something like that, too? She said she saw Tenma Taro holding a staff-like object that made a jangly sound. Apollo: I guess that's the source of the noise then... Judge: Well, Mr. Justice? Mr. Filch says Tenma Taro \"jingle jangles.\" Would you consider that vital information? Very important Apollo: Extremely vital! I request that it be added to his testimony! Adds statement \"If Tenma Taro was to pass by, his staff woulda gone jingle jangle.\" Not so important Apollo: (Doesn't seem particularly important to me.) No, Your Honor. I don't think it's of any importance. Judge: Very well. The witness may continue with his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press (after adding statement) Apollo: Apollo: Could someone walk by without making a sound? Filch: Nope, not even a ninja. That's 'cause even the tiniest mouse makes that floor creak, eh-heh. Real creaky squeaky, it is! Blackquill: I can vouch for the tanuki's keen ears. He came running from across the building the moment Fool Bright dropped his wallet. And true to his name, Filch filched it before Mr. Less-Than-Bright knew what happened. Apollo: That's some scary good hearing. Filch: Wads o' cash or expensive shoes on the pavement... Sounds like that don't get by ol' Filch's ears. Got years o' practice, eh-heh heh. Athena: Remind me not to bring anything of value to the manor next time. Apollo: The sound of shoes makes sense, but wads of cash? What does that sound like? ...Anyway, it sounds like they need to hire somebody to take care of their caretaker. Filch: If Tenma Taro was to pass by, his staff woulda gone jingle jangle. Press Apollo: Apollo: So, Tenma Taro's staff makes a distinctive sound? Filch: Yep, like a jingle and a jangle. Athena: Wait, Jinxie said something like that. Something about Tenma Taro making a jangly sound. Apollo: Hmmm... I think we're missing something here, but I can't quite put a finger on it. (Perhaps I should take a look at the Court Record again...) Present Yokai Legend Scroll Apollo: Leads to: \"Tenma Taro's staff would make a jangly sound, you say?\" Filch: So ya see, there weren't no Tenma Taro in the foyer. Press Apollo: Apollo: Please tell the court, what did Jinxie see if not Tenma Taro? Filch: She's always going on about seeing this yokai or that. Just an active imagination, I reckon. She won't even come near me 'cause she thinks I'm some sorta tanuki monster! Athena: Can't say I blame her. Apollo: So, Mr. Filch, you'd chalk it up to a child's active imagination? Filch: Yep. No Tenma Taro or anyone else got in or outta Kyubi Manor on my watch. Athena: Apollo, what could this mean? Do you think Jinxie was just seeing things? Apollo: Well, if that's the case, the details she provided were pretty impressive. But if we're to continue believing Jinxie's statement... Athena: We'll have to uncover Filch's lie? Apollo: Right, or.... find out why he can't tell the truth. Apollo: Tenma Taro's staff would make a jangly sound, you say? Well, I'm going to say that your story doesn't add up. Judge: Is there something the defense would like to share with the court? Apollo: Mr. Filch, you say that you didn't see Tenma Taro on the day of the incident. Why then, did you assume just now that Tenma Taro would be holding a staff? Filch: Huh? Apollo: You see, the Tenma Taro Jinxie saw held a staff in his hands. And she described its sound just like you did -- as a kind of jangly sound. Filch: Yeah, so he was holding a staff. What's yer point? Apollo: Apollo: The point is that Tenma Taro doesn't use a staff. Not normally. Filch: What are you talking about? Apollo: You see, this is the only known document depicting Tenma Taro. Is there a staff in that picture, Mr. Filch? Judge: You're right! There's no staff! Not even a cane or a walking stick! Filch: Ack! Judge: So, the question is, why does the witness think Tenma Taro uses a staff? Apollo: I believe the answer will overturn the prosecution's case on the most basic level! Blackquill: .........Well now, this IS getting interesting. Judge: All right, Mr. Justice, it's time to show the court where you're going with this. Please tell the court why Mr. Filch believes Tenma Taro carries a staff. The scroll is wrong Apollo: Maybe the scroll is incorrect. There could be an older drawing that shows Tenma Taro with a staff. And Mr. Filch could have seen that. Blackquill: Hmph. If that were the case... ...then the fact that the witness believes Tenma Taro had a staff would not be an issue. Apollo: Oh, in that case, I retract my previous statement. Judge: Not so fast, Mr. Justice. You must be held accountable for your flights of fancy! Apollo: Argh! Athena: Ouch. A legal smack down... Apollo: (Filch believes Tenma Taro has a staff... ...despite the fact that Tenma Taro has never been drawn that way! So how could he have possibly known about the staff?) Judge: Let's try that again, Mr. Justice. Leads back to: \"Please tell the court why Mr. Filch believes Tenma Taro carries a staff.\" He actually saw Tenma Taro Leads to: \"Mr. Filch actually saw Tenma Taro right after the crime occurred!\" Filch is a scatterbrain Apollo: Mr. Filch obviously has a few screws loose. So, it's no surprise he would make a mistake like that! Filch: Now, hold it right there! As caretaker o' Kyubi Manor, I keep every screw nice 'n' tight! Apollo: (I rest my case.) Judge: With an assertion like that, this court wonders whether the defense has a screw loose, too. Here's a penalty to make sure you keep your screws in tighter next time. Apollo: (Filch believes Tenma Taro has a staff... ...despite the fact that Tenma Taro has never been drawn that way! So how could he have possibly known about the staff?) Judge: Let's try that again, Mr. Justice. Leads back to: \"Please tell the court why Mr. Filch believes Tenma Taro carries a staff.\" Apollo: Mr. Filch actually saw Tenma Taro right after the crime occurred! That's the only way he could possibly know about the staff! Filch: B-B-Busted again! Blackquill: Bloody hell! You duplicitous little--! Apollo: (Yes! How'd that feel, Blackquill? Not so fun when you're on the receiving end of the blade, is it!) Admit it, Mr. Filch! You DID see Tenma Taro that day, didn't you? Filch: Um... Uhhhhhh... Apollo: Well?! Filch: I'm beggin' ya! Please don't make me say it! Apollo: But you clearly did see Tenma Taro! Stop stalling and testify to that fact! Filch: No can do! No way, no how! You ain't got no idea how terrifying he can be! Apollo: ...He? (Mr. Filch still won't admit seeing Tenma Taro, even though everyone already knows he did. The question now is, why?) Athena: Mr. Filch is scared to death! Apollo: Is that why he can't admit the truth? Athena: Hmm... Come to think of it... Jinxie: They say you must not gaze upon Tenma Taro. But in the event that you do look... ...and then tell anyone what you saw, Tenma Taro will claim your soul. Athena: Jinxie wouldn't admit to seeing Tenma Taro after hearing about the village superstitions. She said that if she told anyone that she had seen Tenma Taro, he'd claim her soul. Apollo: Wait, you think Filch believes that, too? Filch: Ah! So Mister Big-Time, City-Slicker Lawyer has heard about 'em?! Them old village superstitions? Judge: Will the defense please explain what the witness is talking about? Apollo: The people of Nine-Tails Vale believe some pretty strange things. And their superstitions may be the reason our witness here can't admit the truth... ...the truth that he really did see Tenma Taro. Filch: D-Darn straight, that's why! It's all right here! Apollo: Ignoring the superstitions will cost you your soul? Filch: See?! That's why us folks in Nine-Tails Vale can't talk about seeing Tenma Taro! Village Superstitions added to the Court Record. Apollo: That clears up one mystery. The killer took advantage of the superstitions by wearing a Tenma Taro costume. They knew that that way no one could talk about him, so it was as if he never existed! The defense holds that this Tenma Taro impersonator is the true killer! Judge: Whaaat?! Blackquill: Blackquill: Hmph! Superstitions, you say? What kind of a fool would actually believe such rubbish? And would that using some silly fairy tale could so easily expose the culprit. (Changed from [And would that using some silly fairy tale so easily expose the culprit.] in the original release) You'll need to come up with a more rational, common-sense explanation than that! Apollo: Apollo: Your common sense seems awfully narrow-minded to me, Prosecutor Blackquill! Blackquill: Blackquill: Try living in my world of narrow cells, mortal danger, and dark, sleepless nights! There is no lack of superstitions in the clink, but few are those who truly believe in them! Apollo: Apollo: Well, the village superstitions are real enough to the people of Nine-Tails Vale! A life or death superstition might even make you a believer! Blackquill: ............Grr! Raaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwrrrrrrrrrrrr! Judge: Order! Order, I say!!! Blackquill: You fool of a tanuki! Two times now, your lies have cost me! Filch: S-S-Sorry, sorry! I promise not to do it again! Blackquill: ...Taka, my fine-feathered friend, have at him! Filch: Yiiipes! He's gonna eat me alive! Head for the hills! Apollo: Ah! He took off. Judge: B-B-Bailiff! What are you waiting for?! After him -- and with your fastest men! Athena: That's certainly not something you see every day. Judge: Well, it would seem a new and important fact has come to light. A third party disguised as the yokai Tenma Taro was at the scene. And now we have two witnesses who can attest to that fact. Any objections, Prosecutor Blackquill? Blackquill: .............................. .............................. Apollo: Uh-oh... Athena: Wha--?! Judge: Huh? ............Ahhhhhh! Apollo: His shackles...! Urk! (I... I'm too young to die!) Blackquill: Justice-dono, long has it been since I've been forced to draw my blade. You had best say your prayers. Judge: Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek! D-Detective, do something! Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Have no fear, Fulbright is here! When the going gets tough, the champion of justice gets going! Apollo: Apollo: Then get going, already, before he kills us! Fulbright: Oh, but I stand in awe of Simon Blackquill, for it is his sense of justice that set him free! Judge: Objection! Objection! I object to Detective Fulbright's definition of justice! Blackquill: Blackquill: Hmph. I'm not in the habit of cutting down unarmed cowards. Judge: Oh, w-well, in that case, Prosecutor Blackquill, can I ask you to, umm, you know... Apollo: (I think the judge forgot he's in charge here.) Blackquill: So, Justice-dono's assertion is this: Tenma Taro is the real killer, not Mayor Tenma. According to him, there was a yokai at the scene of the crime. Apollo: Right! And that yokai, or rather, whoever was impersonating him, killed Alderman Kyubi! Blackquill: Apollo: Ack! Blackquill: Care to explain why Jinxie, being the first to discover the murder... ...did not see your alleged killer yokai there in the Fox Chamber? Apollo: What? (He's right, she said nothing about Tenma Taro being in the Fox Chamber...) Blackquill: .........Hmph. Let me enlighten you. That little scamp heard a dying scream right before she opened the chamber door. Apollo: ...And your point is...? Blackquill: Upon opening the door, she found a freshly skewed murder victim -- the alderman... ...and the homicidal maniac who had killer him -- the mayor. Apollo: No, there must've been someone dressed up like Tenma-- Aagh! Blackquill: Then why does that little scamp claim not to have seen a yokai in the Fox Chamber? Judge: Hmm... Considering her father is accused of murder... ...surely she would've mentioned any third party that might have been in the room. Apollo: I don't understand. Why didn't she see Tenma Taro inside the Fox Chamber? Blackquill: Hmph. There is but one way to find out: Ask Jinxie Tenma whether she saw your killer yokai at the scene of the crime. Apollo: Uh-oh... Blackquill: The final battle draws nigh. Only one of us will leave here alive. Heh heh heh. Long has my blade thirsted for blood. At long last, it shall be sated! Apollo: Wait, this IS still a trial, right? Blackquill: Show me what you're truly capable of, Justice-dono! Judge: V-Very well, then. Both parties no doubt need some time to regroup... ...so the court will take a 10-minute recess in order to-- Aagh! Blackquill: ...Three minutes. Judge: I-I'm sorry, but... a three-minute recess? Blackquill: Just so. Plenty of time if your destination of intent is the loo. Judge: The loo? You mean the bathroom? Apollo: (Sheesh... At least include enough time to wash our hands.) Blackquill: See that you take no more than three minutes. All latecomers will be punished. Judge: Y-Yes, sir! I hereby declare a three-minute recess before the battle begins! Athena: I declare Prosecutor Blackquill the winner of this round of Simon Says... Apollo: Doesn't bode well for us if the prosecutor is running the show, does it...? April 18, 10:40 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Athena: He busted out of his shackles. Apollo: Yeah, what was that about? Guess they don't make shackles like they used to. Athena: Better be careful, Apollo. You've really brought out the samurai in him. Especially after you proved there was a Tenma Taro impersonator at the manor. Apollo: What's with that guy and the whole samurai act, anyway? Tenma: Such fine swordsmanship... That is no mere act. Mr. Justice, it's high time I challenge this jailhouse prosecutor to a duel! Apollo: No, wait! Let's save the dueling until after we prove your innocence! Tenma: Hrmmm... I suppose it could wait till later. Apollo: (*sigh* Does ANYONE remember we're conducting a trial here?) Athena, I'm gonna go wash up. Athena: Remember what Blackquill said, Apollo. Don't be late! April 18, 10:43 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 4 Judge: Now then, I believe our next witness is Ms. Jinxie Tenma, a maid at Kyubi Manor. I believe we can proceed now -- if the witness is ready, that is. Jinxie: N-N-Nurarihyon! Leader of the One Hundred Demons! He really does exist! Athena: Wow... That is one well-polished tray... Judge: The witness will show her face while in court, or her testimony will be inadmissible. Jinxie: Eek! Judge: What is it, my child?! Jinxie: Be gone, Nurarihyon, Leader of the One Hundred Demons! Judge: Ho ho ho. You think I'm a yokai? Well, I WAS once known as a judicial monster of sorts. The beast of the bar, the demon of due process, if you will. Jinxie: Eek! My charm has no effect... Athena: The demon of due process? Not sure I can see that one... Blackquill: .........Now, you little scamp. Jinxie: Yes? Blackquill: I trust you know why you're here. Jinxie: .........B-B-Bags. Blackquill: Bags? Oh, that tricksy tanuki? Try the noodle stand. And go enjoy a big bowl of tanuki tail noodles why you're at it. Apollo: (Everyone's a comedian.) Jinxie: No... I meant YOUR bags. The ones under your eyes. You must have trouble sleeping. (Changed from [No... I meant YOUR bags. The one's [sic] under your eyes. You must have trouble sleeping.] in the original release) Here. This charm will keep Azukiarai away. Blackquill: Azukiarai? The yokai that washes azuki beans? The only thing needing washing will be your father's neck before I take his head clean off! Jinxie: Azukiarai often keeps people up at night with the noise he makes washing beans. But if you stick this charm on your forehead, you won't hear him anymore. Blackquill: .........I-Is that so? Well, thank you. Athena: Looks like Prosecutor Blackquill got more than he bargained for. Apollo: They're bad enough alone, but together, those two are just plain creepy. Judge: Your testimony, if you please, Ms. Tenma. Specifically, whether or not you saw Tenma Taro when you discovered the crime scene. Witness Testimony -- What Jinxie Saw -- Jinxie: Did I see Tenma Taro in the Fox Chamber? Well, when I opened the door... *shiver* I saw... I saw... Yes! Now I remember! Y-Y-Yokai! Yokai! Right there in that room! Apollo: So there was a yokai at the scene of the crime! Jinxie: *shiver* Uh-huh, lots... and lots of them! Apollo: Wait, more than one yokai? Did Tenma Taro happen to be among them? Jinxie: I don't know! I just don't know! All I know is the room was swimming in yokai! Kasha, Nurikabe, Setotaisho! Eeek! They were all there! Judge: Well this is an unexpected turn of events. We've gone from no yokai to a flood of them. Blackquill: This is ludicrous. You would have this court listen to this delusional little scamp's testimony?! Apollo: Yurk! Athena: Athena: Your Honor! I believe her memory is simply clouded by fear! But a quick therapy session should ease her mind. With the court's permission, of course. Judge: What a fabulous idea! Please proceed, Ms. Cykes. Apollo: You sure you know what you're doing, Athena? Athena: She's obviously not herself. The trauma of discovering that crime scene... ...and fear of testifying have her dazed and confused. A regular ball of confusion! But my analytical psychology-based approach should be able to help. Judge: Any objections, Prosecutor Blackquill? Shall we let Ms. Cykes proceed? Blackquill: ............Hmph. It makes no difference to me. Do as you will, but I doubt we shall get any viable testimony. She'd be better served by bearing witness to the sword skills I forged in a distant land! Athena: Hmph! I'll show you! Jinxie: Did I see Tenma Taro in the Fox Chamber? Jinxie: Well, when I opened the door... *shiver* I saw... I saw... Jinxie: Yes! Now I remember! Jinxie: Y-Y-Yokai! Yokai! Right there in that room! Athena: Found something! Hmm... Looks like an out-of-control emotion. Apollo: Um, Athena? What exactly are we looking at here? Athena: Oh, this? It's one of Widget's functions. Right here you can see images and emotions extracted from the witness's voice. Apollo: Whoa! You mean that little thing can do all this?! Widget: Pretty cool, huh?! Apollo: (And here I thought it was just some kids' toy.) Athena: Unfortunately, all I'm getting is an overflow error right now. See how Sad is brightly lit there at the bottom left? She's under an uncontrollable amount of distress, which is masking her other emotions. It seems the sheer terror she experienced has made her a confused mess. Apollo: So all those yokai she thinks she saw are a product of rampant emotions? Athena: Yes, that's right. Her fear has instilled in her hallucinations and false memories. She's seeing normal everyday objects as monsters in her mind. It's a form of schizophrenic hallucination brought on by emotional trauma. And the trauma in Jinxie's case is fear. Apollo: (So she was, and still is, seeing ordinary objects as yokai...) Athena: We'll have to find the root cause of her extreme fear before I can treat it. Now, let's see... Apollo, can you point out the yokai on the wheel of fire? She seems particularly terrified of that one. Start by pressing Probe ([L / LB / Q]). (Changed from [Start by tapping Probe (L) on the bottom screen.] in the original release) Next, point to what's causing Jinxie's out-of-control emotion. Finally, hit Probe again ([X / Y / R]) to try and get to the heart of the matter! (Changed from [Finally, tap Probe again (X) to try and get to the heart of the matter!] in the original release) Apollo: (Okay, let's give this a try.) Jinxie: Y-Y-Yokai! Yokai! Right there in that room! Probe Cat Monster on a Wheel of Fire Apollo: Leads to: \"Jinxie, what's the name for that yokai on a wheel of fire?\" Apollo: Jinxie, what's the name for that yokai on a wheel of fire? Jinxie: Th-That's... a Kasha, a yokai that steals the bodies of the recently deceased! I bet it came to steal the alderman's! Apollo: It's almost creepy how well that fits the actual situation. Athena: Exactly! It's a form of hallucination where the patient can't see things for what they are! There must be something at the scene of the crime that she's mistaking for a Kasha! Apollo, you need to point out what she thought was a yokai on a wheel of fire! Apollo: (Hmm... I think I know the answer now.) Jinxie, that wasn't a Kasha you saw. Could you have possibly mistaken this for a Kasha? Present chandelier Apollo: Leads to: \"The light fixture?\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: This is what you mistook for a Kasha! Athena: What? That thing? Apollo: No? Jinxie: I'd never mistake that for a Kasha! Apollo: Really? Athena: You have to consider what a Kasha looks like, Apollo. Think, brightly blazing wheel near the ceiling. Apollo: (Okay... Let's give this another try.) Leads back to: \"Could you have possibly mistaken this for a Kasha?\" Jinxie: The light fixture? Apollo: This one right here. It has a flame design and is up there on the ceiling. There was never a yokai on a wheel of fire. The Kasha you saw was just a light fixture! Jinxie: Eeeeeek! Athena: That's one memory back to normal! Nice job! Now that you've got the hang of it, it should be a cinch to point out the rest! Apollo: Jinxie! What about this white wall-like monster? Jinxie: Th-That's Nurikabe! It's a wall monster that blocks your way or leads you astray! Apollo: That's no yokai, Jinxie! It's a folding screen! Jinxie: Eeeeek! Apollo: And this racoon dog isn't a tanuki monster, it's just the statue of one! Jinxie: Eeeeeeeeek! Apollo: And look! These are just coffee cups. And this right here? It's nothing more than a fox statue! Jinxie: Eeeeeeeeeeeek! I don't know what I was thinking! NOISE LEVEL50% Athena: You did it, Apollo! Her extreme fear is under control now! Jinxie: It was all just my eyes playing tricks on me. There weren't any yokai after all! Athena: See! A clear-cut statement. That's the power of my psychology and your intuition, Apollo! And just like we thought, there never really were any yokai in the Fox Chamber! Blackquill: .........Right. There never really were any yokai there. So, the defense is asserting the exact opposite of their original assertion? Apollo: ............Wait. Um, Jinxie? What about Tenma Taro? Jinxie: There wasn't anyone there dressed up as Tenma Taro, or any other yokai, either. I remember it clearly now. Apollo: You've-- Athena: Gotta-- Apollo: Be-- Jokiiiiiiiiiing!!! Judge: Order! Order in the court! Apollo: I think we just dug our own grave. Blackquill: Allow me to push you on in. It's the least I can do. Apollo: Nooo...! Athena: Apollo! Can I interrupt your freak-out for just a minute? I'm still picking up some noise! It's an unexpected emotion! Apollo: Does that mean Jinxie hasn't remembered everything yet? Athena: Exactly! We should be able to get something else out of her! I'll enter the new information we have and run an update! Jinxie: Did I see Tenma Taro in the Fox Chamber? Jinxie: I was so scared when I entered the room... Jinxie: ... my legs gave out and I fell to the floor. Pinpoint Sad marker Apollo: Leads to: \"The amount of fear you felt is rather low despite your legs having given out from fright.\" Jinxie: There in the Fox Chamber I saw... *shiver* Jinxie: ...the alderman dead on a table and papa collapsed in a chair. Jinxie: Nobody else was there! And that includes Tenma Taro! Apollo: Wait. What am I supposed to do? Athena: Try to find the emotions that contradict her statements. Apollo: So if I find a contradictory emotion, I should point it out? Athena: That's right. But it's not just contradictory emotions you should look out for. You should also keep an eye out for sudden changes in an emotion's intensity. Her emotions might get stronger or weaker as you move from statement to statement. It's important to compare how the same emotion changes throughout the testimony. Apollo: Contradictory emotions and changes in intensity... Okay, I'll give it a shot. Apollo: The amount of fear you felt is rather low despite your legs having given out from fright. Could something have lessened your fear? Jinxie: Actually, I did experience a sudden burst of courage at that moment. Apollo: You did? Where did it come from? Jinxie: Um... uh... Let me think... Oh, it was Mama. I suddenly felt as if she was there with me. Athena: Okay, I'll enter, \"Sudden burst of courage.\" Now, let's see... Ah! Look! Apollo, the noise is all gone! Jinxie seems to have remembered everything now! NOISE LEVEL0%BYE BYE Apollo: A sudden burst of courage... Now where could that have come from? Jinxie, was there something that gave you a sudden burst of courage? Jinxie: Um, yes there was, b-but... um... I, uh... I realized I had done something naughty when I thought about it later. Athena: Any idea what could have given Jinxie that courage? Apollo: Well, there IS one piece of evidence that comes to mind. I wonder if she saw something like it at the scene of the crime. Jinxie, did your sudden burst of courage have anything to do with this? Present Nine-Tails Flower Apollo: Leads to: \"Jinxie, you didn't happen to see a Nine-Tails Flower there at the scene, did you?\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: Could it have been this?! Jinxie: ...Huh? Apollo: (Oh... That's not encouraging...) Athena: The evidence you presented seems to have produced confusion rather than courage. Apollo: Guess I got that one wrong. Athena: Well, if at first you don't succeed... You know the rest, Apollo! Leads back to: \"Jinxie, did your sudden burst of courage have anything to do with this?\" Apollo: Jinxie, you didn't happen to see a Nine-Tails Flower there at the scene, did you? Jinxie: Ah! The demon lawyer strikes again. I can't hide anything from you. I found a small case with a picture of a Nine-Tails Flower on it. I liked it so much, I kept it! Apollo: You what?! You can't remove evidence from a crime scene! Judge: That's right, young lady. Removing evidence is a big no-no. Now, the witness will produce said evidence this instant! Jinxie: S-Sorry, sorry... Judge: Hmm... It does seem to be some sort of case. Oh, look, something slid out. It... appears to be a key! Blackquill: Might I have a look, Your Baldness? Hmmm......... Ah! This is none other than the master key to Kyubi Manor. Judge: Are you certain of this, Prosecutor Blackquill? Blackquill: It matches the serial number of the key that went missing after the murder. Apollo: A master key... that went missing? (Why don't I like the sound of that...?) Blackquill: Our little scamp here has stumbled upon an article of unimaginable consequence. Apollo: That's a little melodramatic, don't you think? Blackquill: Hmph. Heed these words, for I shall say them but once. The sole key to the Fox Chamber has been in this little scamp's constant possession. Ergo, she was the sole person who could use it before, during, and after the murder. Which leaves the master key as the only other key that could have opened the chamber. But this master key... ...was found in a room that had been locked by this girl. Apollo: And your point is? Blackquill: Until Jinxie Tenma opened the Fox Chamber with her key... ...the room had been locked tight from the outside world. And there was no one else in there, save the victim and his killer. I trust you have figured it out for yourself by now. A killer other than Mayor Tenma himself would be utterly inconceivable! Apollo: Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Athena: Athena: How... could... this... happen...?! Nnrrrrrrgh...! Judge: The defense's assistant will refrain from growling her frustrations! Apollo: A-Athena, are you all right? Athena: Ugh! I know Mayor Tenma's innocent, but there's nothing we can do! Widget: This sucks! Blackquill: ...Cykes-dono. Allow me to put you out of your misery. Athena: Can I decline your offer? Blackquill: Abandon your client and your misplaced faith in him. Let the relief of a clear head and a clean conscious come rushing in. That will make the inevitable guilty verdict far easier to accept. Apollo: (Great. Now he's playing Simon Says with us! Well, he's not going to fool us with his stupid mind games! (Changed from [Well, he's not going fool [sic] us with his stupid mind games!] in the original release)) Athena, don't fall for his tricks! Athena: Uuh... Now I'M the one who's dazed and confused. I can't even think straight. Apollo: Hey, are you all right?! (She fell right into his trap!) Blackquill: Now, I suggest you make a mad dash from the courtroom and into the wild blue yonder. Only by running shall your mind be cleared and your conscious cleansed. Athena: All right, I'll be back in 10! Apollo: Apollo: Stay with me, Athena! Don't let yourself be twisted by that samurai! Athena: Apollo? Judge: Mr. Justice? ...I heard the word objection, but what is it you object to? Apollo: Huh...? Oh, right... (That objection was more of a reflex than anything else... ...though I was hoping something would come to me while I was trying to stop Athena...) Judge: The court is waiting, Mr. Justice. Though as it stands now... ...I'll be forced to declare your client guilty and your legal skills suspect if this is it. Now, do you have anything that could overturn the prosecution's case? Apollo: Um, well... Actually, I do! I'm Apollo Justice, and I'm fine! Athena: Apollo! You do have something more than your Chords of Steel, don't you? Apollo: Not really, but we'll be fine! Athena: B-B-But...! Apollo: (I've got absolutely nothing, but that's never stopped me before! I have to explain how the real killer could have escaped that locked room. Because it's all over if I don't!) Athena: Apollo, this calls for a new approach! Try to think outside the box! Apollo: Or in this case, inside the box! (And what a doozy that locked room is, too.) Judge: Well, Mr. Justice? Do you have anything that can counter the prosecution's argument? Apollo: Y-You bet I do! The real killer must have escaped from the locked room one way or another! Blackquill: Vague conjecture shall only earn you a taste of my blade, Justice-dono. Apollo: Err... (Time to do or die, literally!) Judge: The defense will now explain how it would be possible to escape the locked room. Athena: Y-You sure about this, Apollo? Can you really explain what happened? Apollo: I-I'm fine! We just need to think this whole escaping-a-locked-room thing over from the beginning! So... let's see. If the killer had escaped... ...how could they have done so? Athena: The choices are pretty limited. The room has a window, but... ...it doesn't open wide enough for anyone to get through, and there's a sheer cliff outside. As for the air vent... ...it's up too high and there's nothing you could stand on to reach it. And needless to say... ...the Forbidden Chamber wouldn't open no matter what we did, so that's out. Apollo: Yeah, that's why we gotta keep the solution simple. Like they say, simple is best. (Changed from [Yeah, that [sic] why we gotta keep the solution simple. Like they say, simple is best.] in the original release) We need to rule out all of the absolutely impossible escape routes. Then, whatever's left just might lead us to how the Fox Chamber was compromised! Your Honor! The defense proposes that the killer escaped through here! Present Fox Chamber door Apollo: Leads to: \"The hallway door? Well, yes, I suppose that would be the only way out.\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Judge: Hmm... And just how did the killer escape through there, Mr. Justice? Your reasoning skills seem as questionable as your proposed escape route. Apollo: Ack! I wish I could escape right now. Judge: I'm afraid there's no escaping a penalty for your random guessing, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Um, could I try that one again? Leads back to: \"Your Honor! The defense proposes that the killer escaped through here!\" Judge: The hallway door? Well, yes, I suppose that would be the only way out. Blackquill: .........Hmph. It would appear you've already forgotten. The only available key until Jinxie Tenma came on scene was within that locked room. How would one exit the Fox Chamber, and then lock it without a key? Hmm? Apollo: I should've seen this coming... Athena: Remember Apollo, keep it simple. Apollo: Simple, right. I could understand if the killer had exited the room with the key, but... Judge: Well, Mr. Justice? The prosecution has some fine Japanese steel waiting unless you explain yourself quickly. Apollo: I-I'm fine! I can explain myself! The reason the Fox Chamber's hallway door was locked was because... Tenma locked it from inside Apollo: Mayor Tenma locked it himself after the killer fled the scene... ...just in case the killer decided to return. That would explain why the room was locked! Judge: Yes, I see... Then again, wouldn't Mayor Tenma have mentioned that himself? Apollo: Oh, uh, maybe it slipped his mind because of that blow to his head? Aaaaaagh! Blackquill: ...Hmph. I have already considered and investigated such possibilities. Apollo: You have? Blackquill: The mayor's fingerprints were not found on the door or its doorknob. The only fingerprints found belonged to the alderman. Ergo, the mayor did not so much as touch the door. Apollo: (Oops.) Okay, then how about... Leads back to: \"The reason the Fox Chamber's hallway door was locked was because...\" It locked on its own Apollo: Maybe the door closed accidentally... on its own. (Changed from [Maybe the door closed accidently [sic]... on its own.] in the original release) Ack! Blackquill: The killer will never be identified if we attribute key moments to mere chance. Perhaps that spear just happened to fly off of the wall and impale the alderman, too. And perhaps that sedative just happened to make its way into his coffee. Mere chance could explain any number of things. Apollo: Right, um... next idea, then... Leads back to: \"The reason the Fox Chamber's hallway door was locked was because...\" The perp locked it from outside Leads to: \"What if the door was locked from the outside?\" Apollo: What if the door was locked from the outside? In other words, the killer took the key through the hallway door, then locked it-- Youch! Blackquill: Consider this: The master key was found inside the tightly locked Fox Chamber. Any assertion that the key was removed from that room is a blatant contradiction of fact. Athena: Exiting the room before locking the door WOULD require taking the key outside. But the key was found inside the room, which does seem like a contradiction. Apollo: If only we could explain both. Like, how the key could be inside the room AND be used to lock the door from outside. Judge: Well, let's see if the defense can respond before Prosecutor Blackquill draws his sword. (Changed from [Well, let's see if the defense can response [sic] before Prosecutor Blackquill draws his sword.] in the original release) How could the master key be at the crime scene, despite the room being locked tight? Slipped it in when the door was opened Apollo: Maybe someone threw it in from the hallway when Jinxie opened the door? That would explain-- Aaah! Blackquill: .........Hmph. Perhaps we should ask the little scamp herself. When you opened the Fox Chamber, did you witness anyone throw the master key inside? Jinxie: Sorry. I didn't see anyone else there. Apollo: Oh... Blackquill: What a pity. Or perhaps you intend to accuse the witness of murder? Judge: You leave me no choice. A penalty for random speculation and lack of foresight. Apollo: Ugh. (How could've someone gotten the key into that locked room?) Judge: Let's try that again. Leads back to: \"How could the master key be at the crime scene, despite the room being locked tight?\" Threw it in from outside Leads to: \"What if someone threw it into the room from outside -- you know, something like...\" Changed the lock Apollo: If the door had been rebuilt after the key was placed in the room... ...that would explain how it got there! Judge: Hmm... And the original door? Where did that disappear to? Apollo: Well, I guess it's highly unlikely that the door was rebuilt in the first place, so-- Ack! Judge: Penalty! Apollo: Ugh. (How could've someone gotten the key into that locked room?) Judge: Let's try that again. Leads back to: \"How could the master key be at the crime scene, despite the room being locked tight?\" Apollo: What if someone threw it into the room from outside -- you know, something like... ...go out the hallway door, lock the room, and then toss the key back in through the window. That would explain how the master key could be inside the locked room! Blackquill: ...And where would you throw it from? There is a cliff outside the Fox Chamber's window. Throwing the key in from there is an impossibility. Apollo: .........Oh! Right... Ack! Athena: I wonder if the key could've been tossed in from somewhere other than the window. Apollo: Somewhere other than the window? Hmm... Could the key have been tossed in through somewhere other than the window? Present Air Duct Apollo: Leads to: \"The air vent?\" Present window Apollo: Apollo: I propose the key was tossed in through the window! Blackquill: It seems the defense has developed a case of amnesia. A sheer cliff lies just outside that window. No one tossed in anything through there. Apollo: What if you threw it in from the bottom of the cliff? I bet you could get it in if you threw it as hard as you could? Blackquill: ...Hmph. I'm afraid you would still have no ground to stand on, just as with your case. For you see, a raging river lies at the bottom of that cliff. Judge: A penalty for the amnesia-prone attorney! Apollo: Ugh. (So the key didn't get in through the window. Guess I'd better rethink this.) Leads back to: \"Could the key have been tossed in through somewhere other than the window?\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: I propose the key was tossed in through here! Judge: Hmm... And how would that even be possible? Apollo: Oh, um... Very carefully, Your Honor? Judge: ......... The defense will refrain from tossing around vague answers to key questions. Apollo: Ack! Judge: Let's try that again. How could the key have wound up in that locked room? Apollo: (Well, if it isn't the window, from where else could it have been thrown inside?) Leads back to: \"Could the key have been tossed in through somewhere other than the window?\" Judge: The air vent? Apollo: Yes. The window may be out of the question, but the air vent's not! Athena: Oh, that's right! The Fox Chamber's air duct... ...leads out into the hallway. Apollo: That's right. The real killer entered the air duct from the vent outside the Fox Chamber... ...then dropped the key into the room through the vent inside the chamber! Blackquill: Hrgh! That's preposterous! Athena: Ooh, that explains how the key got in there after it was used to lock the door perfectly! Judge: Mr. Justice! Um... I'm afraid I'm a bit confused... Apollo: Don't worry! I'll explain it so even Your Honor can understand. First, the real killer, disguised as Tenma Taro, murdered the alderman in the Fox Chamber. Then, they fled the room through the hallway door and locked it. Next, they entered the air duct from the vent outside in the hallway. Finally, the killer tossed the key into the room through the air vent in the ceiling there! All that was left to do after that was go back through the duct and flee the manor! Well, Your Honor?! Could that be any clearer?! Judge: Amazing! Even I could follow that! Athena: The judge seems really pleased. Apollo: That explains everything! The real killer was someone dressed up like Tenma Taro. And there WAS someone else other than the mayor and the alderman in that room! Man: Hey, it looks like that lawyer has beaten the jailbird prosecutor! Man: Whoa! That was a total turnabout! Woman: That massive forehead of his seems so much more attractive now! Judge: Order! Order! Order, I say!!! Apollo: Now that I've proved a possible third party, I don't see how our client could be guilty! Blackquill: Blackquill: ..........A valiant effort, Justice-dono, but your final thrust missed its mark. Apollo: Huh? Blackquill: Both that little scamp and the tricksy tanuki saw the yokai after it left the room. But then what? Did that irksome yokai simply go through the foyer and waltz right out the front door? Apollo: Th-That's exactly what happened! The killer fled from the-- Youch! Blackquill: But that is impossible -- without being spotted by the foyer's security camera, that is. The electric eye here would have captured any pesky little yokai trying to escape. However, there is no sign of Tenma Taro anywhere in the security footage. Apollo: Wh-Wh-What?! Blackquill: Save for the foyer entrance, there is no other way to flee the manor, is there? Apollo: I don't feel so good. Athena: Athena: Wait! I believe there IS one other way to escape besides the foyer entrance! There's a large window in the foyer. It's possible to escape through there without being seen by the security camera. Apollo: Hey, you're right! Blackquill: Blackquill: Hmph. Must I point out every crucial detail to the defense? It seems you lack not only brains, but investigative prowess to boot. That is the cliff side of the manor. The only killer escaping that way would be a dead one. Athena: N-Nooooooooon! Apollo: Wait... So the killer didn't escape out the foyer window? Widget: What the heck, right? Blackquill: ....Ha! I suppose your next proposal is the killer sprouted wings and flew off into the sunset? Apollo: (That would mean the killer really was a yokai...) Athena: ...If only we had some sort of evidence that could point to a flying killer. Apollo: Who's saying we don't? (As completely far-fetched as it might be...) Athena: WHAAAT?! You're saying you can prove the killer could fly?! Apollo: Whoa! I thought I was the one with the Chords of Steel! Judge: Oh, I can't wait to hear this. Apollo: Um, Your Honor...? Judge: What evidence do you have that the killer flew away? Present Special Edition Paper Apollo: Leads to: \"Take a look at this special edition paper.\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: This piece of evidence shows that the killer yokai flew through the sky! Blackquill: ............ Apollo: ............ Blackquill: ............ Apollo: Never mind. Lemme try that again. Judge: Mr. Justice! You wouldn't be trying to escape without a penalty, would you?! Apollo: (I know we have some kind of evidence of a flying yokai.) Blackquill: Justice-dono, surrender yourself now or suffer the death of a thousand cuts. Apollo: N-Never! Leads back to: \"What evidence do you have that the killer flew away?\" Apollo: Take a look at this special edition paper. Judge: \"Tenma Taro: Real or Flight of Fancy?\" ...What does this article prove, Mr. Justice? Apollo: The photo in that article was taken shortly after the murder. Maybe the yokai in that photo is the killer shortly after they fled out of the window...? Judge: M-Mr. Justice! You're not seriously suggesting--! Apollo: Oh, I'm serious! I mean, it all adds up! The killer, disguised as Tenma Taro, flew away! You know, by some way or another! Blackquill: Blackquill: It is your brain that has flown the coop. (Changed from [It is your brain that has flow [sic] the coop.] in the original release) That image is naught but trick photography or some other form of artifice. Apollo: Okay, then, how about the Tenma Taro figure Mr. Filch saw? It just vanished into thin air? Blackquill: .........No, there is a rational, common-sense explanation for that. That infernal yokai our tricksy tanuki witnessed never reached the entrance. He -- or should I say she -- turned back before the camera's electric eye. Apollo: ......She? (I don't like where this is going one bit!) Blackquill: Now, the fact that we know the yokai had come from the Fox Chamber... ...means that it was likely either Mayor Tenma or his daughter Jinxie Tenma. However, we know that Mayor Tenma was already unconscious at that time. Apollo: *gulp* (Not good. Not good at all!) Blackquill: Do you understand the gravity of the situation now, Justice-dono? The falsified yokai remnants... ...and the appearance of \"Tenma Taro\" were the work of one individual. And that individual is none other than Jinxie Tenma! Apollo: ............ Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh! Nooooooooooooooooooooooo! Judge: Order! Order! The defense will stop competing for the greatest freak-out ever! Blackquill: The little scamp was, no doubt, simply trying to protect her father. And it's no wonder that her superstitious mind conjured up this mad masquerade. Judge: Prosecutor Blackquill's assertion makes perfect sense to me. It's far more convincing than saying the killer escaped by flying out of the window. Blackquill: Hmph. Did you truly believe this could end any other way? Apollo: (Did we fall right into his trap?) Athena: What do we do now, Apollo? Apollo: Our case no longer stands without a real yokai. If only we had one. Blackquill: Bailiff, seize her! It is time I interrogated her as the samurai of yore would. ???: Apollo: M-Mayor Tenma? Tenma: ......... Blackquill: Hmph. This farce is over. How does it feel, seeing your own daughter accused of a cover-up most foul? Tenma: ......... Tenma Taro's true identity is-- Blackquill: Now, now, Mr. Mayor. It would be futile at this point to claim you were the yokai. After all, you had been knocked out cold by a blow to the skull. Slipping into a yokai costume and roaming about the manor would be all but impossible. Tenma: ......... Blackquill: Consider this well. As it stands, your daughter will be arrested for obstruction of justice. But if you confess, the prosecution would be willing to overlook her little yokai farce. Judge: Confess? The defendant intends to confess?! Apollo: Wait! Athena: Apollo! Prosecutor Blackquill's up to his mind games again! Apollo: Mayor Tenma! No! Don't fall for his twisted words! If you're sent away for murder, Jinxie will be left all alone! Tenma: .........The real killer is... Athena: Mayor Tenma's going to confess unless we do something! Apollo: (But... But I can't prove how the real killer could've flown away...) Tenma: ............ Caw caw-caw-caw! Look upon me and despair, for ripe is the time for my return. Apollo: Hm? (Uh-oh... I should watch what I wish for.) Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! Foolish mortals! I am Tenma Taro, the yokai you seek! Apollo: Um... M-Mayor Tenma? Tenma: Silence! I am Tenma Taro -- freed from the bonds binding me to the Forbidden Chamber! Behold! The return of the Demon King! Apollo: Wh-What the--?! Athena: Demon King...?! Judge: Well then, I think it's time for me to... ...t-take a vacatioooon! The witness will...! Um... He will explain himself! Are you saying you're Tenma Taro, the yokai we've been chasing this whole time? Tenma: Indeed, it is I, Tenma Taro, the one whom you seek -- come to reveal the truth. This child is Tenma Taro, you say? Hah! What nonsense! Apollo: So, Mayor Tenma... is a yokai now? Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! His body is now mine! Judge: So, you're saying that Mayor Tenma is... being possessed by you? And that the yokai that Jinxie Tenma and Phineas Filch saw... ...and the one captured in the newspaper photo... Those were all you? Tenma: The accursed power of these warding charms prevents me from revealing my true form. Apollo: ......... Blackquill: Your Baldness! .........Can this not be interpreted as an admission of guilt?! Judge: Well, a confession by a yokai would be quite unprecedented. Blackquill: Be that as it may, the defense's case has been overturned. Apollo: Huh? What?! Blackquill: You claimed the yokai that little scamp saw was some third party -- the true killer... ...the one who escaped from the locked Fox Chamber, but it was the accused all along. Apollo: Argh! Blackquill: Ironic, is it not? Your yokai turned out to be real in a manner of speaking. For the alderman's killer is none other than Mayor Tenma! And the yokai at the scene? That, too, was Mayor Tenma, or should I say, our dear Tenma Taro! The pieces have all fallen into place. Apollo: H-How so, Prosecutor Blackquill? Blackquill: Hmph. It seems I must spell it out for you. Mayor Tenma killed the alderman in the Fox Chamber -- which was locked at the time. He then removed the warding charms from the Forbidden Chamber's door... ...but then fell unconscious from the blow the alderman had delivered to his head. That's when his daughter Jinxie Tenma stumbled on the scene of the crime. The little scamp fled in terror, whereupon the spirit of Tenma Taro... ...freed at last from the charm's warding effect, took possession of the mayor. The newly freed Tenma Taro then fled from the Fox Chamber. So, you see, the yokai Jinxie Tenma saw was her father possessed by Tenma Taro. Apollo: Apollo: But when we arrived on scene, the mayor was found unconscious! How's that possible if he was supposed to have flown out the foyer window?! Blackquill: Then, what? Do you mean to say the maid of Kyubi Manor, Jinxie Tenma, was Tenma Taro? Apollo: ............Oh. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Tenma: Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! That, too, is easily explained. Flew about for a time did I, but presently tired, I made for the Forbidden Chamber. But alas, exhaustion took me unaware in the Fox Chamber, and I knew no more. Blackquill: Hmph. It would seem the pieces are still in place. Apollo: (Is Blackquill up to his tricks again?) Judge: I-I don't know what to say. Is the defendant a real live...? Man: So that rumor about Mayor Tenma is true? I knew yokai were real! Man: You mean he really did kill the alderman just so he could release Tenma Taro?! Judge: Order! Order!!! Athena: Now he's got everyone in the courtroom believing in yokai! Apollo: It's Simon Says on steroids! He wants to convict our client any way he can -- even if it means blaming a yokai! Blackquill: The proverbial ducks are all in a row. You should now have no qualms about finding the accused guilty, Your Baldness. Judge: Hmm... This is one of the most bizarre cases in my entire career. Otherworldly, in fact. Can yokai even be prosecuted under our legal system? Apollo: Apollo: Mayor Tenma is just pretending to be Tenma Taro to protect his daughter. Plus, I already proved how a third party could have escaped from the locked room! A verdict at this point would be premature! Judge: Hmm... Since both sides have raised valid points, I've no choice but to-- Blackquill: Blackquill: Hmph! This is the dark age of the law where defense attorneys are not to be trusted. This is but a ploy to gain time for them to fabricate evidence! How will I sleep tonight... ...knowing you will not let the run rise on the mayor's day of reckoning, Justice-dono? Apollo: Apollo: I won't fabricate any evidence! Blackquill: Blackquill: Then prove it by joining me. A night in the clink will ensure you will not succumb to temptation! Apollo: How about I just promise not to succumb to anything? Blackquill: We have both evidence and a confession. The killer is this yokai before us. It is beyond dispute. A guilty verdict is all but-- Uuuwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Apollo: What's wrong with him? Fulbright: Prosecutor Blackquill! We've had enough of your hijinks! The foundation of justice is fair play, and you are in serious violation of that! Blackquill: *huff* *huff* What in the devil was that? Fool Bright! Have you tampered with my shackles in some manner? Fulbright: Ha ha ha ha! It seems you found that quite shocking. It's my special Jolt of Justice device. Each press is a shocking reminder to behave. Blackquill: You shall pay for this. I, Simon Blackquill, vow to-- Uuuwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Fulbright: Your Honor! You need not fear now! I believe Prosecutor Blackquill will remain on his best behavior. Apollo: ...A bit late with the reassurances, aren't we, Detective? Judge: W-Well, in that case... *ahem*... This concludes today's deliberations. The prosecution and the defense will use this opportunity to further their investigations. This court is adjourned! To be continued Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: That statement clearly contradicts the evidence! Blackquill: ...Hmph. I object to you on personal grounds. The sole contradiction lies in what your faulty logic dreamt up just now. Apollo: Ack! Judge: Objection overruled. The defense will think twice before making such erroneous statements! Apollo: (It seems that statement didn't particularly conflict with the evidence.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: Consider the evidence. There's obviously something wrong with that statement! Blackquill: Your gall knows no bounds. It's shocking, really. Apollo: What's that supposed to mean?! Blackquill: You stand there, brazely objecting to perfectly factual statements... One does not see such shameless behavior that often. Judge: A penalty for our shameless attorney! Apollo: (Oh, no. Looks like Blackquill is turning the judge against me.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: The evidence is at complete odds with the witness's testimony! Blackquill: ...........................Your Baldness. Judge: Wh-Who, me? Blackquill: What do you make of this objection of his? Judge: Oh, I don't know if I should, um, well... Blackquill: I've no patience for vagaries. Now, answer my question. Judge: Y-Yes, sir! The defense's objection was clearly misguided! Blackquill: Bravo. Nicely done. Judge: Ho ho ho. It seems our misguided attorney has earned himself a penalty. Apollo: (Erk... I better look before I leap next time!) Consult (when evidence must be presented) Athena: Hmm... There has to be a contradiction here somewhere. Apollo: (Too bad I'm drawing a blank.) Athena: There was a statement that I thought was a little strange, but... ...I wouldn't bet my life on it. Apollo: .........And which statement would that be? Since I'm the one betting my life on it. Athena: Hee hee hee. Okay, if you must know, I'll show you the one I'm thinking of. Apollo: (Time to swallow my pride and let her lend a hand.) (There must be an inconsistency in the testimony Athena's pointing out!) Consult (when statements must be pressed) Athena: Hmm... I can't flag any inconsistencies. Apollo: So there haven't been any contradictions in the testimony so far... That can mean only one thing... Athena: Time to press the witness! Apollo: Right. We'll have to work to get the testimony we need. Let's press the heck out of any statements that stick out. Pinpoint wrong emotion (during Mood Matrix segment \"What Jinxie Saw\") Apollo: Apollo: Hmm... This seems like an unnatural reaction... Athena: Really? Because I don't see it that way. Apollo: So it isn't unexpected given her testimony? Athena: Hello? Is there anybody in there? Just nod if you can hear me. Apollo: (Yes, there is someone at home, and that someone is going to try that again.) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's argument is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims! This court finds the defendant, Damian Tenma... Guilty The Monstrous Turnabout Image Gallery Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 April 18, 1:20 PMWright Anything Agency Athena: Having a yokai testify in court is unprecedented to say the least. Apollo: \"I am Tenma Taro, the yokai you seek!\" How could such a straight-laced man like Mr. Tenma suddenly become a demon? Athena: Yeah, it's strange. Even worse, Prosecutor Blackquill is playing along. *sigh* I can't even think straight anymore. I need to go out for a run! See you in a bit! Apollo: Wait! What about the--! ...Investigation. Trucy: Back! ...Eek! Athena: Whoa, whoa! Trucy, welcome back. Oh, you're in your stage outfit. Back from work? Trucy: Yep! I really nailed this new magic trick I've been working on! ...I also heard about those tricks that were conjured up in court earlier today. You know, the demon-out-of-nowhere trick and Polly's tightrope-style defense trick! Apollo: I was seriously considering a disappearing act of my own after all that craziness. ...Anyway, our next trick is to find a suspect other than the mayor. I know the killer must've used the air duct in the escape. Athena: And whoever did that was the Tenma Taro that Mr. Filch and Jinxie saw. Apollo: Right. Maybe there's some evidence in the air duct. Athena: The real fight starts right now! Trucy: Hey, before you go, let me make the evidence you no longer need disappear! 3, 2, 1... Ta-dah! Unnecessary evidence has disappeared into Trucy's magic panties. Apollo: (I wonder where all that stuff goes?) Athena: Okay, let's get over to the scene of the crime! ¡Vámonos, Apollo, Vámonos! (Changed from [Vamonos, Apollo, Vamonos!] in the original release) April 18Kyubi Manor - Fox Chamber Athena: Detective Fulbright! Mind if we search the air duct? Fulbright: Well, since you really are on the side of justice, I suppose I can let you... Plus, my own sense of justice has been called into doubt, so... Athena: Wonder if he's been like this ever since the trial. Apollo: Well, his sense of justice HAS been beaten to a pulp. It'll probably take a while for him to recover. Athena: I sorta feel bad for him, but we have work to do! Let's go get the evidence we need! Apollo: The air duct is the key. We know the Tenma Taro impersonator used it to make an escape. After murdering the alderman, the killer left the Fox Chamber through the hallway door. Then, after locking the door from the outside... ...the killer entered the air duct in the hallway. Finally, the killer dropped the key into the Fox Chamber through the air vent here... ...then went back through the duct and fled the manor. That's how the illusion of no one entering or leaving the locked room was created! Athena: If the killer passed through the air duct, maybe we'll find some evidence there. Apollo: Yeah, maybe some black feathers or something like that. Well, here's our vent. It's awfully high up. Athena: Don't worry, I brought a stepladder! Happy hunting! Apollo: (How nice of her to volunteer me for the job.) Whoa, it's pitch black in here. Well, here goes nothing! *cough, cough* *wheeze* *sputter* *cough, cough* There's a thick layer of dust in here! *cough, cough* *wheeze* *sputter* *cough, cough* ............ ...I don't... get it. Athena: Find anything? Yikes! Apollo, what happened?! You're covered in dust! Apollo: Yeah, dust... Lots of dust. Athena: So, what'd you find? Apollo: You know how dust collects on something when nobody uses it for a long time? Athena: Yeah, like Mr. Wright's desk back at the office. Apollo: Right... You think it'd be possible to crawl over that sort of dust without leaving a trail? Athena: I seriously doubt it... Wait, you're not suggesting--! No one's gone through that duct lately?! Apollo: Kinda looks that way. And if it's true, Mayor Tenma is going to be fingered as the killer. Athena: B-B-But...! Apollo: (If we don't turn things around quickly...) Fulbright: In justice we trust! Apollo: Ack! Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Sorry, Mr. Justice! But it seems your justice was not the most just, after all! It is MY sense of justice that has prevailed! Apollo: Argh! Athena: Detective Fulbright sure seems chipper all of a sudden. Apollo: Ugh. And I'm back to my old devastated self. Fulbright: Aw, come on! Where's that never-say-die spirit? Bring it on, Mr. Lawyer Man! Bring it on! Apollo: Let me suffer in peace. Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Justice prevails once more! Athena: It's not over yet! And besides... Kicking someone when they're down is what bad guys do! Fulbright: Ack! A-Are you calling me a... a bad guy?! Me? Bobby Fulbright, champion of justice?! Athena: Then how about some information on the investigation? We need some help here! Fulbright: Information? About the investigation? All right! But I won't have you calling me a bad guy ever again! Understood?! Athena: We did it, Apollo! Apollo: Yeah, but how long can we keep this up? Talk The investigation Athena: I can't believe Prosecutor Blackquill would stoop that low! I mean, to pinning the blame on a yokai?! He really wants a conviction at all costs! Apollo: (She could give a yokai a run for its money when she's mad...) Fulbright: Yes, well... I have him writing a self-reflective essay as we speak! Athena: I doubt that'll teach him anything. Apollo: Yeah, he'll probably just write \"Dotard\" a thousand times. Fulbright: That whole yokai business is most likely a ploy to win a conviction. Truth is, Prosecutor Blackquill believes Jinxie Tenma planted that yokai stuff. Planted it in an effort to protect her father -- the real killer. Athena: Yeah, right! I'd like to see him prove it! Fulbright: Whoa! Calm down! He doesn't have any direct evidence, but we did find this. It was at the base of the cliff just outside Kyubi Manor. Apollo: Wait... That isn't the staff Tenma Taro was supposedly carrying, is it? Fulbright: The one and only! Ms. Tenma no doubt tossed it over the cliff when she was done. Athena: No way! W-Well, what about prints?! Fulbright: Nope, no prints, but if she was wearing a costume, there wouldn't be any, anyway. Apollo: Well, prints or no prints, it's not going to work out in our favor. (Sounds like the staff might have belonged to the mansion. But if that's the case... ...then where in the mansion did Tenma Taro get it from?) The Amazing Nine-Tails Apollo: Did Prosecutor Blackquill figure out that the victim was The Amazing Nine-Tails? Fulbright: He did, indeed. He's a sharp one, all right. He figured it out while investigating the municipal merger and the victim's past. The Amazing Nine-Tails sparked the yokai craze and worked against the merger! And Mayor Damian Tenma is the corrupt politician who murdered that great hero! The Amazing Nine-Tails's fans are so angry, they even tried to storm the detention center! Athena: I don't blame them. I mean, their favorite masked wrestling hero was murdered. They must've been shocked when they found out what happened. Apollo: Speaking of which, isn't Jinxie also a fan of The Amazing Nine-Tails? Jinxie: A wrestler's mask is more precious than his own life! He'd never unmask himself in front of others. But there ARE matches where wrestlers battle for the right to remove each other's masks. Jinxie: To have your mask torn off is the worst humiliation a wrestler could suffer! That's why their masks are more important to them than life itself. Athena: She spoke with a passion that only a fan could appreciate. We oughta become fans ourselves and go protest in front of the prison! Apollo: What? No! Did you forget that Mayor Tenma is not only Jinxie's father, but our client!? Athena: Oh, yeah. Fulbright: You be careful, now. You're defending the most hated mayor in history. I just hope you don't find yourself on the wrong end of a figure-four leg lock! Apollo: (Maybe I should wear a mask to hide MY identity.) Present Crime Photo Fulbright: Such a grisly crime scene! I won't rest until that murderous fiend is behind bars! Apollo: So, you still think Mayor Tenma is responsible? Fulbright: That's right! Damian Tenma is an evil fiend who must be banished from this world! Now, take my hand and together we will defeat this evil! Apollo: Um, I think you're forgetting that Mayor Tenma's still my client. Kyubi's Autopsy Report Apollo: So, it was the spear that killed the alderman? Fulbright: That's right. He'd been in a drug-induced sleep, but woke the moment he was impaled. That's when he was struck by his attacker! Apollo: That's almost superhuman. Fulbright: Justice cannot allow evil to exist unopposed! Even if it means sacrificing one's life! Athena: I bet you two could strike back even if you were impaled! I mean, you're so full of justice. Apollo: Really? Or are you just saying that because of my name, Athena? After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: Are there any other new developments we should know? Fulbright: Hm, now that you mention it... Our suspect is suffering partial memory loss, but he DID manage to remember something. Apollo: He did? What did he say? Fulbright: He said he didn't want to speak with us. His exact words were: \"I am under no obligation to speak with you mortals!\" ...and other things of that nature. Apollo: (I wonder what Mayor Tenma remembered.) Fulbright: Too bad you can't go ask him now, 'cause Prosecutor Blackquill's busy questioning him. I know! Why don't you wait down at the playground with the rest of the kids? Ha ha. Athena: What now, Apollo? Apollo: How about regrouping back at the agency? Athena: Good idea. We might get some words of wisdom out of Mr. Wright while we're there. Detention Center, Yokai Lane, Kyubi Manor Garden, or Kyubi Manor Foyer Talk Any ideas? Athena: So the crime scene was locked tight at the time. Ugh, this is a tough one. Apollo: The only people in that locked room were the deceased -- the alderman -- and the mayor. Athena: Maybe the killer hid somewhere in that room. Apollo: But is there really anywhere to hide in the Fox Chamber? The trial Athena: That was quite a day in court. The news just can't stop talking about how the demon Tenma Taro made an appearance! Apollo: There's never an exorcist around when you need one. Athena: Well, I heard the judge actually held an exorcism in his courtroom after that. Apollo: Good. Let's hope it's the last we'll see of that pain-in-the-neck yokai. Athena: I don't know. I have a feeling Tenma Taro could exorcise an exorcist. Apollo: As an attorney defending a demon, I know exactly how that feels. Present Amazing Nine-Tails Mask Athena: I can't believe Alderman Kyubi was The Amazing Nine-Tails! Apollo: Hmm, maybe that's why the killer targeted him. His popularity among the anti-merger faction would have been a major obstacle. Athena: Yeah... Maybe the alderman felt threatened, and that's why he had to disguise himself. Jinxie's Statement Athena: Do you think the Tenma Taro Jinxie saw was the real killer? Apollo: Hmm... It's hard to say at this point. Athena: But if that's not our killer, then what was it doing in the manor? Apollo: ...Maybe it just wanted to use the bathroom. Athena: Huh?! I've heard of monsters in the closet and under the bed. They're in the bathroom, too?! Apollo: No, what I'm saying is the Tenma Taro Jinxie saw was someone dressed up like a yokai. I mean, there is no such thing as monsters in the bathroom. People on the other hand... Athena: Oh, I get it. That was your attempt at a joke. Ha ha, very funny... Apollo: (For someone so competitive and smart, she sure get some crazy ideas.) April 18Wright Anything Agency Apollo: Maybe I'll... go read over some past cases... Athena: And I'll... go do some research on exorcisms... Trucy: Hey, what's with you guys? You seem bummed out. Apollo: How should I put this? It's like we're at the edge of a cliff and the only way is down. Trucy: In other words, business as usual, right? Apollo: Yeah, I suppose so. Except this time, it's like we're bound and gagged, too. Athena: Don't forget blindfolded with our ears plugged up... Trucy: Ooh, and monsters at every turn, huh? Sounds rough... ???: Hey, Apollo. Oh, and Athena's here, too. Athena: Mr. Wright. Phoenix: How goes the investigation, Apollo, Athena? Athena: I think it's safe to say that things have gotten hairier than before. Phoenix: Really? What happened? Talk Our defense Phoenix: I was watching the two of you this morning from the gallery. That was one tough day in court, to say the least. Apollo: I know. I've never had to defend a yokai before. Phoenix: That business about the locked room was another major hurdle. Athena: Yeah, and on top of that, Jinxie was accused of being an accomplice! Phoenix: But at least you figured out how someone could have escaped that locked room. (Changed from [But at least you figured out how someone could have escaped the Forbidden Chamber.] in the original release) Apollo: Yeah, well, we just found out that our reasoning might be a tad... flawed. Phoenix: Oh, really? Well, that's... bad news. Athena: How are we going to get out of this one...? Phoenix: The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles. Athena: Force... a smile? Phoenix: Yeah. My mentor taught me that back when I was still learning the trade. She... also taught me to return to the basics whenever I got stuck. Apollo: Return to the basics? Phoenix: That's right. Always believe in your client, no matter what happens. That is a lawyer's greatest and most trusted weapon. Apollo: The basics... (Always believe in your client, huh...) You and Athena Apollo: So, Mr. Wright, how long have you known Athena? Phoenix: I met her during a trip to Europe. Apollo: Huh!? Y-You were in Europe? (Why haven't I heard about this before?) Phoenix: Yeah, I went there a few times to study the various legal systems over there. Apollo: Oh, okay... Er, wait a minute. I thought you worked as a pianist after you quit practicing law. Phoenix: I did, but an old friend of mine needed help with some legal work from time to time, so... Apollo: Oh, I guess you were never very far from the courtroom, then. Athena: It was like fate brought us together! It's thanks to Mr. Wright that I became a lawyer at all. Phoenix: Ha ha ha. I knew she was lawyer material from the moment I met her. And I have high hopes for her ability to analyze people's emotions. Athena: Aww, it's nothing special. Apollo: (Hmm... Maybe I've underestimated that analytical psychology of hers.) Athena: It's just, I thought that if my special ability could help defend innocent people... ...then I had to do everything in my power to bring it to the courtroom! That's when I really started hitting the books hard! Phoenix: I'm still amazed she actually became a lawyer. And at the tender age of eighteen, no less. (Changed from [And at the tender age of 18, no less.] in the original release) Apollo: Wow, that's almost superhuman. (Or personal -- like she's trying to help somebody she knows.) (Changed from [Or personal -- like she [sic] trying to help somebody she knows.] in the original release) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Your attorney's badge, huh... I used to show mine to everyone, too. Apollo: Why? Phoenix: You know, I never really thought about it. But I could ask you the same question. Apollo: Me? Well, I guess you could say I show it because there's someone to show it to. ...Or something like that. Phoenix: Ah ha ha. When you say it like that, it sounds kind of... I don't know... philosophical? Apollo: Heh heh, I guess it does. (.........Or does it?) Yokai Legend Scroll Apollo: Here's a little souvenir Trucy wanted you to have. Phoenix: Aww, how sweet! I know. I'll hang it in my office once the case is closed. Apollo: I don't know, it's pretty creepy looking. We don't want to freak our clients out. Phoenix: Hmm... You have a point there. Maybe you should hang it in your room, Apollo. Apollo: My room?! I don't want this thing in there! Phoenix: I don't want it, either. It has instant nightmare fuel written all over it. Apollo: Well, Trucy got it for you, so stop trying to pawn it off on me! Phoenix: You know... The more I look at it, the more I wonder if these are your distant relatives. Apollo: Hey... What's that supposed to mean?! Crime Photo Phoenix: So the room was locked tight and the only people in there were the suspect and victim? I headed up a similar case a long time ago. Apollo: Really?! Phoenix: Not only that, the defendant was my assistant. Apollo: What?! Phoenix: And not only that, the prosecutor for that trial loved to swing her whip around in court. Apollo: A whip?! Phoenix: When I saw that whip... man, I thought it was all over. Apollo: Wait, your assistant getting accused of murder hadn't made you think that already...? Anything else Phoenix: Ah ha ha. You're getting good at this, Apollo. Remember, the way you present evidence in court can really have an impact on the trial. Hmm... But your elbow angle's a little off. It should really be more like this. Apollo: I-I'll be fine! I'll be more careful next time. Promise! After clearing all Talk options: Athena: All right! I'm totally pumped up after talking to you, Mr. Wright! It's like you said, the worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles! Phoenix: And don't forget to return to the basics whenever you get stuck. Apollo: (Keep believing in my client. Right!) Um, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes? Apollo: I'm... I'm going to go visit our client again! Phoenix: I think that's a good idea. Apollo: (Alright, time to see what's new down at the Detention Center!) April 18Detention Center - Visitor's Room Athena: Mayor Tenma, we wanted to talk to you about something! Tenma: Caw-shaaaaaaaaw! Athena: Eeek! Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! So, my minions have returned! Athena: Apollo, he still thinks he's a yokai! Apollo: I wonder if we'll ever be able to talk to Mayor Tenma again. Tenma: Silence, peddler of the legal trade! Free me from these imprisoning walls with great haste! Athena: Wow... He's sounding more and more like a real demon with every sentence. I'm starting to wonder if we should even be helping him win his freedom. Apollo: Still, we can't let Mayor Tenma stay possessed, you know what I mean? Tenma: If you can clear me of these charges, I shall help in whatever manner I may. Now, ask of me what you will! Apollo: I suppose it's worth a shot. Talk Feathers and tracks Apollo: Were those feathers and tracks at the scene of the crime really your doing? Tenma: Indeed! The remnants of Tenma Taro, King of the Underworld, they be! The day when I once again dominate the mortal world is at hand, caw caw-caw-caw! Athena: The prosecution claims the feathers and tracks were planted by Jinxie. Tenma: What's this?! I must breach these walls and go defend my little Jinxie at once! Athena: Huh? Mayor Tenma, is that you? Tenma: ! ...Grr! Well, now! Damian appears to still reside within this body. But I should have expected as much from a descendent of mine! Be silent, now, Damian! Apollo: (I guess a little thing like demonic possession won't stop a father's love for his daughter.) You didn't kill Alderman Kyubi, did you? Tenma: I have killed no one! The remnants of my presence have been misconstrued. The murderer is not I! For if I had slain that mortal... ...raging hellfire would have consumed him, leaving naught but ash! Apollo: Yikes! ............S-So... S-So... you're saying, there must have been somebody else there? (Come to think of it, the mayor had mentioned that he'd been clubbed with this statue. I'd better ask about this, too.) What you remembered Apollo: Detective Fulbright mentioned that you might have something new to tell me. Tenma: Indeed, I have. I regurgitated this key but a short while ago. Behold, the key to the Forbidden Chamber! Apollo: Whoa! Is regurgitation one of your demonic powers, too?! Tenma: Bah! I do not waste my powers on such parlor tricks! Take the key from the killer did Damian, whereupon he swallowed it. He sought to bar the killer entry to the Forbidden Chamber. Apollo: (So, he wanted to keep it shut tight?) Tenma: But no fingerprints shall you find upon that key. Apollo: How do you know that? ...Wait. Is THAT another one of your demonic powers, then?! Tenma: Foolish mortal! You would have me, Tenma Taro, act as some asinine alchemist?! I but asked the jailer and my will was done -- quite eagerly, I must add, caw caw-caw-caw! Guard: Always an honor to serve, Your Malevolence! Apollo: (Guess I'm not the only one he scares the living daylights out of.) Athena: Um, can we ask how you use this key? We couldn't find a keyhole anywhere in or around the door. Tenma: Curse that infernal door! But if I had known its manner of opening, long, long ago would I have made my return! Athena: He has a point there. Apollo: Maybe Jinxie knows something about how the whole thing works... Forbidden Chamber Key added to the Court Record.

Blackmail letter (appears after correctly presenting Blackmail Letter) Apollo: Who placed this in the alderman's pocket? Tenma: Hrmmm. Very few were they who knew the letter was in Damian's briefcase. Apollo: So, whoever knew about the blackmail letter being in the mayor's briefcase... ...is a potential suspect in its theft and placement in the alderman's pocket. Tenma: Ah! Could it have been... HIS doing?! Apollo: Mr. Mayor, er... I mean, Mr. Taro! Did you just remember something?! Tenma: Indeed, I did. There was but one other who knew of that letter: Damian's aide Florent L'Belle. Full knowledge of that briefcase's contents did that aide possess. Apollo: Then he may be the blackmailer and the murderer we're looking for! Tenma: That is preposterous! He's a most trusted advisor. He would never betray Damian! Athena: It seems like Mayor Tenma is a bit too trusting of those around him. Apollo: (Still, this is HUGE! Now we know who might've slipped that blackmail letter in the alderman's pocket! Look out, Florent L'Belle, here comes Justice!) Athena: Let's go find Mr. L'Belle and rake him over the coals! Apollo: Thanks for the help. You've just given us a major lead! Blackmail Letter updated in the Court Record. Athena: Hmm... There's something that still bothers me. If Mr. L'Belle is the killer... ...what could have motivated him to open the Forbidden Chamber? Apollo: We should probably search it for clues. Athena: Only one problem. How do you open a locked door that doesn't have a keyhole? Apollo: Let's go talk to Jinxie. Maybe she can help. Blackmail letter (subsequent times) Apollo: Who placed this in the alderman's pocket?

Present Fox and Demon Statue (after clearing \"Feathers and tracks\" Talk option; before clearing \"What you remembered\" Talk option) Tenma: What, might I ask, is that? Apollo: This statue was found at the scene. Someone hit Mayor Tenma over the head with it. It had been wrapped in a large cloth before the alderman's murder. Tenma: Let me see whether Damian knows about such a thing... Hrmmm, yes... Something wrapped in just such a cloth does he recall. A secret gift from Alderman Kyubi it would seem. He, however, had not a chance to see it till now, for the cloth did conceal it. Apollo: Maybe the cloth fell off or was removed after the mayor was struck. Tenma: Hrmmm, of that Damian does not know. Apollo: (A secret gift? Interesting... Maybe Jinxie knows something about it...?) Fox and Demon Statue (after clearing \"Feathers and tracks\" and \"What you remembered\" Talk options) Tenma: What, might I ask, is that? Apollo: This statue was found at the scene.

Maybe Jinxie knows something about it...? I should question him about the blackmail letter, too. Let's see what he says when I show it to him.) Yokai Legend Scroll Tenma: Ages has it been since I've seen that. We often battled it out like this back in the day. Athena: I've been meaning to ask, which one of you was stronger? Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! That would be me, of course! For I am the demon lord of the yokai! Caw-shaaaaaaaaw! Athena: Yeah, but the Nine-Tailed Fox imprisoned you in-- Apollo: Athena! Don't encourage him! It's already hard enough as it is. Athena: Aw, I just wanted to find out which one was really the strongest. Special Edition Paper Tenma: Why, that is a photo of me soaring through the heavens. Hrmm, but look at my wing angle. It's all wrong. Athena: Wow, you're really a stickler for details. Tenma: I even gave a big smile for the camera... ...but so small am I in this shot that one can't even see it! Apollo: Never knew demons were so interested in how they're presented by the media. Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy Tenma: Hrmmm... A descendent of old Nine-Tails, perhaps? It would seem he's doing quite well these days. Apollo: Yeah, he's a huge hit from kids all the way up to their grandparents. Tenma: Hrmmm... It seems I've been resting on my laurels for far too long. It is time I, too, debut in the mortal world and rekindle my struggle against that wily fox. Athena: That's the spirit! You can make your debut as soon as we get you that not-guilty verdict! Tenma: Then I had best return to top form! Pushups and sit-ups should do for now. Caw caw-caw! Apollo: (Is he planning a new career as a pro wrestler?!) Blackmail Letter (after clearing \"What you remembered\" Talk option and correctly presenting Fox and Demon Statue) Tenma: Why this--! This is that accursed blackmail letter that was sent to Damian. Apollo: Apparently, somebody slipped it into the alderman's pocket. We believe someone, probably the killer, stole it from Mayor Tenma's briefcase. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you? Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! You have questions, do you? Very well, ask away, mortal! Anything else Apollo: Umm... I was hoping you'd take a look at this. Tenma: Hrmmm... An offering to me. Quite admirable. But the best thing you could offer me is to win me my freedom! Caw caw-caw-caw! Apollo: R-Right, right... I'll do my best! After clearing \"Blackmail letter\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: April 18Nine-Tails Vale - Yokai Lane Apollo: Hey, isn't that...? Jinxie: Grrr. You dare imprison me? Athena: Jinxie! She's... acting really strange. Jinxie: That loathsome, no-good Nine-Tailed Fox. He shall know the terror that is mine and despair. Grrr... Grrr. You shall pay. Oh, you shall pay dearly! ......All of you! Apollo: J-Jinxie, are you all right? Jinxie: ! Eeeeeek! Apollo: Aaaah! Jinxie: Oh! Is that you, Mr. Demon Lawyer? Apollo: ...Morning, Jinxie. Jinxie: Morning? Isn't it already past noon? And what am I doing here? Last I remember, I lay down to take a nap back at the manor. ......Oh, no! It must've been the Makuragaeshi! Apollo: Makura... gaeshi? Jinxie: Ever wake after a restless night's sleep to find your pillow in an unusual place... ...or that you've been sleeping on the floor or in the hallway? Well, it's that yokai's fault! The Makuragaeshi preys on people when they're asleep! Apollo: ...It sounds like you just need to be tucked in really tight, or maybe a snug sleeping bag. Athena: Jinxie, how come you don't have any charms on your forehead? Jinxie: I don't? Oh, they must've fallen off. Without them, evil things can creep into me. Apollo: (I'd say we had a more than adequate demonstration of that just now...) Jinxie: I'd better reapply them. Apollo: Jinxie, there's something we wanted to ask you. Jinxie: Ah! There was something I wanted to tell you, too! I... I remembered something else! Apollo: You did? What was it? Talk What you remember Apollo: Jinxie, can you tell us what you remembered? Jinxie: Well, after the trial I remembered lots of stuff. But there was one thing I thought was really weird. Apollo: (I'm almost afraid to ask, but here goes...) Really? What? Jinxie: Um... It's about the yokai feathers and tracks. They weren't there when I first opened the door! Apollo: Wait, whaaat?! Are you sure? Jinxie: Uh-huh. My memory's crystal clear now. Apollo: So, you're saying they were left at the crime scene after you found it? Athena: This could spell major trouble, Apollo. Apollo: Why? Athena: Because Jinxie is already accused of leaving the feathers and tracks at the scene. If they weren't there when she discovered the crime scene... ...it will totally fuel the claim that she fabricated the evidence later on. Apollo: Ack! Athena: Jinxie's fuzzy memory of the whole incident is really working against us. The prosecution will probably say she doesn't remember planting the evidence. Good luck rebutting that! Apollo: Oh, man, this is not good. (I sure hope she didn't plant the evidence while she was sleepwalking or something...) The Forbidden Chamber Apollo: Jinxie, you wouldn't happen to know how to open the Forbidden Chamber, would you? That door doesn't even have a keyhole. Jinxie: Well, it's supposed to have a secret mechanism. They say you have to figure it out before the keyhole will appear. Apollo: A secret mechanism?! Really? Jinxie: Uh-huh. It's hidden in the Fox Chamber. But only Alderman Kyubi knew what it was, and how it worked. Apollo: The alderman of Nine-Tails Vale sure loved his secrets. (Changed from [The alderman of Nine-Tails Vail [sic] sure loved his secrets.] in the original release) Athena: Apollo, let's go see if we can find that secret mechanism! Apollo: Whoa, slow down! There's something else I need to ask about. Jinxie, is there only one key to the Forbidden Chamber? Jinxie: Uh-huh. Even the manor's master key won't open it. That's because it's a very special room... that must never be opened. Apollo: Guess that means nobody entered the Forbidden Chamber after the murder. After all, we know Mayor Tenma took the key from the killer and swallowed it, so... Athena: So the mayor's efforts to keep the killer out of the Forbidden Chamber... ...were not in vain! Forbidden Chamber Key updated in the Court Record. The Forbidden Chamber (subsequent times) Apollo: Jinxie, you wouldn't happen to know how to open the Forbidden Chamber, would you?

Present Fox and Demon Statue Jinxie: Alderman Kyubi made that statue. It's a token of goodwill... ...I think it was meant to be for Nine-Tails Vale and Tenma Town. Apollo: A token of goodwill? But the two yokai are fighting. Jinxie: Fighting? Oh, I see what you mean! The cup portion is missing. This statue... ...originally depicted the two yokai holding up a cup in celebration. But it sure doesn't look that way now, does it? Apollo: Maybe it broke when it was used to hit Mayor Tenma on the head. Jinxie: That would explain it. I guess the only two people who knew what it really looked like were the alderman and I. Now it's just me, but its symbol of goodwill will be forever etched in my mind!

BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: Ack! (My bracelet! It's reacting!) Jinxie, you wouldn't happen to be-- Fulbright: In justice we trust! Apollo: Yikes! Jinxie: Eek! A ghost! Fulbright: Argh! Apollo: Detective Fulbright! What are you doing here? Fulbright: I have business with this young lady, if you must know. Prosecutor Blackquill has asked me to question her. Jinxie: Question me? ...Sorry, not interested. Apollo: Are you here to ask about that whole yokai affair? Fulbright: That's right. Specifically, we want to ask-- Ah, but I can't tell you that, now can I? Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Athena: Oh, come on, please? We're partners in justice, right? Fulbright: No no, Prosecutor Blackquill specifically told me, my questions were of the utmost justice. I will not fall for your lies! In justice we trust! Apollo: The Twisted Samurai sure has him on a short leash. Jinxie: So you're not a ghost? Maybe some sort of urban troll, then? Fulbright: Now, come along, Ms. Tenma. To the station with you! Athena: He took her away. Apollo: (Missed my chance to see what she was lying about.) Athena: Well, at least we found out there's a secret mechanism for opening the chamber! Let's go check it out! Apollo: I just hope they let us in now. April 18Kyubi Manor - Garden L'Belle: Oh, what an absolutely FABULOUS scent! I'm SO glad I had these carnations imported from England. Nothing but the FINEST will do. Perhaps I should place one aside for our DEARLY departed alderman. Athena: Hey, it's Mr. L'Belle! Apollo, let's ask him about you-know-what! Apollo: (Oh yeah, before we search the Fox Chamber we should ask about the blackmail letter.) L'Belle: Why, if it isn't the mayor's little lawyers. What do YOU want with ME? Apollo: Oh, um, there's something we wanted to ask... (Where's that ringing coming from?) L'Belle: You'll HAVE to excuse me. ...Hello? L'Belle here. Apollo: What the--?! (Those things on his shoulders are cell phones?!) L'Belle: ...Yes, about that. You MUST forgive me! This WHOLE matter with Mayor Tenma has been a COMPLETE nightmare. Athena: ......Where do you buy clothes like that? L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Surprised? This is my OWN special design. It's the ULTIMATE in functional beauty. Apollo: Functional beauty? Are you sure about that? Looks a bit unwieldy to me. Ack! L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! You simply don't have an eye for beauty. Apollo: (...If having an eye for beauty means looking like this guy, I'd rather be blind.) L'Belle: So, what DO you want with ME? Talk Did you see Tenma Taro? Apollo: Both Jinxie and Mr. Filch said they saw Tenma Taro. But what about you, Mr. L'Belle? If you were there in the foyer, why didn't you see-- Ack! L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Very well, I ADMIT it. That's right! I, Florent L'Belle, SAW the demon Tenma Taro! Apollo: Hmm... (So he did see something.) Then why did you lie about not seeing him? L'Belle: I was SIMPLY trying to protect dear little Jinxie. Apollo: Protect Jinxie? What do you mean? L'Belle: Why, don't TELL me you haven't heard of that strange little HABIT of hers? Apollo: Which one are we talking about...? L'Belle: The ONE where she wanders around making mischief without knowing WHAT she's doing! Rumor has it she's possessed by Tenma Taro. Apollo: That one's new to me. L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Well, THERE you have it! Anytime you HEAR about a Tenma Taro sighting... ...little Jinxie should be your PRIME suspect. Athena: Tell us more about that rumor! Rumor about Jinxie (appears after \"Did you see Tenma Taro?\") Apollo: So, what was that rumor about Jinxie? L'Belle: They say she's possessed. Not ALL the time, of course. It hits suddenly, then she starts WANDERING around doing strange THINGS. Apollo: I-Is that so...? (Although, come to think of it...) Jinxie: That loathsome, no-good Nine-Tailed Fox. He shall know the terror that is mine and despair. Apollo: (That certainly would explain how she was acting earlier.) L'Belle: Once, she EVEN put on a Tenma Taro costume and wandered around the woods at night. Apollo: She did? Anime cutscene Jinxie: Beware you who sealed me away! Apollo: (Ugh. I wish I'd never asked.) Athena: Does she remember anything while she's possessed? L'Belle: Unfortunately, no. She doesn't seem to remember a THING during these EPISODES. Athena: Memory loss during possession... Hmm... L'Belle: Come to think of it, her MEMORY of the MURDER scene was QUITE fuzzy. I suppose THAT, too, was caused by her possession. Apollo: .........Ah! Then maybe-- L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! So you DO understand! That whole yokai business was ENTIRELY of her own making! Apollo: Now wait a minute! (Although... that yokai evidence wasn't there until after she discovered the crime scene... Did she leave those black feathers and strange tracks there herself?) Athena: Apollo, let's ask Mayor Tenma about Jinxie's episodes the next time we talk with him! Present Jinxie's Statement Apollo: Jinxie thinks she saw Tenma Taro near the scene of the crime. L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! That little dear is ALWAYS talking such nonsense. After all, she's ALWAYS calling you a red demon, is she not? Apollo: Gngh! L'Belle: Plus, she has the nerve to call ME of all people a yokai! She even has a name for me: Baron Powder Face! Pffft! I've NEVER been so insulted! Apollo: (How could anyone look at him and NOT think monster?) L'Belle: Now, if she had named me the BEAUTIFUL Baron Powder Face, I could've forgiven her. Apollo: Wait, THAT's your sticking point?! Blackmail Letter L'Belle: WHAT is THAT? Apollo: It's the blackmail letter, but it wasn't sent to Alderman Kyubi. It was sent to Mayor Tenma. L'Belle: AND? ......Your point BEING? Apollo: Someone took the letter from the mayor's briefcase... ...and then placed it in the alderman's pocket after he was murdered. L'Belle: Oh, you don't say... Apollo: You wouldn't happen to be the one who made the switch, would you? After all, you're the only one who knew that the blackmail letter was in his briefcase... ...so, naturally, you-- Ack! L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! PERHAPS that shot of cologne will MAKE those scales FALL from your eyes! Apollo: Or my eyes fall from their sockets. L'Belle: Is it possible that you would like to FRAME me as a potential SUSPECT? What would MAKE you raise such an OUTRAGEOUS allegation in the first place? Apollo: Oh, uh, well... L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! My ONLY crime is being born as BEAUTIFUL as you see here! In other words, YOU have NOTHING! Now, let me show you what to DO with this garbage! Apollo: Ahhh! You can't destroy evidence like that! L'Belle: What do you mean I CAN'T? I just DID, ah ha ha ha! Feel a little lighter now? Apollo: (You've just won a one-way trip to the top of my \"most annoying people ever\" list, buddy.) After clearing \"Rumor about Jinxie\" Talk option and presenting Blackmail Letter: L'Belle: Are we done with your SILLY questions now? I'm a VERY busy man, you know. Apollo: *sigh* (I guess that's it for now.) L'Belle: Hello, L'Belle speaking! ...Really? You wish to carry MY new product at YOUR store? Oh, but I'm afraid it's my own PRIVATE brand. It's NOT available to the public. ...What? Then I shouldn't advertise it on TV? But I DON'T understand. As THE embodiment of beauty, it is my duty to announce my good looks to the world! Apollo: ......... (Stop the bus. I'm getting off.) L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! EVERYONE wants my EXCLUSIVE \"Je suis L'Belle!\" brand products! It's the crown jewel of MY collection, born of my LONG, RELENTLESS pursuit of beauty! But now that it's become SO popular, it's been an ABSOLUTE nightmare! Apollo: You don't say. L'Belle: Well, they CAN'T have it! It's just for ME! It's not meant for you PEASANTS. Apollo: Peasants? L'Belle: This is my LATEST product! I'm calling it \"Couleur Me L'Belle!\" A DAZZLING hair color that you can wash out with just water! Apollo: (Guess that means you can't sweat.) L'Belle: I have SEVEN colors in all. You can find out more in my commercials and magazine ads. Apollo: (...Yet, it's not available to the public? Great sales strategy there, genius.) Athena: Come to think of it, Mr. L'Belle... ...your hair color's changed since the last time we met. L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! The little lady has QUITE the discerning eye! Here's a little sample. Consider it a gift for one who TRULY appreciates beauty. Athena: Oh, uh... Apollo, what should I do? Apollo: Better take it before you get a face full of cologne. Athena: Good point. ...Wow, thanks, Mr. L'Belle. Couleur Me L'Belle! added to the Court Record. Athena: Okay, let's head over to the Fox Chamber. Apollo: We've still gotta find the secret mechanism for opening the Forbidden Chamber. Present Couleur Me L'Belle! L'Belle: Dazzling hair color that you can wash out with water. Isn't it magnificent? Athena: What if you start to sweat? Won't that wash the color out, too? L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! I assure you, Florent L'Belle, embodiment of beauty, does NOT sweat! Apollo: Then what about rain? Even if you don't sweat, you never know when it might-- Ack! L'Belle: Pffft! Peasants like YOU fail to GRASP the truth. Rain and other forces of nature draw back in awe of my beauty! Apollo: (Sure they're not being repelled back by your narcissism?) Before clearing all Talk options and presenting Blackmail Letter in Kyubi Manor - Garden: April 18Kyubi Manor - Fox Chamber Policeman: Hey, we're trying to conduct an investigation here! Come back later once we're done. Apollo: *sigh* (Oh, well. Guess we'll have to find a way to kill some time.) Athena: Let's go talk to Mr. L'Belle while we wait. Apollo: Okay, there was something I wanted to ask him, anyway. Policeman: If you're looking for Mayor Tenma's aide, I saw him in the garden earlier. We won't be here much longer. Go keep that narcissist company in the meantime. Apollo: *sigh* After clearing all Talk options and presenting Blackmail Letter in Kyubi Manor - Garden: April 18Kyubi Manor - Fox Chamber Apollo: Okay, let's find that secret mechanism for opening the Forbidden Chamber. Athena: Ooh, this is so exciting! I can't wait to see how it works! But do you really think the killer entered the Forbidden Chamber? Apollo: We'll just have to open it to find out. Athena: We should also see if there was anywhere the killer could've hid in this room! Okay, let's get started. ¡Apúrate, Apollo, Apúrate! Examine Forbidden Chamber door Apollo: Still no keyhole, huh. Athena: Yeah, and the door won't budge, just like those spiky bangs of yours. Apollo: Well, all it takes is some water, but I don't think that would work on the door. Athena: Oh, I know! I'll break it down with a body slam! Apollo: Ha ha ha. I seriously doubt you could do that. Athena: Tsk, how do you know if I haven't even tried?! Apollo: No, wait, don't! Athena: Aaaagh... Apollo: (As much as you hate losing, Athena, I think the door would win this match...) Table Athena: Maybe the killer hid under this table! Apollo: That would be a terrible hiding place. The alderman's body would've been right above. Athena: Hmm, maybe you're right. Guess the underside is a bit... Wait, there's something under the table. Apollo: Let's check it out. Lustrous cup Apollo: Hey, look! There's something down here! Athena: It looks like a piece of something. Only question is, a piece of what? Apollo: Hmm... Oh, I know! It might be a piece of this statue. Remember what Jinxie said? The statue originally depicted two yokai holding up a cup. It was a symbol of goodwill. Athena: So, this piece broke off and rolled under the table? Fox and Demon Statue updated in the Court Record. Lustrous cup (subsequent times) Apollo: What have we here... It's the piece that broke off of this statue. Athena: You think it broke off when the mayor was clobbered on the head? Apollo: I'd say that's the most likely explanation. Fox statues Apollo: There's a carving of the Nine-Tailed Fox over the door and statues of him on either side. The way those two statues are glaring, it's like they're guarding the door from us. Come to think of it, there are two foxes on the folding screen as well. It can't be a coincidence, can it...? Athena: Hey, this statue moves! Apollo: Don't get carried away, now. I mean, who knows? It might trigger a trap. Athena: Heh heh. I can handle it. If a spear comes shooting my way, I'll snatch it out of the air! After all, I have the reflexes of a regular karate kid! Apollo: (I guess if you can catch something that fast out of mid-air, you can accomplish anything. Still... There might be something to the fact that these fox statues rotate. Maybe there's something around here that shows the position they should be in.) Feathers and tracks Athena: Look at all these feathers... Apollo: ...And bloody tracks, too. Athena: Then we have Jinxie and Mr. Filch's eyewitness reports... Apollo: ...And a newspaper photo. Athena: Our yokai's definitely not the shy type, that's for sure! Apollo: (This is bad! Mayor Tenma is scary enough without people thinking he's a yokai!) Overturned chair Apollo: I don't think we'll find anything else on this chair. Right Fox Chamber door Athena: I just remembered this mystery novel I once read. The murder occurred in a locked room... ...and the perpetrator made sure to hide behind the room's door when it was opened. Then, when no one was looking, he made his escape. Apollo: A clever trick, but it would've been impossible in this case. See this broken tanuki statue here? The door must've banged into it when it was opened. Athena: Oh, I get it. The killer couldn't have been there because of the statue. Left Fox Chamber door Apollo: Better take a look behind this door, too... Oh, look. The doorknob banged into the wall. Made a big dent, too. That wouldn't have happened if the killer had been hiding there. Athena: Right... I guess that rules out the old hide-behind-the-door trick. Air vent Athena: There really is no escaping here through the air duct. Apollo: And here we went through all the trouble of bringing a ladder to check it out. Athena: That's not a ladder, Apollo. It's a stepladder. Apollo: What's the difference? They both have the word ladder in them. Athena: What's the difference...? ............ Oh, I know! Let's play rock, paper, scissors to decide who's right! Apollo: You're way too competitive. And it's not even related to the original issue, either! Window Apollo: There's a cliff outside this window. Makes it pretty impossible to get out this way. Athena: When I hear things like that, it just makes me want to try! Never say never, right? I bet I could get out this way. Hrrrgh! Apollo: No, wait! Do you have a death wish or something?! Athena: Tsk, it won't even open wide enough for me to squeeze through! Guess I lost that bet. Apollo: That loss just saved your life. Statue next to armchair Athena: This statue originally depicted the two yokai holding up a cup in a gesture of goodwill. Apollo: Maybe Alderman Kyubi was planning on smoothing things over with Mayor Tenma. Athena: But he was murdered instead... ...by somebody who intervened. Apollo: The mayor was only pursuing the municipal merger because he'd been blackmailed. Who knows? If this murder hadn't occurred, maybe they could've come up with a solution. Front of folding screen Apollo: Two foxes standing back to back are depicted on this elegant folding screen. Could this have something to do with the keyhole? Hmm... Wait a minute... Two foxes... There are two fox statues in front of the Forbidden Chamber as well. Athena: Maybe the keyhole will appear if we do something to this folding screen. Hmm... But I don't see anything unusual about it. Apollo: Well, it does have two foxes on it, and there are two fox statues in front of the door. Athena: Then maybe there's a clue somewhere in this room. Let's turn the whole place upside down! Apollo: (She's as excited as a kid in a candy store.) After examining front of folding screen, lustrous cup, Forbidden Chamber door, and fox statues: Athena: Well, I can't think of anywhere else to look. You find anything, Apollo? We'll never find the keyhole to the Forbidden Chamber at this rate. Apollo: There's something about that folding screen. You know how those fox statues in front of the Forbidden Chamber move? That screen might be a clue as to how we're supposed to position them or something. Athena: Hey, I bet you're right! Let's go over that screen with a fine-toothed comb! Examine Front of folding screen Leads to: \"On closer inspection...\" Apollo: On closer inspection... ...I think there's more to this screen than meets the eye. Athena: Let's check every last inch of it! Apollo: I can rotate the folding screen with [right analog stick / arrow keys]. (Changed from [Tap and slide on the bottom screen to rotate the folding screen.] in the original release) And if I spot anything of interest, I can press [A / Space] on it to inspect it further. (Changed from [I can also tap on something of interest to inspect it further.] in the original release) Athena: You can also zoom in and out with [X / B] and [B / M] to get a better look. (Changed from [You can also zoom in and out to get a better look.] in the original release) Now, let's check every last inch of it! Examine front side Apollo: Hey, doesn't it look like the picture here has been cut off on both ends? Athena: Hmm, now that you mention it... Apollo: It looks like there are supposed to be doors on both ends, but they're cut in half. Athena: Maybe those doors symbolize the Forbidden Chamber's door. Apollo: Yeah... It definitely feels like something significant, but the question is, what? Examine keyhole pictures on back (before examining key pictures on back) Apollo: What's this? Looks like a keyhole or something. Athena: You think it could be the keyhole to the Forbidden Chamber? Apollo: No, it's just a picture. Athena: Still, you know what they say: a picture's worth a thousand words. Examine keyhole pictures on back (after examining key pictures on back) Apollo: What's this? Looks like a keyhole or something. Athena: You think it could be the keyhole to the Forbidden Chamber? Apollo: Wait, what about that key drawn on the end of the screen? You think the two are related? Leads to: \"A key and a keyhole? Ooh, I just got an idea!\" Examine key pictures on back (before examining keyhole pictures on back) Apollo: It's a picture of a key. Hmm, that shape looks awfully familiar. Oh, I know! It's shaped like the Forbidden Chamber's key. Athena: Hmm... We're definitely getting warmer... Apollo: Okay, let's take an ever closer look. Examine key pictures on back (after examining keyhole pictures on back) Apollo: It's a picture of a key. Hmm, that shape looks awfully familiar. Oh, I know! It's shaped like the Forbidden Chamber's key. Hmm... Wait! What about that keyhole drawn on the center of the screen? You think the two are related? Leads to: \"A key and a keyhole? Ooh, I just got an idea!\" Athena: A key and a keyhole? Ooh, I just got an idea! If we folded the screen up just right, the key and keyhole should overlap! Apollo: Hey, I think you're right! Athena: Let's give it a try! Apollo: Look, a door! Athena: Yeah, and it's open, too! Apollo: The two foxes are now facing each other, so... Hey, what if we made those fox statues face each other?! Athena: Apollo! Let's go check out the two statues! Apollo: Okay! Help me move the two statues so they face each other -- just like on the screen. Look! A lock appeared! Athena: Now we can use that key! Apollo: Okay, here goes nothing! Apollo: ...It worked! Athena: Time to see why this chamber's so forbidden! Apollo: What secrets could it hold, I wonder...? April 18Kyubi Manor - Forbidden Chamber *creeeeeeeeeak* *thud* Apollo: These doors need some serious oil. Athena: Aaah! That was like nails on a chalkboard! Apollo: Oh, right. Forgot about those super good ears of yours. Look, more feathers... Athena: Eeeeeeeeeeeek! Apollo: What the heck is that...? ...Is that a Tenma Taro... statue? But there's... something odd about it. Athena: Ugh... All I know is I don't like it, but I can't explain why. Apollo: You okay, Athena? You look kinda pale. You're not scared, are you? Athena: What, of this thing? Don't make me laugh, heh heh. Apollo: Really? ......Hey, look! Athena: Wh-What?! What is it?! Apollo: Over there on the left. There's a bunch of staves on that rack. (Changed from [Over there on the left. There's a bunch of staffs on that rack.] in the original release) They kinda look like the staff we saw earlier... Athena: You mean the one Jinxie said she saw Tenma Taro carrying? Apollo: Yeah. I bet our Tenma Taro impersonator really did come in here at some point. Athena: Well? What are we waiting for? Let's search the place! Examine Tenma Taro statue Apollo: Whoa, that's one big statue. Must be something like fifteen feet tall. And look! THIS Tenma Taro has a staff! But the Tenma Taro in the scroll didn't have one. Athena: Hmm... I wonder why. Apollo: I feel like this could be significant, but why...? Let's take a closer look. First, to go around this table here... Athena: Ah! Apollo, are you sure that's a good idea? Apollo: Hey, it looks like there's some sort of compartment in the base of the statue. Athena: Don't open it! Who knows what might be in there! Apollo: It's just a big empty compartment. And from all the dust and cobwebs... ...I'd say it hasn't been opened in a really long time. Athena: That's enough, Apollo. Let's shut it and-- Apollo: Wait, there IS something in here! Looks like some sort of figure. But it's so dusty, I can't tell what it's supposed to be. Wonder what it's doing here. Forbidden Chamber Figure added to the Court Record. Tenma Taro statue (subsequent times) Athena: This statue's probably twice as tall as Prosecutor Blackquill. Apollo: (Yeah, and he towers over me as it is.) Athena: It's like if you took something really scary, like a spider, and made it fifteen feet tall. Apollo: A fifteen-foot tall spider?! Athena: What? I was just exaggerating for dramatic effect. Apollo: Well, Prosecutor Blackquill may be scary, but a fifteen-foot spider is utterly terrifying! Scroll Apollo: Looks like an old scroll... and there's something drawn on it! Unless I'm mistaken, it looks like an old guy... Some sort of monk, maybe? Athena: A monk? What are you talking about? Apollo: You know, people that take walks in the mountains as a form of spiritual training... Athena: Wouldn't that just be a hiker? Apollo: The guy in this picture doesn't look like he's doing it for fun, Athena. Athena: Hmm... Oh look, there's some yellow... thing strapped to his back. Apollo: Whoa! It's turning into Tenma Taro! Athena: What's this scroll getting at? Is this how Tenma Taro was born? Apollo: Well, whatever it is, it's definitely creepy. Scroll (subsequent times) Apollo: The yellow thing the one guy had transformed into Tenma Taro! Athena: Hmm... Or maybe the picture's showing Tenma Taro getting caught in a yokai trap. I bet that yellow thing is a trap to catch the demon before he ravages the entire mountain! Apollo: I highly doubt yokai are things you can catch like a bear or wild boar. Athena: Then maybe that yellow thing is some leftovers that didn't get put in the fridge. They got all gross and moldy and out popped Tenma Taro! Apollo: You have a really active imagination. First off, they probably didn't have fridges back then... ...and second, we'd be swimming in yokai if they spawned that easily. Athena: Okay, Mr. Smarty-Pants, what is it, then? Apollo: Oh, umm... That yellow thing could've been a bomb containing Tenma Taro. And the old guys were terrorists who used yokai to further their cause. Athena: ...Apollo, if I have an active imagination, yours is hyperactive. Feathers Apollo: Black feathers... They looks exactly like the ones in the Fox Chamber. Athena: That means the killer must've been in here at some point. The question is, why? Apollo: Maybe... Maybe the Tenma Taro costume was hidden in here. I mean... ...if someone carried it through the manor, it would've stuck out like a sore thumb. Athena: But when did the killer get in here? The mayor snatched the Forbidden Chamber key when the killer hit him on the head. That means the killer could've only gotten in here before the murder. Apollo: Wow, this is one tough riddle, all right. Lanterns Apollo: A stone lantern... Athena: Like those Japanese garden lamps? Where's the switch? Apollo: Lamps like these are lit by fire not electricity, so there is no switch. Athena: Oh, here it is! Apollo: Whaaat?! Athena: It was hidden out of sight. Apollo: ...I see Tenma Taro's cell has been outfitted with all the amenities a yokai could want. Air vent Apollo: Oh, look. There's an air vent here, too. Athena: I guess even forbidden chambers need proper ventilation. Apollo: Hmm... But I don't think anyone could reach this one, either. Athena: Yeah, and there's nothing to stand on around here. I wonder where this vent leads. Apollo: Well, the Fox Chamber's vent didn't branch this way, so... Athena: Maybe it doesn't have anything to do with this case, after all. Staves Apollo: Hey, there's a bunch of staves here. And it looks like one's missing. The Tenma Taro Jinxie saw must've taken it. Athena: I'd have to agree. These look like the one Detective Fulbright showed us. Apollo: Why do you think there are so many here? Athena: Maybe they're spares. Tenma Taro might be, you know, absent-minded or something. But the fact that he has spare staves handy, well... ...it shows that he's aware of his faults, and is trying to deal with them. Or at least that's my take on it. Apollo: (Maybe this will remind her to deal with her own faults. But I won't hold my breath.) Staves (subsequent times) Athena: These look like the staff Detective Fulbright showed us. Apollo: That must mean that the Tenma Taro Jinxie saw... ...took this staff from here. I wonder what all these staves are doing here in the first place. Gravestone Apollo: Looks like a gravestone or something. Athena: It reads, \"Here lies Tenma Taro, Age 80. Cause of death: Choked on a chicken bone.\" Apollo: *gasp!* Say it ain't so! ...Besides, that sounds more like an autopsy report than an epitaph, if you ask me. Wait, you're joking around because you're scared! It's your coping mechanism! Athena: I'm n-not scared! Widget: Freak-out central! Right here, baby! Athena: Cut it out, Widget! Apollo: (Denial is strong in this one.) Cream bottle on floor Apollo: What's this? Whatever it is, the packaging is really gaudy. And the fact that there's no dust on it means it hasn't been here very long. Athena: Oh! It's hand cream. Let's see what brand it is......... \"Je suis L'Belle!\"?! Apollo: L'Belle?! (What the--?!) But then, wouldn't that mean Mr. L'Belle was here? Athena: I guess so... but why? Apollo: Well, whoever was dressed up like Tenma Taro... ...must have taken a staff from here in the Forbidden Chamber. And that same person probably dropped this hand cream at that time. Athena: In other words, the Tenma Taro impersonator we're looking for is none other than... Apollo: ...Florent L'Belle! This might be a big break for us in court tomorrow. Athena: Now all we have to do is get the truth out of Mayor Tenma! Hand Cream added to the Court Record. Cream bottle on floor (subsequent times) Apollo: Mr. L'Belle's private brand of hand cream. He must've been here in the Forbidden Chamber at some point. Athena: This could be the big break we need. After examining Tenma Taro statue, scroll, feathers, air vent, staves, and cream bottle on floor: Athena: Guess that about wraps it up. What now? Apollo: We should probably talk to some of the witnesses again. Athena: You mean like Mr. Filch... and Jinxie? Apollo: Yeah. I really want to ask Mr. Filch about the village superstitions and Tenma Taro. Talk Any ideas? Apollo: Any good ideas yet, Athena? Athena: Good ideas? You bet I do! Umm... Well, there's that thing. Apollo: Thing? What thing? ............ Athena: ............ Ugh, you saw right through me, didn't you?! Apollo: Huh? You mean you really have nothing for me? Athena: No, sorry! I just got a little carried away! Apollo: (Oh, boy. Bluffing is obviously not her strength.) The real culprit Apollo: Seems we finally have the real killer in our sights. The only person to threaten Mayor Tenma, push for the municipal merger... Athena: ...And to be identified at the manor disguised as Tenma Taro... ...is none other than Mayor Tenma's aide, Florent L'Belle! We're in for a fight tomorrow! Let's banish Tenma Taro, both literally and figuratively! Apollo: Yeah! We'll be fine between the two of us! We'll send that yokai packing, along with that twisted samurai of a prosecutor! Widget: Let's do this! Wright Anything Agency Talk Any ideas? Trucy: I was shocked to hear a demon appeared at your trial. Apollo: You were shocked? I was the one questioning him! Trucy: Wish you would've called me in. Apollo: Really? You would've come to my rescue? Trucy: With a demon like that, your tightrope-style of defense... and my magic tricks, we would've had it all. We could've been The Three Great Illusions! The audience would've been in the palm of our hand! Apollo: I'd settle for convincing the judge with some solid evidence. What to do Trucy: It's everyone's favorite, Trucy's Two Cents! Go ahead, ask me anything! Apollo: My client has turned into a demon. I don't know what he's thinking, and I have no idea what to do. Trucy: Hmm, I think this calls for... placing yourself in the other person's shoes. In other words, think of what it's like to be a demon. That should be easy for you, Polly! Apollo: Right... Okay, here goes......... Jinxie: Eeeeeek! A red demon! Apollo: Aaaaaaugh! Jinxie: Return to the black pit from whence you were spawned! Apollo: It ain't easy being a demon, that's for sure. Trucy: Hm? Fox Chamber Examine Fox statues Apollo: So, the fox statues are part of the keyhole mechanism. Athena: Let's try moving them around. Maybe something will happen! Apollo: But what if it's a trap. Who knows? The ceiling might come crashing down. Athena: Oh, will you relax? If it comes to that, I'll just dash out of the way! Apollo: Yeah, but what about me?! Folding screen Apollo: I would've never guessed the screen was the clue to the keyhole mechanism. That alderman sure was an interesting guy. Athena: I'll say! Makes me want to implement a secret locking mechanism into the office door! Apollo: What, are you planning to turn it into a Forbidden Chamber II or something? Athena: If I were, I'd need a demon to imprison... Apollo: Ha ha, very funny. But no, I'm not going to imprison myself. April 18Kyubi Manor - Foyer Filch: It's the curse, the curse! The curse of Tenma Taro! Athena: Eek! Filch: You outsiders are ignoring them superstitions at OUR peril! Mind yer own business, will ya?! Apollo: Aagh! Youch! What's all this about a curse? Filch: Tenma Taro's gonna curse us all 'less ya stop sticking yer nose where it don't belong! Stop the investigation! Listen to what them superstitions say! Athena: Right... Umm... How about obeying the law... before you go obeying the superstitions? Filch: Huh? Athena: Hey, what are you doing with Widget around your neck? He's mine! You know better than to go around stealing people's stuff like that! Apollo: The same goes for my bracelet! Filch: S-S-Sorry, sorry! I promise I won't do it again! Athena: Tsk, he almost kidnapped my sweet, little Widget. Widget: The big jerk! Filch: I'm sorrrryyyy! Apollo: *sigh* I guess you can't teach an old raccoon dog new tricks. (As long as we have him here, I guess we should ask him about what happened.) Talk Stealing Athena: I can't believe you did that! It's one thing to steal a pair of shoes, but to steal Widget! Widget: Grrr! Filch: Yiiipes! Mercy, mercy! I can't seem to control myself! It's that thieving blood running in my veins! Apollo: Thieving blood? What's that supposed to mean? Filch: Eh heh heh. Glad ya asked. The infamous bandit Azuki Kozo was my grandpappy! Take a gander at this! Apollo: What exactly am I looking at? Looks like another one of those yokai to me. Filch: It's none other than THE Azuki Kozo! Robbed from the rich to give to the poor, he did! And he'd leave one o' these figures at the scene of the crime! What's more, I'm his grandson 'cause he was my grandpappy! Apollo: Wow, you don't say! Filch: Thieves' honor, it's the honest truth! Ah... The sloshing sound of azuki beans scrapping together in the dead o' night... It's the magical sound of dirty money getting washed clean for givin' out to the poor! I'm Azuki Kozo, washer of money, giver-outer of wealth, reborn! Athena: ......... Forget the money. You should be washing yourself of this nasty habit. Apollo: (Wait a second. This figure looks familiar.) Yes! It looks just like that old, dusty figure we found in the Forbidden Chamber. Forbidden Chamber Figure updated in the Court Record. Filch: Hey! Whaddaya doing with that there figure?! Apollo: Oh, this? We found it in the Forbidden Chamber. Looks like it'd been there practically forever. Filch: Hmm... Could mean my grandpappy broke into the Forbidden Chamber way back. Hey, that reminds me. He once told me there's treasure in that there chamber! Apollo: Treasure? Forbidden Chamber Treasure (appears after \"Stealing\") Apollo: What do you know about the treasure in the Forbidden Chamber? Filch: Eh heh heh. Only that it's the greatest get-rich-quick chance in the universe. Grandpappy told me all about it. Said there's an amazing treasure in there! Apollo: There's something amazing in there? (Didn't see anything like that, though.) Your grandfather didn't, by chance, already steal it, did he? Filch: Seein' how there was one o' his figures in there, that just might be. Eh heh heh, that's Grandpappy for ya! Bet he washed that treasure up real good before handing it out to the poor. Apollo: Oh, of course, because he was so righteous... Tenma Taro sighting Apollo: In court, you mentioned seeing Tenma Taro near the scene of the crime. Filch: Sorry I didn't come clean right away, but them superstitions got the better o' me. Apollo: The people of Nine-Tails Vale sure seem like a superstitious bunch. I'm not surprised you wouldn't want to talk about seeing Tenma Taro. Filch: Darn right! Them superstitions scare me outta my wits, I tell you! That's why I'm gonna do exactly what they say from now on. Apollo: So you plan on staying here in Nine-Tails Vale? Filch: Yep. I'm gonna keep living right here 'n' keep with the old ways, just like Grandpappy did. Them superstitions are like a rulebook to me. Apollo: Wait, so you're saying you actually believe in those old wives' tales? Filch: Ain't you been listening to a word I said? Apollo: You're going to do \"exactly what them superstitions say\"? Well, I say that's baloney. Present Village Superstitions Apollo: Leads to: \"It's clearly written right here: \"Ignoring the superstitions will cost you your soul.\"\" Present anything else Apollo: Filch: ............Say, Mr. Lawyer, sir... Apollo: Yeah? Filch: I don't have much school learnin', but I ain't no dummy. That there ain't got nothing to do with me. But I'd be happy to take it off yer hands if ya wanted, eh heh heh heh. Apollo: I don't think so. (Let's try that one again.) I heard every word of what you had to say... ...but I don't believe them for a second. Leads back to: \"You're going to do \"exactly what them superstitions say\"? Well, I say that's baloney.\" Apollo: It's clearly written right here: \"Ignoring the superstitions will cost you your soul. There is, however, one way to save it: your immediate departure from the village.\" Filch: ...Ah. Apollo: So according to this, you shouldn't even be here, let along talking with us. You said you plan on staying right here in Nine-Tails Vale. But if you really believe in the superstitions, you would've been long gone by now. Filch: Uwaaah! Apollo: I know you've been lying to me! Time to come clean, Mr. Filch! Filch: Yiiiiiiiiipes! Tenma Taro sighting (second time) Apollo: You were lying about believing in the superstitions, weren't you? Filch: Sorry, but I didn't have no choice. Apollo: So, what was the real reason why you couldn't talk about seeing Tenma Taro? Filch: It's all that pretty boy's fault -- Mr. L'Belle, if ya know what I mean. He told me not to say a word 'bout seeing Tenma Taro. Said if I did, he'd do to me what them superstitions said would happen. Apollo: So, it was Mr. L'Belle who muzzled you? Why would Mr. L'Belle want to scare you into silence? Filch: Mr. L'Belle was trying to protect that little maid gal! It was on account o' that rumor! The one about her being possessed! Apollo: That rumor again... Athena: I guess we really do have to talk to Mayor Tenma about the possession rumor. Apollo: Ouch! Hey, watch it! Village Superstitions stolen by Phineas Filch! Filch: I'll be taking this back now, eh heh heh heh. Kinda like family to me. Apollo: You could've just asked instead of stealing it... Tenma Taro sighting (subsequent times) Apollo: You were lying about believing in the superstitions, weren't you? Filch: Sorry, but I didn't have no choice. Apollo: So, what was the real reason why you couldn't talk about seeing Tenma Taro? Filch: It's all that pretty boy's fault -- Mr. L'Belle, if ya know what I mean. He told me not to say a word 'bout seeing Tenma Taro. Said if I did, he'd do to me what them superstitions said would happen. Apollo: So, it was Mr. L'Belle who muzzled you? Why would Mr. L'Belle want to scare you into silence? Filch: Mr. L'Belle was trying to protect that little maid gal! It was on account o' that rumor! The one about her being possessed! Apollo: That rumor again... Athena: I guess we really do have to talk to Mayor Tenma about the possession rumor. Present Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy Filch: Hey, I know that picture! That's my Amazing Nine-Tails glossy! How dare you steal from me! Apollo: No, this is the one you gave me. Remember? You said you had lots more. Filch: I did? Well, it was never really mine in the first place, so... You can go ahead and keep it. Apollo: (Don't tell me I'm now guilty of receiving stolen goods...) Azuki Kozo Figure Apollo: So, your grandfather was a famous thief? Filch: That's right. He stole for the rich to give to the poor. Just like your Robin Hood. But in these parts, he's known as Azukikozo! He washes his loot clean before handing it out to the poor. Apollo: (It's hard to imagine Mr. Filch has such noble intentions. I bet he was planning on keeping my bracelet for himself.) After clearing all Talk options: Athena: Was that all we wanted to ask Mr. Filch? Apollo: Yeah, I think that was it. Let's go see \"Mr. Tenma Taro\" one more time. (Just thinking about dealing with that yokai again makes me want to say, \"Pass!\") April 18Detention Center - Visitor's Room Athena: Lord Tenma! Your attorneys are here to see you, Your Malevolence! Tenma: ......... Apollo: Umm......... Tenma: .........Why are you speaking like that? Athena: Oh, Mayor Tenma! You've returned...! Tenma: Yes, well, Jinxie came by earlier to apply a new charm to my head. It seems to be suppressing the demon within me. Apollo: That's a relief. Maybe we'll actually get somewhere this time. Tenma: So, what can I do for you today? Apollo: We'd like to ask about the rumor that Jinxie is possessed. Tenma: Ah! Apollo: She allegedly left the yokai evidence at the scene while under a demon's power. At least, that's what the prosecution is going to claim at tomorrow's trial. Tenma: .................. Heh heh heh... Apollo: Huh? Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! No match is this warding charm for me! Apollo: Aagh! Th-The charm! Athena: Tenma Taro's back! Tenma: Those foolish mortals! They shall regret blaming that child for my doings! Apollo: Argh, I blew it! That question brought that yokai back. (And he probably won't drop the act until Jinxie's name is cleared either.) Talk Rumor about Jinxie Apollo: We'd like to ask you about something your aide Florent L'Belle mentioned. Did you know Jinxie is rumored to be possessed? Tenma: I know not of what you speak. Apollo: You're not trying to protect Jinxie, are you? Tenma: I, Tenma Taro, demon lord of the yokai, protect a mere mortal? Caw caw-caw-caw! No affections do I possess for your race of humans. Apollo: Please! We already proved there was a third part disguised as a yokai at the scene. But if you deny that tomorrow, we'll never be able to clear Mayor Tenma's name. Tenma: .........But I have already told you, I know not of what you speak! Athena: I don't think we'll get anything more out of him. Apollo: It's all over unless we can somehow prove that Jinxie didn't plant that yokai evidence. Athena: .........Hey, Apollo? I think I've got this one. I think I can prove that she didn't do it. Apollo: Really? Athena: Sure! I should be able to use psychology to explain that whole possession thing. Apollo: Knock yourself out, then! (Wow, Athena's really something. I can really count on her when it counts!) The real story (appears after \"Rumor about Jinxie\") Athena: Mayor Tenma, Jinxie isn't possessed. I believe her so-called possession episodes are a form of somnambulism. Apollo: Somnambulism? You mean sleepwalking? Athena: Yes, I believe she is exhibiting a rare form of the disorder. It's usually brought on by repressed stress. Mr. Mayor, didn't her symptoms start soon after she began her job in Nine-Tails Vale? Tenma: ...Hrmmm. When the child visited last... ...she did speak of dreading yokai, and how they rob her of sleep each night. Athena: I knew it! That lack of sleep is causing her to enter an unconscious state. And that means she can't be trying to protect you -- at least not on a conscious level. Apollo: So then, the Tenma Taro that was spotted at the manor wasn't Jinxie. Tenma: Sleepwalking, eh? Hrmmm. That would, indeed, explain the matter. Apollo: Look! Tenma Taro's spirit! It's left the mayor's body. Athena: Can you tell us the truth now, Mayor Tenma? Tenma: Very well. It's the least I could do for a superb exorcist such as you. Feathers and tracks (appears after \"The real story\") Leads to: \"Mayor Tenma, you didn't leave those feathers and tracks at the scene, did you?\" Athena: Mayor Tenma, you didn't leave those feathers and tracks at the scene, did you? Tenma: I did not. Neither I nor Jinxie have anything to do with that. That was... the killer's doing, no doubt. Athena: I knew it! Tenma: You suspect Florent is behind all this? But why? Did he really want Nine-Tails Vale that badly? Apollo: Can you think of any reason why? Tenma: Hmm... Looking back, he did seem fixated on Tenma Taro for a spell. Ah! Could it be...?! Perhaps he was... attempting to release Tenma Taro. Apollo: That's crazy! Are you saying that yokai is real? Tenma: Whatever the case, Tenma Taro brings nothing but pain and misfortune. It's as the superstitions warn. You must not gaze upon him nor free him from his prison! Apollo: B-But... (How can people actually believe that?!) Athena: Well, at least we know who's behind this whole Tenma Taro thing now. Apollo: Yeah, and I think we need to have another nice, long chat with Mr. L'Belle. Guard: You d-d-dinner is ready, Your Malevolence! Tenma: Ah, an offering to the demon king. You may place it right there. Guard: The kitchen crew poured their heart and soul into making it. Tenma: Did they now? Souls happen to be a favorite of mine. Just, hold the hearts next time! Caw caw-caw-caw! Guard: Y-Yes, Your Malevolence! I'll remember that! Apollo: (How long is he planning to keep up this yokai charade?) Well, we've already talked to Mr. Filch and Mayor Tenma, so... Why don't we go see Florent L'Belle next? Now that we know the truth... ...he won't be able to claim that the Tenma Taro was Jinxie or the mayor anymore! Athena: But the real question is: how are we going to get him to admit it was him? Detention Center (before clearing \"Taro's true identity\" Talk option in Kyubi Manor - Foyer) Talk Feathers and tracks Athena: Mayor Tenma, you didn't leave those feathers and tracks at the scene, did you? Tenma: I did not. Neither I nor Jinxie have anything to do with that. That was... the killer's doing, no doubt. Athena: I knew it! Tenma: You suspect Florent is behind all this? But why? Did he really want Nine-Tails Vale that badly? Apollo: Can you think of any reason why? Tenma: Hmm... Looking back, he did seem fixated on Tenma Taro for a spell. Ah! Could it be...?! Perhaps he was... attempting to release Tenma Taro. Apollo: That's crazy! Are you saying that yokai is real? Tenma: Whatever the case, Tenma Taro brings nothing but pain and misfortune. It's as the superstitions warn. You must not gaze upon him nor free him from his prison! Apollo: B-But... (How can people actually believe that?!) Athena: Well, at least we know who's behind this whole Tenma Taro thing now. Apollo: Yeah, and I think we need to have another nice, long chat with Mr. L'Belle. April 18Kyubi Manor - Foyer L'Belle: Okay! Now, let's PRACTICE that AGAIN, Filchy! From the top! Filch: Errr... Mr. L'Belle was in the foyer at the time of the crime... ...and when we, uhh... heard a scream, uhh... Aw, heck! What was the next part again? Aaaargh! L'Belle: You have the memory capacity of a FLEA! This is the THIRTIETH TIME, you know! Now, a hundred times more and we're done! Apollo: (What on Earth are they practicing?) Filch: Aww, I ain't cut out for this. ......Whoopsie daisy! L'Belle: Ouuuw! Filch: Oh, begging yer pardon, Mr. L'Belle, sir. It's just, all this practice-- Yipes! L'Belle: Unbelievable! What if you had sullied MY outfit with those GRUBBY paws of yours? Apollo: ......... (Did Filch filch L'Belle's wallet just now...?) Athena: So... what do you think they're up to this time, Apollo? L'Belle: Hm? Oh, it's YOU two. Eavesdropping, are we? Pffft, you peasants are SO tacky. Well, what do YOU want with ME? Apollo: (Your confession to being the Tenma Taro imposter would be nice right about now.) Talk Taro's true identity Leads to: \"Mr. Filch filled me in on a conversation you two had.\" Present Hand Cream Apollo: (Wait, this is our trump card. Better not show it off too soon.) L'Belle: You wanted something? Apollo: Oh, um... No, never mind. L'Belle: Pffft. Apollo: Mr. Filch filled me in on a conversation you two had. And about how you told him not to say a word about seeing Tenma Taro. L'Belle: ......... Filchy, you FOOL! Filch: Yipes! L'Belle: I TOLD you nothing good would come of you RUNNING your mouth! Apollo: So why did you want to keep Mr. Filch quiet like that, Mr. L'Belle? L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Why to PROTECT darling little Jinxie, of course. Apollo: But Jinxie was never really possessed. She was sleepwalking. Being asleep at the time, she couldn't have been consciously trying to protect the mayor. That also means she couldn't have possibly been Tenma Taro. L'Belle: Interesting... But where ARE you going with this? Apollo: ...Since you asked so politely... I believe you have a different reason for trying to keep Mr. Filch quiet. That reason would be to deflect doubt away from the one who was really Tenma Taro. L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha! Now THIS is getting interesting! Are YOU insinuating that I'M Tenma Taro? So SORRY to disappoint, but I'm NOTHING of the sort! Filch: That's right! Mr. L'Belle even told me Tenma Taro was a jinx, so why would he-- Youw-ouw-ouw-ouw-ouw-ouch! L'Belle: I SAID Tenma Taro was JINXIE, you fool! Honestly! You have the memory capacity of a FLEA! Practice it a hundred more times! (Changed from [Honestly! You have the memory capacity of a FLEA! Practice it a hundred times more times [sic]!] in the original release) Filch: Yiiipes! Apollo: So, um, have you been called to testify tomorrow? L'Belle: Yes, and I'm SO looking forward to my COURTROOM debut. But you'll JUST have to wait until then, ah ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (Oh, I'll be waiting -- with a special piece of evidence I've been saving just for you.) L'Belle: FILCHY! Wake up, you lazy bones! Filch: Huh? What? Was I sleeping? *yawn* Musta been that sweet cologne o' yours, Mr. L'Belle. Made me right sleepy, it did. L'Belle: Well, it's TIME for your LESSON on what to do and say tomorrow. Filch: Oh, I'm beggin' ya! Not another lesson! I ain't cut out for this thinkin' and rememberin' stuff! Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh! Right up the schnozzola! L'Belle: Keep quiet and do EXACTLY as I say! Filch: Noooooo! Pleeeaaase! Anything but another lessooooooooon! Athena: There they go... Missed our chance to get the truth out of him. Apollo: Yeah, but we'll get the proof we need in court tomorrow, one way or another! (All that's left now is that lie Jinxie told. We'd better go clear that up before tomorrow.) Athena: You think they're done questioning Jinxie? Apollo: Maybe. Let's see if she's over on Yokai Lane shopping for more charms. April 18Nine-Tails Vale - Yokai Lane Jinxie: Accursed Nine-Tailed Fox! The time for settling the score is nigh! My grudge has but festered over time. At last, vengeance will be mine! Grrr... Grrr... Athena: She must be possessed -- er, sleepwalking again! Apollo: (...Maybe if I speak softly, I won't startle her and get a charm plastered on my forehead.) Pssst... Jinxie? Jinxie: ......Huh?! ......Oh, hello, Mr. Demon Lawyer. Ah! My charms must've fallen off again. Apollo: (Phew... Guess I can avoid a charm slap by toning down my Chords of Steel.) Athena: Are they done questioning you, Jinxie? Jinxie: Uh-huh. And on the way back, I stopped here to buy a new charm that was just released. Apollo: Yeah, which one? Jinxie: Oh, um, the one with the Nine-Tails Fox and Tenma Taro. It shows them dancing together! Apollo: Really?! Two bitter rivals dancing together? Jinxie: Uh-huh. It's a charm for rebuilding burnt bridges! Apollo: Oh, right. For the municipal merger issue. Jinxie: No, it's for the Demon Lawyer and the Insomniac Prosecutor. It'll stop you two from fighting like you did in court this morning. Apollo: We weren't fighting. It was just a spirited debate. It's what we lawyers-- Ack! Jinxie: No fighting. Apollo: *sigh* Charm-slapped again. Athena: Apollo, if you're done playing around, let's find out what she was lying about! Talk What you remember Apollo: Jinxie, it seems like you're starting to remember things. You already said the feathers and tracks weren't there when you discovered the crime. Have you remembered anything else that seems important? Jinxie: Eek! L-Like what? Apollo: Tell us what you saw that day. Maybe you'll remember something else this time. Jinxie: ...Eek! When I opened the door, Papa and Alderman Kyubi were collapsed in the Fox Chamber. That's when Papa told me to call an ambulance and the police. That's all he said before he passed out in the chair. BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: (I knew it... She's holding something back.) Present Bracelet Jinxie: That's all he said before he passed out in his chair. Perceive trembling finger on charm on \"That's all he said\" Apollo: Apollo: You were very nervous when you said, \"That's all he said,\" weren't you? I know because I saw your fingers move as if you were going to slap someone with a charm. Jinxie: Huh?! Apollo: Listen to me, Jinxie. This is very important. Did Mayor Tenma say anything else to you? Jinxie: I-It was... It was nothing. He was just talking in his sleep... Apollo: Talking in his sleep? So you admit that he DID say something else! Jinxie: E-Eeeeeek! How could you tell?! Only... Only a demon could have such powers! Leads back to Talk options Perceive wrong area Apollo: Jinxie: Eek! Apollo: Arrragh! Jinxie: D-Don't shout like that. Nearly scared the wits out of me. Uhh... And d-don't stare at me like that, either. It's creepy... Apollo: (Guess that wasn't right.) Leads back to Talk options What you remember (after perceiving) Leads to: \"Uuuh... Uuuuuuuh...\" Jinxie: Uuuh... Uuuuuuuh... L-Like I said, he was just talking in his sleep! I mean, why else would Papa say something like that! Apollo: Could you be a little more specific? Jinxie: Before he f-fainted, he said... \"Forgive me, Jinxie. I killed Alderman Kyubi.\" Apollo: He said whaaaaaaaaat?! Athena: The mayor actually confessed to the crime?! Jinxie: B-But he didn't mean it. He couldn't possibly have known what he was saying! He was probably possessed or maybe he was in the middle of a nightmare! Apollo: A nightmare? No, THIS is a nightmare...! (This is one statement I wish I'd never heard. What in the world are we going to do now?) Apollo: Return to the basics? Phoenix: That's right. Always believe in your client, no matter what happens. That is a lawyer's greatest and most trusted weapon. Apollo: (Right... Just believe in my client, even if all I can see ahead is darkness and despair.) Athena: Jinxie, does Prosecutor Blackquill know about your father's confession? Jinxie: I didn't mention it when he was questioning me. I mean, there's no way Papa's the killer! Athena: Why would the mayor confess like that? Apollo: Could he really have been dreaming, or simply delirious? Athena: Who knows, but I sure feel like I'M in a living nightmare right now. Apollo, what are we going to do about tomorrow's trial? The crime scene was locked tight until Jinxie arrived, and our client's even confessed! Not only that, Jinxie has been accused of planting the yokai evidence. Both the mayor and Jinxie are going to prison if we don't do something! Apollo: (I know, I know...) Well, let's see here... Our lack of a third party in the locked room is a major problem. Jinxie has testified that when she first opened the door... ...Alderman Kyubi and Mayor Tenma were the only people she saw in the Fox Chamber. Athena: But the real killer must've been hiding in there as well. Apollo: Considering the room was locked tight, that's the only logical explanation. Athena: Our mystery person must've then fled the Fox Chamber when it was opened. And that's when Jinxie saw what she thought was Tenma Taro! Jinxie: B-But... Papa and the alderman were the only people there. I didn't see anyone else. Apollo: (What's going on here? L'Belle's extremely pale, but he's far from transparent. So just how did he hide himself at the scene of the crime?) Athena: Whatever it takes in court tomorrow, Apollo... ...we have to take down that dirty, rotten \"Tenma Taro\" Florent L'Belle! Apollo: Right. We'll get him with a legal exorcism, Justice style! To be continued Nothing to examine during investigation Athena: Apollo, it doesn't look like there's anything particularly interesting here. Examine insignificant area on evidence Apollo: Nothing particularly interesting here. Area already examined Apollo: (We've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around.)\n-- What L'Belle Saw --L'Belle: I was in the hallway, HIDING in the shadows. THAT'S when I heard the confession.Press Apollo: Apollo: You claim that the mayor confessed to his daughter. Are you sure about that? L'Belle: PEASANT! You wouldn't DARE ask such a question if you truly understood. TRUE beauty is never wrong. Apollo: It's not? L'Belle: No, beauty is carved DEEP in the DNA. That means I'M programmed to ALWAYS be right, EVEN when I'm wrong. Apollo: I'm not following. L'Belle: These exquisite ears like flowers abloom... These eyes that shine like pearls... This hair like the finest silk... Nothing can corrupt the truth they hold! Apollo: Uh... right... Judge: Hmm... The witness will hurry up and explain this truth of his. Specifically, what did Jinxie Tenma do upon hearing the confession?L'Belle: Upon LEARNING of her father's crime, little Jinxie fled without EVER noticing me.Press Apollo: Apollo: How did Ms. Tenma appear to you? L'Belle: Oh, the poor little thing seemed POSITIVELY heartbroken -- all teary eyed and whatnot. I couldn't help but shed a few tears myself after seeing her like that. Athena: He actually sympathized with Jinxie? Seems like an overly human emotion for him. Apollo: Yeah, because he's the only real monster we've seen so far -- in looks and in character. L'Belle: The NEXT thing I did was check my face in the mirror. Apollo: Checked your face? Why? L'Belle: Pffft! To behold the beauty that is my sadness, why else! Athena: ...Apollo, I'm starting to lose all faith in humanity. Apollo: I know the feeling, but hang in there. At least keep faith in our client. Judge: Let's keep moving, shall we? So what happened next?L'Belle: Immediately AFTER that, the mayor came to, stood up and opened the Forbidden Chamber!Press Apollo: Apollo: He opened the Forbidden Chamber? But why would he do that? L'Belle: Who knows? MAYBE he wanted to free the demon, Tenma Taro? Apollo: Apollo: The courtroom is no place for fairy tales! Remember, you ARE under oath! L'Belle: Hello? L'Belle speaking. ...Yes, I will CERTAINLY explore the matter. Toodles! Now, WHERE were we again? Apollo: You were going to tell us the real reason why the mayor opened the Forbidden Chamber! L'Belle: Oh, yes! Of course. Hello? This is L'Belle. ...A ha ha ha! Good one, sir! You're an ABSOLUTE riot. ...Okay, bye. You were saying? Apollo: Never mind. (This is a waste of time. He's just going to tell more lies.) Judge: The witness will focus on his testimony, not his phone calls. Now, tell the court what you did after you saw the mayor open the Forbidden Chamber. L'Belle: Well, after THAT...L'Belle: As I ran in TERROR, the demon emerged from his prison!Press Apollo: Apollo: What was Mr. Filch like at the time? L'Belle: He was shouting, \"I can't see! I can't see! It's the curse o' Tenma Taro!\" THEN, he took off running like a MADMAN. Apollo: He must've been blinded by the sudden light flooding in. L'Belle: Wrong. Apollo: What? L'Belle: He set EYES upon me... ...and was thus BLINDED by my radiant beauty! Apollo: ......... Athena: ...So, it was the curse of Florent L'Belle, rather than Tenma Taro? L'Belle: Yes, I'm afraid such beauty can be a curse. It's almost criminal. Blackquill: ...The only thing criminal here... is your ceaseless jabbering. Now, get on with your testimony. L'Belle: Oh, forgive me, Your Darkness. Let's see... Oh, yes. I FLED for dear life from Tenma Taro, and...L'Belle: In shock, I FLED down the hallway to my right -- the one with the PHONE at the end.Press Apollo: Apollo: So, after you fled into the hallway with the phone at the end... ...Tenma Taro ran off toward the foyer? L'Belle: PRECISELY. Athena: Notice any inconsistencies, Apollo? Apollo: Well, Jinxie also saw Tenma Taro, right? Athena: She did. She said they passed each other in the hall after she made that call to the police. Apollo: Well, if L'Belle had fled down the hall where that phone is... ...Jinxie would've seen him when she was returning from making her call. Athena: Oh, right. And if she saw him, she would've definitely asked him for help. Apollo: Right. It just doesn't make any sense. (Time to review the evidence.)Present Jinxie's Statement Apollo: Leads to: \"Florent L'Belle, you're lying about having witnessed those events from the hallway!\"Athena: If we don't find some way to poke a hole in his testimony... ...Mayor Tenma is as good as guilty!Apollo: This is bad, very bad.Athena: We need to find an inconsistency, a mistake, some kind of conflict!Apollo: (It's all over if we can't find a flaw in the prosecution's case!)Apollo: Florent L'Belle, you're lying about having witnessed those events from the hallway!L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! What on EARTH do you mean?Judge: Yes, care to fill the rest of us in, Mr. Justice?Apollo: If Mr. L'Belle had really fled down into the hall with the phone in it... ...he would've crossed paths with Ms. Tenma.L'Belle: ...What's this?Apollo: After she discovered the crime scene, she immediately went to call the police. Then, after making her call, she went back to the main hallway... ...whereupon she encountered the demon, yokai, or whatever you want to call it. As for me, I call it Phineas Filch in a Tenma Taro costume! The encounter happened right there, where the hallways meet. As for Mr. L'Belle, if he had fled here, feigning escape from the yokai imposter...Judge: Why, yes! The two would've crossed paths!Apollo: Right. Except Ms. Tenma told us that \"there was no one else in the hall.\" In short, Ms. Tenma did not see you in the hall because you were never really there!L'Belle: Aaaaaah! My eyes! My beautiful eyes!Apollo: (Hah! Not such a FABULOUS scent now, is it!)Judge: But Mr. Justice, the witness also stated that he heard the mayor confess. If he was lying about hearing the confession from the hall... ...then where was he when he heard it?Apollo: Inside the Fox Chamber, where else?Judge: Hmm... But isn't that within the very crime scene?!Apollo: It is, Your Honor. And that means he's not really a witness. Rather, he's the third party I've been alleging this whole time!L'Belle: What?! You think I'M the killer? How DARE you!Blackquill:Blackquill: Foolish fop. A true man knows when he is beaten. A shield of lies comes to naught before a foe with the sword of truth bared.L'Belle: P-Prosecutor Blackquill, what ARE you...? I thought WE were on the SAME side?Blackquill: You are mistaken. There are no sides here, save for my cold, steely edge of judgment. You are alone upon this battlefield, with naught but your lies and sickly sweet perfume.Apollo: (Whoa, what just happened? Blackquill's really tearing into him!)Blackquill: You heard the mayor's confession from the inside, did you not, you deviant dandy? For the sole location from which you could've seen and heard the mayor and the tanuki... ...without either of them noticing you was right there in the Fox Chamber.L'Belle: .........Oh, my. So THAT'S how it's going to be? Fine, I'll come clean, then.Apollo: Seriously? You admit to being there in the Fox Chamber?L'Belle: I do! I DID enter the room AFTER the murder. But I was afraid of being FALSELY accused, so I lied about it. I feel TERRIBLE about lying like that. But it's a verbal cologne I use to PROTECT myself.Apollo: You'd better explain yourself, Mr. L'Belle!L'Belle: Yes, of course! I was JUST about to get to that!Judge: The witness is skating on thin ice. I'll remind you that perjury is a very serious crime. Now, let's hear your testimony again, this time without your perfume of lies.Witness Testimony-- In the Fox Chamber --L'Belle: I DID enter the Fox Chamber after the murder. But I DIDN'T enter until AFTER Jinxie had heard the confession and left. I HEARD the mayor groan and hid behind the folding screen there. What I saw there up close... It was absolutely HORRIFYING! So you SEE, I was THERE, but merely watching from behind the screen.Judge: From behind the screen? Why, yes, I believe you wouldn't be spotted if you were there.Blackquill: Just so. He could see everything without being spotted by the victim or that tanuki Filch. Suffice to say, he was mere witness to the events, rather than an actual third party.Apollo: ......... (This guy's as slippery as an eel.)Athena: Apollo, you think he's telling the truth?Apollo: Well, he WAS in the Fox Chamber, so at least that much must be true.Judge: The defense may cross-examine our slightly voyeuristic witness.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- In the Fox Chamber --L'Belle: I DID enter the Fox Chamber after the murder.Press Apollo: Apollo: Why in the world would you enter that grisly crime scene? L'Belle: WHY? Because I was WORRIED sick. Mayor Tenma's suit, it... Apollo: It what? L'Belle: It was designed PERSONALLY by me. I was WORRIED my work of art might get blood on it. Apollo: (This man clearly has his priorities in order...) L'Belle: Okay, let's get this over with, SHALL WE? Now, where was I? Oh, yes, so I ENTERED the Fox Chamber almost WITHOUT thinking.L'Belle: But I DIDN'T enter until AFTER Jinxie had heard the confession and left.Press Apollo: Apollo: Why didn't you enter right away? L'Belle: And RUIN my designer shoes? Apollo: Your shoes? L'Belle: Even now, just THINKING about getting blood on my FABULOUS footwear... It sends CHILLS down my spine. That's why I hesitated. Athena: Athena: That's terrible! A man was dying and another injured and you're worried about your shoes?! Blackquill: Blackquill: Need I remind you, this is a court of law. We are not teaching morality here. We have schools of etiquette and such for trivial pursuits. Athena: Gah. Blackquill: Now, you listen to me, you deceptive dandy. Get to the point and be quick about it. L'Belle: ...Yes, well, I WAS there in the Fox Chamber, BUT...L'Belle: I HEARD the mayor groan and hid behind the folding screen there.Press Apollo: Apollo: Wait a second! Why did you hide yourself? L'Belle: Oh, my. So you DO understand! Apollo: I do? L'Belle: By hiding, I was concealing my FABULOUS beauty, which, for the sake of the universe... ...is something I should NEVER EVER do! THAT'S what you were thinking, right? Apollo: (I'm sensing a black hole of egocentricity forming around the witness stand.) Blackquill: We can deliberate his mental process another time. Get on with the testimony. Now! L'Belle: Well, regarding the murder scene...L'Belle: What I saw there up close... It was absolutely HORRIFYING!Press Apollo: Apollo: Could you describe the crime scene in a bit more detail? L'Belle: Hm? And WHAT exactly would you like DETAILS about? Apollo: Well, what I'd like to ask you about is... The feathers and tracks Apollo: What do you remember about the yokai feathers and tracks? L'Belle: They RESULTED when Tenma Taro EXITED the Forbidden Chamber. He came out in QUITE a rush, scattering feathers THIS way and THAT. Apollo: Did you immediately know it was Mr. Filch? L'Belle: I did. And THAT'S why I suggested we cook up our alibis together. Apollo: And how did those practice sessions go? L'Belle: They were NEARLY the death of me. Filchy has to be the WORST STUDENT EVER. Athena: He really doesn't think he's done anything wrong, does he? Judge: Well, Mr. Justice? Do you consider his statement to be of any importance? Apollo: (Is it important?) Very important Apollo: Yes, I believe it is, Your Honor. I request that it be added to the testimony! Adds statement \"The yokai feathers and tracks weren't there before the Fox Chamber was opened.\" or changes statement from \"The Forbidden Chamber was shut tight until the mayor opened it.\" or \"A statue had fallen to the floor. It was a token of goodwill celebrating the municipal merger.\" to \"The yokai feathers and tracks weren't there before the Fox Chamber was opened.\" Not so important Apollo: (It's probably not particularly important.) No, Your Honor. The witness may proceed. L'Belle: All right, then. I would JUST like to add that it was a TERRIBLY grisly scene, as I have described. Leads back to cross-examination The feathers and tracks (after adding statement \"The yokai feathers and tracks weren't there before the Fox Chamber was opened.\") Apollo: What do you remember about the yokai feathers and tracks? L'Belle: They RESULTED when Tenma Taro EXITED the Forbidden Chamber. He came out in QUITE a rush, scattering feathers THIS way and THAT. Apollo: Did you immediately know it was Mr. Filch? L'Belle: I did. And THAT'S why I suggested we cook up our alibis together. Apollo: And how did those practice sessions go? L'Belle: They were NEARLY the death of me. Filchy has to be the WORST STUDENT EVER. Athena: He really doesn't think he's done anything wrong, does he? Apollo: (I've already had him add this statement to his testimony... ...but is there really anything there? Maybe I should try reviewing the evidence.) Leads back to cross-examination The Forbidden Chamber Apollo: Could you please describe the Forbidden Chamber at the time? L'Belle: It was SHUT tight until the MAYOR opened it. Apollo: (He's really trying to stress that it was the mayor who opened the Forbidden Chamber.) Athena: Tsk, that big liar! He opened it himself! Apollo: (Whoa. If looks could kill, L'Belle would be toast!) Judge: Well, Mr. Justice? Do you consider his statement to be of any importance? Apollo: (Is it important?) Very important Apollo: I have a feeling it is. Let's add it to the testimony, just in case. Adds statement \"The Forbidden Chamber was shut tight until the mayor opened it.\" or changes statement from \"The yokai feathers and tracks weren't there before the Fox Chamber was opened.\" or \"A statue had fallen to the floor. It was a token of goodwill celebrating the municipal merger.\" to \"The Forbidden Chamber was shut tight until the mayor opened it.\" Not so important Apollo: (It's probably not particularly important.) No, Your Honor. The witness may proceed. L'Belle: All right, then. I would JUST like to add that it was a TERRIBLY grisly scene, as I have described. Leads back to cross-examination The Forbidden Chamber (after adding statement \"The Forbidden Chamber was shut tight until the mayor opened it.\") Apollo: Could you please describe the Forbidden Chamber at the time? L'Belle: It was SHUT tight until the MAYOR opened it. Apollo: (He's really trying to stress that it was the mayor who opened the Forbidden Chamber.) Athena: Tsk, that big liar! He opened it himself! Apollo: (Whoa. If looks could kill, L'Belle would be toast! I've already had him add this statement to his testimony... ...but is there really anything there? Maybe I should try reviewing the evidence.) Leads back to cross-examination The murder weapon Apollo: Could you describe the state of the weapons that had been used at the scene? L'Belle: The spear had been thrust ALL the way through Alderman Kyubi. Then there was that STATUE the alderman used to BLUDGEON Mayor Tenma. That INCREDIBLY inspiring symbol had fallen to the floor. Apollo: (Oh, right, the statue... But why would he find it inspiring?) Why exactly did you find the statue inspiring? L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Well! When I saw THAT statue... I felt as if the MERGER had been realized! It was like... ...a celebration of union between town and village -- an INSPIRING symbol of goodwill! Apollo: (A broken statue next to a bloody corpse... Real inspiring...) Judge: Well, Mr. Justice? Do you consider his statement to be of any importance? Apollo: (Is it important?) Very important Apollo: I believe that to be extremely important! I request that it be added to the testimony! (Changed from [I believe that to be extremely importantly [sic]! I request that it be added to the testimony!] in the original release) Adds statement \"A statue had fallen to the floor. It was a token of goodwill celebrating the municipal merger.\" or changes statement from \"The yokai feathers and tracks weren't there before the Fox Chamber was opened.\" or \"The Forbidden Chamber was shut tight until the mayor opened it.\" to \"A statue had fallen to the floor. It was a token of goodwill celebrating the municipal merger.\" Not so important Apollo: (It's probably not particularly important.) No, Your Honor. The witness may proceed. L'Belle: All right, then.

Leads back to cross-examinationL'Belle: The yokai feathers and tracks weren't there before the Fox Chamber was opened.Press Apollo: Apollo: They were left there by Mr. Filch, weren't they. L'Belle: They WERE, indeed. And it was QUITE a shock when I saw that yokai. Judge: I can't imagine how terrifying it must've been to see this face emerging from the darkness. Apollo: (Okay, so he's not even reality TV-grade handsome. Can we move on now?) Athena: Apollo, you think that statement's important? Apollo: I don't think there's anything particularly unusual there, so let's keep going.L'Belle: The Forbidden Chamber was shut tight until the mayor opened it.Press Apollo: Apollo: You're lying about the mayor opening the Forbidden Chamber, aren't you?! L'Belle: In a SENSE, yes, it COULD be seen as a lie. Apollo: Wait, so you admit it? L'Belle: In this world RIDDLED with deceit, my beauty is the ONLY self-evident truth! That is to say, all else except me is but fiction and lies. Apollo: (The nerve of this guy! His testimony is riddled with lies! Looks like I won't be getting anything useful out of this statement.)L'Belle: A statue had fallen to the floor. It was a token of goodwill celebrating the municipal merger.Press Apollo: Apollo: A token of goodwill... Are you referring to the fox and demon statue? L'Belle: Yes, the STATUE the alderman allegedly use to STRIKE BACK at Mayor Tenma. The mayor TRAMPLED down municipal goodwill only to be CLOBBERED by its symbol! It's QUITE ironic, don't you think? Apollo: (And that's when that symbol of goodwill was transformed into a symbol of conflict.)Present Fox and Demon Statue Apollo: Leads to: \"Your lies have finally betrayed you, Mr. L'Belle!\"L'Belle: So you SEE, I was THERE, but merely watching from behind the screen.Press Apollo: Apollo: The mayor had been knocked out by a blow to the head. Could he really have opened the Forbidden Chamber in that state? L'Belle: Well, it DID seem difficult. He was ALL woozy and stumbling around as he opened it. It was SUCH a heroic effort that I NEARLY started to cheer him on despite myself! Apollo: (I think the mayor needed medical attention more than a cheerleader.)Athena: You think he's telling the truth about being there in that room?Apollo: Well, I believe he was there... The question is, when did he enter?Athena: You mean, did he enter after Jinxie fled... ...or was he there before the murder? If it's the latter, that would change everything.Apollo: Right. If he was there before the murder, that would make him a suspect.Athena: But how do we go about proving that?Apollo: Well... I guess we ask him about what happened there. Anyway, let's press him and see what kind of info we can extract from him.Athena: Let's cross our fingers that he says or reveals something incriminating.\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Trucy Wright\nDescription: An aspiring magician who Mr. Wright adopted when duty called.\nCharacter 1\nName: Jinxie Tenma\nDescription: The maid of Kyubi Manor and a friend of Trucy.

    "cot": "Evidence 7, the Fox and Demon Statue, contains information about the nature and symbolism of the statue found at the crime scene. The updated evidence reveals that the statue originally depicted the Nine-Tailed Fox and Tenma Taro holding up a cup in celebration, serving as a token of goodwill and a symbol of unity between Nine-Tails Vale and Tenma Town. However, L'Belle's testimony (Testimony 6) states: \"A statue had fallen to the floor. It was a token of goodwill celebrating the municipal merger.\" This is suspicious because at the time of the murder, the merger had not been celebrated—there was fierce opposition and the victim (Rex Kyubi) was against it. Only Jinxie and the alderman knew what the statue originally represented, and the cup portion symbolizing goodwill was missing/broken off. If L'Belle was supposedly only present after the crime, he should not have known the statue's true, original symbolism. This mistake reveals that L'Belle had foreknowledge of the statue’s previous state or had been informed of its design by someone privy to closely held secrets, suggesting his deeper involvement.\n",

To this day, it is said that he slumbers even still within the Forbidden Chamber. Man: Night, night, alderman... Sweet dreams! At long last... The revival of Tenma Taro is at hand. A few months prior to the courthouse bombing... April 17, 12:13 PMWright Anything Agency Apollo: Hm. Guess I'm a little early. Trucy: Oh, hey, Apollo! Getting an early start today? Apollo: Yeah! This is the first job I've had in a while after all! Trucy: Well, aren't we all fired up! Apollo: Well, it's not every day I get a call from Mr. Wright. What kind of work is it anyway? Mr. Wright didn't mention any details. Trucy: Work? Is that how he put it? Apollo: (Don't tell me he just wants me to clean the toilet again.) Trucy: You've really become a fixture around here, Apollo. Apollo: (Come to think of it, it's been almost a year since I was hired. A lot's happened since then... ...But I've settled in nicely despite a few bumps in the road.) Apollo: My name is Apollo Justice. I've been practicing law for about a year, but I still have a lot to learn. This is the Wright Anything Agency, and it's where I work. Don't let the name fool you -- it's definitely a law agency. Trucy: But don't forget that this place is a \"talent agency\" too, Polly! Apollo: Uhh, it's the \"law agency\" part of this office that's usually forgotten... This is Trucy Wright, a budding magician... ...and adopted daughter of the agency's owner, Phoenix Wright. She sometimes makes me help with her magic tricks. Trucy: And what's wrong with that? You're one of the agency's \"talents\" as well! Apollo: I was under the impression that I was a lawyer... Trucy: Oh, we'd better hurry. Doesn't look Daddy's going to make it, so let's get going. Apollo: Huh? Where are we going? What about the job he mentioned? Trucy: This IS the job, Polly! You're supposed to keep me company today! Now, come on! Apollo: Another day of not being a lawyer. Should've seen this coming. Trucy: Well, this is the \"Wright ANYTHING Agency,\" y'know. And there's no law-related work at the moment, so... Apollo: (Tell me again why I chose to \"work\" here?) Where is Mr. Wright, anyway? Trucy: Daddy said something about going to meet an acquaintance. But don't worry. Just focus on your job, and I'll tell you exactly what you need to know. Well, let's go. We don't have all day! Apollo: Wait a second! (*sigh* And another day of \"anything goes\" begins at the Wright Anything Agency...) April 17, 1:30 PMNine-Tails Vale - Yokai Lane Apollo: Whew... So, what are we doing way up here in the mountains? Trucy: This is Nine-Tails Vale. Everyone's been talking about the yokai craze here. Apollo: Yokai? Oh, you mean Japanese monsters? Guess that explains all these weird things... Speaking of which, wasn't Nine-Tails Vale founded by Japanese immigrants? Trucy: Yeah. They're holding a festival to boost tourism over at the alderman's manor. My friend who works there invited us. That's why we're here! Apollo: In other words, I'm your chaperon because your dad was too busy. Trucy: Daddy said that with those horns of yours, you'd make a great addition to their festival. I mean, you look just like a Japanese demon! Wasn't that so thoughtful of him, Polly?! Apollo: I could do without thoughtfulness like that. Trucy: Oh, it's almost time! Come on, Polly! The festival grounds are this way. Apollo: (Alright, I guess it's time to move to the \"Kyubi Manor's Garden\"...) Talk The monster craze Apollo: This monster craze... Come to think of it, I think I heard about it on TV. It's supposedly how Nine-Tails Vale made a comeback from the brink of fiscal disaster. Trucy: Hmm... Our agency could sure use something positive like that. Oh, I know! Let's jump on board the monster craze! You and daddy would be a perfect comedy duo! You could call yourselves Agni & Rudra, Demon Kings of Comedy! Daddy sets them up, and you knock 'em down! Hey, I think we hit the jackpot with this idea! Apollo: Um... Sorry, but I plan on staying a lawyer. Trucy: You do?! Apollo: (You don't have to act so surprised by that.) What to do Apollo: Hey, Trucy? Have you seen my attorney's badge? Trucy: How could you lose something so important? Sometimes I really wonder about you, Apollo. Apollo: This is so weird. I wonder if I dropped it somewhere. Trucy: Oh, look! What are these panties doing here? Apollo: Forget about panties. I'm looking for my badge. Trucy: 3, 2, 1... Ta-dah! Did you forget? These are my magic panties! Apollo: ......Hey! That's my attorney's badge! Wow! How'd you do that? Trucy: I set it all up while we were back at the office. Apollo: Wow, I didn't even-- Wait, you took my badge?! Present Attorney's Badge Apollo: Check it out. Trucy: You're so lucky, Apollo. Everyone can see what you do with just a flash of your badge. Apollo: What about you, Trucy? People can tell you're a magician by the way you're dressed. Trucy: Yeah, but I can't always dress like this. Like when I'm at school and stuff. Apollo: You could always show you're a magician by making things appear or disappear. Trucy: You mean like this? 3, 2, 1... Ta-dah! Apollo: Umm, magic or no, aren't you a little old to be showing those things in public? Trucy: Hmm... Then maybe I'll become a lawyer, too. Apollo: You're abandoning your dream just like that?! April 17, 2:05 PMKyubi Manor - Garden Apollo: Wow, this place is really something. Trucy: It definitely feels like a different world here. ???: Trucy. Trucy: Jinxie! Apollo: And this is? Trucy: My friend, Jinxie Tenma. She's the one who invited us. She just happens to be the maid here. Jinxie: ...Two horns. A love of red. Are you a demon? Apollo: No, ha ha. I'm Apollo Justice! Nice to meet you! Jinxie: Eeeeeek! He IS a demon! Apollo: What the--! Jinxie: Be gone, foul beast! Trucy: Hee hee! You look great, Polly. Fills in some of that space on your forehead! Apollo: Argh... What is this thing? Trucy: It's a warding charm. Jinxie puts them on all the monsters she finds. Apollo: Um, but I'm not a monster. Trucy: Maybe I should have told her you're a good demon. Apollo: Or you could just say I'm human. Jinxie: *shiver* The red demon, emissary of the Underworld. Apollo: (I got up early to do my hair for this?) Um, can I take this off now? Jinxie: So you can eat me? Apollo: I'm not going to eat you! Jinxie: Eek! Forgive me, O terrible one! Trucy: Tone down your Chords of Steel, Apollo. You're scaring her out of her wits! Apollo: Um, don't worry. I'm already full. Jinxie: Please stay that way. Apollo: (Great, now I'm playing along, too.) Talk Nine-Tails Vale Apollo: Um, so I wanted to ask you about Nine-Tails Vale... Jinxie: Eeeeeek! Apollo: Aaaaugh! Jinxie: Be gone, foul demon! Trucy: Looks like you've been demonized, Polly, literally! Apollo: I'm starting to wonder if I really am a demon myself. Um... Jinxie: Eek! Please don't eat me. I have food if you're hungry. Apollo: This isn't working. We won't get anything out of her until we set the record straight. Trucy: Hmmm... If only we had some way to prove you're not as scary as you look. Apollo: (Ouch, unnecessary roughness... Looks like I have to present some proof. Proof that I'm one hundred percent human! (Changed from [Proof that I'm 100% human!] in the original release)) Present Attorney's Badge Apollo: Would you mind taking a look at this? Jinxie: Eeeeek! No, thank you! Be gone, foul demon! Apollo: Ack, banished again. Trucy: That's what you get when you flash a girl like that -- even if it was just your badge. Apollo: Sheesh, you make it sound like I'm some kind of creep. Attorney's Badge (after clearing \"Nine-Tails Vale\" Talk option) Leads to: \"Um, I wanted to show you this.\" Apollo: Um, I wanted to show you this. Jinxie: Eek! What is it?! Apollo: It's my attorney's badge. You see? I'm not a demon, I'm a lawyer. Jinxie: Really?! ...You're a lawyer? Apollo: (Whew... Maybe now she'll stop calling me a demon.) Jinxie: Does it protect you from Enma Dai-O's judgment? Apollo: Who's Enma Dai-O? Trucy: I read somewhere that he's the demon lord who punishes the dead for their sins. (Changed from [I read somewhere that's [sic] he's the demon lord who punishes the dead for their sins.] in the original release) Uh-oh! I think now she thinks you're a demon lawyer from hell, Polly! Apollo: Can I go back to being just a normal demon?! Jinxie: Please... Please don't boil me in a scalding cauldron. I'd prefer a Turkish bath if possible. Apollo: (A Turkish bath? Isn't that more sauna than bath?) Trucy: Don't worry, Jinxie, he's a good demon. He'll save you if you ever go astray! Jinxie: Eek! Please, Mr. Demon Lawyer, sir, have mercy on my soul! Apollo: Argh! I told you, I'm not a demon! And Trucy, you're just making things wors--! (Ack!) Umm... You just leave that Enma Dai-O to me. Trucy: Isn't that great, Jinxie?! Jinxie: Uh-huh. I'm no longer scared to cross into the afterlife. Apollo: (Will someone tell these two I'm human, already!) Talk Nine-Tails Vale Trucy: So, Jinxie, I hear this village is the epicenter of the monster craze. Jinxie: Uh-huh. Barely anyone had even heard of it before, but now it's packed with tourists. Apollo: Really? So, the monster craze is the reason behind today's festival? Jinxie: It was the alderman's idea. But I'd be careful if I were you. There are lots and lots of yokai prowling about Nine-Tails Vale. Apollo: Prowling about? You mean like wild animals or something? Jinxie: Uh-huh. And they're hungry, too. Apollo: Man-eating monsters?! And they're all over the place? Jinxie: Uh-huh. In fact, there was one at the manor yesterday. I heard the doorbell ring, but when I opened the door, nobody was there. It was the Ding-Dong Demon! How else could you explain it? Apollo: Well... When I was a kid, my friends used to play this prank called Ding-Dong Ditch. Jinxie: Well, that doesn't prove yokai aren't real. There's even one here at the manor. The demon Tenma Taro -- he's imprisoned in the Forbidden Chamber. Apollo: Tenma... Taro? The Forbidden Chamber? Tenma Taro (appears after \"Nine-Tails Vale\") Leads to: \"Um, about that yokai you said was imprisoned here at the manor. Is it true?\" Present Attorney's Badge Jinxie: So you really are a demon lawyer. Ummm... So, then, you must know Enma Dai-O, the Appraiser of Souls. What's he like? Apollo: What's he like?! Well, uh... he's um... He's bald, has a white beard, and... Jinxie: A-A-And what? Apollo: He shouts, \"Guilty!\" and \"Order!\", while banging his gavel. I call him \"The Judge.\" Jinxie: Oh, wow, he's as scary as I thought. Apollo: Nah, he's just an old man who's wiser than you might think. Apollo: Um, about that yokai you said was imprisoned here at the manor. Is it true? Jinxie: Uh-huh. He's a super evil demon named Tenma Taro. Here, take a look at this scroll. Tenma Taro's the dark demon you see here. He's super evil and super scary. Apollo: So that's the yokai imprisoned in the Forbidden Chamber? Jinxie: Uh-huh. He was defeated by the village guardian yokai, the Nine-Tailed Fox... ...and locked away forever. Apollo: So... you're saying Tenma Taro is still trapped inside the Forbidden Chamber? Jinxie: Uh-huh. But he's just biding his time until he can escape. Still, we should be perfectly safe! Because there's a reeeally powerful sealing charm on the door keeping it shut tight! Apollo: (What a... charming security system.) Jinxie: You can keep the scroll if you want. The alderman gave me this, but just holding it gives me the chills, so... Apollo: Ah, uh, thanks, Jinxie. (Maybe I'll give this to Mr. Wright.) Yokai Legend Scroll added to the Court Record. Apollo: So... I was wondering... Are those things on your forehead also warding charms, Jinxie? Jinxie: Yes, they're to prevent evil things from getting inside me. Papa told me to wear them. Apollo: Evil things? Trucy: Apollo, don't you dare take those charms off her forehead! They HAVE to stay there... forever! Got it?! Apollo: (I wonder what would happen if I did take them off...?) Jinxie: It's time for me to get back to work. Trucy: Thanks for inviting us, Jinxie! Jinxie: You're welcome. Oh, and before I forget... There's going to be a surprise event today. Even I don't know what's to expect, but it's sure to be fun. Apollo: (Better not be a yokai parade. She'd probably drop dead from fright.) Jinxie: .........Hm? .........Eeeeek! Apollo: Ahhh! D-D-Demon! (Oh, wait... It's just someone in a suit... right?) Jinxie: T-T-Tenma T-Taro! Apollo: Tenma Taro? (The demon from the Forbidden Chamber?) Jinxie: Eeeeeek! Please don't hurt me! Be gone! Be gone! Be gone! Tenma Taro: Hissssssss! Better watch out little girl, or I'll snatch you away! Jinxie: Eek! Charm charm charm...! Where's that \"Die and Go To Heaven\" charm?! Trucy: Oh, she put it on her own forehead this time! Apollo: ...She sure gives up quick. (Huh? Why's everyone hiding their faces?) Villager: Hey, you there! You mustn't stare at Tenma Taro like that! Lower your eyes! He'll steal your soul if you're not careful! Apollo: Huh? (Steal my soul? Seriously?) ???: Your devilry stops here and now, Tenma Taro! Apollo: Now what?! Trucy: Look, Apollo! There's somebody up on the roof! ???: Ah-ha ha ha ha ha! Villager: That booming laugh! Could it be...! ???: My nine golden tails are proof of my unassailable righteousness! With my band of one hundred minions, I vanquish evil from the land! (Changed from [With my band of 100 minions, I vanquish evil from the land!] in the original release) I am the wrestler of righteousness! Ya-ha! Wrestler: The golden lord of yokai, The Amazing Nine-Tails, is here! Fear not, good little boys and girls! For I shall defeat Tenma Taro! Ah-ha ha ha ha ha! Ah-ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha! Villager: Hurray! Hurray! It's The Amazing Nine-Tails! Wrestler: Up to your no good tricks again, eh, Tenma Taro?! Well, not on my watch! Tenma Taro: Aaaaaaaaaaaah! Wrestler: A-ha ha ha ha ha ha! There's nothing to fear now, my child! I have banished Tenma Taro! You and your people can now live in peace! Jinxie: Th-Thank you, Mr. Amazing Nine-Tails, sir! Wrestler: Now, I must be off! Another match and another foe to vanquish, await! Apollo: W-What was that all about? Did that wrestler just chase off a yokai? Looked like he came out of the alderman's manor. Jinxie: That was The Amazing Nine-Tails! He's a pro wrestler from right here in Nine-Tails Vale. But no one knows his true identity! Apollo: (Jinxie sure seems chipper all of a sudden.) What was all that about him banishing Tenma Taro? Jinxie: That was a yokai exorcism. It's an annual ritual where Tenma Taro is released, to remind us of his wickedness. In the end, the Nine-Tailed Fox drives Tenma Taro out, and purifies our village. But The Amazing Nine-Tails did the honors this year! Apollo: (So that was the big surprise, huh? The Amazing Nine-Tails and Tenma Taro, huh... Well, whatever floats her boat.) Jinxie: Oh, would you look at the time. I'd better get back to work. Please excuse me. Apollo: She's a strange one, all right. Trucy: I think she's sweet in her own special way. (Changed from [I think she's sweet in own her [sic] special way.] in the original release) Apollo: (Knowing Trucy, she probably has lots of friends who are \"sweet\" in their own way.) Trucy: Well, we still have some time to kill. Might as well see the rest of Nine-Tails Vale while we're here. Apollo: The fun never stops, does it? .............................. .............................. April 17, 3:40 PMKyubi Manor - Garden Trucy: I think I bought nearly every yokai souvenir that was for sale. Apollo: I know, because my wallet's running on empty. Trucy: Hm? What's with all the commotion over there? Apollo: Huh? Hey, isn't that your friend Jinxie?! I hope everything's okay. Jinxie: I-I-It's t-t-terrible! Th-Th-Thththth...! The--! The--! Trucy: Calm down, Jinxie! Tell us what happened. Jinxie: Th-Th-The demon T-Tenma T-Taro... ...He killed Alderman Kyubi! Apollo: Whaaaaaat?! Trucy: Wait, killed as in dead? Jinxie: Yes. And Tenma Taro did it! Apollo: Tenma Taro?! You stay here while I go have a look. Jinxie: P-Please, wait! Apollo: Huh...? Ack! Jinxie: It's a... Tenma Taro Warding Charm. It should protect you, but please... be careful. The alderman's in the Fox Chamber at the top of the main staircase. Apollo: Okay, got it! Tenma Taro Warding Charm slipped into pocket. April 17Kyubi Manor - Fox Chamber Anime cutscene Apollo: A-Are you all right?! Man: Wh-Who are you...? Apollo: H-Help! Someone call an ambulance! Apollo: The police arrived soon after that, at which point I returned to the festival grounds. Apparently, the man impaled by the spear was already dead. But there was one other person there, and he was immediately rushed to the hospital. April 17Kyubi Manor - Garden Apollo: Thank goodness the other man's going to be fine. Sounds like he'd only been unconscious. Trucy: You think Jinxie's going to be okay? Apollo: I'm sure she'll be back to her old self in no time. At least she's calm enough for the police to question her for now. (And I'd sure love to know what crazy animal left those feathers and tracks...) Trucy: Oh, look, here comes Jinxie. Jinxie: ...Hi, Trucy. ...Hi, Mr. Demon Lawyer. Apollo: Heya... Feeling any better? ...I was wondering if you're up to filling us in on what happened... Talk About what happened Apollo: So, the man with the spear in his chest was already dead? Jinxie: Uh-huh. It was Alderman Kyubi. When I found him, he was already... Apollo: (So the victim was the village alderman...) And the one who was found alive? Who was he? Jinxie: Damian Tenma. He's the mayor of the neighboring city, Tenma Town. They arrested him. *sob* Apollo: So... he's the killer? Ack! Jinxie: Nuh-uh! Papa didn't kill anyone! Apollo: Papa? As in... your father? Trucy: That's right. Jinxie's dad is mayor of Tenma Town. Apollo: No way! Jinxie: Errr... Yes, way, but he's innocent. Apollo: (This just got way more complicated. The victim was the alderman of Nine-Tails Vale. And Jinxie's father, the mayor of Tenma Town, was arrested for the crime. Sounds like we have some investigating to do.) Trucy: I know this is difficult, Jinxie, but you need to hang in there! Jinxie: I know. I'll try my best. Apollo: Would you mind telling me a little more about the victim? The alderman (appears after \"About what happened\") Leads to: \"So the victim was the village alderman? What can you tell me about him?\" Present Yokai Legend Scroll Jinxie: They sell those at the village souvenir shop. Apollo: They really went all out, making it look like a real scroll and all. Jinxie: By rolling it up like that, you can't see Tenma Taro's picture. It's so you don't lose your soul if you accidentally gazed upon him. Even if it is a souvenir, no one in this village wants to accidentally see what's inside! Apollo: I've heard of losing or selling your soul for many things, but for the price of a souvenir? Jinxie: I wonder how many innocent shop girls have fallen victim. *shivers* Apollo: Wouldn't it be better not to sell them at all? Tenma Taro Warding Charm Jinxie: That warding charm is my supernatural security system. It protects me from yokai -- ghosts, demons, and other things that go bump in the night! Just the other day, I was chased down by a demented camera demon. But I drove him back with my trusty warding charm! Apollo: (Camera demon? Sounds more like an overexcited tourist.) Jinxie: Still, I suppose it's not nice to repel every yokai I meet. I mean, there are some that aren't all bad. I learned that today. Apollo: (Um... Why is she staring at me like that?) Apollo: So the victim was the village alderman? What can you tell me about him? Jinxie: His name was Rex Kyubi. They say his family has ties to the legendary Nine-Tailed Fox. He was really kind, and he always looked out for me. He was a former pro wrestler, and I even heard he knew The Amazing Nine-Tails. Apollo: (A former pro wrestler, huh... Hmm... That's something to keep in mind.) With your father being mayor and all, I guess you're originally from Tenma Town, huh? So then, why did you come work here? Trucy: It was to overcome your fears, right, Jinxie? Jinxie: Uh-huh. Plus, Mama was from Nine-Tails Vale, though she's no longer with us. She loved these flowers. I always wanted to live where Nine-Tails flowers grew. Trucy: Wow, what a beautiful flower. And with exactly nine petals, too! Jinxie: Just looking at them gives me courage, even when I'm scared of yokai. Nine-Tails Flower added to the Court Record. Apollo: Jinxie, when you first told us what happened, you said the killer was a demon. Jinxie: Uh-huh. The warding charm on the Forbidden Chamber's door... It's been... removed. Apollo: (The Forbidden Chamber's door? That big door that was barred shut? There wasn't a charm on it when I checked it out, so I guess it was removed by someone...) Jinxie: That's how Tenma Taro escaped! Ooh... Ooooooh! But when... when I try and remember what happened, it all goes... fuzzy. Trucy: Jinxie, you should do get some rest. You've been through a lot today. Apollo: (Between the warding charm being removed, and the black feathers and weird tracks... ...I could see how a superstitious person might think a demon was the killer.) Trucy: Apollo! Maybe this is your chance. Apollo: Chance for what? Trucy: To do the right thing and defend Jinxie's dad in court! Apollo: Who, me? Wouldn't a man like Mayor Tenma have access to more experienced lawyers? Jinxie: Umm... You wanna know what the detectives said? They doubted there was a lawyer who could get a not-guilty verdict in this one. Apollo: (Sounds like they're expecting an open and shut case.) Trucy: Don't worry, Jinxie! If anyone can prove your dad's innocence, it's Polly! Apollo: Wha--?! Trucy: You'll accept the case, won't you, Polly! Jinxie: Ooh... It's all over, isn't it? I'll... I'll be all alone... for the rest of my life. Apollo: (Oh, right... Jinxie already lost her mother.) ...All right. Jinxie, leave your father's defense to me! Trucy: Atta boy, Polly! Jinxie: You're going to help Papa, Mr. Demon Lawyer? Apollo: Yep, because that's what lawyers do. (Plus, no toilet cleaning for a while!) I'll do whatever it takes to make sure your father walks away a free man! Jinxie: Th-Thank you, Mr. Demon Lawyer! I can tell you're one of the good ones. Red Demons are usually so mean. Apollo: (It's been awhile, but I'll be fine! Ready or not, here comes Justice! Guess I oughta go and meet my new client.) Ah, but before I forget... (Better jot this down in my notebook.) Trucy: Hey, Apollo, what's the notebook for? Apollo: Oh, I just thought I should jot down some stuff about the case. And so I don't misplace them, I'm putting my Notes in the Court Record. I guess it's what you would call a \"To-Do\" list. Trucy: Oh? Sounds handy. Apollo: (To read my notes, I just open the Court Record with [R / RB / E]. Then I can switch between the tabs using [L / LB / Q] and [R / RB / E].) Trucy: Oh, I almost forgot! So, about Jinxie's father... No matter how scary he seems, promise me you'll resist the urge to run away! Apollo: Wait, what? Jinxie: His angry glare can paralyze you with fear. Trucy: And some claim he can even shoot laser beams from his eyes. Jinxie: Well, maybe Papa isn't really THAT scary... Apollo: (A paralyzing stare... Laser beams from his eyes... He sounds like some kind of monster.) Trucy: Hm, I think it's about time I see Jinxie off. I'll head back to the office after I'm done. Apollo: Okay, thanks. April 17Detention Center - Visitor's Room Apollo: Ah, visiting hours. Perfect timing. (Hope he's not as scary as he sounds...) ???: ...Who are you? Apollo: (Yikes!) S-So you're Damian Tenma, r-right?! I'm, uhh... I'm Apollo Justice, attorney-at-law! I'm here to, uhh... I'm here to help! Huh? Aaaaaaaaaaah! (Lemme outta here!) S-Sorry, sorry! I get a little loud sometimes! Tenma: How... incredibly... RUDE! Apollo: Umm, sorry. Did I do something to offend you? Tenma: A visitor when all others shun me like a common criminal! And here I am with nothing to offer! I am the epitome of rude! Apollo: (.........Wait, so he wasn't mad at me?) Tenma: Unworthy as I am, I, Damian Tenma, shall breach these walls... ...so that I may treat my benefactor to some tea, and maybe some cookies, too. Apollo: No, wait! We can do tea and cookies after we prove your innocence! How about you start by telling me what happened? Tenma: Hrmmm... I see. So tea and cookies can wait, can they? Apollo: (Whew, that was close. We don't need \"jailbreak\" added to the list of charges. Seems like a good guy, but with a face like that, I can see why he's misunderstood.) Talk Reason for arrest Apollo: Mayor Tenma. Do you mind if I ask why you were arrested? Tenma: ! Grrrrrr! Apollo: Whoa! S-Sorry! I guess some things are better left unsaid! Tenma: Bah! Apollo: Excuse me? Tenma: To think a public paragon such as I could be treated like this! This arrest should have never happened! Apollo: Go on... Tenma: I fear the ill effects it will have on our youth! Now I've but one choice. I must leave here at once, if only to protect the moral fiber of our youth! Apollo: No, wait! You can protect the moral fiber of our youth after you've been declared not guilty! Tenma: Hrmmm... I suppose you're right. Apollo: (Phew... Our youth just came this close to quite a scare.) Tenma: My fingerprints were on the spear that killed Alderman Kyubi. That's why I was arrested. Apollo: Your prints were on the murder weapon? That's never good. Any idea how they got there? Tenma: None. For I hardly remember a thing, you see. I was fast asleep at the time. Someone must have slipped me a sleeping pill or something. What's worse, somebody clobbered me on the head. Apollo: I see... A drug induced slumber, and a blow to the head. No wonder you hardly remember a thing. Tenma: ............Ho. Apollo: (Huh? Was that some kind of strange laugh?) Well, I think we can safely assume your prints were planted while you were unconscious. Motive Apollo: What do the police have on you as far as a motive is concerned? Tenma: Truth be told, there's been a bit of trouble between the alderman and I as of late. Apollo: Oh? Was it personal in nature? Tenma: Nothing like that. It's a long story... ...but suffice to say, I've been pushing to merge Nine-Tails Vale with Tenma Town. Surrender Nine-Tails Vale to Tenma Town now!!! Apollo: Yikes! Tenma: ...That's what I told him. Apollo: (I'd like to tell YOU to stop shouting like that, but I'm too scared!) So, um, that's the motive the police have established for the alderman's murder? Tenma: Indeed it is. After all, Alderman Kyubi was dead set against a municipal merger. Apollo: And that's why they think you killed him, he was in your way. Tenma: Arrrrrrgh! Cuuuurrrrssseeees! Apollo: Um, M-Mayor Tenma? Are you okay...? Tenma: Jinxie! Forgive me! I never meant to worry you like this! Apollo: It'll work out fine! Just leave it to me! (If only it really were that easy. I don't even know where to start...) Present Attorney's Badge Tenma: ......Thank you for agreeing to defend me. Apollo: Oh, no thanks required. Just doing my job. Tenma: ............ ............ Apollo: (He's even scarier when he's not saying anything.) Um... Nice day today, huh? Tenma: ............Hrmmm. Apollo: I, um, love nice days like these. It's, uh, perfect lawyering weather, heh heh heh! Tenma: The trial......... is tomorrow. Apollo: Yes, right, the trial! (Why do I keep blabbering on like that?) Tenma Taro Warding Charm Apollo: Those charms on your head... They're the same as this one, correct? Tenma: Indeed they are. Jinxie applied them after the murder. She said they would keep Tenma Taro from possessing me. Apollo: Oh, right! (So it's not some creepy fashion statement.) Still, there are an awful lot of them. Tenma: That there are. Truth be told, my head's feeling a bit... itchy. Apollo: Can't you just peel them off? Tenma: Jinxie did this for me. I could not hurt her feelings like that. Apollo: (He really cares for his daughter.) Anything else Apollo: I wanted to show you this. Tenma: ! Apollo: Aaagh! Sorry! Tenma: ............... Apollo: (I hate when he clams up like this.) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: Thank you for meeting with me, Mayor Tenma. Tenma: Please, wait. My daughter, Jinxie... Apollo: Yes? Tenma: She... she already lost her mother. And now with me being held in here, I fear she'll be terribly lonely. I hesitate to ask, but......... I beg you, be a friend to her in her time of need. Apollo: Leave it to me! Trucy and I will look out for your daughter! Tenma: I shall rest a little easier, then. You know, you remind me of some of the new friends Jinxie has been talking about. Apollo: New... friends? Tenma: Yes. It seems she's made some new friends since she started working in Nine-Tails Vale. They're quite the unusual bunch, too. There's a lady with an exceptionally long neck... ...a young lad with an incredibly long tongue, and many other interesting characters. Apollo: (Friends? Sounds more like a bunch of monsters to me!) Tenma: Now, if you would excuse me. It appears my time is up. Apollo: (Whew... Why am I so tired? I must've been more tense than I thought... Still, I'm glad he didn't turn out to be as scary as he looks!) A call? ...Oh, it's Mr. Wright. Justice here. Phoenix: Apollo, is that you? Apollo: Hi, Mr. Wright. What can I do for you? Phoenix: Trucy told me you've taken on a new case. Apollo: Oh, that. It was kinda spur of the moment. (He's actually calling ME about a case?) Phoenix: That's fine, but I have a favor to ask. Apollo: Sure. What is it? Phoenix: I'm at the airport right now. There was someone I had to meet. A new addition to the agency, actually. Her name's Athena Cykes, and she just passed the bar. Apollo: (That's right. I remember hearing about her coming to join us. Guess that was today.) Phoenix: She took off as soon as I told her you needed help with a case. It was like there was no stopping her. Apollo: Wait... Whaaaaaat! Where is she now? Phoenix: Probably somewhere in Nine-Tails Vale by now. That's where that favor I mentioned comes in. I need you to go find her. Apollo: But I've never even met her before. What does she look like? Phoenix: She'll be the girl in the yellow suit sporting an attorney's badge. Apollo: Okay, I'll find her. A new addition to the agency... (Well, I'd better get back to Nine-Tails Vale quick.) Wright Anything Agency Talk Any ideas? Apollo: Trucy, I'd like to hear your thoughts on what happened. Trucy: You do? Does that mean I can join the investigation? Apollo: I could sure use your help, but remember what Mr. Wright said? \"Trucy, you're in high school now, so you need to focus.\" Trucy: Right... I guess I better pull it together. It's time to forget everything else and just focus on my magic tricks! Apollo: Wait, no! He was talking about your schoolwork! What to do Trucy: Welcome to Trucy's Two Cents! Go ahead, ask me anything! Apollo: Oh, um, okay... Jinxie's always plastering charms on my forehead. What should I do? Trucy: That's an easy one, Apollo. Just do this... 3, 2, 1... Ta-dah! Apollo: Do what...? ......Ack! Trucy: See! She won't be able to stick any more on if there's already one there. Problem solved! Apollo: How's that a solution? Either way, I still have a charm plastered on my forehead! Present Attorney's Badge Apollo: Check it out. Trucy: You're so lucky, Apollo. Everyone can see what you do with just a flash of your badge. Apollo: What about you, Trucy? People can tell you're a magician by the way you're dressed. Trucy: Yeah, but I can't always dress like this. Like when I'm at school and stuff. Apollo: You could always show you're a magician by making things appear or disappear. Trucy: You mean like this? 3, 2, 1... Ta-dah! Apollo: Umm, magic or no, aren't you a little old to be showing those things in public? Trucy: Hmm... Then maybe I'll become a lawyer, too. Apollo: You're abandoning your dream just like that?! Tenma Taro Warding Charm Trucy: Jinxie's warding charms... Hm, what if I incorporated it into my act? Might be fun. Apollo: You mean like having charms come out of your magic panties? Trucy: Exactly! And then I'd have them fly off and stick to audience members' foreheads! Apollo: Somehow, I don't think that would go over so well. Trucy: Then how 'bout I have them stick on my assistant? That would be you, Polly! Apollo: How does that make it any better?! And I'm not your assistant! Trucy: What?! But I could've sworn you were. Apollo: Where in the world did you get that idea? Anything else Trucy: Okay! Watch me make that disappear! Apollo: No, wait! That's crucial evidence! Trucy: But I wanted to show you my new disappearing trick! Oh, I know! If it's really so important, how about I make more of it appear! Apollo: Fabricating evidence is even worse than making it disappear! Trucy: Oh, well. Too bad. April 17Nine-Tails Vale - Yokai Lane ???: I. Already. Told. You! I'm a lawyer assigned to the case! I need to study the crime scene, so if you would please tell me where Kyubi Manor is...! Policeman: You can't fool me! You're just some delinquent high school student playing hooky! ???: You stupid, pig-headed...! This attorney's badge isn't just for show, you know! Apollo: (Looks like I just found Ms. Athena Cykes.) Athena: Tsk! Why won't you believe me?! Don't expect me to defend you in court if you ever get arrested! Policeman: Well, I'm the one who usually does the arresting, so... Say, shouldn't you be getting back to school? Athena: I already told you, I'm a lawyer, not a student! Policeman: That's it! Enough of your lies! You're coming with me! Athena: Aaah! Get your hands off of me! Anime cutscene Apollo: .........Urnngh... Think you can watch out for the bystanders next time...? Athena: Whoops! Are you okay? Apollo: I think so. (But that police officer's out cold.) Athena: I am SO sorry! I do that when people suddenly grab me. It's like a reflex or something. Apollo: (Reflex? Sounds more like a felony!) You're Athena Cykes, I take it? Athena: That would be me. And you are? Apollo: I'm Apollo Justice. I work at the Wright Anything Agency. Athena: The Wright Anything Agency? What a fishy sounding name. Apollo: ...It's a long story, but it IS a law office, among other things. Didn't Mr. Wright explain it to you? Athena: Oh, right, THAT Wright! So then, you must be...! Where have you been?! I've been looking all over for you! Apollo: (I could say the same thing to you.) Well, here I am. Now how about telling me a little bit about yourself. Mr. Wright didn't really tell me much... as always. Athena: .........Ah, of course! Feel free to ask away! Talk Athena Cykes Apollo: So, Athena, I hear you just passed the bar. Athena: That's right! And here's my shiny new badge to prove it. Isn't it beautiful? Apollo: Oh, so you must be a bit younger than me. Athena: Heh heh heh. A bit more than you might think, in fact! I'm only eighteen! Apollo: E-Eighteen? How in the world did you become a lawyer at that age? Athena: I skipped a few grades while I was an exchange student in Europe. And I got my license to practice law while I was over there. Apollo: All I can say is, wow... (She must be a genius or something.) Athena: I also studied analytical psychology! Thought it might help me be a better lawyer. Apollo: (Psychology helps her be a better lawyer? How exactly does that work?) The client Athena: So, tell me about our client. What are they like? Apollo: Oh, right, you haven't met him yet. Well... Apollo: ...And that about sums it up. Athena: He's more worried about his daughter than himself. What a wonderful father. *sniffle* Apollo: Wait, are you crying? Athena: I'm not cr-crying! There was something in my eye! Apollo: (Um, they're called \"tears\"...) Athena: Moving right along... Let's get down to business! Helping our client is priority number one! Psychology (appears after \"Athena Cykes\") Apollo: So, Athena, you mentioned studying psychology. Athena: That's right! I've always wanted to bring analytical psychology into the courtroom. The power of psychology will bring a breath of fresh air to the legal system. Apollo: Oh, really? So how do you plan on using it to defend our client? Athena: ...Um, well, for example, I can try to listen in on a witness's inner voice... ...and then analyze their psychological state with the help of my trusty partner Widget! Apollo: Widget...? Athena: This device around my neck here! Say hi, Widget! Widget: Hi Widget! Apollo: IT TALKS?! Athena: Whoa, you need a volume knob! Anyway, the little guy will sometimes say what I'm feeling. Widget: Awk-ward... Athena: Don't worry, you'll get used to it. Apollo: Now THAT I seriously doubt. Present Attorney's Badge Athena: Yep! That's your attorney's badge, all right! Its dull, grimy look makes me think of all the courtroom battles you've faced so far! I hope mine will look like that someday! Look out legal world, Athena Cykes is psyched and ready to go! Apollo: ......... (Actually, I just haven't polished it lately... Maybe I should keep that to myself. No need to deflate her dreams about \"work\" just yet.) Yokai Legend Scroll Athena: What an interesting picture! It looks like a one-on-one monster smack down! It must've been quite a battle. Which yokai do you think is stronger? Apollo: Seems to me Tenma Taro's ability to fly would give him an edge over the Nine-Tailed Fox. Athena: But the Fox has powerful legs. He'd pounce before Tenma Taro knew what hit him! Apollo: He won't be pouncing on anyone after he's dropped from way up in the sky! Athena: Errr... B-But the Nine-Tailed Fox is gold-colored! Gold is way better than black, so I'm sure he'd win! Apollo: What do colors have to do with anything? (Besides, everyone knows red is the best.) Anything else Athena: *sigh* Sorry, Apollo. Nothing's coming to mind. But give me an hour and I'll have it analyzed Cykes style! I'll get started on it right now! Apollo: No need for that! I was just wondering. After clearing all Talk options: Athena: ...Oh, I almost forgot. I have something you might be interested in. I got in on my way here. Think it might have something to do with our case? Apollo: A special edition covering our case? That was quick. Athena: That's the whole point of special editions, isn't it? To be the first to get the scoop? ¡Rápido! (Changed from [That's the whole point of special editions, isn't it? To be the first to get the scoop? Rapido!] in the original release) Apollo: Right... Well, let's see what it says here... (What's the deal with the Spanish?) Tenma Taro was seen.... wha--? He was seen flying through the sky?! Athena: Yeah, somebody happened to snap that photo near Nine-Tails Vale. The article goes on to say it might be connected to our case. Apparently, that photo was shot right after the murder occurred. Apollo: Well, there were black feathers and strange tracks at the crime scene. I'm not surprised the locals think a yokai was involved. Athena: Wait a second... Yokai as in one of those Japanese monsters? Mein Gott! You don't actually think it was a supernatural murder, do you? Apollo: Ha ha ha, n-no, of course not. (Now German? Why not plain old English?) Special Edition Paper added to the Court Record. Athena: ¡Ándale, Apollo! Let's get cracking on that crime scene already! (Changed from [Andale, Apollo! Let's get cracking on that crime scene already!] in the original release) Talk The investigation Apollo: Okay, what's next on the list? Athena: Investigating the crime scene, what else?! Well, what are we waiting for?! Last one there is a rotten egg! Apollo: We don't have to run all the way there. Athena: Okay... Then how about speed walking?! Apollo: (Why does this have to be a competition at all?) Present Special Edition Paper Athena: Looks like this paper doesn't shy away from stories on strange creatures. Apollo: Really? What does it say? Athena: They claim to have produced photos of Gourdy and a Kappa water sprite thingie. And just the other day, they got one of Konaki Jiji crying his poor old eyes out... ...followed by that infamous shot of Tenma Taro. Apollo: I don't know about a Kappa, but I bet the Konaki Jiji... ...is just a shot of someone's grandpa lost and crying up in the mountains. Athena: That's not very nice! They should have helped him instead of publishing his picture! April 17Kyubi Manor - Foyer Athena: Do you hear that? It sounds like a TV or something. Oh, look! There's a TV in that little room in the corner. TV: In other news... The mysterious masked wrestler The Amazing Nine-Tails... ...has been confirmed missing according to sources close to the wrestler. It appears he disappeared sometime after the special event held in Nine-Tails Vale today. He also failed to appear at a match today where he was scheduled to defend his title. Local villagers say his disappearance may be connected with Tenma Taro's recent escape. Apollo: So, that wrestler's gone missing. ???: Hey, you two! You don't belong in here! Athena: Eek! Apollo: Don't worry, there's nothing suspicious-- ???: What about them there horns o' yours? They look mighty suspicious if ya ask me! Apollo: Horns?! That's my hair...! Anyway, we're lawyers, and we're here to-- ???: Ah! You're them lawyers come to defend Mayor Tenma, ain't ya?! Eh heh heh. Shoulda reckoned what with that expensive-looking bracelet ya got there. The name's Phineas Filch. Filch: I'm the caretaker here. Pleased to meetcha, eh heh heh. Apollo: Um, same here. Athena: Wow, talk about a quick change of heart. Filch: So, tell me, Demon Lawyer! Betcha use them demonic horns of yours to scare the bejeebers outta witnesses, huh? Come here, ya lil' horned demon, you! Apollo: Youch! These horns, er... I mean, my hair isn't meant to threaten anyone! Filch: They ain't? Seems a mighty big waste o' perfectly good horns if ya ask me. Then again, ain't none o' my business, so... Apollo: *sigh* (That was fast. Guess he's done with me.) Filch: Well, I'd best get back to work! Athena: Athena: Halt! Stop right there! Filch: Huh? Me? Athena: Apollo, your bracelet's gone! Apollo: Ah! Filch: Don't ya worry, Mr. Lawyer, sir! I'll check the lost 'n' found later! Apollo: .........Somehow, I don't think that will be necessary. Just check your wrist right now. Filch: Arrrrrrrrrgh! The cat's outta the bag! Apollo: (It was barely in the bag in the first place!) Athena: That was a pretty pathetic attempt. Filch: S-S-Sorry! I'm sooooo sooooo sorry! Just couldn't control myself! Please, forgive me! I'm beggin' ya! Apollo: (Sheesh, I almost feel sorry for him now.) Athena: What should we do about him, Apollo? Apollo: Well, I got my bracelet back, and he seems sorry enough, so... Filch: I knew ya'd understand, Mr. Lawyer, sir! Ya obviously got a big heart! As big as the wad o' cash in your wallet, I hope, eh heh heh! Apollo: You leave my wallet out of this. Filch: Ho HO! Athena: Hey! Didn't you just finish apologizing for stealing from us?! Filch: Run away, run away! Head for the hills! Athena: Get back here, you! Apollo: (Talk about a quick escape.) ...Hm? Looks like he dropped a few things. Looks like a pair of diagrams. This one's of the crime scene, and here's one of the foyer. Athena: He left his shoes behind, too. Apollo: The guy's the living definition of a bumbling thief. Athena: Let's hang on to his shoes. We can give them back next time we see him. As for the diagrams, I say we keep them! Apollo: They look like something the police might draw. Wonder where the caretaker got them? Crime Scene Diagram added to the Court Record. Foyer Diagram added to the Court Record. Apollo: Now then, as I recall... ...the Fox Chamber should be at the top of those stairs. April 17Kyubi Manor - Fox Chamber Athena: Whoa! Where'd all these black feathers and weird tracks come from?! Apollo: The popular opinion seems to be that they're from Tenma Taro. Athena: You mean the great evil has returned? Apollo: Even if he did, I'd be laughed out of the courthouse trying to indict him. ???: Hey, who are you and what are you doing here? This is a crime scene! Apollo: And who are YOU? Are you with the police? ???: I asked first! Who are YOU and what are you doing here?! On second thought... I'm placing you under arrest for disturbing a crime scene! Apollo: Ack! Under arrest?! B-B-But... ???: Save it for the boys back at HQ! Now, come quietly or else! I don't want to be late for lunch! Apollo: P-Please, wait! We're Mayor Tenma's lawyers! ???: Well why didn't you just say so! So you're the lawyers I heard about. Ha ha ha! I almost took you two in! You two sure were suspicious, though! Athena: I don't know how many more times I can take being called suspicious in one day... Apollo: Sorry, we didn't catch your name. Fulbright: My name? I'm Bobby Fulbright! The heroic detective who defends our good citizens from evil! The champion of justice who comes running whenever you're in need! And my catchphrase? It's \"In justice we trust!\" Apollo: Hoo boy... (This guy's a story and a half...) Fulbright: So! What can I do for you? Talk Investigating the scene Apollo: So, would it be okay if we had a look around? Fulbright: Certainly not! No unauthorized personnel allowed! Apollo: Couldn't you make an exception? Fulbright: Cease and desist at once, or you'll have to deal with my little friend here! Apollo: Ack! (Yikes! Is he reaching for his...?!) Fulbright: In justice we trust! Apollo: ...! (Phew, it's just his badge.) Fulbright: You may be Mayor Tenma's attorneys, but you still need authorization to cross a police line! Athena: Apollo, let's see if we can't change his mind! Apollo: Good luck! Let me know how it goes! (I bet he's as dense as heroes come...) Persuasion (appears after \"Investigating the scene\") Leads to: \"You're wasting your time and mine! Nobody's crossing this line without authorization!\" Present Anything Fulbright: Justice need backup sometimes, too! So I don't mind you asking for help, but you should start by thinking things over yourself. After all, the road to justice starts with your own first step! Ha ha ha! Apollo: If you don't have any information to offer, you could just say so. Fulbright: You're wasting your time and mine! Nobody's crossing this line without authorization! I'm a wall of justice keeping injustice -- that would be you -- at bay! Apollo: *sigh* I knew it. Look, there's just us and you here, right? Fulbright: Justice and me, you say? Apollo: Th-That's right...? Fulbright: Are you trying to say that justice and I aren't enough to keep you out?! Apollo: Um, what? Athena: ...! No, silly! We're saying that you're an inspiration in our quest for justice! Fulbright: No!!! It can't beeeee!!! Apollo: You have him on the ropes now, Athena! Athena: Um, if we were on the side of justice, would you let us through? Fulbright: B-B-But, guarding the crime scene is a part of justice, too! Athena: Sure... but only a bad guy would stand in the way of justice, right? Fulbright: Aaaaargh! Whose justice is the most just here? Apollo: Well, we can't have a fair and just trial without a thorough investigation, so... Fulbright: Hrmmm... Oh, Lady Justice...! What would you have me dooooo?! Athena: I think we really got to him. Apollo: Yeah, he seems pretty neurotic as far as champions of justice go. (Changed from [Yeah, he's [sic] seems pretty neurotic as far as champions of justice go.] in the original release) Athena: Our pleas for justice must've had a huge impact. It's tying him up in knots! Now's our chance to start looking around. Apollo: (After all that about authorized personnel only... this was surprisingly easy.) Fulbright: Hrmmm... Should I stop them or let them through? Whose justice is more just? Athena: Well, let's get to work! We're supposed to be finding clues related to the crime, right? (Changed from [We're supposed to being [sic] finding clues related to the crime, right?] in the original release) Apollo: Right. A search of the crime scene should turn up some evidence we can use at the trial. Let's try viewing the crime scene from different angles. Athena: You never know what's hiding just around the corner, right? So we move the cursor with [left analog stick / WASD]... (Changed from [Wait, but how do we go about changing our perspective?] in the original release) Apollo: And change our perspective with [right analog stick left/right / left/right arrow keys]. (Changed from [Touch the arrows on the bottom screen or press left or right on [D-Pad].] in the original release) If there's a particular spot you want to examine, just give it a tap. Athena: Okay, let's leave no stone unturned! Nous allons commencer! Let's get started! Examine Forbidden Chamber door Apollo: The Forbidden Chamber... They say the demon Tenma Taro was imprisoned in there before his \"escape.\" Athena: Think we could get this door open? Apollo: It's worth a try. Hrrrgh! ...No good. It's shut tight! I don't even see a key hole. Seems pretty hopeless. Fulbright: In justice we trust! Apollo: Yikes! Fulbright: Did I just hear the voice of someone in need?! Allow me to fill you in! This door simply will not open! We've tried and tried, but it won't budge! It's an essential part of the culture found in this manor, so we can't blow it up either! Apollo: (So, an unopenable door. Right.) Fulbright: According to Ms. Jinxie Tenma, it was shut tight when she came across the crime scene. Athena: Thanks for the tip, Detective Fulbright. We didn't expect you to be so helpful. Fulbright: Aaaaaaaaaaargh! Forget I just said that! Apollo: (So, the Forbidden Chamber was shut tight at the time of the murder. Sounds like something I'd better keep in mind.) Outline on table Apollo: So, this is where Alderman Kyubi's body was found. Athena: Apparently, the murder weapon -- a spear -- had Mayor Tenma's prints on it. Apollo: That's not good. Fulbright: Never fear, Detective Fulbright is here! Apollo: Yikes! Fulbright: Of course, I can't offer you any information on my investigation, so... In the name of justice, I must say goodbye! Apollo: Umm... What was that all about? Armchair on right Athena: Wow! This is a pricy-looking chair! Apollo: Apparently, the mayor was found drugged and unconcious in it. Athena: Really?! Apollo: Yeah, and when he came to, he was arrested for murder. Talk about your rude awakenings. Athena: So, he's the prime suspect in a crime he knows nothing about?! Widget: That stinks! Athena: Oh, poor Mr. Tenma. *sniffle* He must be feeling so scared and confused. Apollo, it's up to us to save him! Apollo: (It's like she's on her own emotional roller coaster.) Fox statues Athena: Look! This statue only has one tail. Apollo: Maybe it's the Nine-Tailed Fox's sidekick. I bet the number of tails represents a yokai's power. Athena: So... if you had two, Apollo, I'd only have one? Apollo: Wait. What? Athena: ...Not that it means you're better than me, got it?! Apollo: Like I said, what? Armchair on left Apollo: There's something wedged under this chair. Let's see if we can't lift it up and... Fulbright: Freeze! Apollo: Yikes! Fulbright: No disturbing crime scene evidence! Even if you ARE the mayor's lawyers. Apollo: (He does have a point there.) Athena: Hey Detective Fulbright, did you hear about the attack over on Yokai Lane? I hear an elderly woman was assaulted by a strange yokai shaped like a roll of cloth! Fulbright: And you waited till now to tell me?! I better get over there at once. In justice we trust! Athena: ...That was surprisingly easy. Okay, Apollo, now's our chance to look around some more. Apollo: (The more I get to know her, the scarier she gets. Hope she never finds MY weakness.) Cloth under armchair Apollo: Whatever this is, it's stuck on tight. Athena: Looks like a large bloodstained cloth. Apollo: The blood's probably the alderman's, but it's pretty far from his body. Wonder how it got here... (And why does this seem important?) Back of folding screen Apollo: (Nothing much to see on this side. Maybe I should go check the other side.) Weapons Athena: This one's a spear, but what about this one? It looks like a giant pair of pliers. Apollo: Looks like something a demon might use. Saw something like that in a manga once. Athena: Really? What are they used for? Apollo: Oh, things like pinching through cheeks... Athena: Eeeuuuw! Apollo: Pulling out tongues... Widget: Stop, stop! Apollo: Oh, and you should see what they can do to a person's eyes-- Athena: Okay, okay, I get the idea! But I'm sure THIS thing is just a simple can opener or something like that! Apollo: Demons eat canned food? I always wondered what they are besides people. Feathers and tracks Apollo: These weird tracks must've been made when someone stepped in the alderman's blood. Athena: Maybe the killer inadvertently made them when they were fleeing? They're pretty big tracks, almost bird-like. The feathers also point to a bird. Apollo: Then it must be one big bird! And not one of the friendly yellow type, either! Athena: Maybe it's some mutant bird creature! Apollo: So, your theory is a giant mutant bird murdered Alderman Kyubi with a spear? Athena: It's more plausible than saying a monster or yokai did it. Apollo: Sorry to burst your bubble, but a giant spear-wielding bird is by definition a monster! Front of folding screen Athena: It's a folding screen. I wonder what they were using it for. Apollo: I read that the Japanese used to use these in drafty rooms, but now they're just for show. Athena: You mean like... like my attorney's badge. *sniffle* Widget: Poor Athena... Apollo: (That cop treating her like a child must've really bothered her.) Clock above door Athena: Apollo, what words come to mind when you watch that pendulum in there? Apollo: Hmm... Unsteady and umm... restless. Athena: That's a direct representation of your current state of mind. Apollo: Wait! That was some kind of psychological test?! Athena: My diagnosis? This strange case has made you anxious, causing you to lose your cool. Apollo: You're actually not that far off the mark. Broken statue behind door Apollo: Hm? There's something behind the door. Whatever it is, it looks like it's broken. Probably broke when the door was opened. Why would anybody put something there? Athena: Yeah, that wasn't very smart. Apollo: Maybe it was Jinxie. She was the first one to discover the body. She must have heard the screams and come running in here in a panic. Athena: Well, look at you, Apollo! Now you're using analytical psychology, too! Apollo: I am? Athena: Wow, you really learn quick! But I guess I shouldn't be surprised. You're the ace attorney of Wright Anything Agency! Apollo: (I can't tell whether she's serious or not. Now, if Trucy said something like that, I'd immediately know she was messing with me.) Intact statue behind door Athena: Doesn't this tanuki statue remind you of the manor's caretaker, Phineas Filch? Apollo: This raccoon-looking thing? Yeah, it does look like him! Athena: Ooh, I just got the best idea! We should knock it over! It might transform back into Mr. Filch! Apollo: Mr. Filch is mischievous, but he's not magical, you know. Athena: Way to waste a brilliant idea, Apollo. Air vent Apollo: Huh, that looks like an air vent. It's pretty high up there. Athena: What if you got a running start and jumped? Apollo: I doubt even a high-jumper could make it. Athena: Argh! Don't rule it out before you try it! Besides, I'm an excellent jumper. Apollo: Even so, that must be about nine feet high. Athena: Like I said, you don't know until you try, Monsieur Justice! Apollo: (She doesn't know when to give up and when to stop using foreign words.) Trophies Athena: Look, trophies! Ooh! This one was awarded to Alderman Kyubi! \"The Amazing Nine-Tails, Yokai Div. Winner, Tenma Town Pro Wrestling Tournament.\" Apollo: Yokai Division? I didn't know you could have a division of one. Athena: Apollo, you should enter the tournament next time! And I have the perfect name for you! The Mysterious Firebrand! A mild-mannered masked lawyer by day... demonic masked wrestler by night! Apollo: No one's going to hire a masked lawyer, Athena. Window Apollo: Hey, this window opens. And outside... we have ourselves a steep cliff. Athena: The window only opens about six inches -- not wide enough for anyone to get in or out. Look, Apollo! There's something caught in the window frame! It looks like gold fur. What a pretty color! It must be from some kind of animal! Apollo: Wonder what it's doing here. Did Alderman Kyubi have a pet fox? Golden Fur added to the Court Record. Window (subsequent times) Apollo: What's this gold fur caught in the window frame here? Could it be from some rare gold-colored fox found only in Nine-Tails Vale? Athena: You think a fox squeezed out of this window? Apollo: Nothing's getting out that way. There's a steep cliff on the other side. Athena: Hmm... It's one mystery after another. Statue next to armchair Apollo: Hmm... What do we have here? Looks like a statue of the Nine-Tailed Fox and Tenma Taro battling it out. Athena: Eek! Careful, Apollo, it's got blood on it! Apollo: Really? ...Hey, you're right. Wonder if it's the alderman's blood? Athena: How can you remain so calm after seeing all this blood? Apollo: Well, this isn't the first time I've seen something like this, so... Athena: You're no fun at all! At least act surprised or grossed out or something for my first case! Apollo: I'm already a lawyer. You want me to be an actor, too? Fox and Demon Statue added to the Court Record. Statue next to armchair (subsequent times) Apollo: Hmm... What do we have here? Looks like a statue of the Nine-Tailed Fox and Tenma Taro battling it out. Athena: Eek! Careful, Apollo, it's got blood on it! Apollo: Really? ...Hey, you're right. Wonder if it's the alderman's blood? Athena: How can you remain so calm after seeing all this blood? Apollo: Well, this isn't the first time I've seen something like this, so... Athena: You're no fun at all! At least act surprised or grossed out or something for my first case! Apollo: I'm already a lawyer. You want me to be an actor, too? Yokai figurines left of the window Athena: Look! A cat with two tails! Apollo: No such thing. Athena: Oh, and this lady has a really long neck! Ha ha ha! How funny is that! Apollo: There's no way a creature like that could ever exist. She'd have a tough time swallowing. Athena: Apollo... I bet you were one of those kids who didn't believe in Santa Claus. Apollo: What's that got to do with anything? After examining Forbidden Chamber door, outline on table, cloth under armchair, window, and statue next to armchair: Apollo: (Guess that about wraps it up.) Now if only we could get that detective to tell us what he knows... Athena: Hey, Apollo... Do you hear something? Apollo: Hm? .........I don't hear anything. Athena: Oh, right. Your hearing must not be as sensitive as mine. Apollo: Um, what are you talking about? Athena: A whooshing sound, like wind rushing through a narrow strait. And the echo of someone's voice... \"In... In...\" Fulbright: IN JUSTICE WE TRUST! Athena: Aaaaaaaaah! Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Someone's got a sharp set of ears! That was the sound of my righteous voice reverberating through the air duct! Athena: I heard it through the air ducts? Fulbright: Yeah, check it out. Apollo: But why would she hear you through there? Fulbright: Why don't we go to the diagram? As you can see, that vent is connected to an air duct that leads out into the hallway! The wind must've rushed through there... ...and carried my monologue with it straight to your ears! Athena: And what a... unique monologue it was. I was just thinking... Maybe the killer made their escape through the air duct or something! Fulbright: Heh heh heh, a cute theory, but I don't think so. The air duct in the hallway is low enough to climb into, that much is true. But as you can see, the vent in the ceiling is very high. Nine feet high, in fact. (Changed from [9 feet high, in fact.] in the original release) I highly doubt that there's any way to get up there without a ladder or something. And I don't see anything of the sort in this room, do you? Athena: Hmm... I guess you're right. Apollo: Speaking of things in this room... Fulbright: Yeah? Apollo: Can you tell us what you guys turned up, Detective Fulbright? Fulbright: Not on my watch, buddy! In the name of justice, I cannot reveal facts pertaining to the prosecution's case! Apollo: Aw, come on, throw us a bone here. Athena: Excuse me, Detective Fulbright, but I recall you saying earlier... ...that you would come running whenever we were in need. Fulbright: Yurk! I suppose I did say that! Helping those in need is what justice is all about, but... But keeping information out of enemy hands is also a form of justice! Hmm... Aaaaargh! Which justice is the most just? Why is this always so hard! Athena: Hmm......... Well, how about this? Let's do a little give and take. I mean, serving the public is part of justice, too, right? You know, like the police motto? \"To serve and protect.\" Apollo: (I doubt leaking information to the defense team falls under that motto.) Fulbright: Yes, of course! I must serve as well as protect! (Changed from [Yes, of course! I must serve and [sic] well as protect!] in the original release) Okay, I will share some information. ...In the name of justice! Athena: We did it, Apollo! Apollo: Yeah, we did it, all right. (But I'm not sure that was entirely ethical...) Talk Details of the case Apollo: Was it Ms. Jinxie Tenma who first discovered the crime scene? Fulbright: That's right. And this photo shows what she saw when she opened the door. Ms. Tenma had a key, allowing her immediate access. Apollo: A key? So, then, the Fox Chamber was locked? Fulbright: Yes, and Ms. Tenma had the only key to its door. Apollo: Really? So, Alderman Kyubi didn't have a key to the Fox Chamber? Fulbright: Actually, he had a master key for most of the doors in the manor, but... It disappeared after his murder. Athena: Disappeared? You think the killer took it?! Fulbright: It could very well be connected to the murder. We're looking into the possibility now. But it's the timing of Ms. Tenma's discovery that I think is most important. Of course, I'm not going to share that information with you, ha ha ha! Athena: You think you're some kind of champion of justice, but you're just plain old mean! Fulbright: I won't fall for that, you shameless rascal! I only help good little boys and girls! Athena: Shameless rascal? Who even says that? Apollo: Well, I wouldn't exactly call you a good little girl, either. Crime Photo added to the Court Record. Details of the case (subsequent times) Apollo: Was it Ms. Jinxie Tenma who first discovered the crime scene? Fulbright: That's right. And this photo shows what she saw when she opened the door. Ms. Tenma had a key, allowing her immediate access. Apollo: A key? So, then, the Fox Chamber was locked? Fulbright: Yes, and Ms. Tenma had the only key to its door. Apollo: Really?

But it's the timing of Ms. Tenma's discovery that I think is most important. Of course, I'm not going to share that information with you, ha ha ha! Athena: You think you're some kind of champion of justice, but you're just plain old mean! Fulbright: I won't fall for that, you shameless rascal! I only help good little boys and girls! Athena: Shameless rascal? Who even says that? Apollo: Well, I wouldn't exactly call you a good little girl, either. Feathers and tracks Apollo: Those feathers and tracks look like something a yokai might leave behind. Fulbright: You don't actually think the murderer was some sort of monster, do you? Athena: What's the name of that creature in the Forbidden Chamber? Tenma... something... Because from the black feathers and big tracks, it looks like that creature did it. Fulbright: Our prime suspect would, no doubt, love to pin the blame on some imaginary creature. Athena: Can Tenma whatchamacallit even be made a victim of slander? Apollo: (I doubt the mayor would do something as childish as blaming a boogieman.) Athena: So, the most likely scenario so far is... ...that Tenma guy left the feathers and tracks behind... ...to make it look like yokai Tenma was the killer. Apollo: ...Wait, what? Now I'm as confused as you! (At any rate, I doubt Mayor Tenma would plant evidence like that.) Suspects Apollo: So, Mayor Tenma is your only suspect? Fulbright: That's right. Even his name, Damian Tenma, makes him sound like a villain. And he's really scary looking, too. Apollo: Wait, are you telling me that's why he was arrested? Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Don't be ridiculous! He was the only one without an alibi. Apollo: Oh, is that so? Fulbright: Yup. Other than the victim, the suspect, and Ms. Tenma, the only others around were... ...Mr. Filch and Mayor Tenma's aide, and the two of them were together at the time. Apollo: (Filch... The guy who tried to steal my bracelet. Just living up to his name, I guess. We should go talk to him again when we have a chance.) What about Jinxie? She's not being suspected at all? Fulbright: She may have no alibi whatsoever... but she also has no motive. It's unfathomable that she would murder the alderman, and pin the crime on her father. Besides, do you really think a little girl could lift up this huge spear? Apollo: True enough. That spear looks even bigger than her. Present Attorney's Badge Apollo: Um, so this is my attorney's badge. Fulbright: No, no! Present it with more confidence and conviction! Like this... In justice we trust! Apollo: Okay, um, how's this... Apollo Justice, attorney at law! H-Here comes Justice! Fulbright: That was amazing! But you know what they say, practice makes perfect. Let's see you do it ten more times! Apollo: Okay, I'll try my best! Athena: Um, Apollo? What are you doing? Apollo: (Ack! How'd he talk me into this?!) Anything else Fulbright: Justice need backup sometimes, too! So I don't mind you asking for help, but you should start by thinking things over yourself. After all, the road to justice starts with your own first step! Ha ha ha! Apollo: If you don't have any information to offer, you could just say so. After clearing all Talk options: Fulbright: That's about all I can reveal at this time. Well? You must admit, Damian Tenma appears to be the most likely suspect. Apollo: (I admit it looks bad, but I'm still not buying it.) Fulbright: Oh, and one more thing... I must warn you about the prosecutor. Apollo: The prosecutor assigned to Mayor Tenma's trial? Fulbright: That's the one. He's -- how shall I put it -- not what you'd expect. That is unless you've faced a convicted killer serving hard time as a prosecutor before. Apollo: What the--?! Is this some kind of joke? Talk The prosecution Leads to: \"Can I ask why a man imprisoned for murder is serving as prosecutor?\" Apollo: Can I ask why a man imprisoned for murder is serving as prosecutor? Fulbright: Because he's mastered the use of psychology in courtroom battles. Everyone's talking about how this murder was the work of some strange creature. But yokai are nothing more than a figment of the imagination. They're baloney! Who better to prove that than a master of psychology? He's the best man for the job. Apollo: But he's a convicted murderer! No matter how you look at it, that's just insane! Fulbright: Well, the chief prosecutor personally assigned him, so... ...none of us are in a position to question the matter, ha ha ha! Apollo: (This really is the dark age of the law.) Athena: This prosecutor... He wouldn't happen to go by the name \"Blackquill,\" would he? Fulbright: Bingo! Simon Blackquill. So, you HAVE heard of him? Athena: ...You could say that. Apollo: (What's that supposed to mean?) Fulbright: Well, I bet you don't know his unofficial title. Ever heard of the \"Twisted Samurai\"? That's Prosecutor Blackquill! Apollo: The \"Twisted Samurai\"...? Is that because he's a criminal? Fulbright: Well... Yes and no. You could say it also has to do with the effect his crime had on things. Apollo: How so...? Fulbright: His conviction is what twisted and warped the legal world into this dark age of the law. Apollo: What?! And HE of all people is going to stand in court tomorrow?! Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Never fear! I myself will be there to protect you! Apollo: ......... (That's reassuring, I guess...) Fulbright: Well, you kids knock yourselves out! Can't wait to see how you do tomorrow! Athena: Wait, Detective Fulbright. I've been meaning to ask you something. Um... Why are you barefoot? This doesn't look like the sort of place where you need to take your shoes off... Fulbright: Hm? Ah! Ahhhhhh! I hadn't even noticed. Why AM I barefoot? Apollo: (You honestly hadn't noticed until just now?!) .........Wait a second. Those shoes we found earlier... Excuse me, Detective Fulbright. These wouldn't happen to be your shoes, would they? Fulbright: Yes! Yes they are! My favorite pair, in fact! Thank you for bringing them to me. You must truly be on the side of justice! Apollo: (Don't tell me Mr. Filch actually stole from a detective?) Athena: Stealing shoes right off of someone's feet... That's pretty amazing. Apollo: I find it more amazing that Detective Fulbright didn't notice. (Well, looks like we've gotten all we can out of the detective, so let's see... Maybe we should go have a word with Mr. Filch. I want to hear what his \"alibi\" is.) April 17Kyubi Manor - Foyer Filch: This is just awful! T-Terrible, I say! S-Somebody, help! Athena: Oh, look, it's mister-- what was it again? Finch? Filch: No, no, no! The name's Filch, Phineas Filch! Apollo: (Keep on pilfering and you may wind up a jail bird instead.) So what seems to be the problem, Mr. Filch? Filch: Oh, it's just terrible! Terrible, I tell ya! Come quick! Apollo: O-Okay...? (What's the deal with him all of a sudden?) Apollo: Looks like some kind of mask. Filch: I-It's The Amazing Nine-Tails's mask! Apollo: The Amazing Nine-Tails...? (Oh, right -- the wrestler who appeared during the festival's special event...) What's his mask doing here? Filch: He'd never take off his mask like this! Someone musta killed 'im! Apollo: Whaaa--?! Wh-Who would do such a thing? Athena: Let's go talk over there in private. Apollo: Hm? Look... There's some white hair caught up inside this mask... Amazing Nine-Tails Mask added to the Court Record. Apollo: So, what makes you believe that The Amazing Nine-Tails has been murdered? Filch: Ya really wanna know, eh? You're a studious one, ain't ya! Eh heh he! Apollo: Yes, I mean, no. Er, I mean, just tell me, please. Filch: Well, it's like this. I'd dreamed o' becoming a wrassler myself! Hey, how 'bout ya join me in the quest for the champion's belt?! Whadda team! Me in my bandit's mask and you in that demon mask of yours! Apollo: Demon mask? Heh heh. Wonder if I could make it big. Athena: Apollo, let's save your pro wrestling debut until after the trial. Apollo: Huh?! Oh, no no! I wasn't actually... (Argh! Why did I let him pull me off topic like that?!) Athena: Come on, Apollo -- ask him about The Amazing Nine-Tails's murder already! Talk The Amazing Nine-Tails Filch: The Amazing Nine-Tails is our village's savior, and don't ya forget it! His trademark's a gold cape made to look like nine fox tails! He whirls through the ring, smacking down Tenma Town wrestlers left 'n' right! He sparked the monster craze, revitalizing Nine-Tales [sic] Vale in the blink of an eye. Yep, saved our village from becoming a ghost town. Now it's a yokai town, eh heh heh. Apollo: Huh, The Amazing Nine-Tails really does sound, well... amazing. Filch: Yeah, pretty amazing, huh? That's why he's worshipped like a hero 'round here! I'm proud to be from the same village as him. Athena: Come to think of it, you look kind of monster-like yourself, Mr. Filch. Guess it makes sense since you're from the same village as The Amazing Nine-Tails! Filch: Eh heh heh... I know! A lot o' people have told me I look like a yokai. Apollo: (Since when was that a compliment?) Ouch! What's the big idea! Filch: Eh heh heh... Check your pocket. Apollo: Hey, how'd you do that?! Filch: Keep it. I got lots more. Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy added to the Court Record. Apollo: So, you keep saying that the Amazing Nine-Tails was killed. What's the story behind that? The Amazing Nine-Tails (subsequent times) Filch: The Amazing Nine-Tails is our village's savior, and don't ya forget it! His trademark's a gold cape made to look like nine fox tails! He whirls through the ring, smacking down Tenma Town wrestlers left 'n' right! He sparked the monster craze, revitalizing Nine-Tales [sic] Vale in the blink of an eye. Yep, saved our village from becoming a ghost town. Now it's a yokai town, eh heh heh. Apollo: Huh, The Amazing Nine-Tails really does sound, well... amazing. Filch: Yeah, pretty amazing, huh? That's why he's worshipped like a hero 'round here! I'm proud to be from the same village as him. Athena: Come to think of it, you look kind of monster-like yourself, Mr. Filch. Guess it makes sense since you're from the same village as The Amazing Nine-Tails! Filch: Eh heh heh... I know! A lot o' people have told me I look like a yokai. Apollo: (Since when was that a compliment?) Amazing Nine-Tails's Death (appears after \"The Amazing Nine-Tails\") Apollo: Are you saying he was murdered because his mask washed up along the river outside? Filch: That's only part o' it. The main reason is no one's seen 'im since the special event. The word 'round Nine-Tails Vale is he was killed by Tenma Taro. Apollo: You villagers really are superstitious, aren't you? Filch: That we are. We love conspiracy theories, too, like the mayor's diabolical plot. Apollo: The mayor? Of Tenma Town? What is he plotting? Filch: Rumor has it he's planning on releasing Tenma Taro. That's why he wants the merger. He'll open the Forbidden Chamber once he's in control. Apollo: That's quite a tale. Filch: Ain't finished yet! There was only one person who could stop the mayor. Our hero, The Amazing Nine-Tails! He vowed to battle the mayor of Tenma Town and stop the municipal merger! Apollo: ......... (I couldn't make this stuff up if I tried.) Athena: Apollo! We still have to ask him about the alderman's murder, remember? About the alderman's murder (appears after \"Amazing Nine-Tails's Death\") Apollo: Mr. Filch, would you mind telling us what you were doing at the time of the murder? Filch: I was in the caretaker's office guarding the entrance like Mr. Kyubi said I should. And I made double sure no one came in. I have a clear view of the foyer from where I work. Apollo: (He must be talking about this small room in the upper right. It definitely looks like you can keep track of the comings and goings from there.) And you have an alibi to back your statement up, Mr. Filch? Filch: Eh heh heh. I do, indeed! I was with Mayor Tenma's aide. Florent L'Belle's his name. Apollo: So, the two of you were together... That's a pretty sound alibi, all right. And nobody came in or out of the manor around the time of the murder? Filch: Kept watch here the whole time. Didn't see a soul pass by. And if anyone did, that there security camera woulda spotted 'em. Apollo: (So no one came in or out around the time of the murder... That means we're dealing with someone who was already inside when it happened.) So, do you think this mask is the real deal? Filch: Without a doubt. This here's the mask worn by The Amazing Nine-Tails. Apollo: What about that white hair I found inside the mask? Athena: Wait! I just thought of something! Remember the golden animal fur we found at the crime scene? Could it have come from this mask? Look! There's even a spot where some fur is missing. Apollo: Hmm... Then this places this mask at the crime scene at some point in time. Which means......... (What does this mean? Someone with white hair who is linked with the murder and is against the merger? No way...! Could The Amazing Nine-Tails and the alderman actually be...?!) Athena: Something wrong, Apollo? You should see the look on your face! Apollo: Oh, no, it's n-nothing. (Maybe Jinxie could tell us something, since she works here...) Golden Fur reattached to The Amazing Nine-Tails's mask. About the alderman's murder (subsequent times) Apollo: Mr. Filch, would you mind telling us what you were doing at the time of the murder? Filch: I was in the caretaker's office guarding the entrance like Mr. Kyubi said I should. And I made double sure no one came in. I have a clear view of the foyer from where I work. Apollo: (He must be talking about this small room in the upper right. It definitely looks like you can keep track of the comings and goings from there.) And you have an alibi to back your statement up, Mr. Filch? Filch: Eh heh heh. I do, indeed! I was with Mayor Tenma's aide. Florent L'Belle's his name. Apollo: So, the two of you were together... That's a pretty sound alibi, all right. And nobody came in or out of the manor around the time of the murder? Filch: Kept watch here the whole time. Didn't see a soul pass by. And if anyone did, that there security camera woulda spotted 'em. Apollo: (So no one came in or out around the time of the murder... That means we're dealing with someone who was already inside when it happened.) Present Amazing Nine-Tails's Mask Filch: Hey, that there's The Amazing Nine-Tails's mask! Yer aiming to sell it, aint ya?! Why you sneaky, lily-livered-- Apollo: No, I'm not trying to sell it. It could be a key piece of evidence. Filch: Aw, too bad. Thought I'd hook ya up with this buyer I know. Apollo: Wait, you WANT me to sell it?! Anything else Apollo: You mind if I ask you about this? Filch: Hm? Oh, that... Right, right... Apollo: Well, does it ring a bell? Filch: Eh heh heh heh... Oh, it's ringing, all right. Ya wanna thank me for all my hard work, and I humbly accept! Apollo: No, this isn't a gift! (Should've known this was a dead end.) Kyubi Manor Garden or Detention Center Talk Any ideas? Apollo: Come up with anything yet? Athena: Oh! O-Of course I have! But it's not quite ready for primetime. Apollo: Huh? Athena: The truth will only be revealed once we've dotted all our i's and crossed all our t's. In other words, it's still just a theory, so I don't think I should say anything yet. It's the dilemma any great detective must face! Widget: Whatever! Athena: Tsk! Widget! Apollo: (So basically, you have no ideas. Thanks for nothing.) About the murder Apollo: What are your thoughts on the case so far? Athena: Well... I think our killer is most likely highly intelligent and stone-cold cool. I mean, just look how they killed the alderman: one decisive thrust, no hesitation. Apollo: And you know this how? Psychology? Athena: That's right! I've profiled the killer based on the evidence we found at the scene! I can almost picture the killer in my mind... A terrifying face twisted from hatred toward the victim... Big, bulging eyes full of murderous intent... A horrible gash-like mouth from ear to ear... And... wings, black and sinister. Apollo: Wings? That sounds like Tenma Taro! Athena: On second thought, scratch psychology. That last part was just my imagination. Apollo: You think?! Present Amazing Nine-Tails's Mask Athena: So who do you think is the man behind The Amazing Nine-Tails mask? Apollo: Well, there was that white hair we found inside the mask. I have a feeling it's going to be a valuable clue. Athena: We should run a DNA test on it. Ooh! And what if the results show that the hair's not human? Don't you think it's fun to fantasize about stuff like that? Apollo: Sure, as long as you're prepared to have that fantasy shattered by the results, too. Athena: In that case, let's forget about the DNA testing! After clearing \"About the alderman's murder\" Talk option in Kyubi Manor - Foyer: April 17Nine-Tails Vale - Yokai Lane Apollo: Oh, look, there's Jinxie. Jinxie: Milk, cheese, yogurt, ice cream, and... Apollo: (Sounds like she's out grocery shopping. She must really like dairy products.) Jinxie: ...a charm to make a better milkshake and another to cure my lactose intolerance. Apollo: (Maybe she should just stick to soy milk.) Jinxie! Hey, it's me! Jinxie: Eek! It's th-th-the demon lawyer! Apollo: Ack! (Not another warding charm... *sigh*) Athena: Um, Apollo? Who is she? Apollo: Oh, right. This is your first time meeting each other. This is Jinxie, Mayor Tenma's daughter. She was the first to discover the crime scene. Athena: Oh, so she's the one who--! Um, hello. My name's Athena Cykes. I'll be helping Apollo defend your father at his trial. Pleased to meet you! Jinxie: P-Pleased to meet you, too. Uhh... Um, where's Trucy? Apollo: She went back to the office ahead of us. But don't worry. Athena and I are on the case! Jinxie: W-W-Wait, how do I know you didn't...! ...That you d-d-didn't gobble her up alive! Apollo: Relax, I didn't eat her up! And I wouldn't do such a thing in the first place! Jinxie: Oh, poor little Trucy! *sniffle* Apollo: (I'm about ready for some tears of frustration myself.) Athena: She's quite an, um, interesting character, huh, Apollo... Talk The incident Apollo: Jinxie, do you remember any more of what happened? Jinxie: Not much. ...At least not yet. Apollo: But you do think Tenma Taro was the killer, right? That yokai we saw at the festival? Jinxie: I don't know anything about that! Apollo: Huh? But you said Tenma Taro murdered the alderman. ...It's okay, Jinxie. You can tell me-- Yikes! What was that for?! Jinxie: People see things when they don't get enough sleep. There's no such thing as monsters. Apollo: Huh?! (What's gotten into her?) So, if there are no monsters, you admit I'm human? Jinxie: No, you're still a demon! Apollo: ............ Oh, I give up. Athena: It seems like Jinxie doesn't want to talk about Tenma Taro for some reason. Apollo: But that's precisely what we need to know more about... Besides, she definitely thought there was a yokai there in the Fox Chamber. Jinxie, about this charm... Jinxie: Ah! That's...! Apollo: You gave me this when I was heading off to the scene of the crime. You thought Tenma Taro was the murderer. That's why you gave this to me, right? Jinxie: Errr... That's true, but... Apollo: If there's anything else you could tell us, it would really help. And it will help your father, too! Jinxie: Umm... All right, then. Tenma Taro did it? (appears after \"The incident\") Apollo: Why do you think Tenma Taro's the killer? Jinxie: I saw him. Saw him with my own eyes. Tenma Taro was right there in the manor! He escaped his prison... ...and ran right by me! Athena: Whaaaaaat?! Apollo: Jinxie, tell us everything you saw! Jinxie: I called the police after I stumbled on the scene. I was just about to head back to the festival grounds when... ...I saw Tenma Taro. It was right around here. He was running right at me! I was... I was paralyzed with fear. But there was no one around to help me. *shiver* The foul beast raced right by me toward the foyer. Apollo: Toward the foyer? Athena: Mr. Filch and Mr. L'Belle were supposedly in the foyer at the time. That means they would've seen Tenma Taro, too. Apollo: Sounds like we'd better get their statements. (Considering Jinxie's mental state, her eyes could've been playing tricks on her.) Athena: Um... Apollo? Remember the picture in this paper? Someone caught Tenma Taro flying through the air. I wonder if it's the same Tenma Taro Jinxie says she saw. Apollo: ...Don't be ridiculous! Jinxie: *shiver* Tenma Taro IS the killer. And he can fly, too. The Amazing Nine-Tails Apollo: (Jinxie works at the alderman's manor, so maybe she can shed some light on this.) So, no one knows The Amazing Nine-Tails's true identity? Jinxie: Uh-huh. They say no one's ever seen him without his mask. Apollo: Doesn't that make you want to know even more? Jinxie: Uh-huh. That's why matches where wrestlers try to expose their opponent are so popular. Apollo: Wait... you mean expose, as in strip them naked? Jinxie: Eek! You even think like a demon! ...The only thing the winner removes is the loser's mask. To have your mask torn off is the worst humiliation a wrestler could suffer! That's why their masks are more important to them than life itself. So you see, these unmasking matches are life and death battles for the wrestlers. Apollo: (That means this mask didn't just happen to wash up along the riverbank. There's got to be a story behind it.) Jinxie: No one can stop The Amazing Nine-Tails! Apollo: (Bet she'd be shocked to find out he's really the alderman.) The Tenma Taro you saw (appears after \"Tenma Taro did it?\") Apollo: About the yokai you saw at the scene of the crime... Anything else stand out? Jinxie: Actually, I heard this strange jangly sound. Athena: A jangly sound? Can you be a little more specific? Jinxie: My memory's kind of fuzzy... But I vaguely recall seeing Tenma Taro holding a staff or something like that. Maybe that's what was making the strange sound. Apollo: Does Tenma Taro usually carry a staff? Jinxie: Good question. I've never heard anything like that and it's not shown on the scroll. Apollo: How about in other documents? Any of them show Tenma Taro with a staff? Jinxie: This is the only known document depicting Tenma Taro. After all, those who needlessly depict the demon are forever cursed. (Changed from [After all, those who needless [sic] depict the demon are forever cursed.] in the original release) Apollo: Then what's the deal with the Tenma Taro you saw, Jinxie? Yokai Legend Scroll updated in the Court Record. Jinxie's Statement added to the Court Record. The Tenma Taro you saw (subsequent times) Apollo: About the yokai you saw at the scene of the crime... Anything else stand out? Jinxie: Actually, I heard this strange jangly sound. Athena: A jangly sound? Can you be a little more specific? Jinxie: My memory's kind of fuzzy... But I vaguely recall seeing Tenma Taro holding a staff or something like that. Maybe that's what was making the strange sound. Apollo: Does Tenma Taro usually carry a staff? Jinxie: Good question. I've never heard anything like that and it's not shown on the scroll. Apollo: How about in other documents? Any of them show Tenma Taro with a staff? Jinxie: This is the only known document depicting Tenma Taro. After all, those who needlessly depict the demon are forever cursed. (Changed from [After all, those who needless [sic] depict the demon are forever cursed.] in the original release) Apollo: Then what's the deal with the Tenma Taro you saw, Jinxie? Present Nine-Tails Flower Jinxie: The Nine-Tailed Fox is famous for imprisoning Tenma Taro, but legends say that he also... ...gave us the Nine-Tails Flower, and that he still watches over the village to this day. Apollo: Wow, coming here is like traveling to ancient Japan with all the strange beliefs and all. All those yokai, the Nine-Tails Flower, the Forbidden Chamber, and the list goes on. Jinxie: Uh-huh. It was like I should've been born here. Too bad the population is shrinking. But there's an effort underway to protect the yokai. It also helps the local economy. Apollo: Protect the yokai? You mean like endangered species? Jinxie: Uh-huh. There're even plans to create a yokai wildlife park in the near future. Apollo: Now I'm really starting to wonder about this place. Crime Photo Apollo: Jinxie, I wanted to show you this-- Athena: Wait, Apollo! You can't show that to her. Having her father arrested was bad enough. Jinxie: Huh? Did you say something? Apollo: (Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.) Oh, um, never mind. Amazing Nine-Tails's Mask Apollo: (Wait, Jinxie's a huge fan of The Amazing Nine-Tails. She'd probably freak out if I showed her this mask without the guy in it.) Athena: What are you thinking?! It would crush her if she figured out her favorite wrestler is dead. Apollo: Guess I'll spare her the grief, although she really could use a reality check. Jinxie: ? Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy Jinxie: Ah! Th-Th-That's The Amazing Nine-Tails! He... he lives in the mountains right outside the village. But he often comes to visit. Apollo: Really? He doesn't sound very secret or reclusive to me. Jinxie: No, he's not. In fact, he visits the village bathhouse all the time. Athena: No way! The Amazing Nine-Tails goes to public bathhouses?! Jinxie: Uh-huh. But like a true wrestling legend, he never takes his mask off. Apollo: He takes baths in his mask? Jinxie: Uh-huh. And he also has a towel that says, \"Wrestlers Wanted!\" Apollo: If I saw a naked guy in a mask and a message like that on his towel, I'd run the other way. Jinxie's Statement Jinxie: I saw... him... Tenma Taro. It nearly scared me to death. Athena: Do you see a lot of monsters, Jinxie? Jinxie: Uh-huh. *shivers* In fact, I encountered the Sunekosuri this morning. *shivers* Apollo: Sune... kosuri? You know, I don't know that one. Tell me about it. Jinxie: It's a mean little beast that trips you by bumping into your shins. I keep tripping all the time because of that pesky little thing! When it gets really bad, I stick Sunekosuri warding charms on my shins! Apollo: Um, how about investing in some shin guards, and watching your step instead? Anything else Jinxie: What's this? A Tsukumogami? Apollo: Tsukumo... gami? Jinxie: A yokai that inhabits objects that have been used for a really long time. The Red Demon and a Tsukumogami... What a strange combination. Apollo: (Is everything to her some supernatural phenomenon?) After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: Why didn't you tell me you saw Tenma Taro earlier? Jinxie: Actually... Mr. L'Belle told me not to tell. Apollo: Mr. L'Belle? Jinxie: Papa's aide. Apollo: (Oh, right. The other guy who was supposedly in the foyer at the time of the crime.) And what exactly did he tell you? Jinxie: \"Keep the village superstitions in mind... ...before you go talking about seeing Tenma Taro at the time of the crime.\" Apollo: Village superstitions? Jinxie: They say you must not gaze upon Tenma Taro. But in the event that you do look... ...and then tell anyone what you saw, Tenma Taro will claim your soul. Apollo: And that's something everyone here knows? (Sounds like a bunch of baloney to me.) Jinxie: Uh-huh. Everyone from babies to the village elders know about it. But I didn't because I'm not from around here. Apollo: Hey, come to think of it... Apollo: (Huh? Why's everyone hiding their faces?) Villager: Hey, you there! You mustn't stare at Tenma Taro like that! Lower your eyes! He'll steal your soul if you're not careful! Apollo: Huh? (Steal my soul? Seriously?) Apollo: (The guy at the special event thing said almost the exact same thing.) Athena: Apollo, do you think this L'Belle guy actually believes in Tenma Taro? Apollo: I seriously doubt it. He's not even from Nine-Tails Vale. Athena: Then why would he try to keep Jinxie from talking? Apollo: Good question. I think we'd better go have a word with him. Athena: Time to unmask this monster of a mystery. Jinxie: The last time I saw Mr. L'Belle, he was relaxing in the foyer. Athena: Bueno! Next stop, the manor foyer! With any luck, he'll be there waiting for us! April 17Kyubi Manor - Foyer Athena: There's no one here. Guess our luck isn't so good when it comes to Mr. L'Belle. Apollo: Maybe he's out for a walk or something. (Hmm? Somebody left something on the sill of the caretaker's office window.) Oh, it's a TV program guide. Athena: Looks like someone circled a pro wrestling match. Filch: Hey, whaddya think you're doing! Athena: Eek! I-I-It's a...! Oh, Mr. Filch! Wh-What can we do for you? Apollo: (I bet she was going to scream, \"Monster!\" which really isn't much of a stretch...) Filch: Ain't nothing I need you to do for me. But what business do ya got with my TV listings? Apollo: Oh, no, it just caught my eye. Can I ask if you watched this pro wrestling program today? Filch: Yep, 'twas a match between a couple o' rank amateurs, though. It was a complete disaster. I reckon even I coulda done better than that. Apollo: (I seriously doubt that.) TV Listings added to the Court Record. Apollo: (Almost forgot. There's something I wanted to ask him.) Mr. Filch, did you see anything unusual around the time of the murder? For example, Tenma Taro or something like that? Filch: Huh?! T-Tenma Taro?! Apollo: So you did see him? Filch: Errr... My, how clean and shiny your forehead is again today, Mr. Lawyer, sir! Bet ya shine it up every day real purty like. The ladies must love it, eh heh heh. Apollo: Don't change the subject! And FYI, that was a seriously bad attempt at flattery. Jinxie said she saw Tenma Taro flee toward the foyer. So you must've seen him too if you were here! Filch: Yi-Yi-Yiiiiiiiiipes! Apollo: (Wow, I really pushed a button there!) Well, did you see anything or not? ???: ???: That is quite enough. I must ask that you not pester my friend anymore. Filch: Yipes! Forgive me for being pestered, sir! Apollo: And you are? ???: I am Florent L'Belle... L'Belle: ...beau divine and PERSONAL aide to Mayor Damian Tenma. Apollo: (Beau divine? More like yokai grotesque. This place is crawling with monsters.) L'Belle: OH! Excuse YOU! Apollo: Ack! Wh-What the heck was that for?! L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! It was just a little cologne. You had a look of stinky sweat about you. It's from my OWN original brand of cosmetics called \"Je suis L'Belle!\" *sniff sniff sniff* Oh, what a heavenly scent. Apollo: Ugh. I think you just paralyzed my olfactory receptors. L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! I suppose such a scent WOULD be difficult for a peasant to appreciate. I'll have you know, THAT is Brand No. 5 \"Bonjour.\" It's MY way of introducing myself. Enjoy! Apollo: (Where's my bottle of \"Adieu\" so I can return the favor?) Enough about the cologne. Please tell us what you saw around the time of the murder. Talk Keeping Jinxie quiet Apollo: I heard you're the one who told Jinxie not to mention that she saw Tenma Taro. L'Belle: Why that little--! So, she told you she saw the demon, did she? Athena: Mr. L'Belle, do you mind if I ask whether you believe in the village superstitions? (Changed from [Mr. L'Belle, do mind [sic] if I ask whether you believe in the village superstitions?] in the original release) L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Oh, PU-LEASE! I was merely trying to keep with traditions. Nevertheless, I will say this... I wouldn't stick MY nose into this whole Tenma Taro business if I were you. Bad things happen to those who do. THAT much is true. He is one... scary... monster. Apollo: That's crazy! You really expect me to believe that monsters are real? L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Well, YOU'RE real, and YOU sure look like a monster. Apollo: (Look who's talking!) So, Mr. L'Belle, you didn't see Tenma Taro? Aaah! L'Belle: Little Jinxie has an ACTIVE imagination. Isn't that right, Phineas? Filch: That's right. I didn't see nothing, especially not Tenma Taro! L'Belle: As for ME, I only see things of beauty. That's why I can barely see you. ...Pwh! Ah ha ha ha! Apollo: (I've got two words for this guy: total freak.) Your alibi Apollo: Could I ask you what you were doing at the time of the crime? L'Belle: In other words, you'd like to hear MY alibi. Tsk, to think you'd suspect ME of all people! Apollo: Oh, no, it's just a formality. We ask everyone the same questions. Aaah! L'Belle: How DARE you doubt me! That's an affront to beauty itself! You OBVIOUSLY can't see straight! Apollo: Urnngh... Like that spritz really helped...! L'Belle: What were WE doing, you ask? Go ahead, Filchy, answer the question. Filch: Errr... At the time of the crime, we were... um... uh... in this here foyer! L'Belle: Exactly! Good answer, Filchy, good answer! Filch: Eh heh he. Just repeating whatcha told-- Youch! L'Belle: You've said QUITE enough! Apollo: (.........What is WITH these two? Great, now he's got me talking like that.) Present Tenma Taro Warding Charm L'Belle: Yes? That's a warding charm, but why are YOU showing it to ME? Apollo: ............ (Guess it doesn't work on all monsters.) Yurk! L'Belle: Shame on you, thinking THAT would work on ME! Apollo: Blech! L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! You should be honored to be bathed in my beautiful scent, peasant! Apollo: Ack... (Now I really wish it would work.) Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy L'Belle: Pffft, The Amazing Nine-Tails? What's so AMAZING about HIM? I mean, MY glossies are selling WAY better than his. Apollo: You sell glossies of yourself? L'Belle: That's right. I have one for all seven of my hair colors! Apollo: ............ (Well, guess that's it. Civilization over.) L'Belle: Tsk, if you WANT one, you need simply ask. I'll even let you choose the color yourself. Apollo: No, thank you! Anything else L'Belle: Yes? Do you ALWAYS go around sticking your hand in OTHER people's faces? Apollo: Oh, no, I just wanted to show you this. L'Belle: Ah, yes, you DO have something in that grimy paw of yours. But I only have eyes for things of beauty. Now, if you would excuse me. Apollo: (Guess he'll only look at stuff that interests him.) After clearing all Talk options: L'Belle: Are we quite through here? I'm a VERY busy man, you know. Apollo: ...Right. Well, thanks for your help. (So, these two were in the foyer, but didn't see Tenma Taro.) L'Belle: Come along, Filchy. Filch: Where we goin'? Oh, right! Gotta practice them statements for tomorrow! ...Yipes! My eyyyes! L'Belle: You're going to dig your own grave with that big mouth of yours someday! Apollo: ......... (What does he mean, \"practice statements\"?) L'Belle: Now if you would excuse me, it's time to touch up my makeup. (Changed from [Now if would [sic] excuse me. It's time to touch up my makeup.] in the original release) Athena: Apollo, I know this sounds strange... ...but Mr. L'Belle seems unusually preoccupied with Tenma Taro. Apollo: Really? How can you tell? Athena: Well, it's kind of hard to explain. You see, I can read people's emotions from the tone of their voice. Apollo: You mean you have good ears? Athena: Something like that. People's emotions are expressed in the tone of their voice. And my ears can pick up even the subtlest of tones for some reason. Apollo: That's an interesting skill... But what do you mean he's preoccupied with Tenma Taro? Athena: I'm not exactly sure, but it was like he was... obsessed with the thought of Tenma Taro... That's what I picked up from his voice, anyway. Apollo: Everywhere we turn it's Tenma Taro this, Tenma Taro that. Hmm... Athena: We should go talk to the mayor, too. Apollo: Sounds like a plan. (We need to get to the bottom of that rumor about him wanting to release Tenma Taro.) April 17Detention Center - Visitor's Room Athena: Something wrong, Apollo? Where did your enthusiasm go? Apollo: (What am I doing asking the mayor if he has ever thought about releasing Tenma Taro?! At best, he'll think I'm an idiot. At worst... *shudder*) Athena: Oh, he's here! Tenma: ......... Athena: It's so nice to finally meet you! I'm Mr. Justice's partner, Athena Cykes! I'm looking forward to working with you, Mr. Tenma... Taro! Tenma: Hm?! ...Oh, yes. I look forward to working with you, too. Apollo: (Eek! Glad he didn't mind Athena calling him by a completely wrong name!) Athena: Apollo, he's just as kind and gentle-looking as I'd imagined! Apollo: (Lucky for you, after that blunder you just made...) Um, there was something I wanted to talk to you about. There are rumors going around about how you want to or did set Tenma Taro free. Tenma: What utter nonsense! Apollo: Yikes! Tenma: They always assume the worst of me because of the way I look! But those rumors don't have a shred of truth, I tell you! Athena: A little touchy about his appearance, isn't he? Apollo: (What he really needs to work on are his people skills...) Talk Tenma Taro's revival Apollo: Um... So rumor has it that you want to push the merger through... ...in order to release Tenma Taro. Of course, that's a bunch of baloney, isn't it? Tenma: Grrrrrr! Apollo: Ack! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry if I offended you! Tenma: So, that's the talk around town, is it?! Apollo: I can see how that would make you angry. Tenma: .........What if Jinxie's schoolmates start teasing her about this? Apollo: Huh? Tenma: I must break out of here at once! Her tormentors must be taught a lesson! Apollo: No, wait! First, we have to get you a not-guilty verdict. Tenma: Don't try to stop me! This is about a father's duty to his darling daughter. Hold tight, sweet Jinxie! Daddy's coming to save you! Apollo: Relax! We'll look out for your daughter until we can get you free. Tenma: Hrmmm... Is that so? You don't need me to... go straighten things out myself? Apollo: (Whoo boy... They'd probably call in the SWAT team if he showed up at her school. Oh, right. I ought to ask about the reason behind the merger.) Why the merger? (appears after \"Tenma Taro's revival\") Apollo: It seems like you were rather forceful in pushing for the municipal merger. Did you really want Nine-Tails Vale that badly? Tenma: Yes, well, it's quite an attractive prize in terms of tourism. BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: (Wait... Am I feeling what I think I'm feeling?) Tenma: Sure, I played a bit of hardball, but only when I deemed it necessary. Apollo: (I knew it. My bracelet's reacting!) Athena: What is it, Apollo? Apollo: Mayor Tenma may not be telling the whole truth. Athena: Really? How can you tell? Apollo: People invariably tense up when they lie. That's where my bracelet here comes in. I can sense when the person I'm talking to is feeling tense... ...because it begins to feel tight on my arm. Athena: Noooooo waaaaaay! You can do that?! Apollo: Wait, so you believe me? Just like that? Athena: Sure. Each of us has our own special gifts. Apollo: (Oh yeah. Athena has a gift, too: her special sense of hearing...) Athena: Still, what do you think the mayor's lying about? Apollo: I don't know, but it's our job to find out. (It's been a while since my bracelet last reacted like this. Let's see if I still remember how to do this... First I touch my bracelet ([X / Y / R])... Right! Now let's give it a whirl!) Present Bracelet Yes, I remember this feeling of intense concentration! The ability to see the smallest twitch, the slightest frown that no one else can see... Now, Mayor Tenma was lying somewhere in that statement he just made. And when he lied, a certain \"habit\" made itself clear just under his right eye. I just have to shift my viewpoint up and focus on that area! Pan to right eyelid Leads to: \"All right, I've got him now.\" Apollo: All right, I've got him now. His nervous tell should appear when he's trying to pull the wool over my eyes. (Changed from [His tic should appear when he's trying to pull the wool over my eyes.] in the original release) I've gotta pore over every word he says, and wait for it to appear. (Changed from [I've gotta pour [sic] over every word he says, and wait for his tic to appear.] in the original release) And when it does, I'll \"Perceive\" ([X / Y / R]) it! Tenma: Yes, well, it's quite an attractive prize in terms of tourism. Perceive right eyelid on \"in terms of tourism.\" Apollo: Leads to: \"Mr. Mayor, please, you can trust us with the truth.\" Perceive wrong area Apollo: Apollo: Something is upsetting you right now... Is that not correct?! I know because of that telltale habit of yours. Tenma: ......... Apollo: .........Well? Ack! Tenma: ......... I get that often. Am I really that strange? Apollo: Oh, no, no. Th-That's not what I meant. I didn't mean to imply there was anything wrong with you! Athena: Well done, Apollo. Now both of you are upset! Apollo: (Argh, let's try that again.) Leads back to presenting bracelet Apollo: Mr. Mayor, please, you can trust us with the truth. Tenma: The truth? I don't understand. Apollo: When you mentioned tourism... ...the bottom of your right eye started twitching. Tenma: What nonsense is this?! So what if it did?! Apollo: Please, tell us more about your merger bid. Tenma: What more is there to tell? Apollo: Why were you really seeking to merge with Nine-Tails Vale? Tenma: I already told you: tourism. The monster craze really revitalized the village, making it quite the prize. Apollo: You really don't trust us, do you? Tenma: What are you talking about? The village has been hot property ever since the monster craze started, has it not? Apollo: I think you've yet to realize that what you're saying contradicts the facts. You say that the monster craze really revitalized Nine-Tails Vale, so... ...you felt it would be an attractive prize for its tourism. But that would contradict this. Present Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy Apollo: Leads to: \"The monster craze in Nine-Tails Vale is a very recent phenomenon.\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: This evidence proves you're not being entirely truthful with us. Aaaack! S-Sorry, sorry! I take it all back! Tenma: ...Oh, forgive me. There was a fly that was driving me crazy. Apollo: If that's how he deals with flies, I'd hate to see him when he's really angry. Tenma: So, you think I'm not being entirely truthful? Apollo: Y-Yes... yes, sir. (This guy is seriously scary!) Leads back to: \"I think you've yet to realize that what you're saying contradicts the facts.\" Apollo: The monster craze in Nine-Tails Vale is a very recent phenomenon. It was sparked when The Amazing Nine-Tails rose up against the municipal merger. The village was practically a ghost town before then. Tenma: Argh! Apollo: So, you see, you couldn't have possibly seen it as an attractive prize for its tourism. What's the REAL reason behind your push to merge Tenma Town with Nine-Tails Vale, huh? Tenma: W-Well, umm... uhh... Ah... Ah... Arrrrrrrrrgh! Why the merger? (after perceiving) Apollo: Are you ready to tell me the truth now? Tenma: Honesly, I never wanted to pursue the merger in the first place. But I had no choice if I wanted to protect my darling little Jinxie. Apollo: Protect her from what? Tenma: I received a threat. It said either I go through with the merger or my Jinxie dies. Apollo: What?! Athena: How awful! Who would do such a thing? Tenma: I don't know. But whoever blackmailed me must be connected to the murder. Apollo: Wait, so you think the blackmailer and the killer could be one and the same? Tenma: Alderman Kyubi was immensely popular, so you have to ask, who would want him dead? The blackmailer who wanted the merger at all costs had all the motive in the world. Athena: But why go from blackmail to murder?! The merger protests won't disappear just because the alderman was killed. Apollo: Ah! (Could it be...!) What if there was another reason for the murder? Athena: Like what? Apollo: Maybe the blackmailer discovered Alderman Kyubi's secret identity! And his secret identity was a threat to the blackmailer's merger scheme! Athena: What do secret identities have to do with anything, Apollo? Apollo: (I have evidence revealing the alderman's secret identity. Maybe it's time to use it.) Present Crime Photo Apollo: Um... this is a photo of the crime scene. You didn't happen to see a yokai there, did you? Tenma: ...What in the world are you talking about? Apollo: Oh, no, I'm not saying I believe in monsters or anything, aha ha ha. Tenma: ......... Apollo: I-I'm sorry! Tenma: ............... Hrmm... Apollo: Heh heh... (Please, somebody let me out of here!) Ummm... so did you see one? You know, like, I don't know, Tenma Taro or... Never mind, just forget it, heh heh! Tenma: ............Huh... Huh huh... Huh. Apollo: (Is he laughing at me, with me, or even laughing at all? It's kinda hard to tell.) Amazing Nine-Tails Mask (after clearing \"Why the merger?\" Talk option after perceiving) Leads to: \"Mayor Tenma, please take a look at this if you would.\" Apollo: Mayor Tenma, please take a look at this if you would. Tenma: That's...! That's The Amazing Nine-Tails's mask! What is the meaning of this?! Apollo: This mask was almost definitely at the crime scene. And there was some white hair inside. Tenma: White hair... you say? Apollo: There was but one person with white hair in the manor that day. Tenma: Wha... What are you saying!? Apollo: You know which man I'm talking about, right? I'm talking about Rex Kyubi -- The Amazing Nine-Tails himself! Athena: No way! Tenma: The alderman was--! Impossible! Athena: Wait! Come to think of it, Alderman Kyubi WAS a former pro wrestler! So the blackmailer turned killer when he discovered the alderman's secret identity! Apollo: Um, didn't I just say that? But yeah, The Amazing Nine-Tails was a threat to the blackmailer's scheme. He opposed the merger and as a result, single-handedly sparked the monster craze. Athena: Even so, what was the mask doing at the crime scene? Apollo: There had been an event at the manor... ...and maybe Alderman Kyubi had taken part in it... if you get my drift. Tenma: This is absurd! Apollo: Mr. Mayor, do you have proof of the threat that was made against you? Tenma: Yes, a blackmail letter. Unfortunately, it disappeared after the murder. I'd been carrying it around in my briefcase but now, it's suddenly vanished. Apollo: The blackmailer must've taken it with them after they killed the alderman. (Well, at least we've clearly established the killer's motive.) (Was not an inner monologue in the original release) Guard: Mayor Tenma, visiting hours are over. Tenma: It would appear this meeting is adjourned. Athena: .........Apollo, do you really think the Tenma Taro that Jinxie saw is the killer? Apollo: I don't know. All I know is there is no such thing as monsters. Athena: What about that newspaper article? Could the killer have purposely freed Tenma Taro to do their dirty work? Apollo: Oh, come on! There wasn't any Tenma Taro to release in the first place! Athena: Yes, but the only suspects the police have right now are the mayor and a yokai. Apollo: (We'll probably be arguing whether there was a yokai involved in court tomorrow.) *sigh* I can already see that look of disbelief on the judge's face. Athena: Apollo? Are you all right? Apollo: I'm fine! I'm fine! I'll, um... I'll think of something! (I'd better because I can't very well say a flying demon was the killer. At this point, the only thing I know for sure is tomorrow is going to be one doozy of a trial.) To be continued (Changed from [To Be Continued] in the original release) Nothing to examine during investigation Apollo: Nothing of particular interest here. Area already examined Apollo: (We've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around.) The Monstrous Turnabout Image Gallery Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 April 18, 9:15 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Apollo: You okay, Athena? You've been really antsy ever since we got here. Athena: I-I'm just excited. This IS my first real court case after all! Apollo: (Yeaaah, a real ball of excitement she is... I know just what she needs.) ATHENA!!! Athena: Eek! Didn't you ever learn about indoor and outdoor voices? Apollo: I'm just trying to show you the best way to relieve your pre-trial jitters. Athena: By scaring the daylights out of me? Apollo: No, I find that shouting \"I'm fine!\" in a loud voice really relieves stress. It's part of my \"Chords of Steel\" voice workout, and a must before every trial. Athena: Y-You want me to shout? Here? Apollo: That's right. Here, I'll go first, then you try. I'm Apollo Justice and I'm fine!!! Athena: All right, um... I-I'm Athena Cykes... ...and I'm fine!!! ............Hmm... I think that actually worked! Apollo: I thought it might help. Always works for me. An old friend of mine from junior high and I say it all the time. Athena: I see... A proven remedy to calm the soul. I like it! Hey, how about we finish off with... ...a race around the courthouse! Apollo: The point is to relieve stress, not get totally exhausted! Phoenix: What's with all the racket, you two? Apollo: Ah, Mr. Wright. Heh heh, just a little voice workout. Hey, what's with the suit? Phoenix: Oh, this? I was thinking about getting my attorney's badge back, that's all. Apollo: That's all?! That's huge news! ...But why now? Phoenix: I have a feeling I'll be needed in the courtroom again sometime soon. But we can talk about that another time. Apollo: (No fair. Inquiring minds want to know. But wow... I'm so used to him in his usual laid-back clothes... That suit makes him look like a million dollars.) Phoenix: By the way, have you heard about the prosecutor assigned to this case? Apollo: Yeah, he's serving time, but before that, he was a prosecutor. He also uses psychology...? Phoenix: That's right. I've heard the rumors about how he was back before his conviction. Using the power of suggestion, he could make even the most stalwart defendants confess. Apollo: (Psychology in the courtroom. Been hearing a lot about that lately.) So, he must be a pretty scary guy, considering he's a prison inmate and all. Phoenix: So they say. They also say he'll cut you down if you talk too much. Apollo: Ack! I knew he was gonna be bad news! Phoenix: Ha ha ha, it's probably just hyperbole, at least I hope for your sake. Apollo: Wait, so is it true or not? Phoenix: Let's just say you should be concise and choose your words carefully. ...If you'd like to keep that head of yours attached to the rest of your body, that is. Apollo: Yikes! (Better tone down my Chords of Steel, too.) Phoenix: So, are you all ready? It might be a good idea to check the Court Record again before stepping into the ring. Apollo: ...Right, Mr. Wright! B-But I'm fine! Phoenix: I'll be watching from the gallery. Good luck! Apollo: Thanks! Athena: Okay, let's do this! Apollo: (The odds of pulling this off are ridiculously low, but that's nothing new. Believe in our client. Seek the truth. That's all we can do. Hang in there, Mayor Tenma, here comes Justice!) April 18, 9:30 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 4 Day 1Court Is Now In SessionAll Rise Judge: Court is now in session for the trial of Damian Tenma. Apollo: Apollo Justice, defense team leader, is ready, Your Honor! Judge: I'd know that big, booming voice anywhere. As chipper as ever, eh, Mr. Justice? But who is the young lady next to you? Athena: I'm Athena Cykes, Mr. Justice's junior partner, and fresh out of law school! Judge: Well, now, full of beans, too, eh? Excellent! Makes an old man feel young again. Now for the prosecution. Hmm... It appears the prosecution is not ready yet. Fulbright: Never fear, for I shall explain! It's just a minor procedural complication, Your Honor. The prosecutor for this case is being escorted from prison as we speak. Judge: Prison? Oh, yes, of course. I almost forgot that he is currently serving time. Anime cutscene Officer: Yup, Prosecutor Blackquill's an inmate! But even a convicted murderer's still got a job to do and duties to perform. ???: ......... Apollo: Um... who's that with his back to us over there? Athena: That's him. I'm sure of it. ...Prosecutor Blackquill. Judge: *ahem* Is the prosecution ready? Blackquill: ...............Hmph. ......Enough jabbering. Get on with it already. Judge: Aah! Of course, forgive me! Apollo: (Urngh! Why are all the people related to this case so scary?!) Judge: Very well, Prosecutor Blackquill. Your opening statement if you please. Aah! Wh-What's the matter?! Blackquill: ......Must we continue to fritter away time like this? It is all right there in the indictment. An opening statement... would be pointless. Judge: Pointless? Oh, um... well... Apollo: Looks like the cat -- or in this case, the prosecutor -- has the judge's tongue. Judge: But, but... we need an opening statement as an overview of the case at hand. Blackquill: Hmph. Well, then, Your Baldness, if it's so very important, why don't you do the honors? Judge: Who?! Me?! Blackquill: There's a term for people who whine and fuss about how they need silly, useless things... ...and then decide they no longer want them once it's theirs: a selfish old fool. Judge: Huh?! Athena: Wait, was that the prosecution's opening statement? Blackquill: Hmph. Old dotards such as you are a plague upon the young. I pity your poor grandchildren, or is it great grandchildren? Judge: ! All these years, I thought the opening statement was the prosecutor's job... ...but I suppose I could give it a try. Might be a nice change of pace. (Changed from [...but I suppose I could give it try. [sic] Might be a nice change of pace.] in the original release) Apollo: What?! (He actually fell for that?!) Athena: That must've been the power of suggestion Mr. Wright was talking about. Judge: *ahem* The opening statement, huh... Hmm... Let's see here... The victim was one Rex Kyubi, alderman of Nine-Tails Vale. And the defendant, Damian Tenma, mayor of Tenma Town, is accused of his murder. Blackquill: ...And why, pray tell, was the mayor arrested? Judge: His prints were on the murder weapon. Plus, he had a motive: the elimination of the biggest roadblock to the municipal merger. The caretaker and the secretary, other potential suspects, both have alibis. And his daughter, who was also in the vicinity at the time of the incident, has no motive. Blackquill: So, in a nutshell...? Judge: I'd have to say the charges against the defendant are incontrovertible. Blackquill: Bravo, Your Baldness. Your years of experience shine bright like your head. Judge: Ho ho ho. Flattery will get you everywhere. Athena: He's playing Simon Says with the judge! Judge: Moving right along now, let's hear from our first witness for today, Detective Fulbright. Judge: Witness, please state your name and occupation. Fulbright: I am the detective assigned to this case, Bobby Fulbright! Oh, and I'll also be keeping tabs on old Blackquill here. Judge: I also heard you would provide protection if it ever came to that. Blackquill: ............Hmph. It would seem that I have been sorely underestimated. Apollo: (Wait, who's protecting who from what?) Fulbright: Still, I truly believe anyone can turn their life around, even ol' Blackquill here. Blackquill: Fool Bright! Save your platitudes for funerals. Get on with your statement. Fulbright: Ha ha ha! That's the spirit! Justice must be swift and true. I see it in your eyes! There IS hope for your rehabilitation and return to society! I will never give up on you! Athena: Prosecutor Blackquill doesn't seem to intimidate Detective Fulbright. Apollo: Well, you know what they say: ignorance is bliss. Athena: Oh, so that's why Detective Fulbright was assigned to Blackquill. He's so oblivious! Judge: Now, let's have your first statement, Detective Fulbright. Fulbright: You got it! But first, I'd like to say to the defense that justice will ultimately prevail! Witness Testimony -- About the Murder -- Fulbright: Alderman Kyubi was murdered with a spear that had been on the wall. The fingerprints of the defendant, Damian Tenma, were found on the murder weapon. At the time, Alderman Kyubi was asleep from a drug he unwittingly ingested. Mayor Tenma attacked his helpless victim, impaling him like a human shish kebob! But the sudden pain jolted the victim awake, and he grabbed a statue and struck back! Apollo: Alderman Kyubi had been slipped some kind of sleep-inducing drug? Fulbright: That's right. The accused was scared because the alderman was a former pro wrestler. So he slipped him a drug to make sure he'd be out cold and defenseless! Here's the autopsy report to prove it! Kyubi's Autopsy Report added to the Court Record. Judge: And the victim managed to attack his attacker, despite being impaled by a spear?! That sounds almost superhuman. Is it even possible? Fulbright: Well, he WAS a former pro wrestler, after all! That spear was probably nothing more than a mosquito bite to him! Apollo: Apollo: Not so fast! Don't try to brush it all off by saying the alderman had been a pro wrestler. Do you really expect us to believe he could fight back after being skewered by a spear? Blackquill: Hmph. Never heard of the incredible feats of which man is capable of in a pinch, have you? Like the samurai of yore, wrestlers can battle through intense pain. It sharpens their senses. I used to talk about it with a former wrestler I met in the clink. Apollo: I dunno... It still sounds a little far-fetched. Blackquill: Does it now? ......Then perhaps we should test the theory on you with the edge of my blade! Apollo: (I didn't sign up for this!) Blackquill: ............Hmph. And so your life is spared... for now. Apollo: (Please let those shackles be made of titanium... I don't want to die.) Fulbright: Ha ha! My investigations are as thorough as they are foolproof, or my name isn't Fulbright! I vow to resign immediately if I ever make a false arrest! Blackquill: The accused's prints were on the weapon. And he's the one person without an alibi. Quite decisive evidence. Wouldn't you agree, Your Baldness? Judge: Hmm... The defendant IS sounding guiltier by the minute. Apollo: (He has the judge leaning toward a guilty verdict, and the trial's just barely begun!) Blackquill: Hmph. What's more, a curious rumor about the accused is making the rounds. They say he seeks the merger for the purpose of freeing Tenma Taro from his imprisonment. Truth be told, I can think of no real reason to show interest in that backwards burg. Perhaps he's a complete nutter and really does seek to release an imaginary demon. Either way, he is raving mad and more than capable of murdering the alderman. Man: That mayor is a strange one, all right. I heard he went to a blood drive, but instead of donating, he tried to make a withdrawal! Judge: Order! There will be no gossiping in my court! Blackquill: Your Baldness. Please take a gander at those charms plastered around his cranium. I hear they're meant to keep him safe from possession by the demon Tenma Taro. Then again... Perhaps he's already under the demon's spell. Behold! The lunatic appears poised to lunge at you at any moment. Judge: Eeeep! Athena: Athena: The rumors and quirks of Mayor Tenma have no relevance to this case! Besides, those charms on his head... they're... they're just a fashion statement! ...I think. Judge: Hmm... Come to think of it, such things don't seem relevant to the case, do they? Athena: The prosecution will refrain from dragging our client's reputation through the mud! Blackquill: Oh, what a dreadfully fearsome lass we have here. Apollo: Whew, thanks for that lifeline, Athena. Athena: Careful, Apollo. He has the judge dancing in the palm of his hand! The power of suggestion is one of the more powerful tools in Simon Blackquill's arsenal. He's trying to manipulate everyone's impressions to suit his objectives. Apollo: (This guy really is bad news.) Judge: In any case, it seems the victim did manage to defend himself, despite being impaled. What sort of weapon did he used against his attacker? Fulbright: None other than this statue right here! Judge: It appears to be a statue of two strange creatures locked in battle. Blackquill: Two yokai to be exact. On one side is the Nine-Tailed Fox and on the other Tenma Taro. Quite interesting if you think about it. It's as though this very case were rendered in art. Apollo: Fox and Demon Statue updated in the Court Record. Judge: Mr. Justice, you may proceed with your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- About the Murder -- Fulbright: Alderman Kyubi was murdered with a spear that had been on the wall. Press Apollo: Apollo: So, those weapons on the wall of the Fox Chamber... I presume those are real? Don't you think keeping real weapons around like that is rather dangerous? Fulbright: No matter what he collected, the alderman insisted it be the real deal. For instance, he had a real demon's club in his possession. Apparently, one of his ancestors claimed it after defeating a demon in battle. Apollo: Wha--?! (That's got to be an old wives' tale.) Fulbright: Ha ha ha! The alderman had pure, unadulterated justice flowing in his veins! Whatever he did, he did it right! We've... lost a real champion of justice in his death! Blackquill: Hmph. Nothing but claptrap and balderdash if you ask me. Now stop your bleating and tell us about the weapon. Fulbright: Your wish is my command! Fulbright: The fingerprints of the defendant, Damian Tenma, were found on the murder weapon. Press Apollo: Apollo: It doesn't make sense, if you think about it. Prints could be easily wiped off. Fulbright: Hm. You do have a point there. Blackquill: I'd venture to say, he did NOT wipe off the prints because he COULD not. Apollo: What do you mean? Blackquill: ......... Athena: Looks like he wants YOU to figure it out. Well, don't just stand there! Show him who's boss! Apollo: (I'm... totally lost... so why don't you just tell me the answer already?!) Athena: I don't think he saw that plea for help. Fulbright: You feeling all right, kid? Running a fever, perhaps? Apollo: (I wish trials came with a reset button.) Judge: Well, the specifics may yet come to light. Please proceed, Detective Fulbright. Fulbright: At the time, Alderman Kyubi was asleep from a drug he unwittingly ingested. Press Apollo: Apollo: Come to think of it, a coffee cup was found on the floor. Was the sedative in his coffee...? Fulbright: Bingo! We found traces of a sleeping agent all over the inside of the cup! Blackquill: And that is why he was out cold. That is until he leapt to his feet upon being impaled by the mayor. Apollo: What an awful way to wake up. Blackquill: Heh. A rather stimulating eye opener if you ask me. I, too, would have risen to the attack, for to die in battle is the samurai way. Paradise awaits fallen heroes, but that hole in his stomach would make eating a challenge... Fulbright: Prosecutor Blackquill, please! Those morbid jokes of yours have no place in this court! Blackquill: ............Hmph. Says the jester in detective's guise. Fulbright: Moving right along...! Fulbright: Mayor Tenma attacked his helpless victim, impaling him like a human shish kebob! Press Apollo: Apollo: So, the alderman was drugged because he was really strong? Fulbright: Did you see those rock hard muscles of his? I'm surprised the spear even managed to pierce that armor-like musculature! I admit, I'm completely jealous of that righteous body of his, ha ha ha! Apollo: Well, he did look pretty buff, even in that suit he had on. Blackquill: Quite a difference when compared with a yellowbelly like you. Apollo: Yellowbelly? Who even says that anymore? Athena: Yeah, and the color's all wrong, too......... Ooh, I know! How about a squishy red tomato! Apollo: I move to strike both of your comments from the record! Judge: Mr. Justice's character is not the issue here. Now, let's get back to what happened after the far more muscular alderman was impaled. Fulbright: Yes, well, your average person would likely have died on the spot. Fulbright: But the sudden pain jolted the victim awake, and he grabbed a statue and struck back! Press Apollo: Apollo: Could he really have attacked his attacker after being impaled with that huge spear? Fulbright: Absolutely! After all, he was once a pro wrestler. The injustice of being drugged, then speared was answered with a righteous counterattack! Apollo: But does being a former pro wrestler make him superhuman? Fulbright: Absolutely! After all, he was one of the good guys, like a superhero on the side of justice. Even though he was retired, he could still don his superhero guise in times of need! Apollo: Apollo: You need to lay off the comic books, detective! We're talking about real life here. Blackquill: Setting aside the halfwit's flights of fancy, the fact is this. The court-ordered post mortem concluded the victim moved after his skewering. Apollo: (So, he found the strength somehow to attack his attacker, huh?) Present Fox and Demon Statue Apollo: Leads to: \"Did the alderman really strike the mayor?\" Athena: Detective Fulbright's testimony sounds airtight. No wonder he's so confident. Apollo: No, he only thinks it's airtight. It's up to us to poke some holes in it. That part about the alderman fighting back sounds like a big hole waiting to be poked. Apollo: Did the alderman really strike the mayor? Fulbright: What?! Are you questioning my sense of justice?! Apollo: Your so-called \"justice\" need to find itself a pair of legs to stand on. You claim the alderman struck back after the mayor put a spear through him. But the statue he supposedly used to defend himself creates a major hole in your theory. Judge: It would appear that the defense has a counter-argument. Very well, let's hear what the defense thinks is odd about the detective's statue theory. Kyubi fought unarmed Apollo: Well, the alderman was a former pro wrestler, so why would he even use it as a weapon? He could've defended himself with his bare hands! I mean, that's what pro wrestlers do! Blackquill: Hmph. You've a lot of nerve... ...but will you raise an objection in the face of swift punishment as solicitors are wont to do? Apollo: Um... Well... Not if I deserve it...? Judge: And you do! The defense will look before they leap next time! Is that understood? Apollo: Sorry, Your Honor! Can I try that again? Leads back to: \"Very well, let's hear what the defense thinks is odd about the detective's statue theory.\" There are no fingerprints Leads to: \"There are no fingerprints on this supposedly crucial piece of evidence.\" It's not broken Apollo: If the statue really was used as a weapon, why are there no signs of breakage? Athena: Um, Apollo? When was the last time you had your eyes examined? The statue is clearly broken. See the area around their hands? Apollo: Ah! Eh heh heh, guess I missed that. Judge: I'm afraid I can't let that one slide without a penalty. Apollo: Please, let me try that again! (Detective Fulbright claims that the alderman used the statue to attack the mayor. But there's a hole in his theory!) Leads back to: \"Very well, let's hear what the defense thinks is odd about the detective's statue theory.\" Apollo: There are no fingerprints on this supposedly crucial piece of evidence. And if you look at the crime scene photo... ...you'll notice that the alderman isn't wearing gloves. Judge: Yes, I believe he is quite gloveless indeed. Apollo: If he touched the statue with his bare hands, he should've left some fingerprints! Detective Fulbright, you DID take that into account during your investigation, didn't you? Fulbright: Arrrrrrgh! This can't be happening! D-D-Did I arrest the wrong maaaaan?! Athena: You did it, Apollo! You knocked Detective Fulbright off his high horse! Apollo: Well, it's just one point in our favor. Athena: Who do you suppose clubbed the mayor if it wasn't the alderman? Apollo: Hmm... Well, if it wasn't the alderman... ...that means someone else must've clubbed the mayor. Athena: You mean there was a third party there in the Fox Chamber? Apollo: Exactly! And this could be the big break we've been looking for! Judge: Hmm... There does seem to be a hole in the prosecution's argument. Prosecutor Blackquill, would you care to respond to the defense's assertion? Blackquill: Hmph. Apollo: (The least you could do is look at me while being dismissive.) Blackquill: Your mind is as dull as an unhoned blade, Justice-dono. Apollo: Justice... dono? (He's been watching too many samurai flicks.) Blackquill: It will take far more than that to cut down Simon Blackquill. A whelp such as you has no hope against my superior swordsmanship. Apollo: This is a trial, not a swordfight, Prosecutor Blackquill! Blackquill: Hmph. There is a perfectly good explanation for the lack of prints on the statue. You might recall that bloodstained cloth found at the scene of the crime. Well, it just so happens... that the blood was the mayor's. Apollo: So, um... what are you getting at? Blackquill: Hone your mind, boy! Why was there blood on that cloth? Solve that riddle and you shall see that the hole you thought you found is but an illusion. Apollo: Now let's see... How was that cloth used...? Was it used... By Kyubi as a head covering Apollo: The alderman was probably wearing it over his head. Athena: Wha--?! Blackquill: Do you truly think the alderman would show up to a meeting over the fate of his village... ...wearing this ridiculous-looking cloth over his head? Apollo: Sure. They had a festival that day, didn't they? Who's to say he didn't party a little too hard and just forgot to take it off?! Blackquill: ............... Judge: ............... Apollo: Okay, fine. So maybe he didn't do that... Can I try one more time? Leads back to: \"Now let's see... How was that cloth used...? Was it used...\" To wipe up blood Apollo: Maybe the cloth was used to wipe as much of the mayor's blood as possible off the statue. And in the process, the culprit inadvertently erased the alderman's fingerprints as well. Blackquill: Blackquill: But the mayor did not bother to wipe away his own fingerprints on the murder weapon. Why would he wipe down one weapon but not the other? Careful, now. Use what little brains you have left before you speak. Apollo: Gimme a do-over on that one! Please! Leads back to: \"Now let's see... How was that cloth used...? Was it used...\" To wrap the statue Leads to: \"Maybe the alderman wrapped the statue in the cloth.\" Apollo: Maybe the alderman wrapped the statue in the cloth. In short, he wasn't touching the statue directly when he used it to strike back at the mayor. Ah! Blackquill: ...Precisely. Bully for you, boy. Apollo: Aw, it was nothing. Athena: Apollo, don't let him start manipulating you, too! You just closed the hole for the prosecution! Apollo: I did? ............Ack, I did! Blackquill: Right. That a statue wrapped in cloth would leave no fingerprints is as plain as day. But this also proves there are no holes in our theory of the alderman striking back. Apollo: .........Oops. Arrrrrrrrrgh! Fox and Demon Statue updated in the Court Record. Blackquill: Now do you see how dull your mind is? Apollo: I'll make sure to sharpen it next time. Blackquill: A particularly frightening inmate once told me that... ...he always tenderly honed his blades before he went to work, like the samurai of yore. Judge: Samurai? Sounds more like a homicidal maniac to me! Blackquill: Actually, he was working in the prison kitchen at the time. Apollo: (Wait, so the inmate was a murdering samurai prison chef?) Judge: Hmm... It would seem that the victim and his killer were the only ones there after all. Apollo: (I was kinda attached to that hole... Now what?) Athena: Apollo, I just thought of something. If they didn't find anyone's fingerprints on the statue... ...who's to say someone other than the alderman didn't hit the mayor with it? Apollo: Why didn't I think of that! Anybody could've NOT left prints on it! Blackquill: Hmph. Then who, pray tell, struck the mayor with the statue? Please, illuminate us with your wisdom, young lady. Athena: There's only one answer -- the real killer! Blackquill: Prove the existence of this \"real killer\" then. What evidence have you? Athena: Oh, I'll give you evidence, all right! Apollo: Athena, are you sure about this? (Changed from [Athena, are sure [sic] about this?] in the original release) Athena: To borrow your words, Apollo, I'm fine! Take a look at this! Black feathers and tracks, allegedly from a yokai, were found at the scene. I believe they're from the third party who struck the mayor with that statue. Judge: Is the defense actually suggesting some sort of monster killed that alderman?! Athena: That's exactly what I'm suggesting! Apollo: Apollo: No, Athena! You just lost what little credibility we had left! Athena: .........Aah! Sorry, sorry! Guess I got carried away. Judge: Mr. Justice, we've no time to deal with objections between members of the defense. Apollo: Sorry, Your Honor. It's just, this kid's still, well, a kid... Athena: Ouch... You meanie! I'm reporting this to Mr. Wright! Judge: So, is this court to believe the feathers and tracks are from a \"yokai\" as you put it? Apollo: Uhh, no, Your Honor. I believe they are a fabrication. The real killer wanted us to believe some sort of monster murdered the alderman. Judge: Hmm, interesting. And why do you suppose the killer would do that? Apollo: Umm.... Why, indeed? Judge: Mr. Justice, you seem as new to this as your partner is. Apollo: Ouch... (This, I'm not reporting to Mr. Wright...) Blackquill: Hoy, Fool Bright, explain to His Baldness what these brats are missing. You know, the who and why behind those feathers and tracks. Apollo: Wha--?! (You mean you can explain all that?!) Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Our investigative prowess is without equal! Apollo: (I'm starting to think I chose the wrong profession.) Judge: Very well, let's hear about these so-called yokai feathers and tracks. Witness Testimony -- Feathers and Tracks -- Fulbright: This entire case centers on one man's attempt to crush opposition to the municipal merger! Mayor Tenma panicked when The Amazing Nine-Tails helped embolden the protestors. So he stoked the villagers' fears by fabricating a monster! The strange feathers and tracks he planted made it look like a yokai was the killer. Apollo: Those feathers and tracks stoked the villagers' fears? (Changed from [Those feathers and tracks stoked the villager's [sic] fears?] in the original release) Fulbright: Absolutely! He knew exactly how to prey on their superstitious minds. Blackquill: Those feathers only gave weight to the idea that the alderman was slain by a demon. The accursed demon Tenma Taro, that is. Judge: Tenma who? Blackquill: Tenma Taro -- the legendary demon locked away in the village's Forbidden Chamber. From a young age, the villagers are taught to fear the great, black-feathered demon. And thus were they blinded to other, more plausible explanations. Apollo: Apollo: Hold on for a second. Before we start letting our imaginations run wild... Isn't there someone else that could be considered a suspect? Judge: Mr. Justice, please explain yourself. Apollo: On the day of the incident, there was a special event held at Kyubi Manor. And as part of this event, there was someone dressed in the likeness of Tenma Taro. Obviously this person is a much more likely suspect than any legendary demon! Blackquill: Blackquill: Dullard. You are playing right into the killer's mind games. Apollo: What? Blackquill: Listen here. The feathers and tracks were merely red herrings. The villagers believe the murder to be the work of the real Tenma Taro. However, the police believe that the person in the Tenma Taro suit is the killer. Apollo: Ahh! Blackquill: The defendant sought to sow this confusion in order to deflect blame away from himself. However, he was knocked unconscious by the alderman... ...and thus our mentally deficient mayor was caught red-handed at the scene of the crime. Apollo: Apollo: Do you honestly believe Mayor Tenma would do something so stupid?! Blackquill: Blackquill: The evidence speaks for itself. ...Fool Bright! Fulbright: Right. It was the mayor's last-ditch effort to stop the opposition before things got crazy. The Amazing Nine-Tails was fueling both the yokai craze and the anti-merger movement. Plus, he's one of the better-known masked wrestlers, and the hometown favorite. That's why the mayor panicked and set out on the path of injustice. Judge: But do the people of Nine-Tails Vale really believe a yokai is behind the crime? Fulbright: Yokai sightings are an everyday event there, so I wouldn't be surprised if they did. Judge: Hmm... I must say... A crime that preys upon innocent, impressionable minds. Blackquill: Just so. A particularly silver-tongued inmate once had the following words for me. The innocent of heart are the easiest prey. Judge: You don't say? Was this inmate a con artist? Blackquill: .........No. He was framed for the murder of his beloved. I actually felt sorry for the poor chap. Apollo: (Wait, so he wasn't the predator, but rather the prey?) Judge: Yes, well... Now then, the defense may proceed with their cross-examination. Cross Examination -- Feathers and Tracks -- Fulbright: This entire case centers on one man's attempt to crush opposition to the municipal merger! Press Apollo: Apollo: Detective Fulbright, is the anti-merger movement really that strong? Fulbright: Oh, absolutely! They parade around in yokai costumes shouting, \"Down with Mayor Tenma!\" And just the other day, they stormed Tenma City Hall, claiming it was a den of vipers! Blackquill: Hmph. But when the accused showed his face... ...the angry mob scattered like leaves upon an autumn wind. For you see, lowly yokai are no match for Tenma Taro, the Dark Lord of their kind. Athena: Wait, are the villagers scared of Mayor Tenma or Tenma Taro? I'm confused. Apollo: I think he means Mayor Tenma. It's easy to get the wrong impression about the guy. Judge: Detective Fulbright, why do you suppose the defendant would commit such an act? Fulbright: Mayor Tenma panicked when The Amazing Nine-Tails helped embolden the protestors. Press Apollo: Apollo: The Amazing Nine-Tails... No one knows his true identity, right? Fulbright: That's right. And he was a lone wolf, or in other words, he didn't belong to a wrestling federation. He appeared like a shooting star, defeating one Tenma Town wrestler after another. And before anyone knew it, he was a champion! Blackquill: Like the samurai of yore, surrounded thick with enemies, he cut them down one by one. It was a complete and utter loss of face for Tenma Town Pro Wrestling. Fulbright: He was amazing! If ever there was a real superhero, it would be him! I dream of becoming a true champion of justice like him someday! Athena: I bet Detective Fulbright would be a great pro wrestler. He could even team up with Prosecutor Blackquill. Apollo: A police detective and a prisoner in chains? .........You know, I think people would actually pay to see that. I know I would. Fulbright: Ha ha ha. So you DO understand the greatness that is The Amazing Nine-Tails! Fulbright: So he stoked the villagers' fears by fabricating a monster! Press Apollo: Apollo: Did the murder and yokai evidence really stoke the villagers' fears? Fulbright: Absolutely! It had an immediate effect! The presumed return of the dreaded Tenma Taro has them shaking in their boots! Judge: Oh my, is it really that bad?! Blackquill: Hmph, that superstitious lot? It's as if Jack the Ripper had been set loose in their village. The mere thought of that demon lurking about is enough to spark a mass exodus. Judge: I see... That's a very persuasive argument. Apollo: (The mere thought of His Honor buying into Simon the Psycho-Slasher's words... ...makes me want to spark my own exodus out of the courtroom right about now.) Fulbright: So you see, there can be only one reason why anyone would plant those feathers and tracks! Fulbright: The strange feathers and tracks he planted made it look like a yokai was the killer. Press Apollo: Apollo: ...But it doesn't add up. If what you say is true, why top it off with murder? Fulbright: Hm? What do you mean? Apollo: You claim that our client planted the yokai evidence to stoke the villagers' fears. If so, then why not stop there? Why murder Alderman Kyubi? Judge: Hmm... Excellent point. Apollo: It is, isn't it! So, Your Honor agrees there was no reason for the murder, correct?! Blackquill: Blackquill: Perhaps the killing was on the spur of the moment. (Changed from [Perhaps the killing was spur of the moment.] in the original release) Apollo: You're saying it wasn't premeditated? Blackquill: From the outset, I had no intention of paying heed to any of your babble. However, the fact is, the mayor made a startling discovery. Apollo: A startling discovery? (Why don't I like the sound of that?) Blackquill: Alderman Kyubi's secret identity. Athena: Apollo... I think Prosecutor Blackquill has figured out the alderman's secret identity. But even if he has, why would it be a motive for the mayor to commit murder? Apollo: (...This is not good!) Blackquill: This patch of fur was discovered at the crime scene. It's from the mask worn by The Amazing Nine-Tails. Therefore, we can conclude that this mask was at the crime scene. Judge: Oh, my. But why would it have been there? Blackquill: The victim was a former pro wrestler and a member of the anti-merger movement. ...Need I say more? Judge: Well, um............ Ah! C-Could it really be?! Blackquill: Hmph. Your Baldness has had an epiphany I see. Our victim, Rex Kyubi, was The Amazing Nine-Tails! And the mayor's discovery of such was his motive for murder! Apollo: Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Judge: Order! Order!!! What a shocking development. A motive clearer than crystal clear! Athena: What do we do now, Apollo?! Apollo: I didn't think they'd tie the alderman's secret identity to the mayor's motive for murder! Blackquill: At last we've reached my real point: why did the alderman have to forge a secret identity? Does it not pique your interest, Your Baldness? Judge: I admit it does... It IS odd that he had to create this other persona... ...just to secretly participate in the anti-merger movement. Blackquill: Very astute of you, Your Baldness. Fulbright: Right, now take a look at this! If you value your dearest's life, you will merge Nine-Tails Vale with Tenma Town. This blackmail letter was found in Alderman Kyubi's pocket! Apollo: Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaat!!! Blackquill: At present, the alderman's wife is in the hospital. And that letter is clear evidence the mayor was blackmailing him by threatening her life. Athena: Wait, didn't the blackmail letter sent to Mayor Tenma go missing... ...right after the alderman's murder? Apollo: You think maybe the killer took the letter from the mayor after the murder... ...and planted it into the alderman's pocket? Athena: It's possible... but we don't have any proof that that's what happened. Apollo: (Talk about being up the creek without a paddle...) Blackmail Letter added to the Court Record. Fulbright: Mayor Tenma would've made a clean getaway if he'd just left after planting the yokai things. But he was knocked out cold by his sudden decision to kill The Amazing Nine-Tails! Judge: So, it was The Amazing Nine-Tails's counterattack that brought the entire crime to light. Apollo: Wait a sec... (Fulbright's claiming that the mayor killed the alderman after planting the yokai evidence. And that the mayor was knocked out cold immediately after that?) Detective Fulbright, please add your previous statement to your testimony! Adds statement \"Mayor Tenma killed the sleeping alderman after planting the feathers and tracks.\" Press (subsequent times) Apollo: Apollo: So, you're saying our client hadn't planned on killing the alderman? Fulbright: That's right. The motive only came after he discovered the alderman's secret identity! Apollo: W-Well, I guess that does make sense. Athena: What do we do now, Apollo?! Apollo: I didn't think they'd tie the alderman's secret identity to the mayor's motive for murder. Fulbright: Let's get on with the testimony, shall we! Fulbright: Mayor Tenma killed the sleeping alderman after planting the feathers and tracks. Press Apollo: Apollo: So let me get this straight. You believe the mayor planted the yokai evidence before the murder, not after? Fulbright: Absolutely! And then he was knocked out cold by the alderman's last punch! He wouldn't have had a chance to plant the evidence after that! Apollo: (Hmm... Something's not right here.) Present Crime Photo Apollo: Leads to: \"Detective Fulbright, your sense of justice is anything but fair!\" Apollo: (Hard to believe that a stiff, humorless man like the mayor could be behind such a stunt.) Athena: Argh... We have to do something, Apollo, before they pin it all on the mayor! Apollo: Then we're going to need to prove that Mayor Tenma didn't plant that yokai stuff. Athena: How are we supposed to do that? Apollo: Detective Fulbright, your sense of justice is anything but fair! Fulbright: What's this?! You are question my justice again?! Apollo: Yes, and I'm going to prove it to you. Take a look at this photo. Judge: This... is the crime scene photo. And just what does this prove? Apollo: It proves when the feathers and tracks were planted. Fulbright: But I already told you, they were planted before the murder! The defendant planted the yokai evidence, then was knocked out cold while killing his victim! Apollo: But that would be impossible. If you look right here, it's clear when the feathers and tracks were left at the scene. Present tracks Apollo: Leads to: \"Aren't you just pointing to the yokai feathers and tracks, Mr. Justice?\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: There's clearly something wrong... right around here. Judge: The only thing clear to me is that the defense is barking up the wrong tree. Blackquill: Hmph. Really up a tree now, aren't we? Judge: Yes, and a stiff penalty should help you learn that correct assertions don't grow on them. Apollo: Ugh... I wonder if bandages do... (There is clearly something wrong with the assertion that... ...the feathers and tracks were there before the murder.) Leads back to: \"If you look right here, it's clear when the feathers and tracks were left at the scene.\" Judge: Aren't you just pointing to the yokai feathers and tracks, Mr. Justice? Apollo: Yes. See how the feathers are on top of the blood, and the tracks were made in blood? In other words, the yokai evidence could've only resulted AFTER the murder. Fulbright: Th-Then the mayor must've planted the evidence after killing the alderman! Apollo: But you said it yourself, the mayor had been knocked unconscious thereafter. There would've been no time for him to plant any evidence at all! Therefore! There must've been someone else besides the mayor and the alderman at the crime scene! Fulbright: Arrrrrrgh! There must be some mistake! Judge: Order! Order!!! Fulbright: Wh-Where's your evidence?! You can't possibly have any, can you?! Ha ha ha ha ha! Apollo: Evidence? Oh, I have evidence. In fact, I have an eye-witness's testimony for you. Fulbright: You do?! But hooooow?! Was my vaunted sense of justice really just half-baked? Athena: He's taking this really hard. Judge: Hmm... Mr. Justice. What is this testimony regarding a third party that you claim to have? Apollo: I have it right here, Your Honor. It's the sworn testimony of Mr. Tenma's daughter. The witness, Jinxie Tenma, saw a yokai in the hallway after stumbling upon the scene. It was the demon Tenma Taro... He's the source of those feathers and tracks! Judge: ......... Blackquill: ......... Fulbright: ......... ......... Apollo: .........Will somebody please say something? Judge: ...The defense will explain to the court exactly what he means. Fulbright: You... You dare to mock this court and justice itself?! You're unfit to bear your name, boy! Blackquill: You Baldness, it appears our defense attorney here is delirious from exhaustion. Athena: Athena: Apollo! Think of something, quick, before you're held in contempt of court! Apollo: What do you think I'm trying to do?! Before you decide whether I should step down, please... hear me out...? Judge: Very well, Mr. Justice, I'm all ears. But you had better explain yourself well. What was this yokai you were talking about? Apollo: It's all in this statement here -- Jinxie Tenma asserts that she saw Tenma Taro. After she discovered the crime scene and called the police... ...she came around a corner in the hall. It was around here... ...that she saw Tenma Taro fleeing toward the foyer! The defense asserts that whoever was impersonating this monster... ...is the one who left those feathers and tracks behind, intentionally or otherwise! Judge: Wh-Whaaaaaat?! Fulbright: How incredibly unjust! Why haven't I heard about this before?! Man: The defense just proved there was someone else! Woman: So the mayor isn't the killer? Man: Was it all just a set up? The prosecutor IS a convicted felon, after all. Athena: Apollo! The momentum has shifted in our favor! Apollo: Good. Now let's keep it that way! Blackquill: Blackquill: ............Hmph. Little do you realize... ...that though you are in the midst of a fray, your sword is broken. Apollo: My sword? (I didn't know I had one to break.) Are you implying there's a problem with my claim? Blackquill: Consider this: if that yokai impersonator had indeed fled toward the foyer... ...that fool and that fop would have seen him. Apollo: Fool and fop? Oh, you mean Filch and L'Belle. Hmm, now that you mention it... Blackquill: Both Phineas Filch and Florent L'Belle were in the foyer at the time. But they haven't stated that they saw a yokai, have they? Did you ever consider that yokai was but a figment of a scared little girl's imagination? Apollo: Argh. Why DIDN'T those two see the Tenma Taro impersonator pass by? Athena: Why don't we ask them ourselves? Apollo: I was just about to say that myself. No, really, I was! The defense would like to call Mr. Phineas Filch, caretaker of Kyubi Manor, to the stand! I just know he must have seen something! Judge: Hmm... I suppose we can't ignore the fact that the little girl believes she saw a monster. I trust you have no objections to Mr. Justice's request, Prosecutor Blackquill? I understand that Mr. Filch is enjoying a nap out in the lobby. Blackquill: Hmph. I knew that tanuki was a rare find. But when we captured him, I didn't think he'd end up a witness. Do with him as you will. Apollo: (D-Did he just say captured? No, wait. I don't want to know.) Judge: Very well, then. Bailiff, please go wake Mr. Filch and escort him to the witness stand. Judge: Will the witness state his name and occupation, please. Filch: The name's Filch, Phineas Filch, caretaker of Kyubi Manor. Oh, and... This is for you, Your Lordship. Just a little something I though ya might like. Judge: Oh, my, what a fabulous pair of shoes! And \"Your Honor\" will do just fine, Mr. Filch. Apollo: ...Ah! It's those shoes again! Athena: Um... Don't they belong to Detective Fulbright? Apollo: Don't tell me Filch stole them again. Filch: They're all yours, Your Honorship, sir. Judge: What?! But they seem awfully expensive. Filch: Yep, too expensive for me, but I reckon they'd be perfect for someone like Your Honorship. Judge: Hmm... It's a kind gesture, but legal ethics dictate I can't accept such gifts. Filch: Aw, ethics smethics. Just take 'em if ya want 'em. Polished 'em up real nice for ya, too. Judge: I'm sorry about the shoes, Mr. Filch, but I WILL accept your testimony. The court would like to hear whether you saw Tenma Taro in the foyer after the murder. Witness Testimony -- Guarding the Foyer -- Filch: At the time of the murder I was on guard duty in the foyer, just like Mr. Kyubi asked. (Changed from [At the time of the murder I was on guard duty in the foyer, just like Mr. Kyubi's [sic] asked.] in the original release) I was making sure no one -- fair, foul, fishy, or otherwise -- could get to our guest. I was still in my office keeping a good watch when the murder happened after 3 PM. But I didn't see nothing outta the ordinary, no siree! Blackquill: That yokai you keep jabbering on about was but a phantom of a little girl's dreams. Apollo: So, you're telling this court you never saw anyone dressed up like Tenma Taro? Filch: Yep! Was guarding the whole time. That's the truth, the holy truth, 'n' nutter-butter the truth! And Tenma Taro? Bah, ya don't really believe in all that yokai mumbo jumbo, do ya? I certainly don't! BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: Hm? (My bracelet, it's...) Athena: Something the matter, Apollo? Apollo: My bracelet keeps squeezing my arm. Athena: Really? So you think Mr. Tanuki-- er, I mean, Filch has been lying to us? Apollo: I wouldn't rule it out. (Now, if I could just zero in on a tell -- some sort of nervous habit...) ???: *Screech!* Apollo: A-Aaaaaaagh! What in the--?! (W-What's a hawk doing in here!?) Blackquill: Allow me to introduce my trusty cohort, Taka. He seems to have taken quite a liking to the courthouse. Made it his new home, in fact. Apollo: ...He doesn't live with you... you know, in jail? (Who's ever heard of a courthouse bird?) Blackquill: Taka simply loathes trickery and fraud. And that queer power of yours seems to have offended my dear, bosom buzzard. Apollo: This isn't some sort of trick or-- Aaaaaaaaaagh! (I won't be able to spot squat like this!) Filch: Wh-What the heck's goin' on 'round here?! Run for the hills! Judge: N-No pets or other animals allowed in the courtroom! Taka: *Screech!* Judge: Ack! Somebody help! Blackquill: Oh, he's merely having a bit of sport. He won't harm you, save when truly famished. Judge: In that case, Prosecutor Blackquill, you will ensure your feathered friend is properly fed. Athena: Looks like we have to do this the old-fashioned way. Apollo: We'll be fine... I think. (If there was someone dressed as Tenma Taro there, Filch should've seen him. We'll just have to put our faith in Jinxie's statement for now.) Judge: Mr. Justice, please proceed with your cross-examination. Cross Examination -- Guarding the Foyer -- Filch: At the time of the murder I was on guard duty in the foyer, just like Mr. Kyubi asked. (Changed from [At the time of the murder I was on guard duty in the foyer, just like Mr. Kyubi's [sic] asked.] in the original release) Press Apollo: Apollo: Mr. Filch, why did Alderman Kyubi have you handle guard duty? Filch: Eh-heh heh... 'Cause he trusts me. I AM the manor's caretaker, after all. Apollo: So, you took said guard duty seriously? Filch: Eh-heh heh... Lemme tell ya something about me. I'm-- Yipes! Blackquill: Listen here, you little tanuki. Get straight to the point and be quick about it. The court wishes to hear what you did or didn't see in the foyer, and naught else. Filch: Y-Yes, of course, sir! Right away, sir! Apollo: (Blackquill's got him completely under his thumb.) Filch: Like I said, I was guarding the foyer entrance that day! Filch: I was making sure no one -- fair, foul, fishy, or otherwise -- could get to our guest. Press Apollo: Apollo: So no one could get to him... Sounds like security was pretty tight. Filch: That's 'cause there's always lotsa sneaks 'n' thieves 'round festival time. Apollo: And the solution was to entrust the manor's security to a thief? That's not even funny. Athena: Maybe it's a matter of stopping thieves by hiring one. After all, it takes one to know one. Apollo: I dunno, it seems more like letting the fox guard the henhouse to me. Judge: Hmm. So, the witness testifies that he took his guard duty seriously? Filch: Yes, sir, Your Honorship, sir! Filch: I was still in my office keeping a good watch when the murder happened after 3 PM. Press Apollo: Apollo: Did you really keep an eye on the foyer the entire time?! Filch: *sigh* Poor old Filchy... Been working hard my whole life... ...only to be smeared by some greenhorn in his fancy-schmancy suit and silly haircut. Ah! Sorry, sorry, Mr. Blackquill, sir! Didn't mean to get off subject there! Apollo: (Sheesh... Blackquill didn't even say anything.) Filch: To answer your question, yes, I kept an eye -- no, both of 'em, in fact -- on the foyer! Present TV Listings Apollo: Leads to: \"Don't lie to the court like that, Mr. Filch.\" Filch: But I didn't see nothing outta the ordinary, no siree! Press Apollo: Apollo: Could you describe to the court who you would consider fishy looking? Filch: Someone all fidgety and shifty-like, you know, like they're about to steal something. Apollo: (He......... just described himself.) Athena: I wonder why Mr. Filch didn't see Tenma Taro. Apollo: Maybe Jinxie only thinks she saw Tenma Taro. Or... Athena: Maybe Mr. Filch is lying. Apollo: And if he's lying, we might be able to spot a contradiction in his testimony. Apollo: Don't lie to the court like that, Mr. Filch. Filch: Hey, it ain't right to bushwhack a fella like that! Apollo: Unfortunately for you, I have evidence that proves you're lying. If you look at this TV listing here, you'll see that at the time of the crime... ...there was a pro wrestling match scheduled -- something you'd never miss. Filch: Ack! I didn't watch that one, no siree! I was doing my job, just like I was s'pposed to! Apollo: (This guy doesn't know when to give up.) Mr. Filch. Someone even circled the match. It was you, right? Filch: Yipes! Apollo: Not only that, you even told me you watched it. You said, and I quote: \"It was a complete disaster.\" Filch: Hrrrgh! Apollo: So, do you admit to slacking off?! Filch: Y-Y-You can't trick me with your rudy poo lawyer talk! I'm one of them professional-types, too! I can do double-duty, watching TV and the foyer at the same time! Apollo: (The only thing Filch can claim to be a professional of is \"professional thief\"...) Judge: Mr. Justice. You would have this court believe the witness was slacking off? Apollo: That's correct. He claims to have been watching TV and the foyer at the same time. But that's nothing but a bald-faced lie! Judge: Bald, you say? But I'M not the one who's lying! Perhaps you meant the witness, Mr. Justice? And in that case, let's see what evidence you can offer. You claim Mr. Filch is lying about watching TV and the foyer simultaneously. Now, prove it. Present Foyer Diagram Apollo: Leads to: \"Please take a look at the direction the TV is facing in this diagram.\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: This piece of evidence here clearly exposes Mr. Filch's lie. Judge: Hm? How does that prove anything? Apollo: Oh, it, um... (Whoops! Way off on that one!) Heh heh, sorry. Don't know what I was thinking. Judge: Yes, well, I have moments like that myself. Apollo: (Whew, looks like he'll let this one slide.) Judge: But random guesses and speculation must be punished! Apollo: Yargh! Athena: Apollo! We should think about how Mr. Filch was when he was watching TV! Apollo: Please, lemme try that one again! Judge: The defense will look before they leap this time. So, what do you have for us, Mr. Justice? Leads back to: \"You claim Mr. Filch is lying about watching TV and the foyer simultaneously. Now, prove it.\" Apollo: Please take a look at the direction the TV is facing in this diagram. Now, unless Mr. Filch has eyes where his right ear should be... ...I'd think it would be impossible to watch the foyer entrance and the TV at the same time. Judge: Why, yes! Someone watching TV there couldn't possibly see the entrance! Apollo: Exactly. And that means, Mr. Filch... ...you were slacking off and were NOT watching the foyer as you claim! Filch: Yiiipes! The bag's outta the cat! Er, I mean, other way 'round! Judge: Order! Order! Order!!! But Mr. Justice, is Mr. Filch's less-than-stellar work ethic relevant to this case? Apollo: It's very relevant, because while he was slacking off watching TV... ...there really could've been a Tenma Taro impersonator in the foyer! Blackquill: Apollo: What now?! Blackquill: Granted, this tanuki was lax in his duties, but he still had the foyer entrance covered. Apollo: What are you talking about? Blackquill: .........This. Apollo: Um... I'm not a mind reader. Ack! Blackquill: Auditory sense. His eyes may have been slacking off, but his ears were still hard at work. Right, tanuki? Filch: ...They were? ............Er, I mean, yes! Yes they were! Apollo: But you already admitted to slacking off. Now you say you weren't? Filch: My eyes might be lazy, but my ears ain't. I woulda heard anyone in the foyer, eh-heh. Ya see, the foyer floor and stairway get all creaky squeaky when someone walks on 'em! Creak, creak, creak! Loud enough to wake the dead, I reckon! Apollo: So, you're saying you didn't hear anybody walk by? Filch: Yep! My ears were working fulltime. So, who's the liar now, ya no-good shyster! Apollo: A lying thief calling me a shyster. This HAS to be the low point of my fledgling career... Filch: Gotta hand it to ya, Mr. Blackquill, sir, ya really are something else, eh-heh heh! I mean, ya don't miss a thing. And them bags under yer eyes? They're darker than mine! Blackquill: Fair warning, Mr. Filch. Taka is particularly fond of tanuki. Should you lie to this court again, you may suddenly find yourself on the menu. Filch: Yiiiiiipes! Please don't eat me, Mr. Taka, sir! Judge: The witness will henceforth testify truthfully under penalty of painful bird attacks! And with that in mind, the court requests that the witness revise his testimony accordingly. Witness Testimony -- Ears Working Overtime -- Filch: It's true, I was watching a pro wrestling match on the office TV. My eyes mighta been slacking off, but my ears? They were working overtime. The floor there's all creaky squeaky-like. No way I woulda missed someone walking by. So ya see, there weren't no Tenma Taro in the foyer. Blackquill: Superstition is the religion of feeble minds. Understand? A simple, rational explanation is best. Forget yokai, demons, and such. We must use common sense, for lacking that, our entire world would be but upside-down. Apollo: (Says the convict prosecutor who is totally a sign of the end times for the legal world.) Filch: And besides, if there were any yokai roaming about, I'd nab 'em 'n' sell 'em to the zoo! Athena: I wonder whether Jinxie was just seeing things. Apollo: That seems to be the general consensus, but I'm sticking to my guns. Athena: But if we can't prove she saw Tenma Taro, the mayor's sure to be convicted! Apollo: Then we'd better hope my guns fire bullets, not BBs... Judge: The defense may cross-examine the witness. Cross Examination -- Ears Working Overtime -- Filch: It's true, I was watching a pro wrestling match on the office TV. Press Apollo: Apollo: You ARE paid for your work, aren't you? So, how do you justify watching TV on the job? Filch: A-A-Arrgghh! B-B-B-But...! It ain't easy being me! I mean, I can't watch TV when we have visitors and there's no way to record stuff! Apollo: (Sorry, am I supposed to be consoling you over your first-world problems?) Athena: If those are his only problems, he should consider himself lucky. Apollo: I guess pro wrestling's serious business to Mr. Filch. Filch: My eyes mighta been slacking off, but my ears? They were working overtime. Press Apollo: Apollo: You lied earlier about taking your guard duty seriously, didn't you? Filch: Oh, uh, that? Ain't no harm in bending the truth a little, right? Blackquill: Listen to me, you little tanuki. Lie again and Taka shall feast upon that forked tongue of yours. Taka: Screech! Filch: Yiiipes! Sorry! Just lemme keep my tongue! Apollo: (At least leave it until we get the truth out of him, in any case.) Blackquill: You were negligent in your duties, were you not? Filch: Yes, sir, I was sir! But it ain't like that... Filch: The floor there's all creaky squeaky-like. No way I woulda missed someone walking by. Press Apollo: Apollo: So, you have pretty good ears, Mr. Filch? Filch: As good as they come, I'd say. Ain't nothin' to hear a creaky floor. Plus, that Tenma Taro makes a sound when he goes by. It's like a jingle jangle. Apollo: Jingle jangle? How does he do that? Filch: It's that staff o' his. That's what jingle jangles. Athena: What's he talking about, Apollo? Apollo: Beats me, but I guess Tenma Taro has a staff that makes noise. Athena: Come to think of it, didn't Jinxie mention something like that, too? She said she saw Tenma Taro holding a staff-like object that made a jangly sound. Apollo: I guess that's the source of the noise then... Judge: Well, Mr. Justice? Mr. Filch says Tenma Taro \"jingle jangles.\" Would you consider that vital information? Very important Apollo: Extremely vital! I request that it be added to his testimony! Adds statement \"If Tenma Taro was to pass by, his staff woulda gone jingle jangle.\" Not so important Apollo: (Doesn't seem particularly important to me.) No, Your Honor. I don't think it's of any importance. Judge: Very well. The witness may continue with his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press (after adding statement) Apollo: Apollo: Could someone walk by without making a sound? Filch: Nope, not even a ninja. That's 'cause even the tiniest mouse makes that floor creak, eh-heh. Real creaky squeaky, it is! Blackquill: I can vouch for the tanuki's keen ears. He came running from across the building the moment Fool Bright dropped his wallet. And true to his name, Filch filched it before Mr. Less-Than-Bright knew what happened. Apollo: That's some scary good hearing. Filch: Wads o' cash or expensive shoes on the pavement... Sounds like that don't get by ol' Filch's ears. Got years o' practice, eh-heh heh. Athena: Remind me not to bring anything of value to the manor next time. Apollo: The sound of shoes makes sense, but wads of cash? What does that sound like? ...Anyway, it sounds like they need to hire somebody to take care of their caretaker. Filch: If Tenma Taro was to pass by, his staff woulda gone jingle jangle. Press Apollo: Apollo: So, Tenma Taro's staff makes a distinctive sound? Filch: Yep, like a jingle and a jangle. Athena: Wait, Jinxie said something like that. Something about Tenma Taro making a jangly sound. Apollo: Hmmm... I think we're missing something here, but I can't quite put a finger on it. (Perhaps I should take a look at the Court Record again...) Present Yokai Legend Scroll Apollo: Leads to: \"Tenma Taro's staff would make a jangly sound, you say?\" Filch: So ya see, there weren't no Tenma Taro in the foyer. Press Apollo: Apollo: Please tell the court, what did Jinxie see if not Tenma Taro? Filch: She's always going on about seeing this yokai or that. Just an active imagination, I reckon. She won't even come near me 'cause she thinks I'm some sorta tanuki monster! Athena: Can't say I blame her. Apollo: So, Mr. Filch, you'd chalk it up to a child's active imagination? Filch: Yep. No Tenma Taro or anyone else got in or outta Kyubi Manor on my watch. Athena: Apollo, what could this mean? Do you think Jinxie was just seeing things? Apollo: Well, if that's the case, the details she provided were pretty impressive. But if we're to continue believing Jinxie's statement... Athena: We'll have to uncover Filch's lie? Apollo: Right, or.... find out why he can't tell the truth. Apollo: Tenma Taro's staff would make a jangly sound, you say? Well, I'm going to say that your story doesn't add up. Judge: Is there something the defense would like to share with the court? Apollo: Mr. Filch, you say that you didn't see Tenma Taro on the day of the incident. Why then, did you assume just now that Tenma Taro would be holding a staff? Filch: Huh? Apollo: You see, the Tenma Taro Jinxie saw held a staff in his hands. And she described its sound just like you did -- as a kind of jangly sound. Filch: Yeah, so he was holding a staff. What's yer point? Apollo: Apollo: The point is that Tenma Taro doesn't use a staff. Not normally. Filch: What are you talking about? Apollo: You see, this is the only known document depicting Tenma Taro. Is there a staff in that picture, Mr. Filch? Judge: You're right! There's no staff! Not even a cane or a walking stick! Filch: Ack! Judge: So, the question is, why does the witness think Tenma Taro uses a staff? Apollo: I believe the answer will overturn the prosecution's case on the most basic level! Blackquill: .........Well now, this IS getting interesting. Judge: All right, Mr. Justice, it's time to show the court where you're going with this. Please tell the court why Mr. Filch believes Tenma Taro carries a staff. The scroll is wrong Apollo: Maybe the scroll is incorrect. There could be an older drawing that shows Tenma Taro with a staff. And Mr. Filch could have seen that. Blackquill: Hmph. If that were the case... ...then the fact that the witness believes Tenma Taro had a staff would not be an issue. Apollo: Oh, in that case, I retract my previous statement. Judge: Not so fast, Mr. Justice. You must be held accountable for your flights of fancy! Apollo: Argh! Athena: Ouch. A legal smack down... Apollo: (Filch believes Tenma Taro has a staff... ...despite the fact that Tenma Taro has never been drawn that way! So how could he have possibly known about the staff?) Judge: Let's try that again, Mr. Justice. Leads back to: \"Please tell the court why Mr. Filch believes Tenma Taro carries a staff.\" He actually saw Tenma Taro Leads to: \"Mr. Filch actually saw Tenma Taro right after the crime occurred!\" Filch is a scatterbrain Apollo: Mr. Filch obviously has a few screws loose. So, it's no surprise he would make a mistake like that! Filch: Now, hold it right there! As caretaker o' Kyubi Manor, I keep every screw nice 'n' tight! Apollo: (I rest my case.) Judge: With an assertion like that, this court wonders whether the defense has a screw loose, too. Here's a penalty to make sure you keep your screws in tighter next time. Apollo: (Filch believes Tenma Taro has a staff... ...despite the fact that Tenma Taro has never been drawn that way! So how could he have possibly known about the staff?) Judge: Let's try that again, Mr. Justice. Leads back to: \"Please tell the court why Mr. Filch believes Tenma Taro carries a staff.\" Apollo: Mr. Filch actually saw Tenma Taro right after the crime occurred! That's the only way he could possibly know about the staff! Filch: B-B-Busted again! Blackquill: Bloody hell! You duplicitous little--! Apollo: (Yes! How'd that feel, Blackquill? Not so fun when you're on the receiving end of the blade, is it!) Admit it, Mr. Filch! You DID see Tenma Taro that day, didn't you? Filch: Um... Uhhhhhh... Apollo: Well?! Filch: I'm beggin' ya! Please don't make me say it! Apollo: But you clearly did see Tenma Taro! Stop stalling and testify to that fact! Filch: No can do! No way, no how! You ain't got no idea how terrifying he can be! Apollo: ...He? (Mr. Filch still won't admit seeing Tenma Taro, even though everyone already knows he did. The question now is, why?) Athena: Mr. Filch is scared to death! Apollo: Is that why he can't admit the truth? Athena: Hmm... Come to think of it... Jinxie: They say you must not gaze upon Tenma Taro. But in the event that you do look... ...and then tell anyone what you saw, Tenma Taro will claim your soul. Athena: Jinxie wouldn't admit to seeing Tenma Taro after hearing about the village superstitions. She said that if she told anyone that she had seen Tenma Taro, he'd claim her soul. Apollo: Wait, you think Filch believes that, too? Filch: Ah! So Mister Big-Time, City-Slicker Lawyer has heard about 'em?! Them old village superstitions? Judge: Will the defense please explain what the witness is talking about? Apollo: The people of Nine-Tails Vale believe some pretty strange things. And their superstitions may be the reason our witness here can't admit the truth... ...the truth that he really did see Tenma Taro. Filch: D-Darn straight, that's why! It's all right here! Apollo: Ignoring the superstitions will cost you your soul? Filch: See?! That's why us folks in Nine-Tails Vale can't talk about seeing Tenma Taro! Village Superstitions added to the Court Record. Apollo: That clears up one mystery. The killer took advantage of the superstitions by wearing a Tenma Taro costume. They knew that that way no one could talk about him, so it was as if he never existed! The defense holds that this Tenma Taro impersonator is the true killer! Judge: Whaaat?! Blackquill: Blackquill: Hmph! Superstitions, you say? What kind of a fool would actually believe such rubbish? And would that using some silly fairy tale could so easily expose the culprit. (Changed from [And would that using some silly fairy tale so easily expose the culprit.] in the original release) You'll need to come up with a more rational, common-sense explanation than that! Apollo: Apollo: Your common sense seems awfully narrow-minded to me, Prosecutor Blackquill! Blackquill: Blackquill: Try living in my world of narrow cells, mortal danger, and dark, sleepless nights! There is no lack of superstitions in the clink, but few are those who truly believe in them! Apollo: Apollo: Well, the village superstitions are real enough to the people of Nine-Tails Vale! A life or death superstition might even make you a believer! Blackquill: ............Grr! Raaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwrrrrrrrrrrrr! Judge: Order! Order, I say!!! Blackquill: You fool of a tanuki! Two times now, your lies have cost me! Filch: S-S-Sorry, sorry! I promise not to do it again! Blackquill: ...Taka, my fine-feathered friend, have at him! Filch: Yiiipes! He's gonna eat me alive! Head for the hills! Apollo: Ah! He took off. Judge: B-B-Bailiff! What are you waiting for?! After him -- and with your fastest men! Athena: That's certainly not something you see every day. Judge: Well, it would seem a new and important fact has come to light. A third party disguised as the yokai Tenma Taro was at the scene. And now we have two witnesses who can attest to that fact. Any objections, Prosecutor Blackquill? Blackquill: .............................. .............................. Apollo: Uh-oh... Athena: Wha--?! Judge: Huh? ............Ahhhhhh! Apollo: His shackles...! Urk! (I... I'm too young to die!) Blackquill: Justice-dono, long has it been since I've been forced to draw my blade. You had best say your prayers. Judge: Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek! D-Detective, do something! Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Have no fear, Fulbright is here! When the going gets tough, the champion of justice gets going! Apollo: Apollo: Then get going, already, before he kills us! Fulbright: Oh, but I stand in awe of Simon Blackquill, for it is his sense of justice that set him free! Judge: Objection! Objection! I object to Detective Fulbright's definition of justice! Blackquill: Blackquill: Hmph. I'm not in the habit of cutting down unarmed cowards. Judge: Oh, w-well, in that case, Prosecutor Blackquill, can I ask you to, umm, you know... Apollo: (I think the judge forgot he's in charge here.) Blackquill: So, Justice-dono's assertion is this: Tenma Taro is the real killer, not Mayor Tenma. According to him, there was a yokai at the scene of the crime. Apollo: Right! And that yokai, or rather, whoever was impersonating him, killed Alderman Kyubi! Blackquill: Apollo: Ack! Blackquill: Care to explain why Jinxie, being the first to discover the murder... ...did not see your alleged killer yokai there in the Fox Chamber? Apollo: What? (He's right, she said nothing about Tenma Taro being in the Fox Chamber...) Blackquill: .........Hmph. Let me enlighten you. That little scamp heard a dying scream right before she opened the chamber door. Apollo: ...And your point is...? Blackquill: Upon opening the door, she found a freshly skewed murder victim -- the alderman... ...and the homicidal maniac who had killer him -- the mayor. Apollo: No, there must've been someone dressed up like Tenma-- Aagh! Blackquill: Then why does that little scamp claim not to have seen a yokai in the Fox Chamber? Judge: Hmm... Considering her father is accused of murder... ...surely she would've mentioned any third party that might have been in the room. Apollo: I don't understand. Why didn't she see Tenma Taro inside the Fox Chamber? Blackquill: Hmph. There is but one way to find out: Ask Jinxie Tenma whether she saw your killer yokai at the scene of the crime. Apollo: Uh-oh... Blackquill: The final battle draws nigh. Only one of us will leave here alive. Heh heh heh. Long has my blade thirsted for blood. At long last, it shall be sated! Apollo: Wait, this IS still a trial, right? Blackquill: Show me what you're truly capable of, Justice-dono! Judge: V-Very well, then. Both parties no doubt need some time to regroup... ...so the court will take a 10-minute recess in order to-- Aagh! Blackquill: ...Three minutes. Judge: I-I'm sorry, but... a three-minute recess? Blackquill: Just so. Plenty of time if your destination of intent is the loo. Judge: The loo? You mean the bathroom? Apollo: (Sheesh... At least include enough time to wash our hands.) Blackquill: See that you take no more than three minutes. All latecomers will be punished. Judge: Y-Yes, sir! I hereby declare a three-minute recess before the battle begins! Athena: I declare Prosecutor Blackquill the winner of this round of Simon Says... Apollo: Doesn't bode well for us if the prosecutor is running the show, does it...? April 18, 10:40 AMDistrict Court - Defendant Lobby No. 3 Athena: He busted out of his shackles. Apollo: Yeah, what was that about? Guess they don't make shackles like they used to. Athena: Better be careful, Apollo. You've really brought out the samurai in him. Especially after you proved there was a Tenma Taro impersonator at the manor. Apollo: What's with that guy and the whole samurai act, anyway? Tenma: Such fine swordsmanship... That is no mere act. Mr. Justice, it's high time I challenge this jailhouse prosecutor to a duel! Apollo: No, wait! Let's save the dueling until after we prove your innocence! Tenma: Hrmmm... I suppose it could wait till later. Apollo: (*sigh* Does ANYONE remember we're conducting a trial here?) Athena, I'm gonna go wash up. Athena: Remember what Blackquill said, Apollo. Don't be late! April 18, 10:43 AMDistrict Court - Courtroom No. 4 Judge: Now then, I believe our next witness is Ms. Jinxie Tenma, a maid at Kyubi Manor. I believe we can proceed now -- if the witness is ready, that is. Jinxie: N-N-Nurarihyon! Leader of the One Hundred Demons! He really does exist! Athena: Wow... That is one well-polished tray... Judge: The witness will show her face while in court, or her testimony will be inadmissible. Jinxie: Eek! Judge: What is it, my child?! Jinxie: Be gone, Nurarihyon, Leader of the One Hundred Demons! Judge: Ho ho ho. You think I'm a yokai? Well, I WAS once known as a judicial monster of sorts. The beast of the bar, the demon of due process, if you will. Jinxie: Eek! My charm has no effect... Athena: The demon of due process? Not sure I can see that one... Blackquill: .........Now, you little scamp. Jinxie: Yes? Blackquill: I trust you know why you're here. Jinxie: .........B-B-Bags. Blackquill: Bags? Oh, that tricksy tanuki? Try the noodle stand. And go enjoy a big bowl of tanuki tail noodles why you're at it. Apollo: (Everyone's a comedian.) Jinxie: No... I meant YOUR bags. The ones under your eyes. You must have trouble sleeping. (Changed from [No... I meant YOUR bags. The one's [sic] under your eyes. You must have trouble sleeping.] in the original release) Here. This charm will keep Azukiarai away. Blackquill: Azukiarai? The yokai that washes azuki beans? The only thing needing washing will be your father's neck before I take his head clean off! Jinxie: Azukiarai often keeps people up at night with the noise he makes washing beans. But if you stick this charm on your forehead, you won't hear him anymore. Blackquill: .........I-Is that so? Well, thank you. Athena: Looks like Prosecutor Blackquill got more than he bargained for. Apollo: They're bad enough alone, but together, those two are just plain creepy. Judge: Your testimony, if you please, Ms. Tenma. Specifically, whether or not you saw Tenma Taro when you discovered the crime scene. Witness Testimony -- What Jinxie Saw -- Jinxie: Did I see Tenma Taro in the Fox Chamber? Well, when I opened the door... *shiver* I saw... I saw... Yes! Now I remember! Y-Y-Yokai! Yokai! Right there in that room! Apollo: So there was a yokai at the scene of the crime! Jinxie: *shiver* Uh-huh, lots... and lots of them! Apollo: Wait, more than one yokai? Did Tenma Taro happen to be among them? Jinxie: I don't know! I just don't know! All I know is the room was swimming in yokai! Kasha, Nurikabe, Setotaisho! Eeek! They were all there! Judge: Well this is an unexpected turn of events. We've gone from no yokai to a flood of them. Blackquill: This is ludicrous. You would have this court listen to this delusional little scamp's testimony?! Apollo: Yurk! Athena: Athena: Your Honor! I believe her memory is simply clouded by fear! But a quick therapy session should ease her mind. With the court's permission, of course. Judge: What a fabulous idea! Please proceed, Ms. Cykes. Apollo: You sure you know what you're doing, Athena? Athena: She's obviously not herself. The trauma of discovering that crime scene... ...and fear of testifying have her dazed and confused. A regular ball of confusion! But my analytical psychology-based approach should be able to help. Judge: Any objections, Prosecutor Blackquill? Shall we let Ms. Cykes proceed? Blackquill: ............Hmph. It makes no difference to me. Do as you will, but I doubt we shall get any viable testimony. She'd be better served by bearing witness to the sword skills I forged in a distant land! Athena: Hmph! I'll show you! Jinxie: Did I see Tenma Taro in the Fox Chamber? Jinxie: Well, when I opened the door... *shiver* I saw... I saw... Jinxie: Yes! Now I remember! Jinxie: Y-Y-Yokai! Yokai! Right there in that room! Athena: Found something! Hmm... Looks like an out-of-control emotion. Apollo: Um, Athena? What exactly are we looking at here? Athena: Oh, this? It's one of Widget's functions. Right here you can see images and emotions extracted from the witness's voice. Apollo: Whoa! You mean that little thing can do all this?! Widget: Pretty cool, huh?! Apollo: (And here I thought it was just some kids' toy.) Athena: Unfortunately, all I'm getting is an overflow error right now. See how Sad is brightly lit there at the bottom left? She's under an uncontrollable amount of distress, which is masking her other emotions. It seems the sheer terror she experienced has made her a confused mess. Apollo: So all those yokai she thinks she saw are a product of rampant emotions? Athena: Yes, that's right. Her fear has instilled in her hallucinations and false memories. She's seeing normal everyday objects as monsters in her mind. It's a form of schizophrenic hallucination brought on by emotional trauma. And the trauma in Jinxie's case is fear. Apollo: (So she was, and still is, seeing ordinary objects as yokai...) Athena: We'll have to find the root cause of her extreme fear before I can treat it. Now, let's see... Apollo, can you point out the yokai on the wheel of fire? She seems particularly terrified of that one. Start by pressing Probe ([L / LB / Q]). (Changed from [Start by tapping Probe (L) on the bottom screen.] in the original release) Next, point to what's causing Jinxie's out-of-control emotion. Finally, hit Probe again ([X / Y / R]) to try and get to the heart of the matter! (Changed from [Finally, tap Probe again (X) to try and get to the heart of the matter!] in the original release) Apollo: (Okay, let's give this a try.) Jinxie: Y-Y-Yokai! Yokai! Right there in that room! Probe Cat Monster on a Wheel of Fire Apollo: Leads to: \"Jinxie, what's the name for that yokai on a wheel of fire?\" Apollo: Jinxie, what's the name for that yokai on a wheel of fire? Jinxie: Th-That's... a Kasha, a yokai that steals the bodies of the recently deceased! I bet it came to steal the alderman's! Apollo: It's almost creepy how well that fits the actual situation. Athena: Exactly! It's a form of hallucination where the patient can't see things for what they are! There must be something at the scene of the crime that she's mistaking for a Kasha! Apollo, you need to point out what she thought was a yokai on a wheel of fire! Apollo: (Hmm... I think I know the answer now.) Jinxie, that wasn't a Kasha you saw. Could you have possibly mistaken this for a Kasha? Present chandelier Apollo: Leads to: \"The light fixture?\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: This is what you mistook for a Kasha! Athena: What? That thing? Apollo: No? Jinxie: I'd never mistake that for a Kasha! Apollo: Really? Athena: You have to consider what a Kasha looks like, Apollo. Think, brightly blazing wheel near the ceiling. Apollo: (Okay... Let's give this another try.) Leads back to: \"Could you have possibly mistaken this for a Kasha?\" Jinxie: The light fixture? Apollo: This one right here. It has a flame design and is up there on the ceiling. There was never a yokai on a wheel of fire. The Kasha you saw was just a light fixture! Jinxie: Eeeeeek! Athena: That's one memory back to normal! Nice job! Now that you've got the hang of it, it should be a cinch to point out the rest! Apollo: Jinxie! What about this white wall-like monster? Jinxie: Th-That's Nurikabe! It's a wall monster that blocks your way or leads you astray! Apollo: That's no yokai, Jinxie! It's a folding screen! Jinxie: Eeeeek! Apollo: And this racoon dog isn't a tanuki monster, it's just the statue of one! Jinxie: Eeeeeeeeek! Apollo: And look! These are just coffee cups. And this right here? It's nothing more than a fox statue! Jinxie: Eeeeeeeeeeeek! I don't know what I was thinking! NOISE LEVEL50% Athena: You did it, Apollo! Her extreme fear is under control now! Jinxie: It was all just my eyes playing tricks on me. There weren't any yokai after all! Athena: See! A clear-cut statement. That's the power of my psychology and your intuition, Apollo! And just like we thought, there never really were any yokai in the Fox Chamber! Blackquill: .........Right. There never really were any yokai there. So, the defense is asserting the exact opposite of their original assertion? Apollo: ............Wait. Um, Jinxie? What about Tenma Taro? Jinxie: There wasn't anyone there dressed up as Tenma Taro, or any other yokai, either. I remember it clearly now. Apollo: You've-- Athena: Gotta-- Apollo: Be-- Jokiiiiiiiiiing!!! Judge: Order! Order in the court! Apollo: I think we just dug our own grave. Blackquill: Allow me to push you on in. It's the least I can do. Apollo: Nooo...! Athena: Apollo! Can I interrupt your freak-out for just a minute? I'm still picking up some noise! It's an unexpected emotion! Apollo: Does that mean Jinxie hasn't remembered everything yet? Athena: Exactly! We should be able to get something else out of her! I'll enter the new information we have and run an update! Jinxie: Did I see Tenma Taro in the Fox Chamber? Jinxie: I was so scared when I entered the room... Jinxie: ... my legs gave out and I fell to the floor. Pinpoint Sad marker Apollo: Leads to: \"The amount of fear you felt is rather low despite your legs having given out from fright.\" Jinxie: There in the Fox Chamber I saw... *shiver* Jinxie: ...the alderman dead on a table and papa collapsed in a chair. Jinxie: Nobody else was there! And that includes Tenma Taro! Apollo: Wait. What am I supposed to do? Athena: Try to find the emotions that contradict her statements. Apollo: So if I find a contradictory emotion, I should point it out? Athena: That's right. But it's not just contradictory emotions you should look out for. You should also keep an eye out for sudden changes in an emotion's intensity. Her emotions might get stronger or weaker as you move from statement to statement. It's important to compare how the same emotion changes throughout the testimony. Apollo: Contradictory emotions and changes in intensity... Okay, I'll give it a shot. Apollo: The amount of fear you felt is rather low despite your legs having given out from fright. Could something have lessened your fear? Jinxie: Actually, I did experience a sudden burst of courage at that moment. Apollo: You did? Where did it come from? Jinxie: Um... uh... Let me think... Oh, it was Mama. I suddenly felt as if she was there with me. Athena: Okay, I'll enter, \"Sudden burst of courage.\" Now, let's see... Ah! Look! Apollo, the noise is all gone! Jinxie seems to have remembered everything now! NOISE LEVEL0%BYE BYE Apollo: A sudden burst of courage... Now where could that have come from? Jinxie, was there something that gave you a sudden burst of courage? Jinxie: Um, yes there was, b-but... um... I, uh... I realized I had done something naughty when I thought about it later. Athena: Any idea what could have given Jinxie that courage? Apollo: Well, there IS one piece of evidence that comes to mind. I wonder if she saw something like it at the scene of the crime. Jinxie, did your sudden burst of courage have anything to do with this? Present Nine-Tails Flower Apollo: Leads to: \"Jinxie, you didn't happen to see a Nine-Tails Flower there at the scene, did you?\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: Could it have been this?! Jinxie: ...Huh? Apollo: (Oh... That's not encouraging...) Athena: The evidence you presented seems to have produced confusion rather than courage. Apollo: Guess I got that one wrong. Athena: Well, if at first you don't succeed... You know the rest, Apollo! Leads back to: \"Jinxie, did your sudden burst of courage have anything to do with this?\" Apollo: Jinxie, you didn't happen to see a Nine-Tails Flower there at the scene, did you? Jinxie: Ah! The demon lawyer strikes again. I can't hide anything from you. I found a small case with a picture of a Nine-Tails Flower on it. I liked it so much, I kept it! Apollo: You what?! You can't remove evidence from a crime scene! Judge: That's right, young lady. Removing evidence is a big no-no. Now, the witness will produce said evidence this instant! Jinxie: S-Sorry, sorry... Judge: Hmm... It does seem to be some sort of case. Oh, look, something slid out. It... appears to be a key! Blackquill: Might I have a look, Your Baldness? Hmmm......... Ah! This is none other than the master key to Kyubi Manor. Judge: Are you certain of this, Prosecutor Blackquill? Blackquill: It matches the serial number of the key that went missing after the murder. Apollo: A master key... that went missing? (Why don't I like the sound of that...?) Blackquill: Our little scamp here has stumbled upon an article of unimaginable consequence. Apollo: That's a little melodramatic, don't you think? Blackquill: Hmph. Heed these words, for I shall say them but once. The sole key to the Fox Chamber has been in this little scamp's constant possession. Ergo, she was the sole person who could use it before, during, and after the murder. Which leaves the master key as the only other key that could have opened the chamber. But this master key... ...was found in a room that had been locked by this girl. Apollo: And your point is? Blackquill: Until Jinxie Tenma opened the Fox Chamber with her key... ...the room had been locked tight from the outside world. And there was no one else in there, save the victim and his killer. I trust you have figured it out for yourself by now. A killer other than Mayor Tenma himself would be utterly inconceivable! Apollo: Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! Athena: Athena: How... could... this... happen...?! Nnrrrrrrgh...! Judge: The defense's assistant will refrain from growling her frustrations! Apollo: A-Athena, are you all right? Athena: Ugh! I know Mayor Tenma's innocent, but there's nothing we can do! Widget: This sucks! Blackquill: ...Cykes-dono. Allow me to put you out of your misery. Athena: Can I decline your offer? Blackquill: Abandon your client and your misplaced faith in him. Let the relief of a clear head and a clean conscious come rushing in. That will make the inevitable guilty verdict far easier to accept. Apollo: (Great. Now he's playing Simon Says with us! Well, he's not going to fool us with his stupid mind games! (Changed from [Well, he's not going fool [sic] us with his stupid mind games!] in the original release)) Athena, don't fall for his tricks! Athena: Uuh... Now I'M the one who's dazed and confused. I can't even think straight. Apollo: Hey, are you all right?! (She fell right into his trap!) Blackquill: Now, I suggest you make a mad dash from the courtroom and into the wild blue yonder. Only by running shall your mind be cleared and your conscious cleansed. Athena: All right, I'll be back in 10! Apollo: Apollo: Stay with me, Athena! Don't let yourself be twisted by that samurai! Athena: Apollo? Judge: Mr. Justice? ...I heard the word objection, but what is it you object to? Apollo: Huh...? Oh, right... (That objection was more of a reflex than anything else... ...though I was hoping something would come to me while I was trying to stop Athena...) Judge: The court is waiting, Mr. Justice. Though as it stands now... ...I'll be forced to declare your client guilty and your legal skills suspect if this is it. Now, do you have anything that could overturn the prosecution's case? Apollo: Um, well... Actually, I do! I'm Apollo Justice, and I'm fine! Athena: Apollo! You do have something more than your Chords of Steel, don't you? Apollo: Not really, but we'll be fine! Athena: B-B-But...! Apollo: (I've got absolutely nothing, but that's never stopped me before! I have to explain how the real killer could have escaped that locked room. Because it's all over if I don't!) Athena: Apollo, this calls for a new approach! Try to think outside the box! Apollo: Or in this case, inside the box! (And what a doozy that locked room is, too.) Judge: Well, Mr. Justice? Do you have anything that can counter the prosecution's argument? Apollo: Y-You bet I do! The real killer must have escaped from the locked room one way or another! Blackquill: Vague conjecture shall only earn you a taste of my blade, Justice-dono. Apollo: Err... (Time to do or die, literally!) Judge: The defense will now explain how it would be possible to escape the locked room. Athena: Y-You sure about this, Apollo? Can you really explain what happened? Apollo: I-I'm fine! We just need to think this whole escaping-a-locked-room thing over from the beginning! So... let's see. If the killer had escaped... ...how could they have done so? Athena: The choices are pretty limited. The room has a window, but... ...it doesn't open wide enough for anyone to get through, and there's a sheer cliff outside. As for the air vent... ...it's up too high and there's nothing you could stand on to reach it. And needless to say... ...the Forbidden Chamber wouldn't open no matter what we did, so that's out. Apollo: Yeah, that's why we gotta keep the solution simple. Like they say, simple is best. (Changed from [Yeah, that [sic] why we gotta keep the solution simple. Like they say, simple is best.] in the original release) We need to rule out all of the absolutely impossible escape routes. Then, whatever's left just might lead us to how the Fox Chamber was compromised! Your Honor! The defense proposes that the killer escaped through here! Present Fox Chamber door Apollo: Leads to: \"The hallway door? Well, yes, I suppose that would be the only way out.\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Judge: Hmm... And just how did the killer escape through there, Mr. Justice? Your reasoning skills seem as questionable as your proposed escape route. Apollo: Ack! I wish I could escape right now. Judge: I'm afraid there's no escaping a penalty for your random guessing, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Um, could I try that one again? Leads back to: \"Your Honor! The defense proposes that the killer escaped through here!\" Judge: The hallway door? Well, yes, I suppose that would be the only way out. Blackquill: .........Hmph. It would appear you've already forgotten. The only available key until Jinxie Tenma came on scene was within that locked room. How would one exit the Fox Chamber, and then lock it without a key? Hmm? Apollo: I should've seen this coming... Athena: Remember Apollo, keep it simple. Apollo: Simple, right. I could understand if the killer had exited the room with the key, but... Judge: Well, Mr. Justice? The prosecution has some fine Japanese steel waiting unless you explain yourself quickly. Apollo: I-I'm fine! I can explain myself! The reason the Fox Chamber's hallway door was locked was because... Tenma locked it from inside Apollo: Mayor Tenma locked it himself after the killer fled the scene... ...just in case the killer decided to return. That would explain why the room was locked! Judge: Yes, I see... Then again, wouldn't Mayor Tenma have mentioned that himself? Apollo: Oh, uh, maybe it slipped his mind because of that blow to his head? Aaaaaagh! Blackquill: ...Hmph. I have already considered and investigated such possibilities. Apollo: You have? Blackquill: The mayor's fingerprints were not found on the door or its doorknob. The only fingerprints found belonged to the alderman. Ergo, the mayor did not so much as touch the door. Apollo: (Oops.) Okay, then how about... Leads back to: \"The reason the Fox Chamber's hallway door was locked was because...\" It locked on its own Apollo: Maybe the door closed accidentally... on its own. (Changed from [Maybe the door closed accidently [sic]... on its own.] in the original release) Ack! Blackquill: The killer will never be identified if we attribute key moments to mere chance. Perhaps that spear just happened to fly off of the wall and impale the alderman, too. And perhaps that sedative just happened to make its way into his coffee. Mere chance could explain any number of things. Apollo: Right, um... next idea, then... Leads back to: \"The reason the Fox Chamber's hallway door was locked was because...\" The perp locked it from outside Leads to: \"What if the door was locked from the outside?\" Apollo: What if the door was locked from the outside? In other words, the killer took the key through the hallway door, then locked it-- Youch! Blackquill: Consider this: The master key was found inside the tightly locked Fox Chamber. Any assertion that the key was removed from that room is a blatant contradiction of fact. Athena: Exiting the room before locking the door WOULD require taking the key outside. But the key was found inside the room, which does seem like a contradiction. Apollo: If only we could explain both. Like, how the key could be inside the room AND be used to lock the door from outside. Judge: Well, let's see if the defense can respond before Prosecutor Blackquill draws his sword. (Changed from [Well, let's see if the defense can response [sic] before Prosecutor Blackquill draws his sword.] in the original release) How could the master key be at the crime scene, despite the room being locked tight? Slipped it in when the door was opened Apollo: Maybe someone threw it in from the hallway when Jinxie opened the door? That would explain-- Aaah! Blackquill: .........Hmph. Perhaps we should ask the little scamp herself. When you opened the Fox Chamber, did you witness anyone throw the master key inside? Jinxie: Sorry. I didn't see anyone else there. Apollo: Oh... Blackquill: What a pity. Or perhaps you intend to accuse the witness of murder? Judge: You leave me no choice. A penalty for random speculation and lack of foresight. Apollo: Ugh. (How could've someone gotten the key into that locked room?) Judge: Let's try that again. Leads back to: \"How could the master key be at the crime scene, despite the room being locked tight?\" Threw it in from outside Leads to: \"What if someone threw it into the room from outside -- you know, something like...\" Changed the lock Apollo: If the door had been rebuilt after the key was placed in the room... ...that would explain how it got there! Judge: Hmm... And the original door? Where did that disappear to? Apollo: Well, I guess it's highly unlikely that the door was rebuilt in the first place, so-- Ack! Judge: Penalty! Apollo: Ugh. (How could've someone gotten the key into that locked room?) Judge: Let's try that again. Leads back to: \"How could the master key be at the crime scene, despite the room being locked tight?\" Apollo: What if someone threw it into the room from outside -- you know, something like... ...go out the hallway door, lock the room, and then toss the key back in through the window. That would explain how the master key could be inside the locked room! Blackquill: ...And where would you throw it from? There is a cliff outside the Fox Chamber's window. Throwing the key in from there is an impossibility. Apollo: .........Oh! Right... Ack! Athena: I wonder if the key could've been tossed in from somewhere other than the window. Apollo: Somewhere other than the window? Hmm... Could the key have been tossed in through somewhere other than the window? Present Air Duct Apollo: Leads to: \"The air vent?\" Present window Apollo: Apollo: I propose the key was tossed in through the window! Blackquill: It seems the defense has developed a case of amnesia. A sheer cliff lies just outside that window. No one tossed in anything through there. Apollo: What if you threw it in from the bottom of the cliff? I bet you could get it in if you threw it as hard as you could? Blackquill: ...Hmph. I'm afraid you would still have no ground to stand on, just as with your case. For you see, a raging river lies at the bottom of that cliff. Judge: A penalty for the amnesia-prone attorney! Apollo: Ugh. (So the key didn't get in through the window. Guess I'd better rethink this.) Leads back to: \"Could the key have been tossed in through somewhere other than the window?\" Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: I propose the key was tossed in through here! Judge: Hmm... And how would that even be possible? Apollo: Oh, um... Very carefully, Your Honor? Judge: ......... The defense will refrain from tossing around vague answers to key questions. Apollo: Ack! Judge: Let's try that again. How could the key have wound up in that locked room? Apollo: (Well, if it isn't the window, from where else could it have been thrown inside?) Leads back to: \"Could the key have been tossed in through somewhere other than the window?\" Judge: The air vent? Apollo: Yes. The window may be out of the question, but the air vent's not! Athena: Oh, that's right! The Fox Chamber's air duct... ...leads out into the hallway. Apollo: That's right. The real killer entered the air duct from the vent outside the Fox Chamber... ...then dropped the key into the room through the vent inside the chamber! Blackquill: Hrgh! That's preposterous! Athena: Ooh, that explains how the key got in there after it was used to lock the door perfectly! Judge: Mr. Justice! Um... I'm afraid I'm a bit confused... Apollo: Don't worry! I'll explain it so even Your Honor can understand. First, the real killer, disguised as Tenma Taro, murdered the alderman in the Fox Chamber. Then, they fled the room through the hallway door and locked it. Next, they entered the air duct from the vent outside in the hallway. Finally, the killer tossed the key into the room through the air vent in the ceiling there! All that was left to do after that was go back through the duct and flee the manor! Well, Your Honor?! Could that be any clearer?! Judge: Amazing! Even I could follow that! Athena: The judge seems really pleased. Apollo: That explains everything! The real killer was someone dressed up like Tenma Taro. And there WAS someone else other than the mayor and the alderman in that room! Man: Hey, it looks like that lawyer has beaten the jailbird prosecutor! Man: Whoa! That was a total turnabout! Woman: That massive forehead of his seems so much more attractive now! Judge: Order! Order! Order, I say!!! Apollo: Now that I've proved a possible third party, I don't see how our client could be guilty! Blackquill: Blackquill: ..........A valiant effort, Justice-dono, but your final thrust missed its mark. Apollo: Huh? Blackquill: Both that little scamp and the tricksy tanuki saw the yokai after it left the room. But then what? Did that irksome yokai simply go through the foyer and waltz right out the front door? Apollo: Th-That's exactly what happened! The killer fled from the-- Youch! Blackquill: But that is impossible -- without being spotted by the foyer's security camera, that is. The electric eye here would have captured any pesky little yokai trying to escape. However, there is no sign of Tenma Taro anywhere in the security footage. Apollo: Wh-Wh-What?! Blackquill: Save for the foyer entrance, there is no other way to flee the manor, is there? Apollo: I don't feel so good. Athena: Athena: Wait! I believe there IS one other way to escape besides the foyer entrance! There's a large window in the foyer. It's possible to escape through there without being seen by the security camera. Apollo: Hey, you're right! Blackquill: Blackquill: Hmph. Must I point out every crucial detail to the defense? It seems you lack not only brains, but investigative prowess to boot. That is the cliff side of the manor. The only killer escaping that way would be a dead one. Athena: N-Nooooooooon! Apollo: Wait... So the killer didn't escape out the foyer window? Widget: What the heck, right? Blackquill: ....Ha! I suppose your next proposal is the killer sprouted wings and flew off into the sunset? Apollo: (That would mean the killer really was a yokai...) Athena: ...If only we had some sort of evidence that could point to a flying killer. Apollo: Who's saying we don't? (As completely far-fetched as it might be...) Athena: WHAAAT?! You're saying you can prove the killer could fly?! Apollo: Whoa! I thought I was the one with the Chords of Steel! Judge: Oh, I can't wait to hear this. Apollo: Um, Your Honor...? Judge: What evidence do you have that the killer flew away? Present Special Edition Paper Apollo: Leads to: \"Take a look at this special edition paper.\" Present anything else Apollo: Apollo: This piece of evidence shows that the killer yokai flew through the sky! Blackquill: ............ Apollo: ............ Blackquill: ............ Apollo: Never mind. Lemme try that again. Judge: Mr. Justice! You wouldn't be trying to escape without a penalty, would you?! Apollo: (I know we have some kind of evidence of a flying yokai.) Blackquill: Justice-dono, surrender yourself now or suffer the death of a thousand cuts. Apollo: N-Never! Leads back to: \"What evidence do you have that the killer flew away?\" Apollo: Take a look at this special edition paper. Judge: \"Tenma Taro: Real or Flight of Fancy?\" ...What does this article prove, Mr. Justice? Apollo: The photo in that article was taken shortly after the murder. Maybe the yokai in that photo is the killer shortly after they fled out of the window...? Judge: M-Mr. Justice! You're not seriously suggesting--! Apollo: Oh, I'm serious! I mean, it all adds up! The killer, disguised as Tenma Taro, flew away! You know, by some way or another! Blackquill: Blackquill: It is your brain that has flown the coop. (Changed from [It is your brain that has flow [sic] the coop.] in the original release) That image is naught but trick photography or some other form of artifice. Apollo: Okay, then, how about the Tenma Taro figure Mr. Filch saw? It just vanished into thin air? Blackquill: .........No, there is a rational, common-sense explanation for that. That infernal yokai our tricksy tanuki witnessed never reached the entrance. He -- or should I say she -- turned back before the camera's electric eye. Apollo: ......She? (I don't like where this is going one bit!) Blackquill: Now, the fact that we know the yokai had come from the Fox Chamber... ...means that it was likely either Mayor Tenma or his daughter Jinxie Tenma. However, we know that Mayor Tenma was already unconscious at that time. Apollo: *gulp* (Not good. Not good at all!) Blackquill: Do you understand the gravity of the situation now, Justice-dono? The falsified yokai remnants... ...and the appearance of \"Tenma Taro\" were the work of one individual. And that individual is none other than Jinxie Tenma! Apollo: ............ Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh! Nooooooooooooooooooooooo! Judge: Order! Order! The defense will stop competing for the greatest freak-out ever! Blackquill: The little scamp was, no doubt, simply trying to protect her father. And it's no wonder that her superstitious mind conjured up this mad masquerade. Judge: Prosecutor Blackquill's assertion makes perfect sense to me. It's far more convincing than saying the killer escaped by flying out of the window. Blackquill: Hmph. Did you truly believe this could end any other way? Apollo: (Did we fall right into his trap?) Athena: What do we do now, Apollo? Apollo: Our case no longer stands without a real yokai. If only we had one. Blackquill: Bailiff, seize her! It is time I interrogated her as the samurai of yore would. ???: Apollo: M-Mayor Tenma? Tenma: ......... Blackquill: Hmph. This farce is over. How does it feel, seeing your own daughter accused of a cover-up most foul? Tenma: ......... Tenma Taro's true identity is-- Blackquill: Now, now, Mr. Mayor. It would be futile at this point to claim you were the yokai. After all, you had been knocked out cold by a blow to the skull. Slipping into a yokai costume and roaming about the manor would be all but impossible. Tenma: ......... Blackquill: Consider this well. As it stands, your daughter will be arrested for obstruction of justice. But if you confess, the prosecution would be willing to overlook her little yokai farce. Judge: Confess? The defendant intends to confess?! Apollo: Wait! Athena: Apollo! Prosecutor Blackquill's up to his mind games again! Apollo: Mayor Tenma! No! Don't fall for his twisted words! If you're sent away for murder, Jinxie will be left all alone! Tenma: .........The real killer is... Athena: Mayor Tenma's going to confess unless we do something! Apollo: (But... But I can't prove how the real killer could've flown away...) Tenma: ............ Caw caw-caw-caw! Look upon me and despair, for ripe is the time for my return. Apollo: Hm? (Uh-oh... I should watch what I wish for.) Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! Foolish mortals! I am Tenma Taro, the yokai you seek! Apollo: Um... M-Mayor Tenma? Tenma: Silence! I am Tenma Taro -- freed from the bonds binding me to the Forbidden Chamber! Behold! The return of the Demon King! Apollo: Wh-What the--?! Athena: Demon King...?! Judge: Well then, I think it's time for me to... ...t-take a vacatioooon! The witness will...! Um... He will explain himself! Are you saying you're Tenma Taro, the yokai we've been chasing this whole time? Tenma: Indeed, it is I, Tenma Taro, the one whom you seek -- come to reveal the truth. This child is Tenma Taro, you say? Hah! What nonsense! Apollo: So, Mayor Tenma... is a yokai now? Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! His body is now mine! Judge: So, you're saying that Mayor Tenma is... being possessed by you? And that the yokai that Jinxie Tenma and Phineas Filch saw... ...and the one captured in the newspaper photo... Those were all you? Tenma: The accursed power of these warding charms prevents me from revealing my true form. Apollo: ......... Blackquill: Your Baldness! .........Can this not be interpreted as an admission of guilt?! Judge: Well, a confession by a yokai would be quite unprecedented. Blackquill: Be that as it may, the defense's case has been overturned. Apollo: Huh? What?! Blackquill: You claimed the yokai that little scamp saw was some third party -- the true killer... ...the one who escaped from the locked Fox Chamber, but it was the accused all along. Apollo: Argh! Blackquill: Ironic, is it not? Your yokai turned out to be real in a manner of speaking. For the alderman's killer is none other than Mayor Tenma! And the yokai at the scene? That, too, was Mayor Tenma, or should I say, our dear Tenma Taro! The pieces have all fallen into place. Apollo: H-How so, Prosecutor Blackquill? Blackquill: Hmph. It seems I must spell it out for you. Mayor Tenma killed the alderman in the Fox Chamber -- which was locked at the time. He then removed the warding charms from the Forbidden Chamber's door... ...but then fell unconscious from the blow the alderman had delivered to his head. That's when his daughter Jinxie Tenma stumbled on the scene of the crime. The little scamp fled in terror, whereupon the spirit of Tenma Taro... ...freed at last from the charm's warding effect, took possession of the mayor. The newly freed Tenma Taro then fled from the Fox Chamber. So, you see, the yokai Jinxie Tenma saw was her father possessed by Tenma Taro. Apollo: Apollo: But when we arrived on scene, the mayor was found unconscious! How's that possible if he was supposed to have flown out the foyer window?! Blackquill: Then, what? Do you mean to say the maid of Kyubi Manor, Jinxie Tenma, was Tenma Taro? Apollo: ............Oh. Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Tenma: Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! That, too, is easily explained. Flew about for a time did I, but presently tired, I made for the Forbidden Chamber. But alas, exhaustion took me unaware in the Fox Chamber, and I knew no more. Blackquill: Hmph. It would seem the pieces are still in place. Apollo: (Is Blackquill up to his tricks again?) Judge: I-I don't know what to say. Is the defendant a real live...? Man: So that rumor about Mayor Tenma is true? I knew yokai were real! Man: You mean he really did kill the alderman just so he could release Tenma Taro?! Judge: Order! Order!!! Athena: Now he's got everyone in the courtroom believing in yokai! Apollo: It's Simon Says on steroids! He wants to convict our client any way he can -- even if it means blaming a yokai! Blackquill: The proverbial ducks are all in a row. You should now have no qualms about finding the accused guilty, Your Baldness. Judge: Hmm... This is one of the most bizarre cases in my entire career. Otherworldly, in fact. Can yokai even be prosecuted under our legal system? Apollo: Apollo: Mayor Tenma is just pretending to be Tenma Taro to protect his daughter. Plus, I already proved how a third party could have escaped from the locked room! A verdict at this point would be premature! Judge: Hmm... Since both sides have raised valid points, I've no choice but to-- Blackquill: Blackquill: Hmph! This is the dark age of the law where defense attorneys are not to be trusted. This is but a ploy to gain time for them to fabricate evidence! How will I sleep tonight... ...knowing you will not let the run rise on the mayor's day of reckoning, Justice-dono? Apollo: Apollo: I won't fabricate any evidence! Blackquill: Blackquill: Then prove it by joining me. A night in the clink will ensure you will not succumb to temptation! Apollo: How about I just promise not to succumb to anything? Blackquill: We have both evidence and a confession. The killer is this yokai before us. It is beyond dispute. A guilty verdict is all but-- Uuuwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! Apollo: What's wrong with him? Fulbright: Prosecutor Blackquill! We've had enough of your hijinks! The foundation of justice is fair play, and you are in serious violation of that! Blackquill: *huff* *huff* What in the devil was that? Fool Bright! Have you tampered with my shackles in some manner? Fulbright: Ha ha ha ha! It seems you found that quite shocking. It's my special Jolt of Justice device. Each press is a shocking reminder to behave. Blackquill: You shall pay for this. I, Simon Blackquill, vow to-- Uuuwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! Fulbright: Your Honor! You need not fear now! I believe Prosecutor Blackquill will remain on his best behavior. Apollo: ...A bit late with the reassurances, aren't we, Detective? Judge: W-Well, in that case... *ahem*... This concludes today's deliberations. The prosecution and the defense will use this opportunity to further their investigations. This court is adjourned! To be continued Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: That statement clearly contradicts the evidence! Blackquill: ...Hmph. I object to you on personal grounds. The sole contradiction lies in what your faulty logic dreamt up just now. Apollo: Ack! Judge: Objection overruled. The defense will think twice before making such erroneous statements! Apollo: (It seems that statement didn't particularly conflict with the evidence.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: Consider the evidence. There's obviously something wrong with that statement! Blackquill: Your gall knows no bounds. It's shocking, really. Apollo: What's that supposed to mean?! Blackquill: You stand there, brazely objecting to perfectly factual statements... One does not see such shameless behavior that often. Judge: A penalty for our shameless attorney! Apollo: (Oh, no. Looks like Blackquill is turning the judge against me.) Presenting wrong evidence during testimony Apollo: Apollo: The evidence is at complete odds with the witness's testimony! Blackquill: ...........................Your Baldness. Judge: Wh-Who, me? Blackquill: What do you make of this objection of his? Judge: Oh, I don't know if I should, um, well... Blackquill: I've no patience for vagaries. Now, answer my question. Judge: Y-Yes, sir! The defense's objection was clearly misguided! Blackquill: Bravo. Nicely done. Judge: Ho ho ho. It seems our misguided attorney has earned himself a penalty. Apollo: (Erk... I better look before I leap next time!) Consult (when evidence must be presented) Athena: Hmm... There has to be a contradiction here somewhere. Apollo: (Too bad I'm drawing a blank.) Athena: There was a statement that I thought was a little strange, but... ...I wouldn't bet my life on it. Apollo: .........And which statement would that be? Since I'm the one betting my life on it. Athena: Hee hee hee. Okay, if you must know, I'll show you the one I'm thinking of. Apollo: (Time to swallow my pride and let her lend a hand.) (There must be an inconsistency in the testimony Athena's pointing out!) Consult (when statements must be pressed) Athena: Hmm... I can't flag any inconsistencies. Apollo: So there haven't been any contradictions in the testimony so far... That can mean only one thing... Athena: Time to press the witness! Apollo: Right. We'll have to work to get the testimony we need. Let's press the heck out of any statements that stick out. Pinpoint wrong emotion (during Mood Matrix segment \"What Jinxie Saw\") Apollo: Apollo: Hmm... This seems like an unnatural reaction... Athena: Really? Because I don't see it that way. Apollo: So it isn't unexpected given her testimony? Athena: Hello? Is there anybody in there? Just nod if you can hear me. Apollo: (Yes, there is someone at home, and that someone is going to try that again.) Too many penalties Judge: That's enough! I see no need to further prolong this trial. The defense's argument is insufficient to overturn the prosecution's claims! This court finds the defendant, Damian Tenma... Guilty The Monstrous Turnabout Image Gallery Transcript Part 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 4 April 18, 1:20 PMWright Anything Agency Athena: Having a yokai testify in court is unprecedented to say the least. Apollo: \"I am Tenma Taro, the yokai you seek!\" How could such a straight-laced man like Mr. Tenma suddenly become a demon? Athena: Yeah, it's strange. Even worse, Prosecutor Blackquill is playing along. *sigh* I can't even think straight anymore. I need to go out for a run! See you in a bit! Apollo: Wait! What about the--! ...Investigation. Trucy: Back! ...Eek! Athena: Whoa, whoa! Trucy, welcome back. Oh, you're in your stage outfit. Back from work? Trucy: Yep! I really nailed this new magic trick I've been working on! ...I also heard about those tricks that were conjured up in court earlier today. You know, the demon-out-of-nowhere trick and Polly's tightrope-style defense trick! Apollo: I was seriously considering a disappearing act of my own after all that craziness. ...Anyway, our next trick is to find a suspect other than the mayor. I know the killer must've used the air duct in the escape. Athena: And whoever did that was the Tenma Taro that Mr. Filch and Jinxie saw. Apollo: Right. Maybe there's some evidence in the air duct. Athena: The real fight starts right now! Trucy: Hey, before you go, let me make the evidence you no longer need disappear! 3, 2, 1... Ta-dah! Unnecessary evidence has disappeared into Trucy's magic panties. Apollo: (I wonder where all that stuff goes?) Athena: Okay, let's get over to the scene of the crime! ¡Vámonos, Apollo, Vámonos! (Changed from [Vamonos, Apollo, Vamonos!] in the original release) April 18Kyubi Manor - Fox Chamber Athena: Detective Fulbright! Mind if we search the air duct? Fulbright: Well, since you really are on the side of justice, I suppose I can let you... Plus, my own sense of justice has been called into doubt, so... Athena: Wonder if he's been like this ever since the trial. Apollo: Well, his sense of justice HAS been beaten to a pulp. It'll probably take a while for him to recover. Athena: I sorta feel bad for him, but we have work to do! Let's go get the evidence we need! Apollo: The air duct is the key. We know the Tenma Taro impersonator used it to make an escape. After murdering the alderman, the killer left the Fox Chamber through the hallway door. Then, after locking the door from the outside... ...the killer entered the air duct in the hallway. Finally, the killer dropped the key into the Fox Chamber through the air vent here... ...then went back through the duct and fled the manor. That's how the illusion of no one entering or leaving the locked room was created! Athena: If the killer passed through the air duct, maybe we'll find some evidence there. Apollo: Yeah, maybe some black feathers or something like that. Well, here's our vent. It's awfully high up. Athena: Don't worry, I brought a stepladder! Happy hunting! Apollo: (How nice of her to volunteer me for the job.) Whoa, it's pitch black in here. Well, here goes nothing! *cough, cough* *wheeze* *sputter* *cough, cough* There's a thick layer of dust in here! *cough, cough* *wheeze* *sputter* *cough, cough* ............ ...I don't... get it. Athena: Find anything? Yikes! Apollo, what happened?! You're covered in dust! Apollo: Yeah, dust... Lots of dust. Athena: So, what'd you find? Apollo: You know how dust collects on something when nobody uses it for a long time? Athena: Yeah, like Mr. Wright's desk back at the office. Apollo: Right... You think it'd be possible to crawl over that sort of dust without leaving a trail? Athena: I seriously doubt it... Wait, you're not suggesting--! No one's gone through that duct lately?! Apollo: Kinda looks that way. And if it's true, Mayor Tenma is going to be fingered as the killer. Athena: B-B-But...! Apollo: (If we don't turn things around quickly...) Fulbright: In justice we trust! Apollo: Ack! Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Sorry, Mr. Justice! But it seems your justice was not the most just, after all! It is MY sense of justice that has prevailed! Apollo: Argh! Athena: Detective Fulbright sure seems chipper all of a sudden. Apollo: Ugh. And I'm back to my old devastated self. Fulbright: Aw, come on! Where's that never-say-die spirit? Bring it on, Mr. Lawyer Man! Bring it on! Apollo: Let me suffer in peace. Fulbright: Ha ha ha! Justice prevails once more! Athena: It's not over yet! And besides... Kicking someone when they're down is what bad guys do! Fulbright: Ack! A-Are you calling me a... a bad guy?! Me? Bobby Fulbright, champion of justice?! Athena: Then how about some information on the investigation? We need some help here! Fulbright: Information? About the investigation? All right! But I won't have you calling me a bad guy ever again! Understood?! Athena: We did it, Apollo! Apollo: Yeah, but how long can we keep this up? Talk The investigation Athena: I can't believe Prosecutor Blackquill would stoop that low! I mean, to pinning the blame on a yokai?! He really wants a conviction at all costs! Apollo: (She could give a yokai a run for its money when she's mad...) Fulbright: Yes, well... I have him writing a self-reflective essay as we speak! Athena: I doubt that'll teach him anything. Apollo: Yeah, he'll probably just write \"Dotard\" a thousand times. Fulbright: That whole yokai business is most likely a ploy to win a conviction. Truth is, Prosecutor Blackquill believes Jinxie Tenma planted that yokai stuff. Planted it in an effort to protect her father -- the real killer. Athena: Yeah, right! I'd like to see him prove it! Fulbright: Whoa! Calm down! He doesn't have any direct evidence, but we did find this. It was at the base of the cliff just outside Kyubi Manor. Apollo: Wait... That isn't the staff Tenma Taro was supposedly carrying, is it? Fulbright: The one and only! Ms. Tenma no doubt tossed it over the cliff when she was done. Athena: No way! W-Well, what about prints?! Fulbright: Nope, no prints, but if she was wearing a costume, there wouldn't be any, anyway. Apollo: Well, prints or no prints, it's not going to work out in our favor. (Sounds like the staff might have belonged to the mansion. But if that's the case... ...then where in the mansion did Tenma Taro get it from?) The Amazing Nine-Tails Apollo: Did Prosecutor Blackquill figure out that the victim was The Amazing Nine-Tails? Fulbright: He did, indeed. He's a sharp one, all right. He figured it out while investigating the municipal merger and the victim's past. The Amazing Nine-Tails sparked the yokai craze and worked against the merger! And Mayor Damian Tenma is the corrupt politician who murdered that great hero! The Amazing Nine-Tails's fans are so angry, they even tried to storm the detention center! Athena: I don't blame them. I mean, their favorite masked wrestling hero was murdered. They must've been shocked when they found out what happened. Apollo: Speaking of which, isn't Jinxie also a fan of The Amazing Nine-Tails? Jinxie: A wrestler's mask is more precious than his own life! He'd never unmask himself in front of others. But there ARE matches where wrestlers battle for the right to remove each other's masks. Jinxie: To have your mask torn off is the worst humiliation a wrestler could suffer! That's why their masks are more important to them than life itself. Athena: She spoke with a passion that only a fan could appreciate. We oughta become fans ourselves and go protest in front of the prison! Apollo: What? No! Did you forget that Mayor Tenma is not only Jinxie's father, but our client!? Athena: Oh, yeah. Fulbright: You be careful, now. You're defending the most hated mayor in history. I just hope you don't find yourself on the wrong end of a figure-four leg lock! Apollo: (Maybe I should wear a mask to hide MY identity.) Present Crime Photo Fulbright: Such a grisly crime scene! I won't rest until that murderous fiend is behind bars! Apollo: So, you still think Mayor Tenma is responsible? Fulbright: That's right! Damian Tenma is an evil fiend who must be banished from this world! Now, take my hand and together we will defeat this evil! Apollo: Um, I think you're forgetting that Mayor Tenma's still my client. Kyubi's Autopsy Report Apollo: So, it was the spear that killed the alderman? Fulbright: That's right. He'd been in a drug-induced sleep, but woke the moment he was impaled. That's when he was struck by his attacker! Apollo: That's almost superhuman. Fulbright: Justice cannot allow evil to exist unopposed! Even if it means sacrificing one's life! Athena: I bet you two could strike back even if you were impaled! I mean, you're so full of justice. Apollo: Really? Or are you just saying that because of my name, Athena? After clearing all Talk options: Apollo: Are there any other new developments we should know? Fulbright: Hm, now that you mention it... Our suspect is suffering partial memory loss, but he DID manage to remember something. Apollo: He did? What did he say? Fulbright: He said he didn't want to speak with us. His exact words were: \"I am under no obligation to speak with you mortals!\" ...and other things of that nature. Apollo: (I wonder what Mayor Tenma remembered.) Fulbright: Too bad you can't go ask him now, 'cause Prosecutor Blackquill's busy questioning him. I know! Why don't you wait down at the playground with the rest of the kids? Ha ha. Athena: What now, Apollo? Apollo: How about regrouping back at the agency? Athena: Good idea. We might get some words of wisdom out of Mr. Wright while we're there. Detention Center, Yokai Lane, Kyubi Manor Garden, or Kyubi Manor Foyer Talk Any ideas? Athena: So the crime scene was locked tight at the time. Ugh, this is a tough one. Apollo: The only people in that locked room were the deceased -- the alderman -- and the mayor. Athena: Maybe the killer hid somewhere in that room. Apollo: But is there really anywhere to hide in the Fox Chamber? The trial Athena: That was quite a day in court. The news just can't stop talking about how the demon Tenma Taro made an appearance! Apollo: There's never an exorcist around when you need one. Athena: Well, I heard the judge actually held an exorcism in his courtroom after that. Apollo: Good. Let's hope it's the last we'll see of that pain-in-the-neck yokai. Athena: I don't know. I have a feeling Tenma Taro could exorcise an exorcist. Apollo: As an attorney defending a demon, I know exactly how that feels. Present Amazing Nine-Tails Mask Athena: I can't believe Alderman Kyubi was The Amazing Nine-Tails! Apollo: Hmm, maybe that's why the killer targeted him. His popularity among the anti-merger faction would have been a major obstacle. Athena: Yeah... Maybe the alderman felt threatened, and that's why he had to disguise himself. Jinxie's Statement Athena: Do you think the Tenma Taro Jinxie saw was the real killer? Apollo: Hmm... It's hard to say at this point. Athena: But if that's not our killer, then what was it doing in the manor? Apollo: ...Maybe it just wanted to use the bathroom. Athena: Huh?! I've heard of monsters in the closet and under the bed. They're in the bathroom, too?! Apollo: No, what I'm saying is the Tenma Taro Jinxie saw was someone dressed up like a yokai. I mean, there is no such thing as monsters in the bathroom. People on the other hand... Athena: Oh, I get it. That was your attempt at a joke. Ha ha, very funny... Apollo: (For someone so competitive and smart, she sure get some crazy ideas.) April 18Wright Anything Agency Apollo: Maybe I'll... go read over some past cases... Athena: And I'll... go do some research on exorcisms... Trucy: Hey, what's with you guys? You seem bummed out. Apollo: How should I put this? It's like we're at the edge of a cliff and the only way is down. Trucy: In other words, business as usual, right? Apollo: Yeah, I suppose so. Except this time, it's like we're bound and gagged, too. Athena: Don't forget blindfolded with our ears plugged up... Trucy: Ooh, and monsters at every turn, huh? Sounds rough... ???: Hey, Apollo. Oh, and Athena's here, too. Athena: Mr. Wright. Phoenix: How goes the investigation, Apollo, Athena? Athena: I think it's safe to say that things have gotten hairier than before. Phoenix: Really? What happened? Talk Our defense Phoenix: I was watching the two of you this morning from the gallery. That was one tough day in court, to say the least. Apollo: I know. I've never had to defend a yokai before. Phoenix: That business about the locked room was another major hurdle. Athena: Yeah, and on top of that, Jinxie was accused of being an accomplice! Phoenix: But at least you figured out how someone could have escaped that locked room. (Changed from [But at least you figured out how someone could have escaped the Forbidden Chamber.] in the original release) Apollo: Yeah, well, we just found out that our reasoning might be a tad... flawed. Phoenix: Oh, really? Well, that's... bad news. Athena: How are we going to get out of this one...? Phoenix: The worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles. Athena: Force... a smile? Phoenix: Yeah. My mentor taught me that back when I was still learning the trade. She... also taught me to return to the basics whenever I got stuck. Apollo: Return to the basics? Phoenix: That's right. Always believe in your client, no matter what happens. That is a lawyer's greatest and most trusted weapon. Apollo: The basics... (Always believe in your client, huh...) You and Athena Apollo: So, Mr. Wright, how long have you known Athena? Phoenix: I met her during a trip to Europe. Apollo: Huh!? Y-You were in Europe? (Why haven't I heard about this before?) Phoenix: Yeah, I went there a few times to study the various legal systems over there. Apollo: Oh, okay... Er, wait a minute. I thought you worked as a pianist after you quit practicing law. Phoenix: I did, but an old friend of mine needed help with some legal work from time to time, so... Apollo: Oh, I guess you were never very far from the courtroom, then. Athena: It was like fate brought us together! It's thanks to Mr. Wright that I became a lawyer at all. Phoenix: Ha ha ha. I knew she was lawyer material from the moment I met her. And I have high hopes for her ability to analyze people's emotions. Athena: Aww, it's nothing special. Apollo: (Hmm... Maybe I've underestimated that analytical psychology of hers.) Athena: It's just, I thought that if my special ability could help defend innocent people... ...then I had to do everything in my power to bring it to the courtroom! That's when I really started hitting the books hard! Phoenix: I'm still amazed she actually became a lawyer. And at the tender age of eighteen, no less. (Changed from [And at the tender age of 18, no less.] in the original release) Apollo: Wow, that's almost superhuman. (Or personal -- like she's trying to help somebody she knows.) (Changed from [Or personal -- like she [sic] trying to help somebody she knows.] in the original release) Present Attorney's Badge Phoenix: Your attorney's badge, huh... I used to show mine to everyone, too. Apollo: Why? Phoenix: You know, I never really thought about it. But I could ask you the same question. Apollo: Me? Well, I guess you could say I show it because there's someone to show it to. ...Or something like that. Phoenix: Ah ha ha. When you say it like that, it sounds kind of... I don't know... philosophical? Apollo: Heh heh, I guess it does. (.........Or does it?) Yokai Legend Scroll Apollo: Here's a little souvenir Trucy wanted you to have. Phoenix: Aww, how sweet! I know. I'll hang it in my office once the case is closed. Apollo: I don't know, it's pretty creepy looking. We don't want to freak our clients out. Phoenix: Hmm... You have a point there. Maybe you should hang it in your room, Apollo. Apollo: My room?! I don't want this thing in there! Phoenix: I don't want it, either. It has instant nightmare fuel written all over it. Apollo: Well, Trucy got it for you, so stop trying to pawn it off on me! Phoenix: You know... The more I look at it, the more I wonder if these are your distant relatives. Apollo: Hey... What's that supposed to mean?! Crime Photo Phoenix: So the room was locked tight and the only people in there were the suspect and victim? I headed up a similar case a long time ago. Apollo: Really?! Phoenix: Not only that, the defendant was my assistant. Apollo: What?! Phoenix: And not only that, the prosecutor for that trial loved to swing her whip around in court. Apollo: A whip?! Phoenix: When I saw that whip... man, I thought it was all over. Apollo: Wait, your assistant getting accused of murder hadn't made you think that already...? Anything else Phoenix: Ah ha ha. You're getting good at this, Apollo. Remember, the way you present evidence in court can really have an impact on the trial. Hmm... But your elbow angle's a little off. It should really be more like this. Apollo: I-I'll be fine! I'll be more careful next time. Promise! After clearing all Talk options: Athena: All right! I'm totally pumped up after talking to you, Mr. Wright! It's like you said, the worst of times are when lawyers have to force their biggest smiles! Phoenix: And don't forget to return to the basics whenever you get stuck. Apollo: (Keep believing in my client. Right!) Um, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: Yes? Apollo: I'm... I'm going to go visit our client again! Phoenix: I think that's a good idea. Apollo: (Alright, time to see what's new down at the Detention Center!) April 18Detention Center - Visitor's Room Athena: Mayor Tenma, we wanted to talk to you about something! Tenma: Caw-shaaaaaaaaw! Athena: Eeek! Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! So, my minions have returned! Athena: Apollo, he still thinks he's a yokai! Apollo: I wonder if we'll ever be able to talk to Mayor Tenma again. Tenma: Silence, peddler of the legal trade! Free me from these imprisoning walls with great haste! Athena: Wow... He's sounding more and more like a real demon with every sentence. I'm starting to wonder if we should even be helping him win his freedom. Apollo: Still, we can't let Mayor Tenma stay possessed, you know what I mean? Tenma: If you can clear me of these charges, I shall help in whatever manner I may. Now, ask of me what you will! Apollo: I suppose it's worth a shot. Talk Feathers and tracks Apollo: Were those feathers and tracks at the scene of the crime really your doing? Tenma: Indeed! The remnants of Tenma Taro, King of the Underworld, they be! The day when I once again dominate the mortal world is at hand, caw caw-caw-caw! Athena: The prosecution claims the feathers and tracks were planted by Jinxie. Tenma: What's this?! I must breach these walls and go defend my little Jinxie at once! Athena: Huh? Mayor Tenma, is that you? Tenma: ! ...Grr! Well, now! Damian appears to still reside within this body. But I should have expected as much from a descendent of mine! Be silent, now, Damian! Apollo: (I guess a little thing like demonic possession won't stop a father's love for his daughter.) You didn't kill Alderman Kyubi, did you? Tenma: I have killed no one! The remnants of my presence have been misconstrued. The murderer is not I! For if I had slain that mortal... ...raging hellfire would have consumed him, leaving naught but ash! Apollo: Yikes! ............S-So... S-So... you're saying, there must have been somebody else there? (Come to think of it, the mayor had mentioned that he'd been clubbed with this statue. I'd better ask about this, too.) What you remembered Apollo: Detective Fulbright mentioned that you might have something new to tell me. Tenma: Indeed, I have. I regurgitated this key but a short while ago. Behold, the key to the Forbidden Chamber! Apollo: Whoa! Is regurgitation one of your demonic powers, too?! Tenma: Bah! I do not waste my powers on such parlor tricks! Take the key from the killer did Damian, whereupon he swallowed it. He sought to bar the killer entry to the Forbidden Chamber. Apollo: (So, he wanted to keep it shut tight?) Tenma: But no fingerprints shall you find upon that key. Apollo: How do you know that? ...Wait. Is THAT another one of your demonic powers, then?! Tenma: Foolish mortal! You would have me, Tenma Taro, act as some asinine alchemist?! I but asked the jailer and my will was done -- quite eagerly, I must add, caw caw-caw-caw! Guard: Always an honor to serve, Your Malevolence! Apollo: (Guess I'm not the only one he scares the living daylights out of.) Athena: Um, can we ask how you use this key? We couldn't find a keyhole anywhere in or around the door. Tenma: Curse that infernal door! But if I had known its manner of opening, long, long ago would I have made my return! Athena: He has a point there. Apollo: Maybe Jinxie knows something about how the whole thing works... Forbidden Chamber Key added to the Court Record. What you remembered (after correctly presenting Fox and Demon Statue) Apollo: Detective Fulbright mentioned that you might have something new to tell me. Tenma: Indeed, I have.

Athena: He has a point there. Apollo: Maybe Jinxie knows something about how the whole thing works... Blackmail letter (appears after correctly presenting Blackmail Letter) Apollo: Who placed this in the alderman's pocket? Tenma: Hrmmm. Very few were they who knew the letter was in Damian's briefcase. Apollo: So, whoever knew about the blackmail letter being in the mayor's briefcase... ...is a potential suspect in its theft and placement in the alderman's pocket. Tenma: Ah! Could it have been... HIS doing?! Apollo: Mr. Mayor, er... I mean, Mr. Taro! Did you just remember something?! Tenma: Indeed, I did. There was but one other who knew of that letter: Damian's aide Florent L'Belle. Full knowledge of that briefcase's contents did that aide possess. Apollo: Then he may be the blackmailer and the murderer we're looking for! Tenma: That is preposterous! He's a most trusted advisor. He would never betray Damian! Athena: It seems like Mayor Tenma is a bit too trusting of those around him. Apollo: (Still, this is HUGE! Now we know who might've slipped that blackmail letter in the alderman's pocket! Look out, Florent L'Belle, here comes Justice!) Athena: Let's go find Mr. L'Belle and rake him over the coals! Apollo: Thanks for the help. You've just given us a major lead! Blackmail Letter updated in the Court Record. Athena: Hmm... There's something that still bothers me. If Mr. L'Belle is the killer... ...what could have motivated him to open the Forbidden Chamber? Apollo: We should probably search it for clues. Athena: Only one problem. How do you open a locked door that doesn't have a keyhole? Apollo: Let's go talk to Jinxie. Maybe she can help. Blackmail letter (subsequent times) Apollo: Who placed this in the alderman's pocket?

Present Fox and Demon Statue (after clearing \"Feathers and tracks\" Talk option; before clearing \"What you remembered\" Talk option) Tenma: What, might I ask, is that? Apollo: This statue was found at the scene. Someone hit Mayor Tenma over the head with it. It had been wrapped in a large cloth before the alderman's murder. Tenma: Let me see whether Damian knows about such a thing... Hrmmm, yes... Something wrapped in just such a cloth does he recall. A secret gift from Alderman Kyubi it would seem. He, however, had not a chance to see it till now, for the cloth did conceal it. Apollo: Maybe the cloth fell off or was removed after the mayor was struck. Tenma: Hrmmm, of that Damian does not know. Apollo: (A secret gift? Interesting... Maybe Jinxie knows something about it...?) Fox and Demon Statue (after clearing \"Feathers and tracks\" and \"What you remembered\" Talk options) Tenma: What, might I ask, is that? Apollo: This statue was found at the scene.

Yokai Legend Scroll Tenma: Ages has it been since I've seen that. We often battled it out like this back in the day. Athena: I've been meaning to ask, which one of you was stronger? Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! That would be me, of course! For I am the demon lord of the yokai! Caw-shaaaaaaaaw! Athena: Yeah, but the Nine-Tailed Fox imprisoned you in-- Apollo: Athena! Don't encourage him! It's already hard enough as it is. Athena: Aw, I just wanted to find out which one was really the strongest. Special Edition Paper Tenma: Why, that is a photo of me soaring through the heavens. Hrmm, but look at my wing angle. It's all wrong. Athena: Wow, you're really a stickler for details. Tenma: I even gave a big smile for the camera... ...but so small am I in this shot that one can't even see it! Apollo: Never knew demons were so interested in how they're presented by the media. Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy Tenma: Hrmmm... A descendent of old Nine-Tails, perhaps? It would seem he's doing quite well these days. Apollo: Yeah, he's a huge hit from kids all the way up to their grandparents. Tenma: Hrmmm... It seems I've been resting on my laurels for far too long. It is time I, too, debut in the mortal world and rekindle my struggle against that wily fox. Athena: That's the spirit! You can make your debut as soon as we get you that not-guilty verdict! Tenma: Then I had best return to top form! Pushups and sit-ups should do for now. Caw caw-caw! Apollo: (Is he planning a new career as a pro wrestler?!) Blackmail Letter (after clearing \"What you remembered\" Talk option and correctly presenting Fox and Demon Statue) Tenma: Why this--! This is that accursed blackmail letter that was sent to Damian. Apollo: Apparently, somebody slipped it into the alderman's pocket. We believe someone, probably the killer, stole it from Mayor Tenma's briefcase. You wouldn't happen to know anything about that, would you? Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! You have questions, do you? Very well, ask away, mortal! Anything else Apollo: Umm... I was hoping you'd take a look at this. Tenma: Hrmmm... An offering to me. Quite admirable. But the best thing you could offer me is to win me my freedom! Caw caw-caw-caw! Apollo: R-Right, right... I'll do my best! After clearing \"Blackmail letter\" Talk option in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: April 18Nine-Tails Vale - Yokai Lane Apollo: Hey, isn't that...? Jinxie: Grrr. You dare imprison me? Athena: Jinxie! She's... acting really strange. Jinxie: That loathsome, no-good Nine-Tailed Fox. He shall know the terror that is mine and despair. Grrr... Grrr. You shall pay. Oh, you shall pay dearly! ......All of you! Apollo: J-Jinxie, are you all right? Jinxie: ! Eeeeeek! Apollo: Aaaah! Jinxie: Oh! Is that you, Mr. Demon Lawyer? Apollo: ...Morning, Jinxie. Jinxie: Morning? Isn't it already past noon? And what am I doing here? Last I remember, I lay down to take a nap back at the manor. ......Oh, no! It must've been the Makuragaeshi! Apollo: Makura... gaeshi? Jinxie: Ever wake after a restless night's sleep to find your pillow in an unusual place... ...or that you've been sleeping on the floor or in the hallway? Well, it's that yokai's fault! The Makuragaeshi preys on people when they're asleep! Apollo: ...It sounds like you just need to be tucked in really tight, or maybe a snug sleeping bag. Athena: Jinxie, how come you don't have any charms on your forehead? Jinxie: I don't? Oh, they must've fallen off. Without them, evil things can creep into me. Apollo: (I'd say we had a more than adequate demonstration of that just now...) Jinxie: I'd better reapply them. Apollo: Jinxie, there's something we wanted to ask you. Jinxie: Ah! There was something I wanted to tell you, too! I... I remembered something else! Apollo: You did? What was it? Talk What you remember Apollo: Jinxie, can you tell us what you remembered? Jinxie: Well, after the trial I remembered lots of stuff. But there was one thing I thought was really weird. Apollo: (I'm almost afraid to ask, but here goes...) Really? What? Jinxie: Um... It's about the yokai feathers and tracks. They weren't there when I first opened the door! Apollo: Wait, whaaat?! Are you sure? Jinxie: Uh-huh. My memory's crystal clear now. Apollo: So, you're saying they were left at the crime scene after you found it? Athena: This could spell major trouble, Apollo. Apollo: Why? Athena: Because Jinxie is already accused of leaving the feathers and tracks at the scene. If they weren't there when she discovered the crime scene... ...it will totally fuel the claim that she fabricated the evidence later on. Apollo: Ack! Athena: Jinxie's fuzzy memory of the whole incident is really working against us. The prosecution will probably say she doesn't remember planting the evidence. Good luck rebutting that! Apollo: Oh, man, this is not good. (I sure hope she didn't plant the evidence while she was sleepwalking or something...) The Forbidden Chamber Apollo: Jinxie, you wouldn't happen to know how to open the Forbidden Chamber, would you? That door doesn't even have a keyhole. Jinxie: Well, it's supposed to have a secret mechanism. They say you have to figure it out before the keyhole will appear. Apollo: A secret mechanism?! Really? Jinxie: Uh-huh. It's hidden in the Fox Chamber. But only Alderman Kyubi knew what it was, and how it worked. Apollo: The alderman of Nine-Tails Vale sure loved his secrets. (Changed from [The alderman of Nine-Tails Vail [sic] sure loved his secrets.] in the original release) Athena: Apollo, let's go see if we can find that secret mechanism! Apollo: Whoa, slow down! There's something else I need to ask about. Jinxie, is there only one key to the Forbidden Chamber? Jinxie: Uh-huh. Even the manor's master key won't open it. That's because it's a very special room... that must never be opened. Apollo: Guess that means nobody entered the Forbidden Chamber after the murder. After all, we know Mayor Tenma took the key from the killer and swallowed it, so... Athena: So the mayor's efforts to keep the killer out of the Forbidden Chamber... ...were not in vain!

But the two yokai are fighting. Jinxie: Fighting? Oh, I see what you mean! The cup portion is missing. This statue... ...originally depicted the two yokai holding up a cup in celebration. But it sure doesn't look that way now, does it? Apollo: Maybe it broke when it was used to hit Mayor Tenma on the head. Jinxie: That would explain it. I guess the only two people who knew what it really looked like were the alderman and I. Now it's just me, but its symbol of goodwill will be forever etched in my mind!

Apollo: Detective Fulbright! What are you doing here? Fulbright: I have business with this young lady, if you must know. Prosecutor Blackquill has asked me to question her. Jinxie: Question me? ...Sorry, not interested. Apollo: Are you here to ask about that whole yokai affair? Fulbright: That's right. Specifically, we want to ask-- Ah, but I can't tell you that, now can I? Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Athena: Oh, come on, please? We're partners in justice, right? Fulbright: No no, Prosecutor Blackquill specifically told me, my questions were of the utmost justice. I will not fall for your lies! In justice we trust! Apollo: The Twisted Samurai sure has him on a short leash. Jinxie: So you're not a ghost? Maybe some sort of urban troll, then? Fulbright: Now, come along, Ms. Tenma. To the station with you! Athena: He took her away. Apollo: (Missed my chance to see what she was lying about.) Athena: Well, at least we found out there's a secret mechanism for opening the chamber! Let's go check it out! Apollo: I just hope they let us in now. April 18Kyubi Manor - Garden L'Belle: Oh, what an absolutely FABULOUS scent! I'm SO glad I had these carnations imported from England. Nothing but the FINEST will do. Perhaps I should place one aside for our DEARLY departed alderman. Athena: Hey, it's Mr. L'Belle! Apollo, let's ask him about you-know-what! Apollo: (Oh yeah, before we search the Fox Chamber we should ask about the blackmail letter.) L'Belle: Why, if it isn't the mayor's little lawyers. What do YOU want with ME? Apollo: Oh, um, there's something we wanted to ask... (Where's that ringing coming from?) L'Belle: You'll HAVE to excuse me. ...Hello? L'Belle here. Apollo: What the--?! (Those things on his shoulders are cell phones?!) L'Belle: ...Yes, about that. You MUST forgive me! This WHOLE matter with Mayor Tenma has been a COMPLETE nightmare. Athena: ......Where do you buy clothes like that? L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Surprised? This is my OWN special design. It's the ULTIMATE in functional beauty. Apollo: Functional beauty? Are you sure about that? Looks a bit unwieldy to me. Ack! L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! You simply don't have an eye for beauty. Apollo: (...If having an eye for beauty means looking like this guy, I'd rather be blind.) L'Belle: So, what DO you want with ME? Talk Did you see Tenma Taro? Apollo: Both Jinxie and Mr. Filch said they saw Tenma Taro. But what about you, Mr. L'Belle? If you were there in the foyer, why didn't you see-- Ack! L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Very well, I ADMIT it. That's right! I, Florent L'Belle, SAW the demon Tenma Taro! Apollo: Hmm... (So he did see something.) Then why did you lie about not seeing him? L'Belle: I was SIMPLY trying to protect dear little Jinxie. Apollo: Protect Jinxie? What do you mean? L'Belle: Why, don't TELL me you haven't heard of that strange little HABIT of hers? Apollo: Which one are we talking about...? L'Belle: The ONE where she wanders around making mischief without knowing WHAT she's doing! Rumor has it she's possessed by Tenma Taro. Apollo: That one's new to me. L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Well, THERE you have it! Anytime you HEAR about a Tenma Taro sighting... ...little Jinxie should be your PRIME suspect. Athena: Tell us more about that rumor! Rumor about Jinxie (appears after \"Did you see Tenma Taro?\") Apollo: So, what was that rumor about Jinxie? L'Belle: They say she's possessed. Not ALL the time, of course. It hits suddenly, then she starts WANDERING around doing strange THINGS. Apollo: I-Is that so...? (Although, come to think of it...) Jinxie: That loathsome, no-good Nine-Tailed Fox. He shall know the terror that is mine and despair. Apollo: (That certainly would explain how she was acting earlier.) L'Belle: Once, she EVEN put on a Tenma Taro costume and wandered around the woods at night. Apollo: She did? Anime cutscene Jinxie: Beware you who sealed me away! Apollo: (Ugh. I wish I'd never asked.) Athena: Does she remember anything while she's possessed? L'Belle: Unfortunately, no. She doesn't seem to remember a THING during these EPISODES. Athena: Memory loss during possession... Hmm... L'Belle: Come to think of it, her MEMORY of the MURDER scene was QUITE fuzzy. I suppose THAT, too, was caused by her possession. Apollo: .........Ah! Then maybe-- L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! So you DO understand! That whole yokai business was ENTIRELY of her own making! Apollo: Now wait a minute! (Although... that yokai evidence wasn't there until after she discovered the crime scene... Did she leave those black feathers and strange tracks there herself?) Athena: Apollo, let's ask Mayor Tenma about Jinxie's episodes the next time we talk with him! Present Jinxie's Statement Apollo: Jinxie thinks she saw Tenma Taro near the scene of the crime. L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! That little dear is ALWAYS talking such nonsense. After all, she's ALWAYS calling you a red demon, is she not? Apollo: Gngh! L'Belle: Plus, she has the nerve to call ME of all people a yokai! She even has a name for me: Baron Powder Face! Pffft! I've NEVER been so insulted! Apollo: (How could anyone look at him and NOT think monster?) L'Belle: Now, if she had named me the BEAUTIFUL Baron Powder Face, I could've forgiven her. Apollo: Wait, THAT's your sticking point?! Blackmail Letter L'Belle: WHAT is THAT? Apollo: It's the blackmail letter, but it wasn't sent to Alderman Kyubi. It was sent to Mayor Tenma. L'Belle: AND? ......Your point BEING? Apollo: Someone took the letter from the mayor's briefcase... ...and then placed it in the alderman's pocket after he was murdered. L'Belle: Oh, you don't say... Apollo: You wouldn't happen to be the one who made the switch, would you? After all, you're the only one who knew that the blackmail letter was in his briefcase... ...so, naturally, you-- Ack! L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! PERHAPS that shot of cologne will MAKE those scales FALL from your eyes! Apollo: Or my eyes fall from their sockets. L'Belle: Is it possible that you would like to FRAME me as a potential SUSPECT? What would MAKE you raise such an OUTRAGEOUS allegation in the first place? Apollo: Oh, uh, well... L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! My ONLY crime is being born as BEAUTIFUL as you see here! In other words, YOU have NOTHING! Now, let me show you what to DO with this garbage! Apollo: Ahhh! You can't destroy evidence like that! L'Belle: What do you mean I CAN'T? I just DID, ah ha ha ha! Feel a little lighter now? Apollo: (You've just won a one-way trip to the top of my \"most annoying people ever\" list, buddy.) After clearing \"Rumor about Jinxie\" Talk option and presenting Blackmail Letter: L'Belle: Are we done with your SILLY questions now? I'm a VERY busy man, you know. Apollo: *sigh* (I guess that's it for now.) L'Belle: Hello, L'Belle speaking! ...Really? You wish to carry MY new product at YOUR store? Oh, but I'm afraid it's my own PRIVATE brand. It's NOT available to the public. ...What? Then I shouldn't advertise it on TV? But I DON'T understand. As THE embodiment of beauty, it is my duty to announce my good looks to the world! Apollo: ......... (Stop the bus. I'm getting off.) L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! EVERYONE wants my EXCLUSIVE \"Je suis L'Belle!\" brand products! It's the crown jewel of MY collection, born of my LONG, RELENTLESS pursuit of beauty! But now that it's become SO popular, it's been an ABSOLUTE nightmare! Apollo: You don't say. L'Belle: Well, they CAN'T have it! It's just for ME! It's not meant for you PEASANTS. Apollo: Peasants? L'Belle: This is my LATEST product! I'm calling it \"Couleur Me L'Belle!\" A DAZZLING hair color that you can wash out with just water! Apollo: (Guess that means you can't sweat.) L'Belle: I have SEVEN colors in all. You can find out more in my commercials and magazine ads. Apollo: (...Yet, it's not available to the public? Great sales strategy there, genius.) Athena: Come to think of it, Mr. L'Belle... ...your hair color's changed since the last time we met. L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! The little lady has QUITE the discerning eye! Here's a little sample. Consider it a gift for one who TRULY appreciates beauty. Athena: Oh, uh... Apollo, what should I do? Apollo: Better take it before you get a face full of cologne. Athena: Good point. ...Wow, thanks, Mr. L'Belle. Couleur Me L'Belle! added to the Court Record. Athena: Okay, let's head over to the Fox Chamber. Apollo: We've still gotta find the secret mechanism for opening the Forbidden Chamber. Present Couleur Me L'Belle! L'Belle: Dazzling hair color that you can wash out with water. Isn't it magnificent? Athena: What if you start to sweat? Won't that wash the color out, too? L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! I assure you, Florent L'Belle, embodiment of beauty, does NOT sweat! Apollo: Then what about rain? Even if you don't sweat, you never know when it might-- Ack! L'Belle: Pffft! Peasants like YOU fail to GRASP the truth. Rain and other forces of nature draw back in awe of my beauty! Apollo: (Sure they're not being repelled back by your narcissism?) Before clearing all Talk options and presenting Blackmail Letter in Kyubi Manor - Garden: April 18Kyubi Manor - Fox Chamber Policeman: Hey, we're trying to conduct an investigation here! Come back later once we're done. Apollo: *sigh* (Oh, well. Guess we'll have to find a way to kill some time.) Athena: Let's go talk to Mr. L'Belle while we wait. Apollo: Okay, there was something I wanted to ask him, anyway. Policeman: If you're looking for Mayor Tenma's aide, I saw him in the garden earlier. We won't be here much longer. Go keep that narcissist company in the meantime. Apollo: *sigh* After clearing all Talk options and presenting Blackmail Letter in Kyubi Manor - Garden: April 18Kyubi Manor - Fox Chamber Apollo: Okay, let's find that secret mechanism for opening the Forbidden Chamber. Athena: Ooh, this is so exciting! I can't wait to see how it works! But do you really think the killer entered the Forbidden Chamber? Apollo: We'll just have to open it to find out. Athena: We should also see if there was anywhere the killer could've hid in this room! Okay, let's get started. ¡Apúrate, Apollo, Apúrate! Examine Forbidden Chamber door Apollo: Still no keyhole, huh. Athena: Yeah, and the door won't budge, just like those spiky bangs of yours. Apollo: Well, all it takes is some water, but I don't think that would work on the door. Athena: Oh, I know! I'll break it down with a body slam! Apollo: Ha ha ha. I seriously doubt you could do that. Athena: Tsk, how do you know if I haven't even tried?! Apollo: No, wait, don't! Athena: Aaaagh... Apollo: (As much as you hate losing, Athena, I think the door would win this match...) Table Athena: Maybe the killer hid under this table! Apollo: That would be a terrible hiding place. The alderman's body would've been right above. Athena: Hmm, maybe you're right. Guess the underside is a bit... Wait, there's something under the table. Apollo: Let's check it out. Lustrous cup Apollo: Hey, look! There's something down here! Athena: It looks like a piece of something. Only question is, a piece of what? Apollo: Hmm... Oh, I know! It might be a piece of this statue. Remember what Jinxie said? The statue originally depicted two yokai holding up a cup. It was a symbol of goodwill. Athena: So, this piece broke off and rolled under the table? Fox and Demon Statue updated in the Court Record. Lustrous cup (subsequent times) Apollo: What have we here... It's the piece that broke off of this statue. Athena: You think it broke off when the mayor was clobbered on the head? Apollo: I'd say that's the most likely explanation. Fox statues Apollo: There's a carving of the Nine-Tailed Fox over the door and statues of him on either side. The way those two statues are glaring, it's like they're guarding the door from us. Come to think of it, there are two foxes on the folding screen as well. It can't be a coincidence, can it...? Athena: Hey, this statue moves! Apollo: Don't get carried away, now. I mean, who knows? It might trigger a trap. Athena: Heh heh. I can handle it. If a spear comes shooting my way, I'll snatch it out of the air! After all, I have the reflexes of a regular karate kid! Apollo: (I guess if you can catch something that fast out of mid-air, you can accomplish anything. Still... There might be something to the fact that these fox statues rotate. Maybe there's something around here that shows the position they should be in.) Feathers and tracks Athena: Look at all these feathers... Apollo: ...And bloody tracks, too. Athena: Then we have Jinxie and Mr. Filch's eyewitness reports... Apollo: ...And a newspaper photo. Athena: Our yokai's definitely not the shy type, that's for sure! Apollo: (This is bad! Mayor Tenma is scary enough without people thinking he's a yokai!) Overturned chair Apollo: I don't think we'll find anything else on this chair. Right Fox Chamber door Athena: I just remembered this mystery novel I once read. The murder occurred in a locked room... ...and the perpetrator made sure to hide behind the room's door when it was opened. Then, when no one was looking, he made his escape. Apollo: A clever trick, but it would've been impossible in this case. See this broken tanuki statue here? The door must've banged into it when it was opened. Athena: Oh, I get it. The killer couldn't have been there because of the statue. Left Fox Chamber door Apollo: Better take a look behind this door, too... Oh, look. The doorknob banged into the wall. Made a big dent, too. That wouldn't have happened if the killer had been hiding there. Athena: Right... I guess that rules out the old hide-behind-the-door trick. Air vent Athena: There really is no escaping here through the air duct. Apollo: And here we went through all the trouble of bringing a ladder to check it out. Athena: That's not a ladder, Apollo. It's a stepladder. Apollo: What's the difference? They both have the word ladder in them. Athena: What's the difference...? ............ Oh, I know! Let's play rock, paper, scissors to decide who's right! Apollo: You're way too competitive. And it's not even related to the original issue, either! Window Apollo: There's a cliff outside this window. Makes it pretty impossible to get out this way. Athena: When I hear things like that, it just makes me want to try! Never say never, right? I bet I could get out this way. Hrrrgh! Apollo: No, wait! Do you have a death wish or something?! Athena: Tsk, it won't even open wide enough for me to squeeze through! Guess I lost that bet. Apollo: That loss just saved your life. Statue next to armchair Athena: This statue originally depicted the two yokai holding up a cup in a gesture of goodwill. Apollo: Maybe Alderman Kyubi was planning on smoothing things over with Mayor Tenma. Athena: But he was murdered instead... ...by somebody who intervened. Apollo: The mayor was only pursuing the municipal merger because he'd been blackmailed. Who knows? If this murder hadn't occurred, maybe they could've come up with a solution. Front of folding screen Apollo: Two foxes standing back to back are depicted on this elegant folding screen. Could this have something to do with the keyhole? Hmm... Wait a minute... Two foxes... There are two fox statues in front of the Forbidden Chamber as well. Athena: Maybe the keyhole will appear if we do something to this folding screen. Hmm... But I don't see anything unusual about it. Apollo: Well, it does have two foxes on it, and there are two fox statues in front of the door. Athena: Then maybe there's a clue somewhere in this room. Let's turn the whole place upside down! Apollo: (She's as excited as a kid in a candy store.) After examining front of folding screen, lustrous cup, Forbidden Chamber door, and fox statues: Athena: Well, I can't think of anywhere else to look. You find anything, Apollo? We'll never find the keyhole to the Forbidden Chamber at this rate. Apollo: There's something about that folding screen. You know how those fox statues in front of the Forbidden Chamber move? That screen might be a clue as to how we're supposed to position them or something. Athena: Hey, I bet you're right! Let's go over that screen with a fine-toothed comb! Examine Front of folding screen Leads to: \"On closer inspection...\" Apollo: On closer inspection... ...I think there's more to this screen than meets the eye. Athena: Let's check every last inch of it! Apollo: I can rotate the folding screen with [right analog stick / arrow keys]. (Changed from [Tap and slide on the bottom screen to rotate the folding screen.] in the original release) And if I spot anything of interest, I can press [A / Space] on it to inspect it further. (Changed from [I can also tap on something of interest to inspect it further.] in the original release) Athena: You can also zoom in and out with [X / B] and [B / M] to get a better look. (Changed from [You can also zoom in and out to get a better look.] in the original release) Now, let's check every last inch of it! Examine front side Apollo: Hey, doesn't it look like the picture here has been cut off on both ends? Athena: Hmm, now that you mention it... Apollo: It looks like there are supposed to be doors on both ends, but they're cut in half. Athena: Maybe those doors symbolize the Forbidden Chamber's door. Apollo: Yeah... It definitely feels like something significant, but the question is, what? Examine keyhole pictures on back (before examining key pictures on back) Apollo: What's this? Looks like a keyhole or something. Athena: You think it could be the keyhole to the Forbidden Chamber? Apollo: No, it's just a picture. Athena: Still, you know what they say: a picture's worth a thousand words. Examine keyhole pictures on back (after examining key pictures on back) Apollo: What's this? Looks like a keyhole or something. Athena: You think it could be the keyhole to the Forbidden Chamber? Apollo: Wait, what about that key drawn on the end of the screen? You think the two are related? Leads to: \"A key and a keyhole? Ooh, I just got an idea!\" Examine key pictures on back (before examining keyhole pictures on back) Apollo: It's a picture of a key. Hmm, that shape looks awfully familiar. Oh, I know! It's shaped like the Forbidden Chamber's key. Athena: Hmm... We're definitely getting warmer... Apollo: Okay, let's take an ever closer look. Examine key pictures on back (after examining keyhole pictures on back) Apollo: It's a picture of a key. Hmm, that shape looks awfully familiar. Oh, I know! It's shaped like the Forbidden Chamber's key. Hmm... Wait! What about that keyhole drawn on the center of the screen? You think the two are related? Leads to: \"A key and a keyhole? Ooh, I just got an idea!\" Athena: A key and a keyhole? Ooh, I just got an idea! If we folded the screen up just right, the key and keyhole should overlap! Apollo: Hey, I think you're right! Athena: Let's give it a try! Apollo: Look, a door! Athena: Yeah, and it's open, too! Apollo: The two foxes are now facing each other, so... Hey, what if we made those fox statues face each other?! Athena: Apollo! Let's go check out the two statues! Apollo: Okay! Help me move the two statues so they face each other -- just like on the screen. Look! A lock appeared! Athena: Now we can use that key! Apollo: Okay, here goes nothing! Apollo: ...It worked! Athena: Time to see why this chamber's so forbidden! Apollo: What secrets could it hold, I wonder...? April 18Kyubi Manor - Forbidden Chamber *creeeeeeeeeak* *thud* Apollo: These doors need some serious oil. Athena: Aaah! That was like nails on a chalkboard! Apollo: Oh, right. Forgot about those super good ears of yours. Look, more feathers... Athena: Eeeeeeeeeeeek! Apollo: What the heck is that...? ...Is that a Tenma Taro... statue? But there's... something odd about it. Athena: Ugh... All I know is I don't like it, but I can't explain why. Apollo: You okay, Athena? You look kinda pale. You're not scared, are you? Athena: What, of this thing? Don't make me laugh, heh heh. Apollo: Really? ......Hey, look! Athena: Wh-What?! What is it?! Apollo: Over there on the left. There's a bunch of staves on that rack. (Changed from [Over there on the left. There's a bunch of staffs on that rack.] in the original release) They kinda look like the staff we saw earlier... Athena: You mean the one Jinxie said she saw Tenma Taro carrying? Apollo: Yeah. I bet our Tenma Taro impersonator really did come in here at some point. Athena: Well? What are we waiting for? Let's search the place! Examine Tenma Taro statue Apollo: Whoa, that's one big statue. Must be something like fifteen feet tall. And look! THIS Tenma Taro has a staff! But the Tenma Taro in the scroll didn't have one. Athena: Hmm... I wonder why. Apollo: I feel like this could be significant, but why...? Let's take a closer look. First, to go around this table here... Athena: Ah! Apollo, are you sure that's a good idea? Apollo: Hey, it looks like there's some sort of compartment in the base of the statue. Athena: Don't open it! Who knows what might be in there! Apollo: It's just a big empty compartment. And from all the dust and cobwebs... ...I'd say it hasn't been opened in a really long time. Athena: That's enough, Apollo. Let's shut it and-- Apollo: Wait, there IS something in here! Looks like some sort of figure. But it's so dusty, I can't tell what it's supposed to be. Wonder what it's doing here. Forbidden Chamber Figure added to the Court Record. Tenma Taro statue (subsequent times) Athena: This statue's probably twice as tall as Prosecutor Blackquill. Apollo: (Yeah, and he towers over me as it is.) Athena: It's like if you took something really scary, like a spider, and made it fifteen feet tall. Apollo: A fifteen-foot tall spider?! Athena: What? I was just exaggerating for dramatic effect. Apollo: Well, Prosecutor Blackquill may be scary, but a fifteen-foot spider is utterly terrifying! Scroll Apollo: Looks like an old scroll... and there's something drawn on it! Unless I'm mistaken, it looks like an old guy... Some sort of monk, maybe? Athena: A monk? What are you talking about? Apollo: You know, people that take walks in the mountains as a form of spiritual training... Athena: Wouldn't that just be a hiker? Apollo: The guy in this picture doesn't look like he's doing it for fun, Athena. Athena: Hmm... Oh look, there's some yellow... thing strapped to his back. Apollo: Whoa! It's turning into Tenma Taro! Athena: What's this scroll getting at? Is this how Tenma Taro was born? Apollo: Well, whatever it is, it's definitely creepy. Scroll (subsequent times) Apollo: The yellow thing the one guy had transformed into Tenma Taro! Athena: Hmm... Or maybe the picture's showing Tenma Taro getting caught in a yokai trap. I bet that yellow thing is a trap to catch the demon before he ravages the entire mountain! Apollo: I highly doubt yokai are things you can catch like a bear or wild boar. Athena: Then maybe that yellow thing is some leftovers that didn't get put in the fridge. They got all gross and moldy and out popped Tenma Taro! Apollo: You have a really active imagination. First off, they probably didn't have fridges back then... ...and second, we'd be swimming in yokai if they spawned that easily. Athena: Okay, Mr. Smarty-Pants, what is it, then? Apollo: Oh, umm... That yellow thing could've been a bomb containing Tenma Taro. And the old guys were terrorists who used yokai to further their cause. Athena: ...Apollo, if I have an active imagination, yours is hyperactive. Feathers Apollo: Black feathers... They looks exactly like the ones in the Fox Chamber. Athena: That means the killer must've been in here at some point. The question is, why? Apollo: Maybe... Maybe the Tenma Taro costume was hidden in here. I mean... ...if someone carried it through the manor, it would've stuck out like a sore thumb. Athena: But when did the killer get in here? The mayor snatched the Forbidden Chamber key when the killer hit him on the head. That means the killer could've only gotten in here before the murder. Apollo: Wow, this is one tough riddle, all right. Lanterns Apollo: A stone lantern... Athena: Like those Japanese garden lamps? Where's the switch? Apollo: Lamps like these are lit by fire not electricity, so there is no switch. Athena: Oh, here it is! Apollo: Whaaat?! Athena: It was hidden out of sight. Apollo: ...I see Tenma Taro's cell has been outfitted with all the amenities a yokai could want. Air vent Apollo: Oh, look. There's an air vent here, too. Athena: I guess even forbidden chambers need proper ventilation. Apollo: Hmm... But I don't think anyone could reach this one, either. Athena: Yeah, and there's nothing to stand on around here. I wonder where this vent leads. Apollo: Well, the Fox Chamber's vent didn't branch this way, so... Athena: Maybe it doesn't have anything to do with this case, after all. Staves Apollo: Hey, there's a bunch of staves here. And it looks like one's missing. The Tenma Taro Jinxie saw must've taken it. Athena: I'd have to agree. These look like the one Detective Fulbright showed us. Apollo: Why do you think there are so many here? Athena: Maybe they're spares. Tenma Taro might be, you know, absent-minded or something. But the fact that he has spare staves handy, well... ...it shows that he's aware of his faults, and is trying to deal with them. Or at least that's my take on it. Apollo: (Maybe this will remind her to deal with her own faults. But I won't hold my breath.) Staves (subsequent times) Athena: These look like the staff Detective Fulbright showed us. Apollo: That must mean that the Tenma Taro Jinxie saw... ...took this staff from here. I wonder what all these staves are doing here in the first place. Gravestone Apollo: Looks like a gravestone or something. Athena: It reads, \"Here lies Tenma Taro, Age 80. Cause of death: Choked on a chicken bone.\" Apollo: *gasp!* Say it ain't so! ...Besides, that sounds more like an autopsy report than an epitaph, if you ask me. Wait, you're joking around because you're scared! It's your coping mechanism! Athena: I'm n-not scared! Widget: Freak-out central! Right here, baby! Athena: Cut it out, Widget! Apollo: (Denial is strong in this one.) Cream bottle on floor Apollo: What's this? Whatever it is, the packaging is really gaudy. And the fact that there's no dust on it means it hasn't been here very long. Athena: Oh! It's hand cream. Let's see what brand it is......... \"Je suis L'Belle!\"?! Apollo: L'Belle?! (What the--?!) But then, wouldn't that mean Mr. L'Belle was here? Athena: I guess so... but why? Apollo: Well, whoever was dressed up like Tenma Taro... ...must have taken a staff from here in the Forbidden Chamber. And that same person probably dropped this hand cream at that time. Athena: In other words, the Tenma Taro impersonator we're looking for is none other than... Apollo: ...Florent L'Belle! This might be a big break for us in court tomorrow. Athena: Now all we have to do is get the truth out of Mayor Tenma! Hand Cream added to the Court Record. Cream bottle on floor (subsequent times) Apollo: Mr. L'Belle's private brand of hand cream. He must've been here in the Forbidden Chamber at some point. Athena: This could be the big break we need. After examining Tenma Taro statue, scroll, feathers, air vent, staves, and cream bottle on floor: Athena: Guess that about wraps it up. What now? Apollo: We should probably talk to some of the witnesses again. Athena: You mean like Mr. Filch... and Jinxie? Apollo: Yeah. I really want to ask Mr. Filch about the village superstitions and Tenma Taro. Talk Any ideas? Apollo: Any good ideas yet, Athena? Athena: Good ideas? You bet I do! Umm... Well, there's that thing. Apollo: Thing? What thing? ............ Athena: ............ Ugh, you saw right through me, didn't you?! Apollo: Huh? You mean you really have nothing for me? Athena: No, sorry! I just got a little carried away! Apollo: (Oh, boy. Bluffing is obviously not her strength.) The real culprit Apollo: Seems we finally have the real killer in our sights. The only person to threaten Mayor Tenma, push for the municipal merger... Athena: ...And to be identified at the manor disguised as Tenma Taro... ...is none other than Mayor Tenma's aide, Florent L'Belle! We're in for a fight tomorrow! Let's banish Tenma Taro, both literally and figuratively! Apollo: Yeah! We'll be fine between the two of us! We'll send that yokai packing, along with that twisted samurai of a prosecutor! Widget: Let's do this! Wright Anything Agency Talk Any ideas? Trucy: I was shocked to hear a demon appeared at your trial. Apollo: You were shocked? I was the one questioning him! Trucy: Wish you would've called me in. Apollo: Really? You would've come to my rescue? Trucy: With a demon like that, your tightrope-style of defense... and my magic tricks, we would've had it all. We could've been The Three Great Illusions! The audience would've been in the palm of our hand! Apollo: I'd settle for convincing the judge with some solid evidence. What to do Trucy: It's everyone's favorite, Trucy's Two Cents! Go ahead, ask me anything! Apollo: My client has turned into a demon. I don't know what he's thinking, and I have no idea what to do. Trucy: Hmm, I think this calls for... placing yourself in the other person's shoes. In other words, think of what it's like to be a demon. That should be easy for you, Polly! Apollo: Right... Okay, here goes......... Jinxie: Eeeeeek! A red demon! Apollo: Aaaaaaugh! Jinxie: Return to the black pit from whence you were spawned! Apollo: It ain't easy being a demon, that's for sure. Trucy: Hm? Fox Chamber Examine Fox statues Apollo: So, the fox statues are part of the keyhole mechanism. Athena: Let's try moving them around. Maybe something will happen! Apollo: But what if it's a trap. Who knows? The ceiling might come crashing down. Athena: Oh, will you relax? If it comes to that, I'll just dash out of the way! Apollo: Yeah, but what about me?! Folding screen Apollo: I would've never guessed the screen was the clue to the keyhole mechanism. That alderman sure was an interesting guy. Athena: I'll say! Makes me want to implement a secret locking mechanism into the office door! Apollo: What, are you planning to turn it into a Forbidden Chamber II or something? Athena: If I were, I'd need a demon to imprison... Apollo: Ha ha, very funny. But no, I'm not going to imprison myself. April 18Kyubi Manor - Foyer Filch: It's the curse, the curse! The curse of Tenma Taro! Athena: Eek! Filch: You outsiders are ignoring them superstitions at OUR peril! Mind yer own business, will ya?! Apollo: Aagh! Youch! What's all this about a curse? Filch: Tenma Taro's gonna curse us all 'less ya stop sticking yer nose where it don't belong! Stop the investigation! Listen to what them superstitions say! Athena: Right... Umm... How about obeying the law... before you go obeying the superstitions? Filch: Huh? Athena: Hey, what are you doing with Widget around your neck? He's mine! You know better than to go around stealing people's stuff like that! Apollo: The same goes for my bracelet! Filch: S-S-Sorry, sorry! I promise I won't do it again! Athena: Tsk, he almost kidnapped my sweet, little Widget. Widget: The big jerk! Filch: I'm sorrrryyyy! Apollo: *sigh* I guess you can't teach an old raccoon dog new tricks. (As long as we have him here, I guess we should ask him about what happened.) Talk Stealing Athena: I can't believe you did that! It's one thing to steal a pair of shoes, but to steal Widget! Widget: Grrr! Filch: Yiiipes! Mercy, mercy! I can't seem to control myself! It's that thieving blood running in my veins! Apollo: Thieving blood? What's that supposed to mean? Filch: Eh heh heh. Glad ya asked. The infamous bandit Azuki Kozo was my grandpappy! Take a gander at this! Apollo: What exactly am I looking at? Looks like another one of those yokai to me. Filch: It's none other than THE Azuki Kozo! Robbed from the rich to give to the poor, he did! And he'd leave one o' these figures at the scene of the crime! What's more, I'm his grandson 'cause he was my grandpappy! Apollo: Wow, you don't say! Filch: Thieves' honor, it's the honest truth! Ah... The sloshing sound of azuki beans scrapping together in the dead o' night... It's the magical sound of dirty money getting washed clean for givin' out to the poor! I'm Azuki Kozo, washer of money, giver-outer of wealth, reborn! Athena: ......... Forget the money. You should be washing yourself of this nasty habit. Apollo: (Wait a second. This figure looks familiar.) Yes! It looks just like that old, dusty figure we found in the Forbidden Chamber. Forbidden Chamber Figure updated in the Court Record. Filch: Hey! Whaddaya doing with that there figure?! Apollo: Oh, this? We found it in the Forbidden Chamber. Looks like it'd been there practically forever. Filch: Hmm... Could mean my grandpappy broke into the Forbidden Chamber way back. Hey, that reminds me. He once told me there's treasure in that there chamber! Apollo: Treasure? Forbidden Chamber Treasure (appears after \"Stealing\") Apollo: What do you know about the treasure in the Forbidden Chamber? Filch: Eh heh heh. Only that it's the greatest get-rich-quick chance in the universe. Grandpappy told me all about it. Said there's an amazing treasure in there! Apollo: There's something amazing in there? (Didn't see anything like that, though.) Your grandfather didn't, by chance, already steal it, did he? Filch: Seein' how there was one o' his figures in there, that just might be. Eh heh heh, that's Grandpappy for ya! Bet he washed that treasure up real good before handing it out to the poor. Apollo: Oh, of course, because he was so righteous... Tenma Taro sighting Apollo: In court, you mentioned seeing Tenma Taro near the scene of the crime. Filch: Sorry I didn't come clean right away, but them superstitions got the better o' me. Apollo: The people of Nine-Tails Vale sure seem like a superstitious bunch. I'm not surprised you wouldn't want to talk about seeing Tenma Taro. Filch: Darn right! Them superstitions scare me outta my wits, I tell you! That's why I'm gonna do exactly what they say from now on. Apollo: So you plan on staying here in Nine-Tails Vale? Filch: Yep. I'm gonna keep living right here 'n' keep with the old ways, just like Grandpappy did. Them superstitions are like a rulebook to me. Apollo: Wait, so you're saying you actually believe in those old wives' tales? Filch: Ain't you been listening to a word I said? Apollo: You're going to do \"exactly what them superstitions say\"? Well, I say that's baloney. Present Village Superstitions Apollo: Leads to: \"It's clearly written right here: \"Ignoring the superstitions will cost you your soul.\"\" Present anything else Apollo: Filch: ............Say, Mr. Lawyer, sir... Apollo: Yeah? Filch: I don't have much school learnin', but I ain't no dummy. That there ain't got nothing to do with me. But I'd be happy to take it off yer hands if ya wanted, eh heh heh heh. Apollo: I don't think so. (Let's try that one again.) I heard every word of what you had to say... ...but I don't believe them for a second. Leads back to: \"You're going to do \"exactly what them superstitions say\"? Well, I say that's baloney.\" Apollo: It's clearly written right here: \"Ignoring the superstitions will cost you your soul. There is, however, one way to save it: your immediate departure from the village.\" Filch: ...Ah. Apollo: So according to this, you shouldn't even be here, let along talking with us. You said you plan on staying right here in Nine-Tails Vale. But if you really believe in the superstitions, you would've been long gone by now. Filch: Uwaaah! Apollo: I know you've been lying to me! Time to come clean, Mr. Filch! Filch: Yiiiiiiiiipes! Tenma Taro sighting (second time) Apollo: You were lying about believing in the superstitions, weren't you? Filch: Sorry, but I didn't have no choice. Apollo: So, what was the real reason why you couldn't talk about seeing Tenma Taro? Filch: It's all that pretty boy's fault -- Mr. L'Belle, if ya know what I mean. He told me not to say a word 'bout seeing Tenma Taro. Said if I did, he'd do to me what them superstitions said would happen. Apollo: So, it was Mr. L'Belle who muzzled you? Why would Mr. L'Belle want to scare you into silence? Filch: Mr. L'Belle was trying to protect that little maid gal! It was on account o' that rumor! The one about her being possessed! Apollo: That rumor again... Athena: I guess we really do have to talk to Mayor Tenma about the possession rumor. Apollo: Ouch! Hey, watch it! Village Superstitions stolen by Phineas Filch! Filch: I'll be taking this back now, eh heh heh heh. Kinda like family to me. Apollo: You could've just asked instead of stealing it... Tenma Taro sighting (subsequent times) Apollo: You were lying about believing in the superstitions, weren't you? Filch: Sorry, but I didn't have no choice. Apollo: So, what was the real reason why you couldn't talk about seeing Tenma Taro? Filch: It's all that pretty boy's fault -- Mr. L'Belle, if ya know what I mean. He told me not to say a word 'bout seeing Tenma Taro. Said if I did, he'd do to me what them superstitions said would happen. Apollo: So, it was Mr. L'Belle who muzzled you? Why would Mr. L'Belle want to scare you into silence? Filch: Mr. L'Belle was trying to protect that little maid gal! It was on account o' that rumor! The one about her being possessed! Apollo: That rumor again... Athena: I guess we really do have to talk to Mayor Tenma about the possession rumor. Present Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy Filch: Hey, I know that picture! That's my Amazing Nine-Tails glossy! How dare you steal from me! Apollo: No, this is the one you gave me. Remember? You said you had lots more. Filch: I did? Well, it was never really mine in the first place, so... You can go ahead and keep it. Apollo: (Don't tell me I'm now guilty of receiving stolen goods...) Azuki Kozo Figure Apollo: So, your grandfather was a famous thief? Filch: That's right. He stole for the rich to give to the poor. Just like your Robin Hood. But in these parts, he's known as Azukikozo! He washes his loot clean before handing it out to the poor. Apollo: (It's hard to imagine Mr. Filch has such noble intentions. I bet he was planning on keeping my bracelet for himself.) After clearing all Talk options: Athena: Was that all we wanted to ask Mr. Filch? Apollo: Yeah, I think that was it. Let's go see \"Mr. Tenma Taro\" one more time. (Just thinking about dealing with that yokai again makes me want to say, \"Pass!\") April 18Detention Center - Visitor's Room Athena: Lord Tenma! Your attorneys are here to see you, Your Malevolence! Tenma: ......... Apollo: Umm......... Tenma: .........Why are you speaking like that? Athena: Oh, Mayor Tenma! You've returned...! Tenma: Yes, well, Jinxie came by earlier to apply a new charm to my head. It seems to be suppressing the demon within me. Apollo: That's a relief. Maybe we'll actually get somewhere this time. Tenma: So, what can I do for you today? Apollo: We'd like to ask about the rumor that Jinxie is possessed. Tenma: Ah! Apollo: She allegedly left the yokai evidence at the scene while under a demon's power. At least, that's what the prosecution is going to claim at tomorrow's trial. Tenma: .................. Heh heh heh... Apollo: Huh? Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! No match is this warding charm for me! Apollo: Aagh! Th-The charm! Athena: Tenma Taro's back! Tenma: Those foolish mortals! They shall regret blaming that child for my doings! Apollo: Argh, I blew it! That question brought that yokai back. (And he probably won't drop the act until Jinxie's name is cleared either.) Talk Rumor about Jinxie Apollo: We'd like to ask you about something your aide Florent L'Belle mentioned. Did you know Jinxie is rumored to be possessed? Tenma: I know not of what you speak. Apollo: You're not trying to protect Jinxie, are you? Tenma: I, Tenma Taro, demon lord of the yokai, protect a mere mortal? Caw caw-caw-caw! No affections do I possess for your race of humans. Apollo: Please! We already proved there was a third part disguised as a yokai at the scene. But if you deny that tomorrow, we'll never be able to clear Mayor Tenma's name. Tenma: .........But I have already told you, I know not of what you speak! Athena: I don't think we'll get anything more out of him. Apollo: It's all over unless we can somehow prove that Jinxie didn't plant that yokai evidence. Athena: .........Hey, Apollo? I think I've got this one. I think I can prove that she didn't do it. Apollo: Really? Athena: Sure! I should be able to use psychology to explain that whole possession thing. Apollo: Knock yourself out, then! (Wow, Athena's really something. I can really count on her when it counts!) The real story (appears after \"Rumor about Jinxie\") Athena: Mayor Tenma, Jinxie isn't possessed. I believe her so-called possession episodes are a form of somnambulism. Apollo: Somnambulism? You mean sleepwalking? Athena: Yes, I believe she is exhibiting a rare form of the disorder. It's usually brought on by repressed stress. Mr. Mayor, didn't her symptoms start soon after she began her job in Nine-Tails Vale? Tenma: ...Hrmmm. When the child visited last... ...she did speak of dreading yokai, and how they rob her of sleep each night. Athena: I knew it! That lack of sleep is causing her to enter an unconscious state. And that means she can't be trying to protect you -- at least not on a conscious level. Apollo: So then, the Tenma Taro that was spotted at the manor wasn't Jinxie. Tenma: Sleepwalking, eh? Hrmmm. That would, indeed, explain the matter. Apollo: Look! Tenma Taro's spirit! It's left the mayor's body. Athena: Can you tell us the truth now, Mayor Tenma? Tenma: Very well. It's the least I could do for a superb exorcist such as you. Feathers and tracks (appears after \"The real story\") Leads to: \"Mayor Tenma, you didn't leave those feathers and tracks at the scene, did you?\" Athena: Mayor Tenma, you didn't leave those feathers and tracks at the scene, did you? Tenma: I did not. Neither I nor Jinxie have anything to do with that. That was... the killer's doing, no doubt. Athena: I knew it! Tenma: You suspect Florent is behind all this? But why? Did he really want Nine-Tails Vale that badly? Apollo: Can you think of any reason why? Tenma: Hmm... Looking back, he did seem fixated on Tenma Taro for a spell. Ah! Could it be...?! Perhaps he was... attempting to release Tenma Taro. Apollo: That's crazy! Are you saying that yokai is real? Tenma: Whatever the case, Tenma Taro brings nothing but pain and misfortune. It's as the superstitions warn. You must not gaze upon him nor free him from his prison! Apollo: B-But... (How can people actually believe that?!) Athena: Well, at least we know who's behind this whole Tenma Taro thing now. Apollo: Yeah, and I think we need to have another nice, long chat with Mr. L'Belle. Guard: You d-d-dinner is ready, Your Malevolence! Tenma: Ah, an offering to the demon king. You may place it right there. Guard: The kitchen crew poured their heart and soul into making it. Tenma: Did they now? Souls happen to be a favorite of mine. Just, hold the hearts next time! Caw caw-caw-caw! Guard: Y-Yes, Your Malevolence! I'll remember that! Apollo: (How long is he planning to keep up this yokai charade?) Well, we've already talked to Mr. Filch and Mayor Tenma, so... Why don't we go see Florent L'Belle next? Now that we know the truth... ...he won't be able to claim that the Tenma Taro was Jinxie or the mayor anymore! Athena: But the real question is: how are we going to get him to admit it was him? Detention Center (before clearing \"Taro's true identity\" Talk option in Kyubi Manor - Foyer) Talk Feathers and tracks Athena: Mayor Tenma, you didn't leave those feathers and tracks at the scene, did you? Tenma: I did not. Neither I nor Jinxie have anything to do with that. That was... the killer's doing, no doubt. Athena: I knew it! Tenma: You suspect Florent is behind all this? But why? Did he really want Nine-Tails Vale that badly? Apollo: Can you think of any reason why? Tenma: Hmm... Looking back, he did seem fixated on Tenma Taro for a spell. Ah! Could it be...?! Perhaps he was... attempting to release Tenma Taro. Apollo: That's crazy! Are you saying that yokai is real? Tenma: Whatever the case, Tenma Taro brings nothing but pain and misfortune. It's as the superstitions warn. You must not gaze upon him nor free him from his prison! Apollo: B-But... (How can people actually believe that?!) Athena: Well, at least we know who's behind this whole Tenma Taro thing now. Apollo: Yeah, and I think we need to have another nice, long chat with Mr. L'Belle. April 18Kyubi Manor - Foyer L'Belle: Okay! Now, let's PRACTICE that AGAIN, Filchy! From the top! Filch: Errr... Mr. L'Belle was in the foyer at the time of the crime... ...and when we, uhh... heard a scream, uhh... Aw, heck! What was the next part again? Aaaargh! L'Belle: You have the memory capacity of a FLEA! This is the THIRTIETH TIME, you know! Now, a hundred times more and we're done! Apollo: (What on Earth are they practicing?) Filch: Aww, I ain't cut out for this. ......Whoopsie daisy! L'Belle: Ouuuw! Filch: Oh, begging yer pardon, Mr. L'Belle, sir. It's just, all this practice-- Yipes! L'Belle: Unbelievable! What if you had sullied MY outfit with those GRUBBY paws of yours? Apollo: ......... (Did Filch filch L'Belle's wallet just now...?) Athena: So... what do you think they're up to this time, Apollo? L'Belle: Hm? Oh, it's YOU two. Eavesdropping, are we? Pffft, you peasants are SO tacky. Well, what do YOU want with ME? Apollo: (Your confession to being the Tenma Taro imposter would be nice right about now.) Talk Taro's true identity Leads to: \"Mr. Filch filled me in on a conversation you two had.\" Present Hand Cream Apollo: (Wait, this is our trump card. Better not show it off too soon.) L'Belle: You wanted something? Apollo: Oh, um... No, never mind. L'Belle: Pffft. Apollo: Mr. Filch filled me in on a conversation you two had. And about how you told him not to say a word about seeing Tenma Taro. L'Belle: ......... Filchy, you FOOL! Filch: Yipes! L'Belle: I TOLD you nothing good would come of you RUNNING your mouth! Apollo: So why did you want to keep Mr. Filch quiet like that, Mr. L'Belle? L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Why to PROTECT darling little Jinxie, of course. Apollo: But Jinxie was never really possessed. She was sleepwalking. Being asleep at the time, she couldn't have been consciously trying to protect the mayor. That also means she couldn't have possibly been Tenma Taro. L'Belle: Interesting... But where ARE you going with this? Apollo: ...Since you asked so politely... I believe you have a different reason for trying to keep Mr. Filch quiet. That reason would be to deflect doubt away from the one who was really Tenma Taro. L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha ha ha ha! Now THIS is getting interesting! Are YOU insinuating that I'M Tenma Taro? So SORRY to disappoint, but I'm NOTHING of the sort! Filch: That's right! Mr. L'Belle even told me Tenma Taro was a jinx, so why would he-- Youw-ouw-ouw-ouw-ouw-ouch! L'Belle: I SAID Tenma Taro was JINXIE, you fool! Honestly! You have the memory capacity of a FLEA! Practice it a hundred more times! (Changed from [Honestly! You have the memory capacity of a FLEA! Practice it a hundred times more times [sic]!] in the original release) Filch: Yiiipes! Apollo: So, um, have you been called to testify tomorrow? L'Belle: Yes, and I'm SO looking forward to my COURTROOM debut. But you'll JUST have to wait until then, ah ha ha ha ha! Apollo: (Oh, I'll be waiting -- with a special piece of evidence I've been saving just for you.) L'Belle: FILCHY! Wake up, you lazy bones! Filch: Huh? What? Was I sleeping? *yawn* Musta been that sweet cologne o' yours, Mr. L'Belle. Made me right sleepy, it did. L'Belle: Well, it's TIME for your LESSON on what to do and say tomorrow. Filch: Oh, I'm beggin' ya! Not another lesson! I ain't cut out for this thinkin' and rememberin' stuff! Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh! Right up the schnozzola! L'Belle: Keep quiet and do EXACTLY as I say! Filch: Noooooo! Pleeeaaase! Anything but another lessooooooooon! Athena: There they go... Missed our chance to get the truth out of him. Apollo: Yeah, but we'll get the proof we need in court tomorrow, one way or another! (All that's left now is that lie Jinxie told. We'd better go clear that up before tomorrow.) Athena: You think they're done questioning Jinxie? Apollo: Maybe. Let's see if she's over on Yokai Lane shopping for more charms. April 18Nine-Tails Vale - Yokai Lane Jinxie: Accursed Nine-Tailed Fox! The time for settling the score is nigh! My grudge has but festered over time. At last, vengeance will be mine! Grrr... Grrr... Athena: She must be possessed -- er, sleepwalking again! Apollo: (...Maybe if I speak softly, I won't startle her and get a charm plastered on my forehead.) Pssst... Jinxie? Jinxie: ......Huh?! ......Oh, hello, Mr. Demon Lawyer. Ah! My charms must've fallen off again. Apollo: (Phew... Guess I can avoid a charm slap by toning down my Chords of Steel.) Athena: Are they done questioning you, Jinxie? Jinxie: Uh-huh. And on the way back, I stopped here to buy a new charm that was just released. Apollo: Yeah, which one? Jinxie: Oh, um, the one with the Nine-Tails Fox and Tenma Taro. It shows them dancing together! Apollo: Really?! Two bitter rivals dancing together? Jinxie: Uh-huh. It's a charm for rebuilding burnt bridges! Apollo: Oh, right. For the municipal merger issue. Jinxie: No, it's for the Demon Lawyer and the Insomniac Prosecutor. It'll stop you two from fighting like you did in court this morning. Apollo: We weren't fighting. It was just a spirited debate. It's what we lawyers-- Ack! Jinxie: No fighting. Apollo: *sigh* Charm-slapped again. Athena: Apollo, if you're done playing around, let's find out what she was lying about! Talk What you remember Apollo: Jinxie, it seems like you're starting to remember things. You already said the feathers and tracks weren't there when you discovered the crime. Have you remembered anything else that seems important? Jinxie: Eek! L-Like what? Apollo: Tell us what you saw that day. Maybe you'll remember something else this time. Jinxie: ...Eek! When I opened the door, Papa and Alderman Kyubi were collapsed in the Fox Chamber. That's when Papa told me to call an ambulance and the police. That's all he said before he passed out in the chair. BRACELET THUMPS Apollo: (I knew it... She's holding something back.) Present Bracelet Jinxie: That's all he said before he passed out in his chair. Perceive trembling finger on charm on \"That's all he said\" Apollo: Apollo: You were very nervous when you said, \"That's all he said,\" weren't you? I know because I saw your fingers move as if you were going to slap someone with a charm. Jinxie: Huh?! Apollo: Listen to me, Jinxie. This is very important. Did Mayor Tenma say anything else to you? Jinxie: I-It was... It was nothing. He was just talking in his sleep... Apollo: Talking in his sleep? So you admit that he DID say something else! Jinxie: E-Eeeeeek! How could you tell?! Only... Only a demon could have such powers! Leads back to Talk options Perceive wrong area Apollo: Jinxie: Eek! Apollo: Arrragh! Jinxie: D-Don't shout like that. Nearly scared the wits out of me. Uhh... And d-don't stare at me like that, either. It's creepy... Apollo: (Guess that wasn't right.) Leads back to Talk options What you remember (after perceiving) Leads to: \"Uuuh... Uuuuuuuh...\" Jinxie: Uuuh... Uuuuuuuh... L-Like I said, he was just talking in his sleep! I mean, why else would Papa say something like that! Apollo: Could you be a little more specific? Jinxie: Before he f-fainted, he said... \"Forgive me, Jinxie. I killed Alderman Kyubi.\" Apollo: He said whaaaaaaaaat?! Athena: The mayor actually confessed to the crime?! Jinxie: B-But he didn't mean it. He couldn't possibly have known what he was saying! He was probably possessed or maybe he was in the middle of a nightmare! Apollo: A nightmare? No, THIS is a nightmare...! (This is one statement I wish I'd never heard. What in the world are we going to do now?) Apollo: Return to the basics? Phoenix: That's right. Always believe in your client, no matter what happens. That is a lawyer's greatest and most trusted weapon. Apollo: (Right... Just believe in my client, even if all I can see ahead is darkness and despair.) Athena: Jinxie, does Prosecutor Blackquill know about your father's confession? Jinxie: I didn't mention it when he was questioning me. I mean, there's no way Papa's the killer! Athena: Why would the mayor confess like that? Apollo: Could he really have been dreaming, or simply delirious? Athena: Who knows, but I sure feel like I'M in a living nightmare right now. Apollo, what are we going to do about tomorrow's trial? The crime scene was locked tight until Jinxie arrived, and our client's even confessed! Not only that, Jinxie has been accused of planting the yokai evidence. Both the mayor and Jinxie are going to prison if we don't do something! Apollo: (I know, I know...) Well, let's see here... Our lack of a third party in the locked room is a major problem. Jinxie has testified that when she first opened the door... ...Alderman Kyubi and Mayor Tenma were the only people she saw in the Fox Chamber. Athena: But the real killer must've been hiding in there as well. Apollo: Considering the room was locked tight, that's the only logical explanation. Athena: Our mystery person must've then fled the Fox Chamber when it was opened. And that's when Jinxie saw what she thought was Tenma Taro! Jinxie: B-But... Papa and the alderman were the only people there. I didn't see anyone else. Apollo: (What's going on here? L'Belle's extremely pale, but he's far from transparent. So just how did he hide himself at the scene of the crime?) Athena: Whatever it takes in court tomorrow, Apollo... ...we have to take down that dirty, rotten \"Tenma Taro\" Florent L'Belle! Apollo: Right. We'll get him with a legal exorcism, Justice style! To be continued Nothing to examine during investigation Athena: Apollo, it doesn't look like there's anything particularly interesting here. Examine insignificant area on evidence Apollo: Nothing particularly interesting here. Area already examined Apollo: (We've already searched here, but it never hurts to take another look around.)\n-- In the Fox Chamber --L'Belle: I DID enter the Fox Chamber after the murder.Press Apollo: Apollo: Why in the world would you enter that grisly crime scene? L'Belle: WHY? Because I was WORRIED sick. Mayor Tenma's suit, it... Apollo: It what? L'Belle: It was designed PERSONALLY by me. I was WORRIED my work of art might get blood on it. Apollo: (This man clearly has his priorities in order...) L'Belle: Okay, let's get this over with, SHALL WE? Now, where was I? Oh, yes, so I ENTERED the Fox Chamber almost WITHOUT thinking.L'Belle: But I DIDN'T enter until AFTER Jinxie had heard the confession and left.Press Apollo: Apollo: Why didn't you enter right away? L'Belle: And RUIN my designer shoes? Apollo: Your shoes? L'Belle: Even now, just THINKING about getting blood on my FABULOUS footwear... It sends CHILLS down my spine. That's why I hesitated. Athena: Athena: That's terrible! A man was dying and another injured and you're worried about your shoes?! Blackquill: Blackquill: Need I remind you, this is a court of law. We are not teaching morality here. We have schools of etiquette and such for trivial pursuits. Athena: Gah. Blackquill: Now, you listen to me, you deceptive dandy. Get to the point and be quick about it. L'Belle: ...Yes, well, I WAS there in the Fox Chamber, BUT...L'Belle: I HEARD the mayor groan and hid behind the folding screen there.Press Apollo: Apollo: Wait a second! Why did you hide yourself? L'Belle: Oh, my. So you DO understand! Apollo: I do? L'Belle: By hiding, I was concealing my FABULOUS beauty, which, for the sake of the universe... ...is something I should NEVER EVER do! THAT'S what you were thinking, right? Apollo: (I'm sensing a black hole of egocentricity forming around the witness stand.) Blackquill: We can deliberate his mental process another time. Get on with the testimony. Now! L'Belle: Well, regarding the murder scene...L'Belle: What I saw there up close... It was absolutely HORRIFYING!Press Apollo: Apollo: Could you describe the crime scene in a bit more detail? L'Belle: Hm? And WHAT exactly would you like DETAILS about? Apollo: Well, what I'd like to ask you about is... The feathers and tracks Apollo: What do you remember about the yokai feathers and tracks? L'Belle: They RESULTED when Tenma Taro EXITED the Forbidden Chamber. He came out in QUITE a rush, scattering feathers THIS way and THAT. Apollo: Did you immediately know it was Mr. Filch? L'Belle: I did. And THAT'S why I suggested we cook up our alibis together. Apollo: And how did those practice sessions go? L'Belle: They were NEARLY the death of me. Filchy has to be the WORST STUDENT EVER. Athena: He really doesn't think he's done anything wrong, does he? Judge: Well, Mr. Justice? Do you consider his statement to be of any importance? Apollo: (Is it important?) Very important Apollo: Yes, I believe it is, Your Honor. I request that it be added to the testimony! Adds statement \"The yokai feathers and tracks weren't there before the Fox Chamber was opened.\" or changes statement from \"The Forbidden Chamber was shut tight until the mayor opened it.\" or \"A statue had fallen to the floor. It was a token of goodwill celebrating the municipal merger.\" to \"The yokai feathers and tracks weren't there before the Fox Chamber was opened.\" Not so important Apollo: (It's probably not particularly important.) No, Your Honor. The witness may proceed. L'Belle: All right, then. I would JUST like to add that it was a TERRIBLY grisly scene, as I have described. Leads back to cross-examination The feathers and tracks (after adding statement \"The yokai feathers and tracks weren't there before the Fox Chamber was opened.\") Apollo: What do you remember about the yokai feathers and tracks? L'Belle: They RESULTED when Tenma Taro EXITED the Forbidden Chamber. He came out in QUITE a rush, scattering feathers THIS way and THAT. Apollo: Did you immediately know it was Mr. Filch? L'Belle: I did. And THAT'S why I suggested we cook up our alibis together. Apollo: And how did those practice sessions go? L'Belle: They were NEARLY the death of me. Filchy has to be the WORST STUDENT EVER. Athena: He really doesn't think he's done anything wrong, does he? Apollo: (I've already had him add this statement to his testimony... ...but is there really anything there? Maybe I should try reviewing the evidence.) Leads back to cross-examination The Forbidden Chamber Apollo: Could you please describe the Forbidden Chamber at the time? L'Belle: It was SHUT tight until the MAYOR opened it. Apollo: (He's really trying to stress that it was the mayor who opened the Forbidden Chamber.) Athena: Tsk, that big liar! He opened it himself! Apollo: (Whoa. If looks could kill, L'Belle would be toast!) Judge: Well, Mr. Justice? Do you consider his statement to be of any importance? Apollo: (Is it important?) Very important Apollo: I have a feeling it is. Let's add it to the testimony, just in case. Adds statement \"The Forbidden Chamber was shut tight until the mayor opened it.\" or changes statement from \"The yokai feathers and tracks weren't there before the Fox Chamber was opened.\" or \"A statue had fallen to the floor. It was a token of goodwill celebrating the municipal merger.\" to \"The Forbidden Chamber was shut tight until the mayor opened it.\" Not so important Apollo: (It's probably not particularly important.) No, Your Honor. The witness may proceed. L'Belle: All right, then. I would JUST like to add that it was a TERRIBLY grisly scene, as I have described. Leads back to cross-examination The Forbidden Chamber (after adding statement \"The Forbidden Chamber was shut tight until the mayor opened it.\") Apollo: Could you please describe the Forbidden Chamber at the time?

Apollo: (Whoa. If looks could kill, L'Belle would be toast! I've already had him add this statement to his testimony... ...but is there really anything there? Maybe I should try reviewing the evidence.) Leads back to cross-examination The murder weapon Apollo: Could you describe the state of the weapons that had been used at the scene? L'Belle: The spear had been thrust ALL the way through Alderman Kyubi. Then there was that STATUE the alderman used to BLUDGEON Mayor Tenma. That INCREDIBLY inspiring symbol had fallen to the floor. Apollo: (Oh, right, the statue... But why would he find it inspiring?) Why exactly did you find the statue inspiring? L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Well! When I saw THAT statue... I felt as if the MERGER had been realized! It was like... ...a celebration of union between town and village -- an INSPIRING symbol of goodwill! Apollo: (A broken statue next to a bloody corpse... Real inspiring...) Judge: Well, Mr. Justice? Do you consider his statement to be of any importance? Apollo: (Is it important?) Very important Apollo: I believe that to be extremely important! I request that it be added to the testimony! (Changed from [I believe that to be extremely importantly [sic]! I request that it be added to the testimony!] in the original release) Adds statement \"A statue had fallen to the floor. It was a token of goodwill celebrating the municipal merger.\" or changes statement from \"The yokai feathers and tracks weren't there before the Fox Chamber was opened.\" or \"The Forbidden Chamber was shut tight until the mayor opened it.\" to \"A statue had fallen to the floor. It was a token of goodwill celebrating the municipal merger.\" Not so important Apollo: (It's probably not particularly important.) No, Your Honor. The witness may proceed. L'Belle: All right, then. I would JUST like to add that it was a TERRIBLY grisly scene, as I have described. Leads back to cross-examination The murder weapon (after adding statement \"A statue had fallen to the floor. It was a token of goodwill celebrating the municipal merger.\") Apollo: Could you describe the state of the weapons that had been used at the scene? L'Belle: The spear had been thrust ALL the way through Alderman Kyubi. Then there was that STATUE the alderman used to BLUDGEON Mayor Tenma. That INCREDIBLY inspiring symbol had fallen to the floor. Apollo: (Oh, right, the statue... But why would he find it inspiring?) Why exactly did you find the statue inspiring? L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Well! When I saw THAT statue... I felt as if the MERGER had been realized! It was like... ...a celebration of union between town and village -- an INSPIRING symbol of goodwill! Apollo: (A broken statue next to a bloody corpse... Real inspiring... I've already had him add this statement to his testimony... ...but is there really anything there? Maybe I should try reviewing the evidence.) Leads back to cross-examinationL'Belle: The yokai feathers and tracks weren't there before the Fox Chamber was opened.Press Apollo: Apollo: They were left there by Mr. Filch, weren't they. L'Belle: They WERE, indeed. And it was QUITE a shock when I saw that yokai. Judge: I can't imagine how terrifying it must've been to see this face emerging from the darkness. Apollo: (Okay, so he's not even reality TV-grade handsome. Can we move on now?) Athena: Apollo, you think that statement's important? Apollo: I don't think there's anything particularly unusual there, so let's keep going.L'Belle: The Forbidden Chamber was shut tight until the mayor opened it.Press Apollo: Apollo: You're lying about the mayor opening the Forbidden Chamber, aren't you?! L'Belle: In a SENSE, yes, it COULD be seen as a lie. Apollo: Wait, so you admit it? L'Belle: In this world RIDDLED with deceit, my beauty is the ONLY self-evident truth! That is to say, all else except me is but fiction and lies. Apollo: (The nerve of this guy! His testimony is riddled with lies! Looks like I won't be getting anything useful out of this statement.)L'Belle: A statue had fallen to the floor. It was a token of goodwill celebrating the municipal merger.Press Apollo: Apollo: A token of goodwill... Are you referring to the fox and demon statue? L'Belle: Yes, the STATUE the alderman allegedly use to STRIKE BACK at Mayor Tenma. The mayor TRAMPLED down municipal goodwill only to be CLOBBERED by its symbol! It's QUITE ironic, don't you think? Apollo: (And that's when that symbol of goodwill was transformed into a symbol of conflict.)Present Fox and Demon Statue Apollo: Leads to: \"Your lies have finally betrayed you, Mr. L'Belle!\"L'Belle: So you SEE, I was THERE, but merely watching from behind the screen.Press Apollo: Apollo: The mayor had been knocked out by a blow to the head. Could he really have opened the Forbidden Chamber in that state? L'Belle: Well, it DID seem difficult. He was ALL woozy and stumbling around as he opened it. It was SUCH a heroic effort that I NEARLY started to cheer him on despite myself! Apollo: (I think the mayor needed medical attention more than a cheerleader.)Athena: You think he's telling the truth about being there in that room?Apollo: Well, I believe he was there... The question is, when did he enter?Athena: You mean, did he enter after Jinxie fled... ...or was he there before the murder? If it's the latter, that would change everything.Apollo: Right. If he was there before the murder, that would make him a suspect.Athena: But how do we go about proving that?Apollo: Well... I guess we ask him about what happened there. Anyway, let's press him and see what kind of info we can extract from him.Athena: Let's cross our fingers that he says or reveals something incriminating.Apollo: Your lies have finally betrayed you, Mr. L'Belle!L'Belle: What POSSIBLY could you mean?Apollo: You said this statue was \"like a celebration of union between town and village.\" Isn't that correct?!L'Belle: It is indeed! But WHAT of it? The two yokai ARE joining hands in goodwill... ...as if they were CELEBRATING the municipal merger!Apollo: ............L'Belle: .........Something the matter?Apollo: So, how did you really know that this statue was meant to be a symbol of goodwill again?L'Belle: What?Blackquill: .........Justice-dono, explain yourself. And make it quick.Apollo: This statue WAS meant to symbolize goodwill in its original form, but that was a secret.L'Belle: A secret? What EVER do you mean?!Apollo: What I mean is that it broke when someone used it to strike Mayor Tenma on the head. What's left clearly makes it look like the two yokai are battling it out!L'Belle: Eep!Apollo: The statue's secret and its true form were lost inside that locked room. For Ms. Tenma is the only living soul who should know what it once looked like. So, Mr. L'Belle, where could you have possibly seen the statue in its original form?L'Belle: ! P-Pffft! What do you mean, WHERE?!Apollo: The only possible answer is this! You saw the statue in its original form... ...right there in the room where the alderman was murdered before it was broken!L'Belle: How DARE you!Judge: M-Mr. Justice! Are you accusing the witness with some sort of crime?Apollo: ...Yes. Yes I am. Florent L'Belle! I accuse you of the murder of Alderman Rex Kyubi!L'Belle: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh!Judge: Order! Order! Mr. L'Belle! You've been accused of murder. Do you have anything to say in your defense?L'Belle: ...Arrrrrrgh! How could YOU possibly accuse ME -- the EMBODIMENT of BEAUTY!Athena: Way to go, Apollo! This is the conclusive evidence we needed! Magnifico!Apollo: We've got you now! We know you killed the alderman. Now, admit it!L'Belle: I-I... I... Aaaagh!Blackquill:Blackquill: Enough of your silly games, Justice-dono. This prancing peacock could not possibly be the killer.Apollo:Apollo: What are you talking about?! His alibi has already crumbled to dust! And I just proved that he was in the Fox Chamber while it was still locked tight!Blackquill:Blackquill: Why could he have not seen the statue in its true form before the murder? After all, he was close friends with the alderman. Ergo...L'Belle: Y-Yes, th-that's right! I CLEARLY remember it now! Alderman Kyubi TOLD me about it. ...About what the statue ACTUALLY looked like! I mean, he WAS a good friend of mine, ah ha ha ha!Athena:Athena: Yeah, right! He wouldn't show you a secret gift just like that!Blackquill:Blackquill: Moreover, it has already been proven that he was not present at the scene of the crime.Athena: It has?Blackquill: Forgotten, have we? Recall the little scamp's statement if you will. When Jinxie Tenma unlocked the Fox Chamber... ...she saw the alderman and the mayor collapsed therein -- and no one else.Athena: Oh.Apollo: Dangit.Blackquill: The fact is, it was you two who made that apparent in yesterday's court session. Thus, Florent L'Belle could not possibly have been in that locked room!Apollo: Urrrrghhnnn...Athena: Nooooooooo...Apollo: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! (I just don't get it. How could Jinxie not have seen L'Belle?)Blackquill: .........The proof is incontrovertible. No room for debate exists. Am I not right, Your Baldness?Judge: Hmm... It does seem awfully conclusive. The facts point to the defendant and victim being the only people in that locked room. Moreover, the defendant has already confessed.Apollo:Blackquill:Blackquill: You cannot defend the indefensible. Your role in this charade is over, Justice-dono.Apollo: B-B-But...Blackquill: Your Baldness... This trial would last an eternity if we were to keep crossing blades with these simpletons. It is high time you brought down the hammer of justice.Judge: ...A point well made. I believe it's time to declare a verdict. This court finds the defendant, Damian Tenma...???:Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! It would seem that my time is at hand!Apollo: M-Mayor Tenma?Tenma: Counselor! There is a matter to which I must testify! I recall it now only for your good graces.Apollo: C-Counselor? Oh, right, he must mean me. (Has he finally remembered what happened before that blow to his head?)Blackquill: Bailiff! Don't just stand there! Seize him!Bailiff: It's no good! I can't restrain him!Tenma: Caw caw-caw-caw! Know me and despair! For I am Tenma Taro, demon lord of the yokai!Judge: M-Mr. Justice! Do something!Apollo: (Since when am I responsible for court security?!)Athena: Apollo, this is our chance! We might get some new information out of him!Apollo: Y-Your Honor! Seeing as our client has something new to say... ...I believe due process demands that we hear him out, even if he is a yokai!Judge: Hmm... When you put it that way... .........Still, I believe testimony by a yokai is unprecedented in the legal world.Blackquill: Hmph. Unprecedented in absurdity more like.Judge: All right then, Mr. Damian Tenma -- or should I say, Mr. Tenma Taro. Your testimony, please.Tenma: I shall now speak of recollections most real, courtesy of my host Damian Tenma. Heed these words, mortals, for hear them but once you shall! Caw caw-caw-caw!Witness Testimony-- The Ruler of Demonkind --Tenma: Barely conscious was Damian there amid the darkness. Suddenly, two yokai did appear! On one side, I, Tenma Taro, ruler of demonkind! And on the other, my mortal enemy, the Nine-Tailed Fox!Apollo: ............Athena: ............Judge: ............Umm... So, is the defendant asserting that the room he was in was very dark at the time?Tenma: Hrmm. Strange as it may be, yes, indeed, all was in darkness.Apollo: And the part about Tenma Taro and the Nine-Tailed Fox being there?Tenma: Yes, that, too! Tenma Taro towered overhead and the Nine-Tailed Fox glittered gold!Apollo: .........Aaaaah! I call animal abuse, Your Honor!Blackquill: ...Hmph. It would seem the defendant's recollections are not to be trusted.Tenma: Yes, well, truth be told, my host's recollections are still a bit fuzzy. As if half dreamt, that happening lingers in his mind.Athena: ...Apollo. Maybe I can help here.Apollo: Really? Oh, you mean...?Athena: Yeah, I can hear it. The discord in his heart. I sense an unusual emotion in the mayor's memory of the event.Apollo: Okay, I just hope our findings don't come back to haunt us... again.Tenma: Barely conscious was Damian there amid the darkness.Tenma: Suddenly, two yokai did appear!Tenma: On, one side, I, Tenma Taro, ruler of demonkind!Tenma: And on the other, my mortal enemy, the Nine-Tailed Fox!Pinpoint Happy marker Apollo: Leads to: \"When the Nine-Tailed Fox appeared, you not only experienced shock and sadness...\"Athena: It sounds like the mayor saw the same thing as what's shown on that scroll.Apollo: What's with those Tenmas and their yokai vision?Athena: I think it's sweet how father and daughter can share something like that.Apollo: (I don't think a shared nightmare really qualifies as sweet.) Anyway, all I need to do is point out an unnatural reaction like last time?Athena: Right. Look for places where an emotion conflicts with the testimony. That conflict usually indicates a thought or emotion that is being suppressed.Apollo: When the Nine-Tailed Fox appeared, you not only experienced shock and sadness... ...but also, something like joy as well.Tenma: Joy? Hmm... Perhaps it was joy at the light coming to my eyes at long last. A long and terrible creaking did pierce the silence... ...and then there was light! On reflection, it was a door that did produce that infernal racket.Apollo: A creaking door? Oh, you must be talking about the Forbidden Chamber door. It does make a lot of noise.Athena: So, this means the Forbidden Chamber really was opened. But what about the sudden light he described?Apollo: I think I know! He mentioned darkness and Tenma Taro towering overhead. Maybe the mayor wasn't really in the Fox Chamber at the time of the crime! Mr. Mayor! Did the darkness that you were in happen to be here?Present Forbidden Chamber Apollo: Leads to: \"The Forbidden Chamber?! Was it not the Fox Chamber where the murder did occur?\"Present anywhere else Apollo: Apollo: Mayor Tenma, the darkness you were in was... right here! Tenma: Hrrrm? You claim I was there? No such recollections do I possess. Apollo: That's just because your memory is still hazy! Tenma: Hrmm... On further reflection, I believe that... ...you are gravely misguided! Apollo: Huh? Athena: He means you got that one wrong, Apollo. Tenma: Counselor! I expect attempts of a more serious nature from you! Apollo: All right, let's think that one over again. Leads back to: \"Mr. Mayor! Did the darkness that you were in happen to be here?\"Tenma: The Forbidden Chamber?! Was it not the Fox Chamber where the murder did occur?Apollo: Yes, but it all makes sense if you were in the Forbidden Chamber! That terrible creaking sound was probably the Forbidden Chamber's door opening. And the towering Tenma Taro you saw? Most likely the Forbidden Chamber's statue!Tenma: Why, yes! That would explain it! The darkness and the staff in the demon's grasp!Athena: But even if all that's true, then what about the Nine-Tailed Fox?Apollo: Umm... Maybe he was seeing things, just like Jinxie and her imaginary yokai.Athena: Fantástico, Apollo! It's entirely possible! In a groggy, dream-like state, people can misremember things and events.Tenma: Misremember, you say? Hrmm. Let me think. ...Ah! I do believe... I remember now! That... that was not the Nine-Tailed Fox. It was... ...The Amazing Nine-Tails!Apollo: Wh-Wh-Whaaaaaat! Th-The Amazing Nine-Tails?Tenma: At first, this is but a dream, I thought. Now, however, most clearly do I recall it. 'Twas The Amazing Nine-Tails who did open the Forbidden Chamber's door!NOISE LEVEL60%Apollo: ............ (I'm sorry I asked.)Athena: The Amazing Nine-Tails? But that was the victim, Alderman Kyubi, right?Apollo: Yeah. Why would he open the Forbidden Chamber? Wasn't he trying to keep it sealed?Athena: Never mind that! This is completely new information! Let me enter it and run an update!Tenma: Barely conscious was Damian there in the Forbidden Chamber.Tenma: Amid the darkness, a mighty statue of Tenma Taro loomed overhead.Tenma: Suddenly, the door did open, and a shaft of light did pierce the gloom!Tenma: The Amazing Nine-Tails had come to the rescue!Pinpoint Sad marker Apollo: Leads to: \"When The Amazing Nine-Tails opened the chamber, banishing the darkness within...\"Athena: What do you suppose The Amazing Nine-Tails was up to?Apollo: Good question. Could he have been trying to free the mayor from the Forbidden Chamber?Athena: But why help an enemy like that? Wasn't he opposed to the mayor's merger plan?Apollo: Hmm... Well, at least now we know why the room suddenly lit up.Athena: Must've been a huge relief for the mayor. I mean, just thinking about being trapped in that pitch-black room freaks me out.Apollo: When The Amazing Nine-Tails opened the chamber, banishing the darkness within... ...you felt joy, but didn't you also feel shock and sadness?Tenma: Hrmmm... Yes, in the hazy depths of my mind, I do recollect something of that nature. I believe it was the fiend's cape of red. For when I did behold it, a great wave of sadness did inexplicitly wash over me.NOISE LEVEL20%Apollo: (A cape... of red?)Athena: Apollo! We've reduced the noise level! Oh, but there's still a little left.Apollo: Mayor Tenma, why were you sad when you saw the red cape?Tenma: Hrmmm... Why indeed...?Apollo: (What could this mean?)Athena: I guess his memory is still a little spotty. I know because his latest recollection contradicts the evidence.Apollo: Yeah, it's one of those contradictions that slaps you right across the face.Athena: Hmm... Something this obvious could arise... ...when someone is trying to force a fuzzy memory into a definitive shape. Apollo, I know what you have to do! You need to present evidence that contradicts the image you see!Apollo: Oh, so it's basically the same as the usual cross-examination process. (Okay, time to review the evidence. Look out contradiction, here comes Justice!)Tenma: Barely conscious was Damian there in the Forbidden Chamber.Tenma: Amid the darkness, a mighty statue of Tenma Taro loomed overhead.Tenma: Suddenly, the door did open, and a shaft of light did pierce the gloom!Tenma: The Amazing Nine-Tails had come to the rescue!Present Amazing Nine-Tails Glossy Apollo: Leads to: \"You said The Amazing Nine-Tails's cape was red. Are you sure about that?\"Apollo: It still seems like his memory is really confused.Athena: Yeah, that's because unlike data, memories are living, breathing things. Preconception, illusion, memory overlap, memory repression... Our memories are intimately tied to our psychology and emotions.Apollo: So, this contradiction is somehow caused by an emotion?Athena: I believe so. There's some deeper meaning here. Let's present some evidence. Maybe it will help jog his memory!Apollo: You said The Amazing Nine-Tails's cape was red. Are you sure about that?Tenma: Yes, well, I do believe it was a red cape I saw, but...Apollo: Mayor Tenma! Does this cape look red to you?!Tenma: Ohhhh! That certainly does NOT look red! Not even scarlet or crimson, either! Nevertheless! Upon my liberation something red did fill my as yet hazy field of view... ...and I thought to myself, \"Ah! The Amazing Nine-Tails is arrayed in a cape of red!\"Apollo: So, you mistook that red something for his cape, huh?Tenma: Apparently so. And remembering it now, brings a great sadness upon me.Athena: So the red something probably wasn't a cape after all. Maybe that great sadness he mentioned is what's interfering with his memory.Apollo: Well, he would've seen the Fox Chamber behind The Amazing Nine-Tails. What red object could he have seen there that would've been that shocking? Hmm... I know! Could it have been...! Mr. Mayor, was the red thing you saw this?Present Crime Photo Apollo: Leads to: \"Something red that could produce a deep sadness...\"Present anything else Apollo: Tenma: Foolish mortal! Do you mock me?! Apollo: Whoa! Sorry! Tenma: I'm afraid I have no recollection of seeing such an item. You must cease this practice of leaping before looking! Apollo: S-Sorry! Sorry! (Youch! That was a human/demon double punch!) Athena: Apollo, think of something that's red and could produce a feeling of sadness... And take a good look at the evidence again! Leads back to: \"Mr. Mayor, was the red thing you saw this?\"Apollo: Something red that could produce a deep sadness... Could it be, Mr. Tenma, that what you saw... was the alderman's blood?!Tenma: Blood?! Why, yes! It was blood! Arrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrgh! Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooh! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaagh! It's all coming back to me now! It wasn't a red cape that I saw... It was, lying behind The Amazing Nine-Tails, the alderman's bloody body!Athena: Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeek!NOISE LEVEL0%BYE BYEAthena: His noise level is down to zero! I think he's remembered everything now.Apollo: Does this mean The Amazing Nine-Tails killed Alderman Kyubi?Athena: But the alderman WAS The Amazing Nine-Tails, so how exactly would that work?Apollo: Hey! I asked you first!Judge: Well, Mr. Justice, you sure know how to make a complicated matter even more complicated.Apollo: True, but at the time of the crime, out client was in the Forbidden Chamber. Moreover--Blackquill:Blackquill: Hoy! Don't you think this strange? The little scamp has already confirmed her father to be in the Fox Chamber. But she said naught about seeing The Amazing Nine-Tails there.Apollo: Ack. (You just had to bring that up, didn't you...?)Athena: Jinxie didn't see L'Belle there, either. It's so weird. Who really was in that room, then?Judge: Would the defense care to share any theories with the court? Can you explain the inconsistency between the defendant's testimony and his daughter's?Yes, I can Apollo: Yes, o-of course, I can explain it! (Because if I don't, we're in serious trouble!) Leads to: \"Not with more of your bluffs and fairy tales, I trust?\"No, I can't Apollo: Explaining something like that would be completely-- Athena: Athena: Possible! My colleague here is going to explain it so it's crystal clear! Apollo: I am?! Athena: Even if you can't explain it, you can't let them know that! Just make something up! Apollo: (I don't hear YOU helping!) Leads to: \"Not with more of your bluffs and fairy tales, I trust?\"Blackquill: Not with more of your bluffs and fairy tales, I trust? Fair warning, Justice-dono. I shall have your head if you fail to explain this.Apollo: Eep! (What about a good old-fashion penalty?)Judge: Well, Mr. Justice, let's see if you have a head worth keeping on your shoulders.Apollo: First of all, Mr. L'Belle was definitely in the Fox Chamber while it was locked. We also know that Mayor Tenma was in the Forbidden Chamber based on his testimony. These two facts are crucial to my explanation. So, let us consider the following question. If the facts point to Florent L'Belle and the victim being there at the scene... ...why did Jinxie Tenma see her father Mayor Tenma and the victim?Judge: Hmm... A very good question, indeed. And I suppose you have an answer for us?Apollo: ......... (Sadly, you would be supposing wrong...)Athena: Umm... You think she could've mistaken L'Belle for the mayor?Apollo: Well, if she did, then the question is, why did she do that?Judge: Well, how about that explanation, Mr. Justice? I believe the time for questions is over. The defense asserts that Florent L'Belle was at the scene of the crime. However, Jinxie Tenma has testified that she saw her father collapsed there. If she has, in fact, misremembered the event, what could've made her do so?Jinxie was confused Apollo: Ms. Tenma was in a state of confusion at the time. That's how she mistook Mr. L'Belle for Mayor Tenma there in the Fox Chamber. After all, they both look kind of like yokai. Judge: I'm afraid I don't follow you, Mr. Justice. Apollo: Um, can I have a do-over on that one?! Leads back to: \"The defense asserts that Florent L'Belle was at the scene of the crime.\"L'Belle was disguised as Tenma Leads to: \"The figure Ms. Tenma saw was not her father.\"She got the rooms mixed up Apollo: She only thought she was in the Fox Chamber because she got the rooms mixed up! Judge: Hmm... When I'm in a big rush, I may make an unintended detour or two through the building... ...but I never end up in the wrong courtroom! Athena: Even if she was confused, I think she'd notice if she entered the Forbidden Chamber. There is that massive barred door to deal with, after all. Apollo: Oh, right. Eh heh heh... Judge: A penalty for our spatially challenged attorney! Apollo: (Let's try that one again.) Leads back to: \"The defense asserts that Florent L'Belle was at the scene of the crime.\"Apollo: The figure Ms. Tenma saw was not her father. It was Florent L'Belle disguised as Damian Tenma.Blackquill:Blackquill: That is a complete impossibility. Their faces are utterly unalike. How could you explain that away with a mere disguise?Judge: Yes, they both DO have incredibly distinctive faces.Apollo: M-Maybe the disguise completely hid his face?Athena: I think Jinxie would've mentioned if she couldn't see her father's face.Blackquill: And if it was that sort of disguise, wouldn't she have removed it?Apollo: Oh, right...Blackquill: Your sword is as dull as your mind, Justice-dono. Shall I show you what a truly sharp blade is capable of?Apollo: Aha ha ha... I think I'll pass--ack! Aaaaaaaaaaaaaah!!Blackquill: .........Hmph.Athena: Are you okay, Apollo?!Apollo: I'm... I'm... not fine, am I?Blackquill: Well, now that we have that little fairytale out of the way... Your Baldness, your verdict if you will.Judge: Mr. Justice, I believe it's time for a verdict if you have no further arguments.Apollo: Uhh... (What's even left for me to do?)Athena: Apollo! Remember what Mr. Wright always says? When you're stuck in a tight spot, turn the case upside down.Apollo: Turn the case upside down? Hmm... He does say that, doesn't he? But I don't quite see how it applies here. (Still, never hurts to give it a try, I guess. Let's see... Rather than \"Jinxie didn't remove the disguise,\" maybe \"she couldn't remove it.\" And rather than \"she didn't tell anyone about the disguise\"... ...maybe it was \"she couldn't talk about it.\")Jinxie: A wrestler's mask is more precious than his own life! He'd never unmask himself in front of others. But there ARE matches where wrestlers battle for the right to remove each other's masks.Jinxie: To have your mask torn off is the worst humiliation a wrestler could suffer! That's why their masks are more important to them than life itself.Apollo: (And what about the fact that it was The Amazing Nine-Tails who opened the door? A mask that can't be removed in front of others? Can these facts turn things around?) Ah! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! (We... We got it all backwards!)Athena: A-Apollo?Apollo: I think... I think we might've made a huge mistake.Blackquill: Your Baldness, I see no need to further indulge them in their silly little farce. The defense has no proof. They never did and they never will.Judge: Hmm... Then it seems I must announce my verdict--Apollo:Apollo: I DO have proof!Blackquill: .........Do you, now?Judge: All right, but this better be good, Mr. Justice.Apollo: We can solve the remaining riddles by turning all of our assumptions upside down. Why Jinxie Tenma mistook Mr. L'Belle for her father... ...why she couldn't remove the costume, or tell anyone about it in the first place... These riddles are inextricably linked to Mayor Tenma's secret identity! A shocking secret identity that will turn the entire premise of this case upside down! This piece of evidence clearly reveals Mayor Tenma's secret identity!Present Amazing Nine-Tails Mask Apollo: Leads to: \"Gah! Wh-What absolute claptrap! Poppycock! Balderdash!\"Present anything else Apollo: Judge: And that reveals the mayor's secret identity how exactly? Apollo: Isn't it obvious? Judge: No, it isn't. Blackquill: I, too, fail to see your point. Apollo: So, I guess we're all in the same boat, then. Judge: Mr. Justice! The only revelation here is your shocking desperation. Apollo: (Okay, time to find something that doesn't stink of desperation.) Leads back to: \"These riddles are inextricably linked to Mayor Tenma's secret identity!\"Blackquill: Gah! Wh-What absolute claptrap! Poppycock! Balderdash!Apollo: We thought the alderman was The Amazing Nine-Tails and the mayor was Tenma Taro. That's why we believed the mayor killed the alderman in his lust for Nine-Tails Vale. And it was the basis for the prosecution's entire case against our client. However... We got the whole thing backwards. Mayor Tenma wasn't Tenma Taro at all. He was The Amazing Nine-Tails!Judge: Wh-Wh-Wh-Wh-What's thiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiis?!Blackquill: You... You'd best explain yourself, Justice-dono... And from where you derived such a farfetched conclusion!Apollo: Jinxie, no doubt, knew the true identity of The Amazing Nine-Tails. But she couldn't tell anyone no matter what. That's why she didn't say it was The Amazing Nine-Tails she saw passed out! Even though, unbeknownst to her, it was really Florent L'Belle in disguise!Blackquill:Blackquill: The accused and that deceitful dandy are utterly dissimilar in physical build and voice. The little scamp would have seen the difference!Apollo:Apollo: Remember, Mr. L'Belle has his very own brand of cosmetics. Why couldn't he fake a different build, too? And anyone speaking through a mask would naturally sound different.Blackquill:Blackquill: Why did she not simply pull the mask off?!Apollo:Apollo: A masked wrestler's disguise is more precious than life itself. As a huge fan of The Amazing Nine-Tails, she would never dare unmask him!Blackquill: ...Gah! Uuuwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!Apollo: This case of mistaken identity also explains the riddle of the locked room.Judge: Then by all means, Mr. Justice, answer it for us already!Apollo: First, Mr. L'Belle entered the room where the mayor and the alderman were talking. I suspect he brought with him coffee laced with some sort of sedative. Once the alderman was out cold... ...that's when Mr. L'Belle killed him! Next, he took the mayor, who he had also drugged, into the Forbidden Chamber. Then he returned to the Fox Chamber, slipped into some of the mayor's spare clothes... ...and completed the disguise by donning The Amazing Nine-Tails's mask! With his entire charade in place, Mr. L'Belle then let out a scream... ...the scream that led Jinxie Tenma to the scene.Athena: Ah! So then... ...the person who said, \"I killed Alderman Kyubi\" was...Apollo: Yep, that was Florent L'Belle in disguise. The mayor never actually confessed.Blackquill:Blackquill: Hmph. This is no more than guesswork and speculation. Now, stop your jabbering and--Apollo:Apollo: No, you twisted samurai! This time, you stop your jabbering and let me finish making my case!Blackquill: Argh!Apollo: Once Ms. Tenma left the scene... ...Mr. L'Belle, still wearing the mayor's clothes and mask, opened the Forbidden Chamber... ...so he could drag the mayor back out into the Fox Chamber!Athena: Oh, so The Amazing Nine-Tails the mayor saw was...Apollo: Right, it was L'Belle opening the Forbidden Chamber. The second time Mr. L'Belle opened the door to the Forbidden Chamber... ...he happened to catch the thieving Mr. Filch by surprise. Startled, Mr. Filch in his Tenma Taro disguise ran as fast as he could away from the room. As he did, he left behind him a trail of feathers and tracks... ...and gave Ms. Tenma the scare of her life in the hallway. With no one left to witness the events that had occurred... ...Mr. L'Belle then proceeded to drag the sleeping mayor back into the Fox Chamber.Judge: I see. Well, that all certainly does make sense.Apollo: Then, after dragging the mayor back into the Fox Chamber... ...Mr. L'Belle threw the mask out the window and fled the room!Blackquill:Blackquill: For this absurd theory to work, it requires that the defendant be The Amazing Nine-Tails. However, he was the one pushing for the municipal merger. That such an individual could possibly be The Amazing Nine-Tails is preposterous!Apollo:Apollo: The mayor was blackmailed into pursuing the merger! Ms. Tenma's life would've been in danger if he had openly voiced his opposition! That's why he created a secret identity as The Amazing Nine-Tails!Blackquill: Gah! This is madness! No one could possibly hatch such an insane plot!Apollo: No one except a killer as insane as his plot, and I'd say Florent L'Belle more than qualifies.Tenma: Foolish mortal! It is at your own peril that you forget who I am!Apollo: M-Mayor Tenma! It's okay now! Jinxie will be safe just as soon as Mr. L'Belle is arrested! You ARE The Amazing Nine-Tails, aren't you?!Tenma: I-I...! .........Hrmmmm.???:Apollo: .........!L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! You have QUITE the active imagination! Mayor Tenma is NOT The Amazing Nine-Tails.Apollo:Apollo: What do you mean?!L'Belle: WELL, has the mayor ADMITTED to it yet?Apollo: But that's just--L'Belle: And even if he DID admit to such nonsense... ...I would reveal the TRUTH behind Tenma Taro right here and now.Apollo: What?Tenma: Why you--! You would dare reveal the secret?!L'Belle: A ha ha ha! My GOOD FRIEND the alderman told me ALL about it. But it WOULDN'T be good to expose the truth, what with the superstitions, now would it?Apollo: (The truth behind Tenma Taro? What's he talking about?)L'Belle: So, go ahead, SAY it! Say, \"I AM The Amazing Nine-Tails!\" I DARE you!Tenma: Arrrrrrgh!Apollo:Apollo: Wait! Will somebody please explain what's going on here?!L'Belle: Mayor Tenma will do ANYTHING to keep the truth behind Tenma Taro a secret. A dark, TERRIBLE truth that has been kept SECRET by the village superstitions.Apollo: And if the mayor admits to being The Amazing Nine-Tails, you'll expose the truth?L'Belle: Right! I WON'T have him walking free because of some NONSENSE you made up.Blackquill: .........Hmph. So, what now, Justice-dono? Without the mayor's admission, your theory is as useless as you are in battle.Apollo: (I'll show YOU who's useless!)Athena: Apollo! Don't you dare give up now!Apollo: I-I know, I know. Your Honor! I believe Mr. L'Belle's statements warrant a thorough cross-examination! After all, the true identity of The Amazing Nine-Tails is the cornerstone of this case!Judge: Hmm... You do have a point there. Please answer this court, Mr. L'Belle: Is the defendant The Amazing Nine-Tails or not?Witness Testimony-- The Amazing Nine-Tails's True Identity --L'Belle: The Amazing Nine-Tails's TRUE identity is NOT Mayor Tenma. The mayor would NEVER admit to such UTTER nonsense. But if he DID admit to such nonsense... ...I will EXPOSE the TRUTH behind Tenma Taro right here and now... ...and THAT would bring RUIN upon Nine-Tails Vale, just as the superstitions say.Apollo: Talk about out of the pot and into the fire... At this rate, the mayor will be found guilty for sure...Judge: Honestly speaking, if Mayor Damian Tenma is not The Amazing Nine-Tails... ...I'm afraid I don't see how the defense has much of a case here.L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! And LET'S just leave it at that, shall we? We ALL know Alderman Kyubi was The Amazing Nine-Tails, anyway. I mean, THAT'S how Nine-Tails Vale made a comeback -- the alderman was SO popular.Apollo: (There's... gotta be a hole in that testimony somewhere... (Was said out loud in the original release) But I don't even know where to start. (Was said out loud in the original release))Athena: Since we don't have any proof that the mayor is The Amazing Nine-Tails... ...then we'll just have to get him to admit it himself.Apollo: But if he admits it, L'Belle's going to expose the secret behind Tenma Taro. (Argh! We are so close! I know it!)Judge: The defense may cross-examine the witness.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Amazing Nine-Tails's True Identity --L'Belle: The Amazing Nine-Tails's TRUE identity is NOT Mayor Tenma.Press Apollo: Apollo: This whole case only makes sense if the mayor is The Amazing Nine-Tails. I know you used his mask to create this illusion of a locked room murder! Blackquill: Blackquill: Hmph. Nothing more than idle speculation. You've no evidence, now, have you? Apollo: Apollo: Mr. L'Belle knows what this statue originally looked like. That means he had to be in the Fox Chamber while it was still locked tight! L'Belle: L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Sorry, but I HEARD about the statue from Alderman Kyubi. If you DON'T believe me, just ASK him. Oh, but what's that? The ALDERMAN'S dead? Ah ha ha ha! LOOKS like the joke's on YOU, my sweaty little friend! Athena: Apollo! You mind if I wring his neck?! Apollo: Wait in line, 'cause I'm going first! L'Belle: Temper, temper... ANYWAY...L'Belle: The mayor would NEVER admit to such UTTER nonsense.Press Apollo: Apollo: The only nonsense here in this court is you and your assertions! L'Belle: Tsk tsk. Such anger is TERRIBLE for the skin, you know. BEAUTY is like a FLOWER that blooms forth from a serene heart. Apollo: Excuse me? L'Belle: Pffft. I wouldn't EXPECT a wilted peasant like you to understand. Perhaps this fragrance will help the BLOSSOM within you BLOOM! Apollo: Ack! L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! You liked that, didn't you? Blackquill: Enough jabbering about blossoms and whatnot. Get on with your testimony before I slice you into a bouquet of cut flowers. L'Belle: Oh, dear, please excuse me. As I was saying, the ASSERTION of our wilted attorney here is UTTER NONSENSE.L'Belle: But if he DID admit to such nonsense...Press Apollo: Apollo: You'd be arrested, wouldn't you? L'Belle: Yes, it's true. I would be SACRIFICED upon the altar of justice DESPITE my innocence. But what a TERRIBLE loss that would be for the FUTURE of humankind's cosmetic needs! It is a TRAGEDY that MUST be averted! Defend me if you UNDERSTAND this! Blackquill: Blackquill: The only terrible loss is the time wasted by your ceaseless yammering. If you would avert the tragedy awaiting you and that vexing visage of yours, then-- L'Belle: Yes, yes, I know. Get on with my testimony. Anyhow, suffice to say... ...should the mayor ADMIT to the defense's nonsense, I will make good on my threat and...L'Belle: ...I will EXPOSE the TRUTH behind Tenma Taro right here and now...Press Apollo: Apollo: And just how did you learn of this so-called truth behind Tenma Taro? L'Belle: Alderman Kyubi told me all about it. The SECRET of the Forbidden Chamber AND the TRUTH behind Tenma Taro! Apollo: Why would he share a secret like that with you, Mr. L'Belle? L'Belle: Because of the alderman's wife. I was looking AFTER her while she was hospitalized. He appreciated it SO much, he shared the SECRETS with me. Athena: Wait, did he threaten the alderman in addition to the mayor?! Apollo: ...Don't tell me THAT'S how he learned how to open the Forbidden Chamber. L'Belle: Needless to say, I'm NOT above revealing the TRUTH behind Tenma Taro...L'Belle: ...and THAT would bring RUIN upon Nine-Tails Vale, just as the superstitions say.Press Apollo: Apollo: Do not gaze upon Tenma Taro. Do not tell others if you see him. Isn't that what the village superstitions say? L'Belle: EXACTLY. Telling others what Tenma Taro LOOKS like would REVEAL the truth. THAT'S why the superstitions were written down in the first place. Apollo: And ruin coming to the village if you free him? Is that a warning not to expose the truth? L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Bingo! And that truth is, Tenma Taro is a great, greed-inspiring fortune! That's what the whole battle over Nine-Tails Vale is all about! Apollo: (Tenma Taro is.. a great fortune? Come to think of it...) Filch: Eh heh heh. Only that it's the greatest get-rich-quick chance in the universe. Grandpappy told me all about it. Said there's an amazing treasure in there! Apollo: Could Tenma Taro actually be... Mayor Tenma Apollo: Mayor Tenma just has to be Tenma Taro... right? Athena: Athena: Please, Apollo! Stop messing around! Apollo: ...Sorry. Leads back to cross-examination Forbidden Chamber treasure Apollo: (Telling the villagers that Tenma Taro is a terrifying yokai... ...is what has scared them away from the Forbidden Chamber and the treasure within. That's how the treasure has been kept secret all this time!) L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Well, well, well... It seems our ace attorney here has uncovered the truth that MUST NOT be revealed. Apollo: (Mayor Tenma looks like he wants to keep the truth hidden as much as I do...) L'Belle: TRAGEDY is DOOMED to repeat itself as long as Tenma Taro exists. THAT'S why the secret MUST BE protected! Apollo: ......... (As long as Tenma Taro exists, huh...) Mr. L'Belle, please add that statement to your testimony! Adds statement \"TRAGEDY is DOOMED to repeat as long as Tenma Taro exists.\"Press (after adding statement) Apollo: Apollo: Do not gaze upon Tenma Taro. Do not tell others if you see him. Isn't that what the village superstitions say? L'Belle: EXACTLY. Telling others what Tenma Taro LOOKS like would REVEAL the truth. THAT'S why the superstitions were written down in the first place. Apollo: (Telling the villagers that Tenma Taro is a terrifying yokai... ...is what has scared them away from the Forbidden Chamber and the treasure within. That's how the treasure has been kept secret all this time!) L'Belle: Ah ha ha ha! Does your hopelessness have you at a LOSS for WORDS? Well, your case IS hopeless, so I'd say that's MORE than appropriate.L'Belle: TRAGEDY is DOOMED to repeat as long as Tenma Taro exists.Press Apollo: Apollo: So, in other words, tragedy wouldn't occur at all if there were no Tenma Taro? L'Belle: Yes, I SUPPOSE so, but THAT'S wishful-- This is L'Belle. ...Yes. ...Mm-hm. ...You don't say? Apollo: (Hmm... As long as Tenma Taro exists, huh...)Present Azuki Kozo Figure Apollo: Leads to: \"Mr. L'Belle, what if Tenma Taro no longer existed?\"Athena: How's the mayor supposed to admit to his secret identity now?!Apollo: Well, we have to find a way to make him say it, or our entire case unravels.

    "cot": "L'Belle, in testimony 3, threatens to \"expose the truth behind Tenma Taro right here and now\". The assertion is that revealing Tenma Taro's true nature would bring \"ruin upon Nine-Tails Vale\", feeding the myth and superstition that has protected the Forbidden Chamber's contents. However, Evidence 20 (Azuki Kozo Figure) directly contradicts the gravity of L'Belle's threat: the figure, found inside the supposedly forbidden and dangerous Tenma Taro statue, reveals that the statue had already been breached, and that no malevolent supernatural consequence befell the village—the \"ruin\" is a manufactured superstition. The presence of the Azuki Kozo Figure, together with its attached folklore about \"dirty money getting washed clean for giving out to the poor,\" also disproves the notion that Tenma Taro's secret is particularly dangerous or supernatural, highlighting the myth is a cover for hiding the true nature of the chamber's contents (a treasure), not something \"ruinous\" to the village if revealed.\n",

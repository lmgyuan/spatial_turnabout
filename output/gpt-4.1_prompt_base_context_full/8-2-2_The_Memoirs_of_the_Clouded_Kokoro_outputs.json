As the victim lay at death's door, thy mystery of just who had stabbed the young lady from behind had been resolved. But no sooner had my friend saved that Eastern exchange student from his harrowing plight, than in the dim, flickering shadows of gaslight did a second bizarre crime rend the stillness of that very night. I daresay most can still recall the sensational headlines of the day. 'Haunted Apartment of Death' 'The Condemned Criminal's Curse' 'The Dread Demon of Coal Gas' Yet, though the great detective had at once discerned the truth upon his arrival at the scene, it only proved to be the overture that announced the rising of the curtain on a most tragic play. My name is Ryunosuke Naruhodo. I'm a fledgling lawyer, just starting out on my journey. Six months ago, I arrived as a visiting student of law... ...having made the long voyage across the sea from the Empire of Japan to here...London, England. And on the way, in quite extraordinary circumstances, I made the acquaintance of a world-famous detective. Currently, I reside in the attic of the detective's own lodgings, from where I run my legal consultancy of sorts. I've successfully defended a number of clients in Britain's highest court, the Old Bailey. But since a particularly gruelling and unforgettable legal battle four months ago now... ...I haven't returned to the courtroom. In truth, I lost my right to return. But that epic trial was just part of an epic tale. A tale which was now about to awaken from slumber... ...thanks to a letter that arrived this morning from my homeland... *Ruuumble* Ryunosuke: ......... (Mmm, what a delicious smell wafting up the stairs... It must be nearly time for breakfast. I'd better go down to Mr Sholmes's suite... ...and say good morning to the great detective and his flatmate.) 30th August, 7:28 a.m. Sholmes's Suite Iris: Ah, Runo, good! I was just about to call up to you. The bacon's ready. Ryunosuke: Good morning, Iris. It smells delicious as usual. Before we eat, though, I have some news. I had a surprise this morning- Sholmes: Shh! Not another word, Mr Naruhodo! This could be just the abstruse thing for my pre-breakfast stagnation-repelling mental stimulation, my dear fellow. Ryunosuke: 'Morning' to you too, Mr Sholmes. Sholmes: Ah...yes...I see... So that's it... The truth is as clear to me as day. My faculties of observation have revealed it again. Ryunosuke: Wh-What are you talking about? Sholmes: You, Mr Naruhodo. You have, this very morning, met with a surprise! ...Well? Is that not the case? Ryunosuke: Um... Sholmes: Really, my dear fellow, it barely warrants explanation. Firstly, your hair is particularly unkempt. Somewhat reminiscent of a bird's nest. Secondly, you have neglected to fasten the third button of your jacket. Clearly, when considered together, these two facts point to you having been flustered this morning. Ryunosuke: ......... Can I talk now? Sholmes: But of course, of course! Though I don't look for admiration, you understand. Ryunosuke: My hair always looks like this. It's been this way since I first met you. Sholmes: Oh. It has? Ryunosuke: And the button...was ripped off last night, if you remember? ...By you. Iris: Hurley pulled your button off? Sholmes: ......... Ah yes, I recall the incident now. It was after supper, was it not? As the evening advanced, I picked up my violin and began to play the wailing notes of a haunting tune. But then, to my utter dismay, the third string snapped! Why did it have to happen? WHY?! Little wonder then, that in my vexation, I grabbed the first button I saw and ripped it from its proper place! Ryunosuke: ...Well, I'd like it back now, please. It's troubling me that I can't fasten my jacket. Sholmes: And it's troubling me that you expect me to know where it is! Somewhere thereabouts on the floor, one presumes. Ryunosuke: (Helpful.) Sholmes: What matters at the present time, my dear fellow, is simply whether or not my deduction was unerring. Iris: But Hurley, Runo said it when he came in, didn't he? 'I had a surprise this morning.' Sholmes: ......... Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Well, that really is a surprise! Ryunosuke: (Yes, this man is the pride of the British Empire. The famous consulting detective, Mr Herlock Sholmes. There can't be a single person in the world who doesn't know his name.) Iris: Alright then, enough of this silly conversation. Come and eat this bacon before it goes cold. And I have a new herbal tea for you to try, too! My latest special blend! Ryunosuke: (And here we have Iris Wilson, Mr Sholmes's lodger and companion. A truly exceptional young girl, who's the author of a highly successful serialisation here in London. Yes, 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes' as published in Randst Magazine.) Sholmes: So, Mr Naruhodo, won't you put us out of our misery? What surprised you this fine morning? Ryunosuke: Ah, well, I received a letter...from Japan. Iris: Oh! From Susie, you mean?! Was it? Really? Ryunosuke: That's right. And she had some rather startling news, in fact. Sholmes: Ah... intriguing indeed. You must tell us all about it over breakfast! Iris: Oh yes! What fun! After clearing all Converse options: Ryunosuke: Summoning her back to Japan so suddenly like that... I wonder what Miss Susato's father is hiding. Iris: Hmmm... Hurley, do you know what it's all about? Sholmes: ...Hm? Ah, well, who can say? Ryunosuke: What? But, but you said... Sholmes: Please, I have engagements, my dear fellow! My calendar is quite surprisingly full today. And a stringent analysis of the matter would be excessive, I feel. Even if I were quite at leisure. So! Man the fort in my absence, won't you, Iris? Iris: I will, Hurley, don't worry. See you later! Ryunosuke: (He scuttled off rather quickly there... I think perhaps Professor Mikotoba isn't the only person hiding something here. Soseki-san was involved in two cases, but only one of them was forbidden from being published. By, of all people...Mr Sholmes.) Iris: Ah-ha! I've found them at last! Ryunosuke: Iris! Are, are they...? Iris: The notes about the case? That's right. Susie and I compiled them together. 'The Case of the Haunted Lodgings'... Do you want to read them, Runo? Ryunosuke: ......... Absolutely. Thank you, Iris. I have no idea what secrets could still be hiding in the shadows of this case... ...but perhaps if I read over the notes again, something might come to light. Iris: That's the spirit! And so... ...Iris and I decided to read over the case notes again together. Everything from what happened, to our investigation and that fierce battle in court that followed. Reliving every detail... I just need to find a clue. And I have all the time in the world. Because of course... ...I'm no longer allowed to practise law in the courts of Great Britain. It was six months ago... A mysterious incident that unfolded on the wintry streets of London. A young woman was found lying on the snowy pavement of Briar Road with a knife in her back. Fortunately, her life was spared, but she was unconscious for several days following the incident. The fog was thick, and nobody saw her attacker, but... ...by a cruel twist of fate, a visiting Japanese student was walking behind her at the time, and was duly arrested. That man was Soseki-san. And the man who effected his arrest...was Mr Sholmes. Believing in our compatriot's innocence, Susato-san and I decided to represent Soseki-san in court. And, after a gruelling trial of many twists and turns, we finally managed to prove his innocence. Soseki: Joyful, Joyous, Jubilant Jubilation! Ryunosuke: ...Was the man's reaction after the trial. But his jubilant jubilation was short lived. We received a telegram from Mr Sholmes the following morning. 'The victim of the Briar Road stabbing has regained consciousness. Hurry to Barts at once!' So Susato-san and I summoned a hansom and headed immediately to the hospital. Before clearing all Converse options in Sholmes's Suite: 30th August Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy 21st February, 5:30 a.m. St Bartholomew's Hospital, Recovery Ward Sholmes: There you are at last! Ryunosuke: Good morning, Mr Sholmes. Sholmes: I think not. Susato: Oh! Sholmes: You're late! What on earth took you so long! Susato: Your telegram only arrived at five o'clock, Mr Sholmes. And it's a twenty-minute ride to the hospital. Ryunosuke: That's right, and it's half past five now. I think we made very good time. Sholmes: The time is utterly irrelevant! The fact is, I have been waiting for what has felt like an eternity. Ryunosuke: Haah... Sholmes: In point of fact, I myself was awoken at four this morning by a telegram boy. And feeling it was somewhat unjust that I alone had been roused at such an hour, I sent one to you. Ryunosuke: (Well thanks for that.) Sholmes: Anyway, you're here now, so... The victim is over there. She's only just regained consciousness. You should introduce yourselves. And I shall observe from here. Ryunosuke: (So that's the lady who was found on the snow-covered pavement with the knife in her back...) Susato: Her name is... Ah yes, here we are. Miss Green. After clearing all Converse options with Olive Green and examining picture frame: ???: Is there a Mr Narrowfodder here? Mr Narrowfoddeeer?! Ryunosuke: ('Narrowfodder' now...?) Well, um, if you're looking for Naruhodo, the lawyer, that's me, but... ???: Ah! Mr Narrowfodder, good. This is for you. It's a message from a Mr Saucy Nutsmeg. Ryunosuke: Mr Natsume?! Sent a message...to me? Susato: But why would a policeman be delivering a message from Mr Natsume? Ryunosuke: Exactly... (What's going on? What's a Scotland Yard constable doing playing delivery boy at this time in the morning?) Sholmes: Argh, what are you waiting for?! Let me see that! Ryunosuke: Oh! Sholmes: ......... Well...this is most unexpected... Ryunosuke: Is something wrong, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: 'Is something wrong, Mr Sholmes?' he says! Have you not seen this note?! Ryunosuke: No, how could I have?! Sholmes: It would seem that London's criminals have no intention of letting the great detective rest. A new case calls. A case of murder, no less. ...We must depart at once! Susato: Murder?! Sholmes: Call a cab! Time is of the essence! Ryunosuke: But...the trouble is... ...we've yet to read Mr Natsume's note. I was thinking we ought to pay him a visit in his lodgings once we did. Sholmes: That will be entirely convenient. Susato: Convenient? What do you mean? Sholmes: It's all here in the note, my dear fellows. The murder we must investigate...took place at Mr Moustache's lodgings! Ryunosuke: Wait...WHAT?! Susato: I'll hail a fiacre at once! (It was only yesterday that Soseki-san was in court and we were dispelling doubts about his innocence. And now...the very next day... ...there's a murder at the man's own address? He may very well be the unluckiest man alive.) ...Or so it seemed to us at the time, but we were soon to discover it was worse than we thought. 21st February Sholmes's Suite 21st February, 7:18 a.m. Mr Natsume's Lodgings, Ground Floor Ryunosuke: What on earth...?! Susato: Oh my! The gentleman is deceased, without question! He's dead! Soseki: L-L-L-Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire! Ryunosuke: Mr Natsume! Soseki: Oh...why...? Why is this happening? Why to me? I'VE ONLY JUST GOT OUT OF COURT! YESTERDAY! I WAS FINALLY HOME AFTER TWO DAYS OF MISERY! AND THEN I WAKE UP THE NEXT DAY TO THIS! NO EARLY BIRD SHOULD CATCH A WORM LIKE THIS! WOEFUL WORM WITHOUT WIGGLE! Sholmes: I see you're in high spirits again this morning, Mr Moustache. Soseki: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!! Not the horrible HERR LOCK SHOLMES! SHOO! SHOVE OFF! SHOW YOURSELF THE DOOR! I NEVER INVITED YOU! Susato: Mr Sholmes came here with us. I'm quite sure he'll be able to help you, Mr Natsume! Sholmes: I am entirely at your disposal, Mr Moustache. What can I do for you? Soseki: GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! Gregson: Tsk, here they are...already. The busybodies. Sholmes: Ah, Inspector Gregson. What a pleasant surprise. Gregson: Pleasant, is it? Gives me heartburn every time I see your face at a crime scene, Sholmes. Sholmes: Hah! I deduce, Inspector...that your heartburn is a result of your excessive consumption of fried food. Ryunosuke: Um...good morning, Inspector. Gregson: .........This is a crime scene! Don't you go touchin' anythin'! Ryunosuke: (Or 'Good morning to you too, sunshine...') Ryunosuke: Um, Mr Sholmes, what are you doing? Sholmes: Hah! You need only observe to know it, my dear fellow. Investigating, naturally! Ryunosuke: ...There's nothing natural about that pose. Susato: Mr Sholmes! Have you made some miraculous discovery? Sholmes: Patience, my dear madam, patience. We've not been here in this room five minutes. So far, all I've managed to deduce is what actually happened. Susato: My goodness! But...isn't that everything we need to know, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: Hm... Now that you propose the idea, I believe one could, indeed, see it that way. At the present time, I have managed to draw two incontrovertible conclusions. The first, that there was a physical struggle here last night in which the victim fought for his life. Soseki: AAAAAAAAAH! Susato: Ah! Ryunosuke: Mr Natsume, what's wrong? Is something that Mr Sholmes said significant somehow? Soseki: N-No... Don't mind me! Forget I was here! Sholmes: And my second conclusion... ...is that there was a poison lingering in the air here last night that passed the victim's lips. Soseki: N-N-N-NONSENSE! Susato: Ah! Ryunosuke: Alright, Mr Natsume. Why are you reacting so extremely to Mr Sholmes's deductions? Soseki: N-N-N-No... Please! Pretend I'm not here! Invisible, Ineffable, Inscrutable...Insignificant! Ryunosuke: ...Impossible to ignore. Susato: You must tell us everything, Mr Sholmes! Spare no detail! Sholmes: ......... But of course. Let the theatrical tragedy before us be unravelled by my great deductions, presented for your pleasure in two acts! Ryunosuke: (We've heard some truly astounding great deductions from Mr Sholmes in the past... No doubt this will be no exception. What miracles will unfold before our eyes this time?) Sholmes: So, my dear fellows, for your delight and wonder, let the curtain rise... ...for Herlock Sholmes's 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular', Act One! The Great Deduction The game is afoot! Topic 1 Cause of Death Sholmes: Careful observation of the victim reveals to us the events that transpired in this disconsolate room last night. Foam at the mouth of the deceased clearly indicates the use of poison. Next to the victim, we notice a large dining plate, which contains, you will observe... ...one half of a sizeable bar of soap. Meaningful? Indubitably. Why is this soap set so purposefully upon the dish? Like the victim's last supper, in fact. Yes... Could it be that the man was about to eat it? Of course, the fork reveals the answer. It appears that the young man's appetite was his undoing. Taking up arms in the form of his cutlery, the victim engaged in a deadly battle for his life. Yet the struggle against his hunger was in vain, for in the end, he couldn't resist devouring the slippery feast! But London's foul soap is besmirched by foul poison. Yes, the victim's life was claimed by poison that tainted the contents of the plate! The soap...and the lather about the young man's mouth are too perfectly matched to ignore. The cause of death was clearly intoxication due to excessive ingestion of foul soap! ...Though personally, I have a greater interest in the taste of foul candlewax, of course. Topic 1 Cause of Death Conclusion Poisoning from soap ingestion Topic 2 Suicide or Murder? Sholmes: The cause of death identified, we proceed to Act Two, where we ponder the next question: Was this suicide or murder? The audience will recall that death occurred during the victim's 'last supper'. Did the man dine and die alone? This single teacup suggests the answer. To draw a conclusion on such meagre evidence would be foolish however, certainly. The careful criminal could have absconded with his own cup to cover his tracks. Well, allow me to lift the veil of doubt, my dear fellow. Indeed. What reveals the answer, of course, is the broken lock! Though forced open now, at the time of the incident, this door was locked. And the sole key was in the victim's pocket. In other words, when the victim consumed the poison, he must have been alone. Alone with his inferior soap, from whence wafted an inferior scent. And with that acrid aroma lingering in the air, the victim met his end...in tragic solitude. We can take comfort only in the fact that his soul was well cleansed on its way to the hereafter. Topic 2 Suicide or Murder? Conclusion No possible perpetrator present Sholmes: Thus concludes the final act of Herlock Sholmes's great deduction! Susato: ......... Gregson: ......... Ryunosuke: ...There's just one thing, Mr Sholmes... Sholmes: You are disposed to identifying 'just one thing', aren't you, Mr Naruhodo? Pray, what concerns you? Ryunosuke: Well...no matter how hungry he was, do you really think the man would have eaten soap? Sholmes: It is quite apparent that this man had barely a penny to his name. It is a curious thing, but to one so destitute, soap can suddenly appear quite irresistibly appetising. Susato: How extraordinary! Sholmes: In truth, I have tried a little soap myself in the past. Ryunosuke: You've eaten it, you mean?! Sholmes: My dear fellow, it was some time ago now. My postulation was that it would cleanse my gut. Susato: And did it? Sholmes: As I writhed in agony on the floor and spilt the contents of my stomach...yes, I believe it did. The experience taught me a valuable lesson: soap is quite poisonous. It has an unpleasant taste and leads to great discomfort. In summary, I cannot recommend it. Ryunosuke: (Believe me, I wouldn't eat it even if you did.) Susato: There's something that troubles me as well, actually. Ryunosuke: Oh? What's that? Susato: It's Mr Natsume. Soseki: Ah! Susato: I couldn't help noticing him shuddering and quivering out of the corner of my eye. Almost as if Mr Sholmes's deductions touched a nerve somehow. Soseki: N-N-N-N-N-Nonsense... Ryunosuke: (Well, that clenched teeth episode didn't last...) Susato: I think...judging by Mr Natsume's reaction... ...the great detective's deductions may need some gentle corrections in order to reach the actual truth. Ryunosuke: (Yes, Mr Sholmes's observations and deductions are sometimes a little too sharp... He has a tendency to hit the nail on the side of the head and drive it in at an obtuse angle. When he does that, it falls to us to straighten things out.) Alright then, let's see what we can do. Susato: Yes, we must pick out the key words in Mr Sholmes's quite brilliant deductions... ...and discreetly exchange them for something that makes a little more sense. If we can do that... ...I'm sure we'll arrive at what Mr Sholmes meant to say in the first place! Sholmes: In that case...are you ready for the second performance of the day? Once again, my dear fellows, for your continued delight and wonder, let the curtain rise... ...for Herlock Sholmes's 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular', Act One! Course Correction Hold it, Mr Sholmes! Topic 1 Cause of Death Conclusion Poisoning from soap ingestion Sholmes: Careful observation of the victim reveals to us the events that transpired in this disconsolate room last night. Foam at the mouth of the deceased clearly indicates the use of poison. Next to the victim, we notice a large dining plate, which contains, you will observe... ...one half of a sizeable bar of soap. Meaningful? Indubitably. Why is this soap set so purposefully upon the dish? Like the victim's last supper, in fact. Yes... Could it be that the man was about to eat it? Of course, the fork reveals the answer. Ryunosuke: Well, you can't deny that a fork implies the man was eating something, or about to eat something. Susato: Yes, that's true. If I were to decide to eat some soap, I should prefer to use a fork than to attempt it with chopsticks. Ryunosuke: And of course, only half of the bar of soap is left on the plate. Susato: But might there not be some other explanation? Something material that proves whether or not the man really ate some soap... Could it be that the man was about to eat it? Of course, the fork reveals the answer. Ryunosuke: Some soup on a plate, and a fork in hand... Even so, surely you wouldn't try to eat soap, no matter how hungry you were. Susato: That's what we must determine: was the victim eating soap when he died or not? Until we can establish that with some certainty, we shan't make any progress. Ryunosuke: (Talk about a slippery problem...) Ryunosuke: Could it be that the man was about to eat it? Of course, the other piece of soap reveals the answer. Sholmes: It being the other half of the soap on the table. In short, the victim was not eating soap at all. But it's obvious, really. For no depths of hunger could drive any man to attempt to eat soap. Even I, with my unquenchable thirst for practical knowledge, took only a single bite! Ryunosuke: But that begs the question of how the man was poisoned. Because there's no sign of any food on the table. Sholmes: An excellent observation, Mr Naruhodo. And one that furnishes us with the answer we seek. For London's foul soap is besmirched by foul poison. Yes, the victim's life was claimed by poison that tainted the contents of the plate! Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes is still pushing the soap argument, then. Susato: Perhaps he's suggesting the man licked the soap rather than ate it. Ryunosuke: If soap in London is that poisonous, I don't think I want to be washing my hands with it. (But there are no signs of any food in this room at all.) Susato: Of course, food isn't the only thing that passes people's lips, is it? Yes, the victim's life was claimed by poison that tainted the contents of the plate! Ryunosuke: If the cause of death was poison, how did it get into the victim's body? Susato: I think it might be difficult to establish the answer conclusively at this point. But at the very least, the idea of poisoned soap should be discounted, I think. I'm sure there's a far more likely explanation before our eyes here. Ryunosuke: (Something obvious that could explain how poison passed the victim's lips...) Ryunosuke: Yes, the victim's life was claimed by poison that tainted the teacup! Sholmes: Indeed! Cups have been the vessel of choice for practising poisoners over the centuries. And it would appear that this victim drank every last drop. Ryunosuke: There's no sign of food anywhere in the room. Sholmes: Which leads us to the immutable conclusion: The cause of death was clearly intoxication due to the ingestion of poison contained in this teacup! Topic 1 Cause of Death Conclusion Poisoning from soap ingestion Poison in the tea Solved Topic 2 Suicide or Murder? Conclusion No possible perpetrator present Sholmes: The cause of death identified, we proceed to Act Two, where we ponder the next question: Was this suicide or murder? The audience will recall that death occurred during the victim's 'last supper'. Did the man dine and die alone? This single teacup suggests the answer. Ryunosuke: Ah, the 'Western vessel for infused hot drinks' again. It's already featured heavily in our deductions so far. Susato: Yes, we can imagine that shortly before his death, Mr Shamspeare was having a drink of tea. There would be nothing remarkable about that. But what troubles me... Ryunosuke: ...Is Mr Natsume's reaction when he heard Mr Sholmes suggest it. (There's more to this deduction than it seems...) Susato: We must closely examine the scene of the crime again for some more clues! Did the man dine and die alone? This single teacup suggests the answer. Susato: It's crucial that we determine whether or not there was somebody else present at the time of death. It will tell us if this was a murder or suicide. Ryunosuke: Yes, and while the argument that the presence of a single teacup shows he was alone is a good one... (...we need to make sure we look at this from all angles...) Ryunosuke: Did the man dine and die alone? This other teacup suggests the answer. Yes! There were two teacups in this room all along! Soseki: Ah! Ryunosuke: In other words, this is a strong indication that at the victim's 'last supper'... ...there was a guest present! Sholmes: ...At the very least, we can say now with certainty... ...that somebody else was here in this room last night, taking tea with the victim! Soseki: Wh-Wh-What are you TALKING ABOUT?! Utterly, Unbelievably, Unjustly Unreasonable! Sholmes: To draw a conclusion on such meagre evidence would be foolish however, certainly. Ryunosuke: In which case, what more can we deduce about this possible 'guest' at the table? Sholmes: Well, allow me to lift the veil of doubt, my dear fellow. Ryunosuke: Do you mean to say, you know who exactly was in this room at the time of the victim's death?! Sholmes: Indeed. What reveals the answer, of course, is the broken lock! Ryunosuke: ...I'm not sure I like where this deduction is going now. Susato: I'm afraid it's too late to go back to the halcyon days of eating too much soap. Ryunosuke: But the identity of the 'guest' who was in here last night when the victim passed away is... Is something I have a very bad feeling about. Susato: Well, you can try to ignore your feelings, but we cannot ignore the truth, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: (No, I suppose not. Time to look around again...) Indeed. What reveals the answer, of course, is the broken lock! Ryunosuke: Was there somebody else in here last night, or not... Clearly that's a fundamental question that will reveal the truth about this man's passing. Susato: Exactly. So we must make sure we have solid grounds for our conclusion. Ryunosuke: (I must have another look around and make sure there's not more here than meets the eye...) Ryunosuke: Indeed. What reveals the answer, of course, is the pile of familiar books! Sholmes: Quite so! It's no mere coincidence that these three titles are here in this room. It's the link to the truth! Soseki: Agh! Ryunosuke: Mr Natsume, you purchased these books four days ago at a secondhand bookshop. Soseki: Th-That's just...a c-c-c-coincidence! Sholmes: In that case, you will be able to bring the same three titles from your own room, will you not? This very moment! Soseki: ......... No! Never! Non-Negotiable! Ryunosuke: If you can't bring your own copies here, it proves that these three books are in fact yours. Soseki: Hnnnnnngh... Ryunosuke: Having purchased the books four days ago and returned to your lodgings, you were arrested the very next day. So you could conceivably have brought the books here on that evening, but you never mentioned that. Sholmes: In other words, you could only have brought these three books here to the victim's room... ...last night, having returned to your lodgings after the trial concluded at the Old Bailey. Soseki: Ah...um...aaah...aaaaaah... Sholmes: In short...there is only one possible conclusion: The victim died here in his room last night as a result of poisoning. Ryunosuke: And that same night, the victim had a visitor. Sholmes: And that visitor... Ryunosuke: ...Was you, Mr Soseki Natsume! Sholmes: Thus concludes the final act of Herlock Sholmes's great deduction! Topic 2 Suicide or Murder? Conclusion No possible perpetrator present Soseki Natsume at the scene Solved Deduction CompleteElementary! Soseki: Huuurgh...uuurgh... Not again... Not again... Not again... NOT AGAAAAAAAAAAAAIN!!! Gregson: Well then, Mr Natsume... ...it would appear you're gonna have to accompany me down to the Yard...again. Soseki: But, but, but... But wait! HOLD YOUR HORSES! Gregson: Yes? Soseki: Door! Key! Locked! Entry! Exit! Entirely! Impossible! Ryunosuke: (He's so flustered he's being even stranger than normal...) Gregson: What, you think that's an alibi? You could have just made a copy. Soseki: Wha...? Gregson: You live in the same buildin', after all. You'd have had plenty of opportunity, I'm sure. Soseki: B-B-B-B-But... MISERY MEEEEEEEEE! Gregson: Sorry, sir, you'll get your chance to give your side of the story later. Sholmes: The facts speak for themselves, Mr Moustache. Soseki: Aaargh...you...you... You horrible Herr Lock Sholmes! Ryunosuke: (He really has found himself an arch-rival now, hasn't he?) Gregson: Come on now, no dilly-dallyin'. Outside! There's a carriage waitin'. Soseki: Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire! I, I never imagined I'd be in this position again, but... YOU HAVE TO HELP ME! Please! Please! I'm innocent! Ryunosuke: ...Alright, I understand. We'll come to your cell later and talk about it. Soseki: And one more thing! Ryunosuke: Oh! Yes? Soseki: My, my poor little kitty-cat... Please give him his breakfast for me! And so... ...his evil curse still apparently unbroken... ...Soseki-san found himself once again the prime suspect in a case of murder. Thanks to the incriminating deduction of the great detective. Sholmes: My dear fellow, that honour belongs to you! Ryunosuke: Well, at least that means Inspector Gregson is no longer here. We can examine the crime scene in more detail now. Susato: Yes, that's right. Ah, and of course... Ryunosuke: What? Susato: Have you forgotten what the inspector mentioned before? It was the landlord, Mr Garrideb, who discovered Mr Shamspeare. Ryunosuke: Ah, Mr John Garrideb, yes... Susato: I expect we could find him in his sitting room on the top floor as usual. Ryunosuke: Right. We must remember to go and talk to him later, then. After examining meter on wall, teacup, bricked-up window twice, and paper scrap on floor: ???: ...Looks like you're havin' a good snoop around, eh? Ryunosuke: Inspector Gregson! B-Back so soon? Gregson: After I threw that little Japanese fella in the clink, I went and reported this to the investigation division. In five minutes' time, this place will be cordoned off by the Yard. Ryunosuke: Oh, I see. Well, we'd better be leaving then. Susato: Poor Mr Natsume must be feeling very low, being back in a cell again so soon... Ryunosuke: I'm sure. We should probably go...and......... Susato: What's wrong, Mr Naruhodo? KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!! Shamspeare: 'Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player... That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, And then is heard no more...' ......... ...Now, how soundeth the next part? Gregson: 'It is a tale. Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.' Shamspeare: Indeed! Oh, happy day! Ryunosuke: Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa... ...WALKING DEEEEEEEEEAD!!! Gregson: The, the fella isn't dead at all?! Ryunosuke: What was that nonsense he was saying, though? Susato: I think... Yes, it was from William Shakespeare's 'Macbeth'. A soliloquy from Act Five, Scene Five. Ryunosuke: Shakespeare... So it was... ...that the victim, Mr William Shamspeare...'came back to life'. If the man had indeed been poisoned, it transpired that it hadn't killed him. He was taken by emergency carriage to a nearby hospital for treatment. And Inspector Gregson evicted us from the scene of the crime...whatever that now was. 21st February Briar Road Susato: Whatever do you think will happen now? Ryunosuke: ...Good question. What a strange situation for Mr Natsume. Arrested for murder, but then the victim comes back to life! Susato: I think perhaps the victim was never dead in the first place. It seems very likely that Mr Shamspeare did consume poison, as we deduced... ...but was it an accident, attempted suicide...or attempted murder? Until the truth can be established, I imagine the police will keep Mr Natsume in custody. Ryunosuke: I suppose so... Let's hope it doesn't come to anything more than a night in the cells... (Oh...what's this? What's that man doing over there? He looks like he's trying to see into Soseki-san's lodgings...) Susato: Is something wrong, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Um, excuse me! Could we have a word? ???: Ah! Ryunosuke: (He just ran off...) Susato: I feel sure that I've seen that man somewhere before. Where was it...? Ryunosuke: Hm... (I do too, but I don't remember...) 21st February Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy 21st February The Garridebs' Room Ryunosuke: (Here we are again. The eccentric landlord's eccentric top floor abode...) Susato: We're here because Mr Garrideb's the one who discovered the incident this morning, don't forget. Garrideb: Ah...you chaps, eh? Ryunosuke: Yes, good morning, sir. Garrideb: Thank you for your...cooperation in court yesterday. Ryunosuke: (It was quite a trial... As much for Mr Garrideb as anyone, really.) Garrideb: Came straight back here after all that business at the Bailey yesterday. Didn't expect to wake up to more bally nonsense this morning! Susato: I wonder...if you wouldn't mind telling us exactly what happened, Mr Garrideb? Garrideb: Yes...I suppose you'd like to know all about that dead loss of an actor chap in the ground floor room. Ryunosuke: (Those were exactly Inspector Gregson's words, weren't they?) After clearing all Converse options with John Garrideb and examining meter on wall, teacup, bricked-up window twice, and paper scrap on floor in Mr Natsume's Lodgings, Ground Floor: Ryunosuke: Well, we've done as much investigating here as we can, I think. Perhaps we ought to go to the prison and speak with Mr Natsume again. Susato: A good idea! 21st February Local Prison, Cell 9 Susato: Look, Mr Naruhodo. Mr Natsume...have the police finished questioning you now? Soseki: Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire! Ryunosuke: Oh! Y-Yes? Soseki: What is he? Tell me! Is he a ghost? Is he here to haunt me?! Ryunosuke: Let me guess... You're talking about Mr Sholmes? Susato: He actually calls himself a great detective, Mr Natsume. Not a ghost. Soseki: But, but his diabolic deductions... They're not of this world... They've...they've...they've left me... AAAH! Cursed! I'm cursed, I tell you! Ryunosuke: (Well, that sort of hurts...) Susato: Credit where credit is due, Mr Naruhodo. You were heavily involved in the deduction, too. Ryunosuke: Yes, um...moving on... We have some wonderful news! Soseki: Oh? Susato: The victim that we all thought was dead...has come back to life again! Soseki: ......... Ryunosuke: Now, in the absolutely worst case, you could only be tried for attempted murder! That's...great, isn't it? Mr Natsume? Soseki: IT'S TERRIBLE! Susato: Oh! Soseki: I'm stuck! In this cell! Suffering! For some silly! Wrong end of the stick! 'You did it, didn't you?' 'Confess!' 'You're a killer!' 'Why the moustache?' CONSTANT QUESTIONS! Ryunosuke: I'm sorry to hear that... Soseki: ARGH, THAT SELFISH SHYSTER! Make up your mind! Are you dead or alive? If you were going to come back to life, why bother dying? Wickedly Wishy-Washy William! Ryunosuke: Well...it seems likely that Mr Shamspeare was never actually dead in the first place. Soseki: Ah, yes, that might make sense... And I'm pleased that he's alive, of course. Our lively debate last night was much fun. I'd be sad to think it was our last. Susato: Oh! Soseki: Oops. Ryunosuke: Um, Mr Natsume...does this mean... ...that you did see the victim last night? You met with Mr Shamspeare, didn't you? Soseki: ......... I'm not saying another word! I demand to have a lawyer present! Ryunosuke: Who do you think I am? Please, Mr Natsume, we need to hear your side of the story! Soseki: Ugh... Why am I cursed like this...? After clearing all Converse options: Soseki: Of course... ...Mr Lord-of-the-Manor is worried about the curse on my room as well. Ryunosuke: You mean Mr Garrideb? Soseki: Yes. He knows that if people keep dying there, he'll never be able to rent it out again. Ryunosuke: Well, that's true. I, for one, wouldn't go near the place. Susato: Ah... Perhaps... ...that may explain why the landlord pays so much attention to the gas lamps and his tenants' movements. Ryunosuke: You mean...because he's worried about their well-being? (He does seem to have an unusually keen interest in the amount of gas in the pipes... There must be a reason why he keeps such close tabs on the occupants of his let rooms.) Soseki: What do you mean, 'he pays so much attention to the gas lamps'? Susato: Oh dear! No! It's nothing to do with you, Mr Natsume! Please, forget I said anything! Soseki: Oh, now you're talking about me behind my back as well... Ryunosuke: What's important is that Mr Shamspeare isn't in fact dead at all. Once he's come round and he's able to tell us what happened, we'll be able to get you released. Soseki: Yes, please! Oh, I do hope you're right! ???: Ahem! Excuse me... Ryunosuke: Inspector Gregson! Gregson: I couldn't help overhearin' what you just said. And on that note... ...I have some good news and some bad news. Soseki: Oh. Gregson: Which d'you want first? Soseki: Always! Every time! The bad news comes first! 'When hope is all you have, hold onto it!' That's my guiding principle! Gregson: Right, well, in that case...the good news it is! Soseki: Huh? Gregson: Sorry, but it's just a lot easier to explain everythin' that way. Soseki: ...Then why did you ask me my preference? Gregson: As you might have heard, the victim, Mr Shamspeare, was just unconscious. He's come round now. Ryunosuke: Yes...we saw it happen in all its terrifying glory. Gregson: He's still bein' treated by the doctors, but we've managed to get a written statement from him already. Susato: Oh, isn't that wonderful, Mr Natsume? Soseki: Oh, thank goodness... It's all over, then. I can leave this sombre cell... Gregson: Sorry, no. That's not on the cards. Soseki: What? Susato: Why ever not, Inspector? Gregson: Mr Shamspeare has implicated someone as bein' responsible for what happened last night. Ryunosuke: Implicated someone? Susato: Oh dear! Soseki: You, you don't mean...? Gregson: I'm sorry to say I do, yes. He's pointed the finger at you, Mr Natsume. Soseki: ARGH! Gregson: 'By sweet poison did he seeketh to end my life. That wicked'st caitiff...Soseki Natsume!' Ryunosuke: No! Gregson: So I'm afraid you'll be appearin' in court as planned. You'll be wantin' to make the necessary preparations. Soseki: Nnnnnn... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH! Ryunosuke: And so...once again, Soseki-san found himself having to take the dock in the Old Bailey. Whether his room was haunted or whether he was just terribly unlucky, I knew I had no choice... The following day I would represent him in court, and do my utmost to break the curse that blighted him!

Susato: What is it, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: This bar of soap... When we first found it, I could have sworn... ...there was some sort of round disk in this depression just here. A reddish one. Susato: Yes, you're right. I remember it, too. But now the depression is completely empty. Ryunosuke: (Where could the disk have gone...?) The details of the bar of soap have been updated in the Court Record. Circular depression (subsequent times) Ryunosuke: ...Oh. Susato: What is it, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: This bar of soap... When we first found it, I could have sworn... ...there was some sort of round disk in this depression just here. A reddish one. Susato: Yes, you're right. I remember it, too. But now the depression is completely empty. Ryunosuke: (Where could the disk have gone...?)Ryunosuke: (The Old Bailey... This place always makes me feel strange. I seem to get chills down my spine and break out in a nervous sweat all at the same time...) Well...I didn't think I'd be back here so soon.???:That's my line!Soseki: GOOD MORNING!Ryunosuke: Ah! Good morning, Mr Natsume.Soseki: It was only two days ago that I was declared not guilty here.Ryunosuke: (Yes, we somehow managed to prove he didn't stab Miss Green in the back...)Soseki: BUT NOW THIS! ANOTHER MORNING, ANOTHER MURDER! AND HERE I AM AGAIN IN THIS HELLHOLE!Can't Keep Coming to Court!Ryunosuke: (I'm beginning to think he's right. It really does seem as though he's cursed.)Susato: Mr Naruhodo! I'm afraid I have bad news! .........Oh! Mr Natsume... Good morning.Soseki: ...Yes, morning.Susato: So...here we are again!Soseki: ...Yes, again.Susato: .........Soseki: ......... JUDICIAL ASSISTANT MISS MIKOTOBA ESQUIRESS! WHAT'S THE BAD NEWS?Susato: Oh dear... You heard, did you?Soseki: If you come in shouting at the top of your voice...PEOPLE CAN'T HELP HEARING WHAT YOU SAY!Susato: Oh... I am sorry.Ryunosuke: You've done nothing wrong, Miss Susato. Now, what is it?Susato: ......... Well...it seems that the prosecution in today's trial... ...will be led by Lord Barok van Zieks.Ryunosuke: Van, van Zieks...?Soseki: GAAAAARGH! Oh no... Oh no no...Ryunosuke: (The so-called 'Reaper of the Bailey'... The most legendary prosecutor in the land... In the trial two days ago, he pursued Soseki-san and I relentlessly. Of course, by the skin of our teeth, we managed to pull through, but still...)Susato: Perhaps Mr Natsume's acquittal in the last trial wasn't the end of the matter. After all...Ryunosuke: Yes, I know what you're thinking. The legend of the Reaper that says... ...nothing can save a person in the dock when Lord van Zieks is the prosecutor.Soseki: Oh no...Susato: That even if that person is found not guilty...the accused will meet a mysterious end one way or another...Ryunosuke: (And we've experienced it firsthand. A man we successfully defended met the most terrifying end after his acquittal...right here in the Old Bailey...)Soseki: AGH! DO I HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THOSE ICE-COLD EYES BORING INTO MY SOUL AGAIN?! CURSED BY EVIL SPIRITS AND NOW BY THE REAPER!Pair of Petrifying Perils, Potentially!Susato: Well, if it's 'potentially'...at least you appear to have hope, Mr Natsume.Soseki: Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire!Ryunosuke: Ah! ...Yes?!Soseki: I'm...I'M INNOCENT! YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME! You, more than anyone now...Ryunosuke: ......... Don't worry. I'll be your steadfast ally every step of the way in this battle. ...I promise! (...And this promises to be a hard battle, I fear...)Susato: Well... ...the trial is scheduled to begin shortly. We should move into the courtroom.Ryunosuke: Let's go!Susato: Oh yes, I forgot to say... I'm afraid he won't be able to make it. Mr Sholmes, I mean.Ryunosuke: ......... That's probably for the best.Susato: Oh!Ryunosuke: If he were here, I might be tempted to rely on his help. And that could be seen as a weakness. If Lord van Zieks were to notice, he'd prey on it mercilessly. At least, that's my gut feeling.Susato: Mr Naruhodo...Soseki: You're right... Yes, you're so right. Oh, well said, Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire! Well said!Ryunosuke: I swear on this sword at my side, and on the spirit of Kazuma that it harbours... ...I'll show him what a Japanese lawyer can do! I'll set you free...with honour!Susato: Oh yes!22nd February, 9:40 a.m. The Old Bailey CourtroomJudge: In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session. I now call upon the counsels for the prosecution and defence to declare their willingness to proceed.Van Zieks: The prosecution is ready.Ryunosuke: The defence is ready, My Lord.Van Zieks: Readiness for the trial, my learned Nipponese friend, is not what the defence needs. What you need...is readiness for your inevitable defeat.Ryunosuke: ......... (It's not just in my imagination; it's really there... Lord van Zieks has such an animosity towards us Japanese for some reason...)Susato: It was some time ago now that he first became known as the Reaper of the Bailey, I believe. These past few years, he hasn't appeared in court at all.Ryunosuke: Yet now he's back in the courtroom. Though for some reason... ...only when I'm defending. (This 'Reaper', with his curious disdain for us Japanese, is a prosecutor shrouded in mystery. Still...this isn't the time to be pondering that. I have to concentrate on Soseki-san's trial.)Judge: Furthermore, I now call upon the six ladies and gentlemen of the jury. You have been chosen at random to represent the will of the people in this trial. Are you ready to fulfil your duty?Juror No. 1: Absolutely! I had a feeling this larrikin wasn't innocent before!Juror No. 2: I must say that I feel especially ruthless on days when my hat refuses to sit right!Juror No. 3: Oh...well I rather like how you're wearing your hat. I think the ruthless look is very fetching, actually...Juror No. 4: I need to be somewhere at ten o'clock. I have a very important meeting. Let's make this quick.Juror No. 5: I couldn't agree more. I need to take home five bob tonight, or the missus will go through the roof!Juror No. 6: Oh, may the Lord show us all the light here, and lead His flock to a righteous verdict...Susato: The British jury system is so very different to our own, isn't it? It's quite extraordinary to think that the power of judgement is in the hands of six members of the public. And that the judge can only pass sentence when all jurors are in agreement about the defendant's guilt.Ryunosuke: (Six citizens of London, chosen at random... Or at least, that's the idea.)Van Zieks: The prosecution would draw attention to the fact that the accused was on trial here but two days ago. Accordingly, where possible, the same jurors have been asked to return for duty today.Judge: Very well, let us commence the trial. Lord van Zieks...your opening statement, please.Van Zieks: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, it is not the intent of the prosecution to cast doubt over your past decision... However, the innocent verdict afforded to this eccentric Nipponese before...has had dire consequences. Did the accused repent for his wrongdoing in that affair? Far from it. Instead, he used his freedom to perpetrate a most blood-curdling crime! Namely, that of the attempted murder of his neighbouring lodger, an innocent Englishman.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: To explain the circumstances of the crime, the prosecution calls its first witnesses to the stand... ...the detective responsible for investigating the scene, and the accused himself!Van Zieks: Witnesses, your names and occupations, please.Gregson: Yes, sir! Tobias Gregson, Detective Inspector at Scotland Yard's homicide division.Soseki: ......... Ah! Soseki Natsume from the Empire of Japan! My government ordered me to come here as a student to study your language and culture.Judge: Mr Natsume...Soseki: Yes! My Lord, sir!Judge: I'm quite sure I'm not mistaken... ...that you swore on oath...never to set foot in my courtroom again. I remember it as if it were yesterday.Van Zieks: The day before, in fact, My Lord. But close enough.Soseki: Ugh...believe me, this is the last place I want to be...Van Zieks: Inspector, let's hear from you first. Explain the case for the court.Gregson: Right you are, sir! The incident occurred at the Garrideb household where the defendant has lodgings... ...in the ground floor room of the victim, Mr William Shamspeare. The defendant has already admitted to visitin' the victim on the night in question. Mr Shamspeare collapsed in his room as a result of poisonin' by strychnine. He was found the followin' mornin' when the landlord, suspectin' somethin' was wrong, broke down the door.Judge: This means, I presume, that the door to the victim's room was locked at the time of the incident?Van Zieks: Correct, My Lord. It was locked from the inside, making entry to or exit from the room impossible.Gregson: Although the victim, Mr Shamspeare, lives to tell tale... ...he very nearly didn't. The man was halfway to Heaven when we first found him.Judge: Hmmm...Gregson: I was the first officer on the scene, My Lord... ...and I have a photographic print here that I took at the time to show how it looked.Judge: Yes, a chilling scene indeed. The man looks very much deceased.Gregson: That's right. Everyone present believed that's exactly what he was.Judge: Very well, I shall accept this photographic print as evidence for the court.The crime scene photograph has been entered into the Court Record.Judge: Now then, Mr Natsume...Soseki: Ah! Y-Yes...yes...YES?!Judge: As the defendant, do you have anything to say at this juncture?Soseki: ......... They're, they're haunted... Haunted by evil sp-spirits...Judge: Good gracious! What's haunted?Soseki: MY LODGINGS! THERE'S BEEN A WHOLE SERIES OF STRANGE HAPPENINGS IN MY LODGINGS! The tenant before me died in mysterious circumstances! A woman was stabbed by no one on the street outside! My neighbour was poisoned! And ME! WHAT ABOUT ME?! I've nearly been killed countless times!Judge: Killed, Mr Natsume? How?Soseki: Even on that fateful night, it happened. When I returned from Mr Shamspeare's room... ...I lit my gas stove and climbed into bed, but before long... ...the stove went out, AND SOMEBODY TRIED TO KILL ME!Judge: You must always extinguish all fires before retiring for the night, Mr Natsume.Soseki: BUT IT'S SO COLD! My, my runny nose would freeze! The point is, I, I didn't poison my neighbour. Oh...why am I being accused of this? Why is my existence so cursed...?Judge: Thank you, witnesses. I believe I have a reasonably clear picture of events.Van Zieks: If I could raise one more point, My Lord. One more...conclusive point.Judge: Conclusive? Go on...Van Zieks: Fortunately, the victim, Mr Shamspeare, has regained consciousness after his ordeal. And he has named the true culprit.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: The poison consumed by the victim was administered in a cup of tea that he drank on the night in question. Tea, My Lord, that was brought to the victim's room by the accused.Judge: The accused...? Good grief! Ordaaar! Ordaaar!Ryunosuke: (Yes...that's the crux of this whole case. If Soseki-san is innocent, then why...? Why has the victim accused him?)Judge: Well, Mr Natsume? What have you to say to this accusation?Soseki: That evening, yes...I did take some freshly brewed tea with me when I visited Mr Shamspeare's room, as a gift. The public water pump outside always freezes at night, so I bought bottled water especially to make it. And this is the result! Never will I touch tea again! Never!Ryunosuke: The public pump was frozen, you say?Susato: That's not information we've heard before.Judge: That will do, thank you. Now, according to our laws, the defence must have the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses at least once. Therefore, I call upon these witnesses now for a formal testimony. ...I presume the prosecution has no objection?Van Zieks: None whatsoever, My Lord.Judge: Good. Then you will give your account of events on the night in question to the court now.Soseki: Ye-Ye-Ye...YEEEEEESSS, MY LORD!Witness Testimony - The Catastrophic Night -Soseki: It was around nine o'clock that evening when I visited my neighbour, and I took some tea with me as a gift. We had a heated literary debate over a nice, hot drink. After which I went back to my room, at around eleven. Argh! My tea was completely harmless! He couldn't have locked the door behind me otherwise, could he?Gregson: Strychnine takes some time to have an effect on the body. People don't keel over immediately after takin' it. The victim would have been perfectly able to lock the door after his guest left. The argument still stands.Judge: Hm, yes, I see... It all seems relatively straightforward.Susato: Excuse me, but...that testimony does raise one rather crucial point, I think. Mr Natsume claims his tea to have been harmless. Presumably, though... ...the teacups have been examined for traces of the poison...haven't they?Ryunosuke: (Why didn't I think of that?)Gregson: Well, as it happens, no. We haven't been able to.Judge: Did I hear you correctly, Inspector? Scotland Yard has failed to examine the suspect substance?Ryunosuke: How could you have overlooked something so important?! Isn't that the first thing you should have done?Van Zieks: ...My learned Nipponese friend is falsely incensed.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: The inspector said Scotland Yard was unable to examine the tea. Not that it was overlooked.Ryunosuke: Unable? Why?Gregson: It's simple enough. There was none left. Not a drop. Someone must have been very thirsty indeed.Van Zieks: With current scientific techniques, it's not possible to test for poison under such circumstances.Gregson: We only need a drop, but that one drop does actually have to exist, funnily enough.Judge: Hmmm...Van Zieks: The lack of examination notwithstanding... ...it appears nothing other than the tea passed the victim's lips on the night in question.Ryunosuke: ...!Judge: I see. Thank you. The matter is clear.Van Zieks: Cast your eyes over the jury, my learned friend.Ryunosuke: What?Van Zieks: You can see it in their faces, I'm sure. The recognition of the accused's guilt. Your client's fate is all but sealed. In mere moments from now...you will lose, and your compatriot will be damned for all eternity!Ryunosuke: (He's right. I can feel all six of the jurors looking daggers at me. But I can't let them beat me down... I won't...)Judge: Counsel for the Defence...proceed with your cross-examination!Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord!Cross-Examination - The Catastrophic Night -\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Susato Mikotoba\nDescription: A judicial assistant sent to Britain on a study tour.

However, the evidence concerning the Pair of Teacups indicates a crucial detail: there is no tea ring inside Soseki's cup. This detail strongly suggests that Soseki did not actually drink tea from his own cup—contradicting his testimony that both men shared a \"nice, hot drink\".\n\nThis contradiction can cast doubt on the prosecution narrative, because if Soseki didn't drink, he may have had reason to avoid the tea (knowing it was poisoned, if guilty) or the claim that both shared tea as a friendly act is at least partially false. This is a significant point for the defence to raise.\n",

As the victim lay at death's door, thy mystery of just who had stabbed the young lady from behind had been resolved. But no sooner had my friend saved that Eastern exchange student from his harrowing plight, than in the dim, flickering shadows of gaslight did a second bizarre crime rend the stillness of that very night. I daresay most can still recall the sensational headlines of the day. 'Haunted Apartment of Death' 'The Condemned Criminal's Curse' 'The Dread Demon of Coal Gas' Yet, though the great detective had at once discerned the truth upon his arrival at the scene, it only proved to be the overture that announced the rising of the curtain on a most tragic play. My name is Ryunosuke Naruhodo. I'm a fledgling lawyer, just starting out on my journey. Six months ago, I arrived as a visiting student of law... ...having made the long voyage across the sea from the Empire of Japan to here...London, England. And on the way, in quite extraordinary circumstances, I made the acquaintance of a world-famous detective. Currently, I reside in the attic of the detective's own lodgings, from where I run my legal consultancy of sorts. I've successfully defended a number of clients in Britain's highest court, the Old Bailey. But since a particularly gruelling and unforgettable legal battle four months ago now... ...I haven't returned to the courtroom. In truth, I lost my right to return. But that epic trial was just part of an epic tale. A tale which was now about to awaken from slumber... ...thanks to a letter that arrived this morning from my homeland... *Ruuumble* Ryunosuke: ......... (Mmm, what a delicious smell wafting up the stairs... It must be nearly time for breakfast. I'd better go down to Mr Sholmes's suite... ...and say good morning to the great detective and his flatmate.) 30th August, 7:28 a.m. Sholmes's Suite Iris: Ah, Runo, good! I was just about to call up to you. The bacon's ready. Ryunosuke: Good morning, Iris. It smells delicious as usual. Before we eat, though, I have some news. I had a surprise this morning- Sholmes: Shh! Not another word, Mr Naruhodo! This could be just the abstruse thing for my pre-breakfast stagnation-repelling mental stimulation, my dear fellow. Ryunosuke: 'Morning' to you too, Mr Sholmes. Sholmes: Ah...yes...I see... So that's it... The truth is as clear to me as day. My faculties of observation have revealed it again. Ryunosuke: Wh-What are you talking about? Sholmes: You, Mr Naruhodo. You have, this very morning, met with a surprise! ...Well? Is that not the case? Ryunosuke: Um... Sholmes: Really, my dear fellow, it barely warrants explanation. Firstly, your hair is particularly unkempt. Somewhat reminiscent of a bird's nest. Secondly, you have neglected to fasten the third button of your jacket. Clearly, when considered together, these two facts point to you having been flustered this morning. Ryunosuke: ......... Can I talk now? Sholmes: But of course, of course! Though I don't look for admiration, you understand. Ryunosuke: My hair always looks like this. It's been this way since I first met you. Sholmes: Oh. It has? Ryunosuke: And the button...was ripped off last night, if you remember? ...By you. Iris: Hurley pulled your button off? Sholmes: ......... Ah yes, I recall the incident now. It was after supper, was it not? As the evening advanced, I picked up my violin and began to play the wailing notes of a haunting tune. But then, to my utter dismay, the third string snapped! Why did it have to happen? WHY?! Little wonder then, that in my vexation, I grabbed the first button I saw and ripped it from its proper place! Ryunosuke: ...Well, I'd like it back now, please. It's troubling me that I can't fasten my jacket. Sholmes: And it's troubling me that you expect me to know where it is! Somewhere thereabouts on the floor, one presumes. Ryunosuke: (Helpful.) Sholmes: What matters at the present time, my dear fellow, is simply whether or not my deduction was unerring. Iris: But Hurley, Runo said it when he came in, didn't he? 'I had a surprise this morning.' Sholmes: ......... Ah ha ha ha ha hah! Well, that really is a surprise! Ryunosuke: (Yes, this man is the pride of the British Empire. The famous consulting detective, Mr Herlock Sholmes. There can't be a single person in the world who doesn't know his name.) Iris: Alright then, enough of this silly conversation. Come and eat this bacon before it goes cold. And I have a new herbal tea for you to try, too! My latest special blend! Ryunosuke: (And here we have Iris Wilson, Mr Sholmes's lodger and companion. A truly exceptional young girl, who's the author of a highly successful serialisation here in London. Yes, 'The Adventures of Herlock Sholmes' as published in Randst Magazine.) Sholmes: So, Mr Naruhodo, won't you put us out of our misery? What surprised you this fine morning? Ryunosuke: Ah, well, I received a letter...from Japan. Iris: Oh! From Susie, you mean?! Was it? Really? Ryunosuke: That's right. And she had some rather startling news, in fact. Sholmes: Ah... intriguing indeed. You must tell us all about it over breakfast! Iris: Oh yes! What fun! After clearing all Converse options: Ryunosuke: Summoning her back to Japan so suddenly like that... I wonder what Miss Susato's father is hiding. Iris: Hmmm... Hurley, do you know what it's all about? Sholmes: ...Hm? Ah, well, who can say? Ryunosuke: What? But, but you said... Sholmes: Please, I have engagements, my dear fellow! My calendar is quite surprisingly full today. And a stringent analysis of the matter would be excessive, I feel. Even if I were quite at leisure. So! Man the fort in my absence, won't you, Iris? Iris: I will, Hurley, don't worry. See you later! Ryunosuke: (He scuttled off rather quickly there... I think perhaps Professor Mikotoba isn't the only person hiding something here. Soseki-san was involved in two cases, but only one of them was forbidden from being published. By, of all people...Mr Sholmes.) Iris: Ah-ha! I've found them at last! Ryunosuke: Iris! Are, are they...? Iris: The notes about the case? That's right. Susie and I compiled them together. 'The Case of the Haunted Lodgings'... Do you want to read them, Runo? Ryunosuke: ......... Absolutely. Thank you, Iris. I have no idea what secrets could still be hiding in the shadows of this case... ...but perhaps if I read over the notes again, something might come to light. Iris: That's the spirit! And so... ...Iris and I decided to read over the case notes again together. Everything from what happened, to our investigation and that fierce battle in court that followed. Reliving every detail... I just need to find a clue. And I have all the time in the world. Because of course... ...I'm no longer allowed to practise law in the courts of Great Britain. It was six months ago... A mysterious incident that unfolded on the wintry streets of London. A young woman was found lying on the snowy pavement of Briar Road with a knife in her back. Fortunately, her life was spared, but she was unconscious for several days following the incident. The fog was thick, and nobody saw her attacker, but... ...by a cruel twist of fate, a visiting Japanese student was walking behind her at the time, and was duly arrested. That man was Soseki-san. And the man who effected his arrest...was Mr Sholmes. Believing in our compatriot's innocence, Susato-san and I decided to represent Soseki-san in court. And, after a gruelling trial of many twists and turns, we finally managed to prove his innocence. Soseki: Joyful, Joyous, Jubilant Jubilation! Ryunosuke: ...Was the man's reaction after the trial. But his jubilant jubilation was short lived. We received a telegram from Mr Sholmes the following morning. 'The victim of the Briar Road stabbing has regained consciousness. Hurry to Barts at once!' So Susato-san and I summoned a hansom and headed immediately to the hospital. Before clearing all Converse options in Sholmes's Suite: 30th August Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy 21st February, 5:30 a.m. St Bartholomew's Hospital, Recovery Ward Sholmes: There you are at last! Ryunosuke: Good morning, Mr Sholmes. Sholmes: I think not. Susato: Oh! Sholmes: You're late! What on earth took you so long! Susato: Your telegram only arrived at five o'clock, Mr Sholmes. And it's a twenty-minute ride to the hospital. Ryunosuke: That's right, and it's half past five now. I think we made very good time. Sholmes: The time is utterly irrelevant! The fact is, I have been waiting for what has felt like an eternity. Ryunosuke: Haah... Sholmes: In point of fact, I myself was awoken at four this morning by a telegram boy. And feeling it was somewhat unjust that I alone had been roused at such an hour, I sent one to you. Ryunosuke: (Well thanks for that.) Sholmes: Anyway, you're here now, so... The victim is over there. She's only just regained consciousness. You should introduce yourselves. And I shall observe from here. Ryunosuke: (So that's the lady who was found on the snow-covered pavement with the knife in her back...) Susato: Her name is... Ah yes, here we are. Miss Green. After clearing all Converse options with Olive Green and examining picture frame: ???: Is there a Mr Narrowfodder here? Mr Narrowfoddeeer?! Ryunosuke: ('Narrowfodder' now...?) Well, um, if you're looking for Naruhodo, the lawyer, that's me, but... ???: Ah! Mr Narrowfodder, good. This is for you. It's a message from a Mr Saucy Nutsmeg. Ryunosuke: Mr Natsume?! Sent a message...to me? Susato: But why would a policeman be delivering a message from Mr Natsume? Ryunosuke: Exactly... (What's going on? What's a Scotland Yard constable doing playing delivery boy at this time in the morning?) Sholmes: Argh, what are you waiting for?! Let me see that! Ryunosuke: Oh! Sholmes: ......... Well...this is most unexpected... Ryunosuke: Is something wrong, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: 'Is something wrong, Mr Sholmes?' he says! Have you not seen this note?! Ryunosuke: No, how could I have?! Sholmes: It would seem that London's criminals have no intention of letting the great detective rest. A new case calls. A case of murder, no less. ...We must depart at once! Susato: Murder?! Sholmes: Call a cab! Time is of the essence! Ryunosuke: But...the trouble is... ...we've yet to read Mr Natsume's note. I was thinking we ought to pay him a visit in his lodgings once we did. Sholmes: That will be entirely convenient. Susato: Convenient? What do you mean? Sholmes: It's all here in the note, my dear fellows. The murder we must investigate...took place at Mr Moustache's lodgings! Ryunosuke: Wait...WHAT?! Susato: I'll hail a fiacre at once! (It was only yesterday that Soseki-san was in court and we were dispelling doubts about his innocence. And now...the very next day... ...there's a murder at the man's own address? He may very well be the unluckiest man alive.) ...Or so it seemed to us at the time, but we were soon to discover it was worse than we thought. 21st February Sholmes's Suite 21st February, 7:18 a.m. Mr Natsume's Lodgings, Ground Floor Ryunosuke: What on earth...?! Susato: Oh my! The gentleman is deceased, without question! He's dead! Soseki: L-L-L-Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire! Ryunosuke: Mr Natsume! Soseki: Oh...why...? Why is this happening? Why to me? I'VE ONLY JUST GOT OUT OF COURT! YESTERDAY! I WAS FINALLY HOME AFTER TWO DAYS OF MISERY! AND THEN I WAKE UP THE NEXT DAY TO THIS! NO EARLY BIRD SHOULD CATCH A WORM LIKE THIS! WOEFUL WORM WITHOUT WIGGLE! Sholmes: I see you're in high spirits again this morning, Mr Moustache. Soseki: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!!! Not the horrible HERR LOCK SHOLMES! SHOO! SHOVE OFF! SHOW YOURSELF THE DOOR! I NEVER INVITED YOU! Susato: Mr Sholmes came here with us. I'm quite sure he'll be able to help you, Mr Natsume! Sholmes: I am entirely at your disposal, Mr Moustache. What can I do for you? Soseki: GRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR! Gregson: Tsk, here they are...already. The busybodies. Sholmes: Ah, Inspector Gregson. What a pleasant surprise. Gregson: Pleasant, is it? Gives me heartburn every time I see your face at a crime scene, Sholmes. Sholmes: Hah! I deduce, Inspector...that your heartburn is a result of your excessive consumption of fried food. Ryunosuke: Um...good morning, Inspector. Gregson: .........This is a crime scene! Don't you go touchin' anythin'! Ryunosuke: (Or 'Good morning to you too, sunshine...') Ryunosuke: Um, Mr Sholmes, what are you doing? Sholmes: Hah! You need only observe to know it, my dear fellow. Investigating, naturally! Ryunosuke: ...There's nothing natural about that pose. Susato: Mr Sholmes! Have you made some miraculous discovery? Sholmes: Patience, my dear madam, patience. We've not been here in this room five minutes. So far, all I've managed to deduce is what actually happened. Susato: My goodness! But...isn't that everything we need to know, Mr Sholmes? Sholmes: Hm... Now that you propose the idea, I believe one could, indeed, see it that way. At the present time, I have managed to draw two incontrovertible conclusions. The first, that there was a physical struggle here last night in which the victim fought for his life. Soseki: AAAAAAAAAH! Susato: Ah! Ryunosuke: Mr Natsume, what's wrong? Is something that Mr Sholmes said significant somehow? Soseki: N-No... Don't mind me! Forget I was here! Sholmes: And my second conclusion... ...is that there was a poison lingering in the air here last night that passed the victim's lips. Soseki: N-N-N-NONSENSE! Susato: Ah! Ryunosuke: Alright, Mr Natsume. Why are you reacting so extremely to Mr Sholmes's deductions? Soseki: N-N-N-No... Please! Pretend I'm not here! Invisible, Ineffable, Inscrutable...Insignificant! Ryunosuke: ...Impossible to ignore. Susato: You must tell us everything, Mr Sholmes! Spare no detail! Sholmes: ......... But of course. Let the theatrical tragedy before us be unravelled by my great deductions, presented for your pleasure in two acts! Ryunosuke: (We've heard some truly astounding great deductions from Mr Sholmes in the past... No doubt this will be no exception. What miracles will unfold before our eyes this time?) Sholmes: So, my dear fellows, for your delight and wonder, let the curtain rise... ...for Herlock Sholmes's 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular', Act One! The Great Deduction The game is afoot! Topic 1 Cause of Death Sholmes: Careful observation of the victim reveals to us the events that transpired in this disconsolate room last night. Foam at the mouth of the deceased clearly indicates the use of poison. Next to the victim, we notice a large dining plate, which contains, you will observe... ...one half of a sizeable bar of soap. Meaningful? Indubitably. Why is this soap set so purposefully upon the dish? Like the victim's last supper, in fact. Yes... Could it be that the man was about to eat it? Of course, the fork reveals the answer. It appears that the young man's appetite was his undoing. Taking up arms in the form of his cutlery, the victim engaged in a deadly battle for his life. Yet the struggle against his hunger was in vain, for in the end, he couldn't resist devouring the slippery feast! But London's foul soap is besmirched by foul poison. Yes, the victim's life was claimed by poison that tainted the contents of the plate! The soap...and the lather about the young man's mouth are too perfectly matched to ignore. The cause of death was clearly intoxication due to excessive ingestion of foul soap! ...Though personally, I have a greater interest in the taste of foul candlewax, of course. Topic 1 Cause of Death Conclusion Poisoning from soap ingestion Topic 2 Suicide or Murder? Sholmes: The cause of death identified, we proceed to Act Two, where we ponder the next question: Was this suicide or murder? The audience will recall that death occurred during the victim's 'last supper'. Did the man dine and die alone? This single teacup suggests the answer. To draw a conclusion on such meagre evidence would be foolish however, certainly. The careful criminal could have absconded with his own cup to cover his tracks. Well, allow me to lift the veil of doubt, my dear fellow. Indeed. What reveals the answer, of course, is the broken lock! Though forced open now, at the time of the incident, this door was locked. And the sole key was in the victim's pocket. In other words, when the victim consumed the poison, he must have been alone. Alone with his inferior soap, from whence wafted an inferior scent. And with that acrid aroma lingering in the air, the victim met his end...in tragic solitude. We can take comfort only in the fact that his soul was well cleansed on its way to the hereafter. Topic 2 Suicide or Murder? Conclusion No possible perpetrator present Sholmes: Thus concludes the final act of Herlock Sholmes's great deduction! Susato: ......... Gregson: ......... Ryunosuke: ...There's just one thing, Mr Sholmes... Sholmes: You are disposed to identifying 'just one thing', aren't you, Mr Naruhodo? Pray, what concerns you? Ryunosuke: Well...no matter how hungry he was, do you really think the man would have eaten soap? Sholmes: It is quite apparent that this man had barely a penny to his name. It is a curious thing, but to one so destitute, soap can suddenly appear quite irresistibly appetising. Susato: How extraordinary! Sholmes: In truth, I have tried a little soap myself in the past. Ryunosuke: You've eaten it, you mean?! Sholmes: My dear fellow, it was some time ago now. My postulation was that it would cleanse my gut. Susato: And did it? Sholmes: As I writhed in agony on the floor and spilt the contents of my stomach...yes, I believe it did. The experience taught me a valuable lesson: soap is quite poisonous. It has an unpleasant taste and leads to great discomfort. In summary, I cannot recommend it. Ryunosuke: (Believe me, I wouldn't eat it even if you did.) Susato: There's something that troubles me as well, actually. Ryunosuke: Oh? What's that? Susato: It's Mr Natsume. Soseki: Ah! Susato: I couldn't help noticing him shuddering and quivering out of the corner of my eye. Almost as if Mr Sholmes's deductions touched a nerve somehow. Soseki: N-N-N-N-N-Nonsense... Ryunosuke: (Well, that clenched teeth episode didn't last...) Susato: I think...judging by Mr Natsume's reaction... ...the great detective's deductions may need some gentle corrections in order to reach the actual truth. Ryunosuke: (Yes, Mr Sholmes's observations and deductions are sometimes a little too sharp... He has a tendency to hit the nail on the side of the head and drive it in at an obtuse angle. When he does that, it falls to us to straighten things out.) Alright then, let's see what we can do. Susato: Yes, we must pick out the key words in Mr Sholmes's quite brilliant deductions... ...and discreetly exchange them for something that makes a little more sense. If we can do that... ...I'm sure we'll arrive at what Mr Sholmes meant to say in the first place! Sholmes: In that case...are you ready for the second performance of the day? Once again, my dear fellows, for your continued delight and wonder, let the curtain rise... ...for Herlock Sholmes's 'Logic and Reasoning Spectacular', Act One! Course Correction Hold it, Mr Sholmes! Topic 1 Cause of Death Conclusion Poisoning from soap ingestion Sholmes: Careful observation of the victim reveals to us the events that transpired in this disconsolate room last night. Foam at the mouth of the deceased clearly indicates the use of poison. Next to the victim, we notice a large dining plate, which contains, you will observe... ...one half of a sizeable bar of soap. Meaningful? Indubitably. Why is this soap set so purposefully upon the dish? Like the victim's last supper, in fact. Yes... Could it be that the man was about to eat it? Of course, the fork reveals the answer. Ryunosuke: Well, you can't deny that a fork implies the man was eating something, or about to eat something. Susato: Yes, that's true. If I were to decide to eat some soap, I should prefer to use a fork than to attempt it with chopsticks. Ryunosuke: And of course, only half of the bar of soap is left on the plate. Susato: But might there not be some other explanation? Something material that proves whether or not the man really ate some soap... Could it be that the man was about to eat it? Of course, the fork reveals the answer. Ryunosuke: Some soup on a plate, and a fork in hand... Even so, surely you wouldn't try to eat soap, no matter how hungry you were. Susato: That's what we must determine: was the victim eating soap when he died or not? Until we can establish that with some certainty, we shan't make any progress. Ryunosuke: (Talk about a slippery problem...) Ryunosuke: Could it be that the man was about to eat it? Of course, the other piece of soap reveals the answer. Sholmes: It being the other half of the soap on the table. In short, the victim was not eating soap at all. But it's obvious, really. For no depths of hunger could drive any man to attempt to eat soap. Even I, with my unquenchable thirst for practical knowledge, took only a single bite! Ryunosuke: But that begs the question of how the man was poisoned. Because there's no sign of any food on the table. Sholmes: An excellent observation, Mr Naruhodo. And one that furnishes us with the answer we seek. For London's foul soap is besmirched by foul poison. Yes, the victim's life was claimed by poison that tainted the contents of the plate! Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes is still pushing the soap argument, then. Susato: Perhaps he's suggesting the man licked the soap rather than ate it. Ryunosuke: If soap in London is that poisonous, I don't think I want to be washing my hands with it. (But there are no signs of any food in this room at all.) Susato: Of course, food isn't the only thing that passes people's lips, is it? Yes, the victim's life was claimed by poison that tainted the contents of the plate! Ryunosuke: If the cause of death was poison, how did it get into the victim's body? Susato: I think it might be difficult to establish the answer conclusively at this point. But at the very least, the idea of poisoned soap should be discounted, I think. I'm sure there's a far more likely explanation before our eyes here. Ryunosuke: (Something obvious that could explain how poison passed the victim's lips...) Ryunosuke: Yes, the victim's life was claimed by poison that tainted the teacup! Sholmes: Indeed! Cups have been the vessel of choice for practising poisoners over the centuries. And it would appear that this victim drank every last drop. Ryunosuke: There's no sign of food anywhere in the room. Sholmes: Which leads us to the immutable conclusion: The cause of death was clearly intoxication due to the ingestion of poison contained in this teacup! Topic 1 Cause of Death Conclusion Poisoning from soap ingestion Poison in the tea Solved Topic 2 Suicide or Murder? Conclusion No possible perpetrator present Sholmes: The cause of death identified, we proceed to Act Two, where we ponder the next question: Was this suicide or murder? The audience will recall that death occurred during the victim's 'last supper'. Did the man dine and die alone? This single teacup suggests the answer. Ryunosuke: Ah, the 'Western vessel for infused hot drinks' again. It's already featured heavily in our deductions so far. Susato: Yes, we can imagine that shortly before his death, Mr Shamspeare was having a drink of tea. There would be nothing remarkable about that. But what troubles me... Ryunosuke: ...Is Mr Natsume's reaction when he heard Mr Sholmes suggest it. (There's more to this deduction than it seems...) Susato: We must closely examine the scene of the crime again for some more clues! Did the man dine and die alone? This single teacup suggests the answer. Susato: It's crucial that we determine whether or not there was somebody else present at the time of death. It will tell us if this was a murder or suicide. Ryunosuke: Yes, and while the argument that the presence of a single teacup shows he was alone is a good one... (...we need to make sure we look at this from all angles...) Ryunosuke: Did the man dine and die alone? This other teacup suggests the answer. Yes! There were two teacups in this room all along! Soseki: Ah! Ryunosuke: In other words, this is a strong indication that at the victim's 'last supper'... ...there was a guest present! Sholmes: ...At the very least, we can say now with certainty... ...that somebody else was here in this room last night, taking tea with the victim! Soseki: Wh-Wh-What are you TALKING ABOUT?! Utterly, Unbelievably, Unjustly Unreasonable! Sholmes: To draw a conclusion on such meagre evidence would be foolish however, certainly. Ryunosuke: In which case, what more can we deduce about this possible 'guest' at the table? Sholmes: Well, allow me to lift the veil of doubt, my dear fellow. Ryunosuke: Do you mean to say, you know who exactly was in this room at the time of the victim's death?! Sholmes: Indeed. What reveals the answer, of course, is the broken lock! Ryunosuke: ...I'm not sure I like where this deduction is going now. Susato: I'm afraid it's too late to go back to the halcyon days of eating too much soap. Ryunosuke: But the identity of the 'guest' who was in here last night when the victim passed away is... Is something I have a very bad feeling about. Susato: Well, you can try to ignore your feelings, but we cannot ignore the truth, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: (No, I suppose not. Time to look around again...) Indeed. What reveals the answer, of course, is the broken lock! Ryunosuke: Was there somebody else in here last night, or not... Clearly that's a fundamental question that will reveal the truth about this man's passing. Susato: Exactly. So we must make sure we have solid grounds for our conclusion. Ryunosuke: (I must have another look around and make sure there's not more here than meets the eye...) Ryunosuke: Indeed. What reveals the answer, of course, is the pile of familiar books! Sholmes: Quite so! It's no mere coincidence that these three titles are here in this room. It's the link to the truth! Soseki: Agh! Ryunosuke: Mr Natsume, you purchased these books four days ago at a secondhand bookshop. Soseki: Th-That's just...a c-c-c-coincidence! Sholmes: In that case, you will be able to bring the same three titles from your own room, will you not? This very moment! Soseki: ......... No! Never! Non-Negotiable! Ryunosuke: If you can't bring your own copies here, it proves that these three books are in fact yours. Soseki: Hnnnnnngh... Ryunosuke: Having purchased the books four days ago and returned to your lodgings, you were arrested the very next day. So you could conceivably have brought the books here on that evening, but you never mentioned that. Sholmes: In other words, you could only have brought these three books here to the victim's room... ...last night, having returned to your lodgings after the trial concluded at the Old Bailey. Soseki: Ah...um...aaah...aaaaaah... Sholmes: In short...there is only one possible conclusion: The victim died here in his room last night as a result of poisoning. Ryunosuke: And that same night, the victim had a visitor. Sholmes: And that visitor... Ryunosuke: ...Was you, Mr Soseki Natsume! Sholmes: Thus concludes the final act of Herlock Sholmes's great deduction! Topic 2 Suicide or Murder? Conclusion No possible perpetrator present Soseki Natsume at the scene Solved Deduction CompleteElementary! Soseki: Huuurgh...uuurgh... Not again... Not again... Not again... NOT AGAAAAAAAAAAAAIN!!! Gregson: Well then, Mr Natsume... ...it would appear you're gonna have to accompany me down to the Yard...again. Soseki: But, but, but... But wait! HOLD YOUR HORSES! Gregson: Yes? Soseki: Door! Key! Locked! Entry! Exit! Entirely! Impossible! Ryunosuke: (He's so flustered he's being even stranger than normal...) Gregson: What, you think that's an alibi? You could have just made a copy. Soseki: Wha...? Gregson: You live in the same buildin', after all. You'd have had plenty of opportunity, I'm sure. Soseki: B-B-B-B-But... MISERY MEEEEEEEEE! Gregson: Sorry, sir, you'll get your chance to give your side of the story later. Sholmes: The facts speak for themselves, Mr Moustache. Soseki: Aaargh...you...you... You horrible Herr Lock Sholmes! Ryunosuke: (He really has found himself an arch-rival now, hasn't he?) Gregson: Come on now, no dilly-dallyin'. Outside! There's a carriage waitin'. Soseki: Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire! I, I never imagined I'd be in this position again, but... YOU HAVE TO HELP ME! Please! Please! I'm innocent! Ryunosuke: ...Alright, I understand. We'll come to your cell later and talk about it. Soseki: And one more thing! Ryunosuke: Oh! Yes? Soseki: My, my poor little kitty-cat... Please give him his breakfast for me! And so... ...his evil curse still apparently unbroken... ...Soseki-san found himself once again the prime suspect in a case of murder. Thanks to the incriminating deduction of the great detective. Sholmes: My dear fellow, that honour belongs to you! Ryunosuke: Well, at least that means Inspector Gregson is no longer here. We can examine the crime scene in more detail now. Susato: Yes, that's right. Ah, and of course... Ryunosuke: What? Susato: Have you forgotten what the inspector mentioned before? It was the landlord, Mr Garrideb, who discovered Mr Shamspeare. Ryunosuke: Ah, Mr John Garrideb, yes... Susato: I expect we could find him in his sitting room on the top floor as usual. Ryunosuke: Right. We must remember to go and talk to him later, then. After examining meter on wall, teacup, bricked-up window twice, and paper scrap on floor: ???: ...Looks like you're havin' a good snoop around, eh? Ryunosuke: Inspector Gregson! B-Back so soon? Gregson: After I threw that little Japanese fella in the clink, I went and reported this to the investigation division. In five minutes' time, this place will be cordoned off by the Yard. Ryunosuke: Oh, I see. Well, we'd better be leaving then. Susato: Poor Mr Natsume must be feeling very low, being back in a cell again so soon... Ryunosuke: I'm sure. We should probably go...and......... Susato: What's wrong, Mr Naruhodo? KYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!! Shamspeare: 'Out, out, brief candle! Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player... That struts and frets his hour upon the stage, And then is heard no more...' ......... ...Now, how soundeth the next part? Gregson: 'It is a tale. Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, Signifying nothing.' Shamspeare: Indeed! Oh, happy day! Ryunosuke: Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa-Wa... ...WALKING DEEEEEEEEEAD!!! Gregson: The, the fella isn't dead at all?! Ryunosuke: What was that nonsense he was saying, though? Susato: I think... Yes, it was from William Shakespeare's 'Macbeth'. A soliloquy from Act Five, Scene Five. Ryunosuke: Shakespeare... So it was... ...that the victim, Mr William Shamspeare...'came back to life'. If the man had indeed been poisoned, it transpired that it hadn't killed him. He was taken by emergency carriage to a nearby hospital for treatment. And Inspector Gregson evicted us from the scene of the crime...whatever that now was. 21st February Briar Road Susato: Whatever do you think will happen now? Ryunosuke: ...Good question. What a strange situation for Mr Natsume. Arrested for murder, but then the victim comes back to life! Susato: I think perhaps the victim was never dead in the first place. It seems very likely that Mr Shamspeare did consume poison, as we deduced... ...but was it an accident, attempted suicide...or attempted murder? Until the truth can be established, I imagine the police will keep Mr Natsume in custody. Ryunosuke: I suppose so... Let's hope it doesn't come to anything more than a night in the cells... (Oh...what's this? What's that man doing over there? He looks like he's trying to see into Soseki-san's lodgings...) Susato: Is something wrong, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: Um, excuse me! Could we have a word? ???: Ah! Ryunosuke: (He just ran off...) Susato: I feel sure that I've seen that man somewhere before. Where was it...? Ryunosuke: Hm... (I do too, but I don't remember...) 21st February Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy 21st February The Garridebs' Room Ryunosuke: (Here we are again. The eccentric landlord's eccentric top floor abode...) Susato: We're here because Mr Garrideb's the one who discovered the incident this morning, don't forget. Garrideb: Ah...you chaps, eh? Ryunosuke: Yes, good morning, sir. Garrideb: Thank you for your...cooperation in court yesterday. Ryunosuke: (It was quite a trial... As much for Mr Garrideb as anyone, really.) Garrideb: Came straight back here after all that business at the Bailey yesterday. Didn't expect to wake up to more bally nonsense this morning! Susato: I wonder...if you wouldn't mind telling us exactly what happened, Mr Garrideb? Garrideb: Yes...I suppose you'd like to know all about that dead loss of an actor chap in the ground floor room. Ryunosuke: (Those were exactly Inspector Gregson's words, weren't they?) After clearing all Converse options with John Garrideb and examining meter on wall, teacup, bricked-up window twice, and paper scrap on floor in Mr Natsume's Lodgings, Ground Floor: Ryunosuke: Well, we've done as much investigating here as we can, I think. Perhaps we ought to go to the prison and speak with Mr Natsume again. Susato: A good idea! 21st February Local Prison, Cell 9 Susato: Look, Mr Naruhodo. Mr Natsume...have the police finished questioning you now? Soseki: Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire! Ryunosuke: Oh! Y-Yes? Soseki: What is he? Tell me! Is he a ghost? Is he here to haunt me?! Ryunosuke: Let me guess... You're talking about Mr Sholmes? Susato: He actually calls himself a great detective, Mr Natsume. Not a ghost. Soseki: But, but his diabolic deductions... They're not of this world... They've...they've...they've left me... AAAH! Cursed! I'm cursed, I tell you! Ryunosuke: (Well, that sort of hurts...) Susato: Credit where credit is due, Mr Naruhodo. You were heavily involved in the deduction, too. Ryunosuke: Yes, um...moving on... We have some wonderful news! Soseki: Oh? Susato: The victim that we all thought was dead...has come back to life again! Soseki: ......... Ryunosuke: Now, in the absolutely worst case, you could only be tried for attempted murder! That's...great, isn't it? Mr Natsume? Soseki: IT'S TERRIBLE! Susato: Oh! Soseki: I'm stuck! In this cell! Suffering! For some silly! Wrong end of the stick! 'You did it, didn't you?' 'Confess!' 'You're a killer!' 'Why the moustache?' CONSTANT QUESTIONS! Ryunosuke: I'm sorry to hear that... Soseki: ARGH, THAT SELFISH SHYSTER! Make up your mind! Are you dead or alive? If you were going to come back to life, why bother dying? Wickedly Wishy-Washy William! Ryunosuke: Well...it seems likely that Mr Shamspeare was never actually dead in the first place. Soseki: Ah, yes, that might make sense... And I'm pleased that he's alive, of course. Our lively debate last night was much fun. I'd be sad to think it was our last. Susato: Oh! Soseki: Oops. Ryunosuke: Um, Mr Natsume...does this mean... ...that you did see the victim last night? You met with Mr Shamspeare, didn't you? Soseki: ......... I'm not saying another word! I demand to have a lawyer present! Ryunosuke: Who do you think I am? Please, Mr Natsume, we need to hear your side of the story! Soseki: Ugh... Why am I cursed like this...? After clearing all Converse options: Soseki: Of course... ...Mr Lord-of-the-Manor is worried about the curse on my room as well. Ryunosuke: You mean Mr Garrideb? Soseki: Yes. He knows that if people keep dying there, he'll never be able to rent it out again. Ryunosuke: Well, that's true. I, for one, wouldn't go near the place. Susato: Ah... Perhaps... ...that may explain why the landlord pays so much attention to the gas lamps and his tenants' movements. Ryunosuke: You mean...because he's worried about their well-being? (He does seem to have an unusually keen interest in the amount of gas in the pipes... There must be a reason why he keeps such close tabs on the occupants of his let rooms.) Soseki: What do you mean, 'he pays so much attention to the gas lamps'? Susato: Oh dear! No! It's nothing to do with you, Mr Natsume! Please, forget I said anything! Soseki: Oh, now you're talking about me behind my back as well... Ryunosuke: What's important is that Mr Shamspeare isn't in fact dead at all. Once he's come round and he's able to tell us what happened, we'll be able to get you released. Soseki: Yes, please! Oh, I do hope you're right! ???: Ahem! Excuse me... Ryunosuke: Inspector Gregson! Gregson: I couldn't help overhearin' what you just said. And on that note... ...I have some good news and some bad news. Soseki: Oh. Gregson: Which d'you want first? Soseki: Always! Every time! The bad news comes first! 'When hope is all you have, hold onto it!' That's my guiding principle! Gregson: Right, well, in that case...the good news it is! Soseki: Huh? Gregson: Sorry, but it's just a lot easier to explain everythin' that way. Soseki: ...Then why did you ask me my preference? Gregson: As you might have heard, the victim, Mr Shamspeare, was just unconscious. He's come round now. Ryunosuke: Yes...we saw it happen in all its terrifying glory. Gregson: He's still bein' treated by the doctors, but we've managed to get a written statement from him already. Susato: Oh, isn't that wonderful, Mr Natsume? Soseki: Oh, thank goodness... It's all over, then. I can leave this sombre cell... Gregson: Sorry, no. That's not on the cards. Soseki: What? Susato: Why ever not, Inspector? Gregson: Mr Shamspeare has implicated someone as bein' responsible for what happened last night. Ryunosuke: Implicated someone? Susato: Oh dear! Soseki: You, you don't mean...? Gregson: I'm sorry to say I do, yes. He's pointed the finger at you, Mr Natsume. Soseki: ARGH! Gregson: 'By sweet poison did he seeketh to end my life. That wicked'st caitiff...Soseki Natsume!' Ryunosuke: No! Gregson: So I'm afraid you'll be appearin' in court as planned. You'll be wantin' to make the necessary preparations. Soseki: Nnnnnn... NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH! Ryunosuke: And so...once again, Soseki-san found himself having to take the dock in the Old Bailey. Whether his room was haunted or whether he was just terribly unlucky, I knew I had no choice... The following day I would represent him in court, and do my utmost to break the curse that blighted him! To be continued...\nThe Memoirs of the Clouded Kokoro TranscriptPart 1 Part 2 Part 3 Part 422nd February, 9:23 a.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' AntechamberExamine evidence Bar of Soap Circular depression Ryunosuke: ...Oh. Susato: What is it, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: This bar of soap... When we first found it, I could have sworn... ...there was some sort of round disk in this depression just here. A reddish one. Susato: Yes, you're right. I remember it, too. But now the depression is completely empty. Ryunosuke: (Where could the disk have gone...?) The details of the bar of soap have been updated in the Court Record. Circular depression (subsequent times) Ryunosuke: ...Oh. Susato: What is it, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: This bar of soap... When we first found it, I could have sworn... ...there was some sort of round disk in this depression just here. A reddish one. Susato: Yes, you're right. I remember it, too. But now the depression is completely empty. Ryunosuke: (Where could the disk have gone...?)Ryunosuke: (The Old Bailey... This place always makes me feel strange. I seem to get chills down my spine and break out in a nervous sweat all at the same time...) Well...I didn't think I'd be back here so soon.???:That's my line!Soseki: GOOD MORNING!Ryunosuke: Ah! Good morning, Mr Natsume.Soseki: It was only two days ago that I was declared not guilty here.Ryunosuke: (Yes, we somehow managed to prove he didn't stab Miss Green in the back...)Soseki: BUT NOW THIS! ANOTHER MORNING, ANOTHER MURDER! AND HERE I AM AGAIN IN THIS HELLHOLE!Can't Keep Coming to Court!Ryunosuke: (I'm beginning to think he's right. It really does seem as though he's cursed.)Susato: Mr Naruhodo! I'm afraid I have bad news! .........Oh! Mr Natsume... Good morning.Soseki: ...Yes, morning.Susato: So...here we are again!Soseki: ...Yes, again.Susato: .........Soseki: ......... JUDICIAL ASSISTANT MISS MIKOTOBA ESQUIRESS! WHAT'S THE BAD NEWS?Susato: Oh dear... You heard, did you?Soseki: If you come in shouting at the top of your voice...PEOPLE CAN'T HELP HEARING WHAT YOU SAY!Susato: Oh... I am sorry.Ryunosuke: You've done nothing wrong, Miss Susato. Now, what is it?Susato: ......... Well...it seems that the prosecution in today's trial... ...will be led by Lord Barok van Zieks.Ryunosuke: Van, van Zieks...?Soseki: GAAAAARGH! Oh no... Oh no no...Ryunosuke: (The so-called 'Reaper of the Bailey'... The most legendary prosecutor in the land... In the trial two days ago, he pursued Soseki-san and I relentlessly. Of course, by the skin of our teeth, we managed to pull through, but still...)Susato: Perhaps Mr Natsume's acquittal in the last trial wasn't the end of the matter. After all...Ryunosuke: Yes, I know what you're thinking. The legend of the Reaper that says... ...nothing can save a person in the dock when Lord van Zieks is the prosecutor.Soseki: Oh no...Susato: That even if that person is found not guilty...the accused will meet a mysterious end one way or another...Ryunosuke: (And we've experienced it firsthand. A man we successfully defended met the most terrifying end after his acquittal...right here in the Old Bailey...)Soseki: AGH! DO I HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THOSE ICE-COLD EYES BORING INTO MY SOUL AGAIN?! CURSED BY EVIL SPIRITS AND NOW BY THE REAPER!Pair of Petrifying Perils, Potentially!Susato: Well, if it's 'potentially'...at least you appear to have hope, Mr Natsume.Soseki: Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire!Ryunosuke: Ah! ...Yes?!Soseki: I'm...I'M INNOCENT! YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME! You, more than anyone now...Ryunosuke: ......... Don't worry. I'll be your steadfast ally every step of the way in this battle. ...I promise! (...And this promises to be a hard battle, I fear...)Susato: Well... ...the trial is scheduled to begin shortly. We should move into the courtroom.Ryunosuke: Let's go!Susato: Oh yes, I forgot to say... I'm afraid he won't be able to make it. Mr Sholmes, I mean.Ryunosuke: ......... That's probably for the best.Susato: Oh!Ryunosuke: If he were here, I might be tempted to rely on his help. And that could be seen as a weakness. If Lord van Zieks were to notice, he'd prey on it mercilessly. At least, that's my gut feeling.Susato: Mr Naruhodo...Soseki: You're right... Yes, you're so right. Oh, well said, Locum Student Mr Naruhodo Esquire! Well said!Ryunosuke: I swear on this sword at my side, and on the spirit of Kazuma that it harbours... ...I'll show him what a Japanese lawyer can do! I'll set you free...with honour!Susato: Oh yes!22nd February, 9:40 a.m. The Old Bailey CourtroomJudge: In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session. I now call upon the counsels for the prosecution and defence to declare their willingness to proceed.Van Zieks: The prosecution is ready.Ryunosuke: The defence is ready, My Lord.Van Zieks: Readiness for the trial, my learned Nipponese friend, is not what the defence needs. What you need...is readiness for your inevitable defeat.Ryunosuke: ......... (It's not just in my imagination; it's really there... Lord van Zieks has such an animosity towards us Japanese for some reason...)Susato: It was some time ago now that he first became known as the Reaper of the Bailey, I believe. These past few years, he hasn't appeared in court at all.Ryunosuke: Yet now he's back in the courtroom. Though for some reason... ...only when I'm defending. (This 'Reaper', with his curious disdain for us Japanese, is a prosecutor shrouded in mystery. Still...this isn't the time to be pondering that. I have to concentrate on Soseki-san's trial.)Judge: Furthermore, I now call upon the six ladies and gentlemen of the jury. You have been chosen at random to represent the will of the people in this trial. Are you ready to fulfil your duty?Juror No. 1: Absolutely! I had a feeling this larrikin wasn't innocent before!Juror No. 2: I must say that I feel especially ruthless on days when my hat refuses to sit right!Juror No. 3: Oh...well I rather like how you're wearing your hat. I think the ruthless look is very fetching, actually...Juror No. 4: I need to be somewhere at ten o'clock. I have a very important meeting. Let's make this quick.Juror No. 5: I couldn't agree more. I need to take home five bob tonight, or the missus will go through the roof!Juror No. 6: Oh, may the Lord show us all the light here, and lead His flock to a righteous verdict...Susato: The British jury system is so very different to our own, isn't it? It's quite extraordinary to think that the power of judgement is in the hands of six members of the public. And that the judge can only pass sentence when all jurors are in agreement about the defendant's guilt.Ryunosuke: (Six citizens of London, chosen at random... Or at least, that's the idea.)Van Zieks: The prosecution would draw attention to the fact that the accused was on trial here but two days ago. Accordingly, where possible, the same jurors have been asked to return for duty today.Judge: Very well, let us commence the trial. Lord van Zieks...your opening statement, please.Van Zieks: Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, it is not the intent of the prosecution to cast doubt over your past decision... However, the innocent verdict afforded to this eccentric Nipponese before...has had dire consequences. Did the accused repent for his wrongdoing in that affair? Far from it. Instead, he used his freedom to perpetrate a most blood-curdling crime! Namely, that of the attempted murder of his neighbouring lodger, an innocent Englishman.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: To explain the circumstances of the crime, the prosecution calls its first witnesses to the stand... ...the detective responsible for investigating the scene, and the accused himself!Van Zieks: Witnesses, your names and occupations, please.Gregson: Yes, sir! Tobias Gregson, Detective Inspector at Scotland Yard's homicide division.Soseki: ......... Ah! Soseki Natsume from the Empire of Japan! My government ordered me to come here as a student to study your language and culture.Judge: Mr Natsume...Soseki: Yes! My Lord, sir!Judge: I'm quite sure I'm not mistaken... ...that you swore on oath...never to set foot in my courtroom again. I remember it as if it were yesterday.Van Zieks: The day before, in fact, My Lord. But close enough.Soseki: Ugh...believe me, this is the last place I want to be...Van Zieks: Inspector, let's hear from you first. Explain the case for the court.Gregson: Right you are, sir! The incident occurred at the Garrideb household where the defendant has lodgings... ...in the ground floor room of the victim, Mr William Shamspeare. The defendant has already admitted to visitin' the victim on the night in question. Mr Shamspeare collapsed in his room as a result of poisonin' by strychnine. He was found the followin' mornin' when the landlord, suspectin' somethin' was wrong, broke down the door.Judge: This means, I presume, that the door to the victim's room was locked at the time of the incident?Van Zieks: Correct, My Lord. It was locked from the inside, making entry to or exit from the room impossible.Gregson: Although the victim, Mr Shamspeare, lives to tell tale... ...he very nearly didn't. The man was halfway to Heaven when we first found him.Judge: Hmmm...Gregson: I was the first officer on the scene, My Lord... ...and I have a photographic print here that I took at the time to show how it looked.Judge: Yes, a chilling scene indeed. The man looks very much deceased.Gregson: That's right. Everyone present believed that's exactly what he was.Judge: Very well, I shall accept this photographic print as evidence for the court.The crime scene photograph has been entered into the Court Record.Judge: Now then, Mr Natsume...Soseki: Ah! Y-Yes...yes...YES?!Judge: As the defendant, do you have anything to say at this juncture?Soseki: ......... They're, they're haunted... Haunted by evil sp-spirits...Judge: Good gracious! What's haunted?Soseki: MY LODGINGS! THERE'S BEEN A WHOLE SERIES OF STRANGE HAPPENINGS IN MY LODGINGS! The tenant before me died in mysterious circumstances! A woman was stabbed by no one on the street outside! My neighbour was poisoned! And ME! WHAT ABOUT ME?! I've nearly been killed countless times!Judge: Killed, Mr Natsume? How?Soseki: Even on that fateful night, it happened. When I returned from Mr Shamspeare's room... ...I lit my gas stove and climbed into bed, but before long... ...the stove went out, AND SOMEBODY TRIED TO KILL ME!Judge: You must always extinguish all fires before retiring for the night, Mr Natsume.Soseki: BUT IT'S SO COLD! My, my runny nose would freeze! The point is, I, I didn't poison my neighbour. Oh...why am I being accused of this? Why is my existence so cursed...?Judge: Thank you, witnesses. I believe I have a reasonably clear picture of events.Van Zieks: If I could raise one more point, My Lord. One more...conclusive point.Judge: Conclusive? Go on...Van Zieks: Fortunately, the victim, Mr Shamspeare, has regained consciousness after his ordeal. And he has named the true culprit.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: The poison consumed by the victim was administered in a cup of tea that he drank on the night in question. Tea, My Lord, that was brought to the victim's room by the accused.Judge: The accused...? Good grief! Ordaaar! Ordaaar!Ryunosuke: (Yes...that's the crux of this whole case. If Soseki-san is innocent, then why...? Why has the victim accused him?)Judge: Well, Mr Natsume? What have you to say to this accusation?Soseki: That evening, yes...I did take some freshly brewed tea with me when I visited Mr Shamspeare's room, as a gift. The public water pump outside always freezes at night, so I bought bottled water especially to make it. And this is the result! Never will I touch tea again! Never!Ryunosuke: The public pump was frozen, you say?Susato: That's not information we've heard before.Judge: That will do, thank you. Now, according to our laws, the defence must have the opportunity to cross-examine witnesses at least once. Therefore, I call upon these witnesses now for a formal testimony. ...I presume the prosecution has no objection?Van Zieks: None whatsoever, My Lord.Judge: Good. Then you will give your account of events on the night in question to the court now.Soseki: Ye-Ye-Ye...YEEEEEESSS, MY LORD!Witness Testimony - The Catastrophic Night -Soseki: It was around nine o'clock that evening when I visited my neighbour, and I took some tea with me as a gift. We had a heated literary debate over a nice, hot drink. After which I went back to my room, at around eleven. Argh! My tea was completely harmless! He couldn't have locked the door behind me otherwise, could he?Gregson: Strychnine takes some time to have an effect on the body. People don't keel over immediately after takin' it. The victim would have been perfectly able to lock the door after his guest left. The argument still stands.Judge: Hm, yes, I see... It all seems relatively straightforward.Susato: Excuse me, but...that testimony does raise one rather crucial point, I think. Mr Natsume claims his tea to have been harmless. Presumably, though... ...the teacups have been examined for traces of the poison...haven't they?Ryunosuke: (Why didn't I think of that?)Gregson: Well, as it happens, no. We haven't been able to.Judge: Did I hear you correctly, Inspector? Scotland Yard has failed to examine the suspect substance?Ryunosuke: How could you have overlooked something so important?! Isn't that the first thing you should have done?Van Zieks: ...My learned Nipponese friend is falsely incensed.Ryunosuke: ...!Van Zieks: The inspector said Scotland Yard was unable to examine the tea. Not that it was overlooked.Ryunosuke: Unable? Why?Gregson: It's simple enough. There was none left. Not a drop. Someone must have been very thirsty indeed.Van Zieks: With current scientific techniques, it's not possible to test for poison under such circumstances.Gregson: We only need a drop, but that one drop does actually have to exist, funnily enough.Judge: Hmmm...Van Zieks: The lack of examination notwithstanding... ...it appears nothing other than the tea passed the victim's lips on the night in question.Ryunosuke: ...!Judge: I see. Thank you. The matter is clear.Van Zieks: Cast your eyes over the jury, my learned friend.Ryunosuke: What?Van Zieks: You can see it in their faces, I'm sure. The recognition of the accused's guilt. Your client's fate is all but sealed. In mere moments from now...you will lose, and your compatriot will be damned for all eternity!Ryunosuke: (He's right. I can feel all six of the jurors looking daggers at me. But I can't let them beat me down... I won't...)Judge: Counsel for the Defence...proceed with your cross-examination!Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord!Cross-Examination - The Catastrophic Night -Shamspeare: The snow lay about. My neighbour did cometh in the evening, bearing a gift of tea.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: To be clear, by neighbour, you are referring to the defendant, Mr Natsume? Shamspeare: O, indeed, sire! Perchance thou wouldst that I call him 'the man from upstairs'? Van Zieks: And at what time did the moustachioed Nipponese visit you in your room? Shamspeare: Our meeting was promis'd for the hour of nine. And lo, did he come, to tender a gift of fragrant tea. Judge: Details which are in accordance with the defendant's own testimony, yes... Shamspeare: And we were broil'd in such a literary debate as history hath nought seen before. Ryunosuke: By which I presume he means... Susato: ...Their discussion about who was the stronger, Romeo or Juliet? Shamspeare: I, Shamspeare, did play the part of young Romeo. Whilst my neighbour play'd the fair Juliet. Each of us dress'd as would our characters be, to bring weight upon our merry experiment. Judge: ...I dare not imagine the scene. Shamspeare: 'Frailty, thy name is woman!' Canst thou imagine how dismay'd I was? Yes, I had heard of the Eastern art of ju-jitsu, but... ...ne'er did I dream 'twould be a skill practis'd by the comely maiden! Ryunosuke: (Juliet beat Romeo up? This is not helping our case...) Van Zieks: ...I believe the court has heard enough about your... earth-shattering literary debate. Perhaps you could reiterate your statement about the tea that the accused brought to your room? Shamspeare: My liege, I am thy servant. Glady, [sic] I would do thy bidding...Shamspeare: But marry! Bitter was his drink! And when he left, I did fall prostrate on my table!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Let me stop you there! Mr Natsume left your room at eleven o'clock. But it wasn't until after two that the poison made you collapse. That amounts to more than three hours of 'missing time'. Shamspeare: ......... Ryunosuke: If the defendant had really put the poison into your tea... ...that three-hour window of time...is something you're going to have to explain! Shamspeare: Gladly. 'Tis an easy task. Ryunosuke: What? Shamspeare: I did drink of the tea not while my guest didst tarry, but after he took leave of me. Faith, 'twas stone cold, but...at one hour post midnight, verily were my lips parched. Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: That...doesn't sound normal! Shamspeare: Nay, 'tis quite ordinary, sire. After all... ...thou wouldst recall our fiery debate. Amidst such argument, there'd be no time for fiery tea. Ryunosuke: (Romeo and Juliet again... And who was stronger...) Van Zieks: Mr Shamspeare, in summary, allow me to confirm. Did you not come here with the intention of naming your attacker? Shamspeare: But of course...my liege. 'Twas the stoop'd lover of words did attempt to shuffle me off this mortal coil. Ryunosuke: (Ugh...we all know what that means...)Shamspeare: 'Twas the tea alone did pass my lips that late hour. Nought else.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So...you didn't have any kind of evening meal? Dinner? Supper? Shamspeare: Hah! Fie on luxury! Fie on gluttony! To eat thrice daily is but a waste of time! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Shamspeare: I would that my belly were full...no more oft than the sun doth rise! Judge: Well... Most heroic eating habits, I must say. Shamspeare: Night and day do I fill my hours with learn'd study of the great bard and playwright. Hence is it that there doth nought in my chamber be than the costumes of mine art. Van Zieks: That would appear to be the case...as even a rodent was found starved to death in your room. Susato: Now I think of it, it's not just food that was conspicuously missing from that room, is it? I don't recall seeing a single play or script anywhere. Shamspeare: For I...have devour'd them all. Ryunosuke: You've...eaten them? Shamspeare: Ev'ry word be within my skull. ...Didst thou imagine otherwise? Ryunosuke: ...Right. That wasn't misleading at all. Now, could you turn around, do you think? Van Zieks: Which brings us to the conclusion...that the only way the poison could have passed the victim's lips...is in the tea. Ryunosuke: Haah...Metermann: I was outside this bloke's window in the freezin' cold all night, keepin' an eye on his room.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But the windows of that house have all been filled in. Susato: A historical artefact of the now defunct window tax! Metermann: Yeah, you're right there. All bricked up horribly. But, as it happens, there's a little part of the brickwork at the bottom corner that's been opened up. I was lookin' in through that gap. Susato: Yes, there were a few bricks loose, weren't there? Ryunosuke: (And for some strange reason, a couple of bars of soap lined up on the ledge outside as well...) Metermann: I don't like goin' around pokin' my chin in other people's business. Especially on freezin' cold nights. But them's my orders! So that's what I'll keep doin'! ...As long as there's breath in my body! Ryunosuke: (What's with all the theatricals today?) Van Zieks: Out of interest, Mr Metermann, after the accused had left and returned to his own lodgings... ...did you see the victim leave the room at all? Metermann: No! He never left! He was in that room the whole time as far as I'm concerned! Van Zieks: And we can therefore discount the possibility of suicide. Ryunosuke: ...! How can you be sure of that? Van Zieks: The police carried out a thorough investigation of the scene and found no receptacle for the poison. And since we know the victim didn't leave his room, and hence didn't dispose of the poison's container himself... ...it's clear that this was no attempted suicide. Only the culprit could have removed the receptacle. Judge: Ah, yes... Lucidly explained, Counsel. Thank you. Ryunosuke: (It really was. You can't argue with the logic...)Metermann: No one else visited his room but that short little round-backed Eastern fella.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You say a 'short little round-backed Eastern fella'... So you can't be sure it was the defendant, then? Van Zieks: Van Zieks: How many other short little round-backed Nipponese with a moustache do you think there are in London?! Metermann: Well, of course...it's only a narrow gap and it was quite dark, so I didn't notice the moustache. But he showed up at around nine, so I'm pretty sure of myself. Ryunosuke: And when the person you saw arrived, did he and Mr Shamspeare drink tea together? Metermann: ......... Nah, sorry, I couldn't say. Ryunosuke: Why not? Metermann: Because. I couldn't see into the room all that well, could I? But what I did see was the silhouette of that little round-backed fella wearin' a pretty dress. Then the pair of them started some kind of wrestlin' match. I tell you, I didn't know what to make of it. Ryunosuke: Haah... Susato: I suppose... ...that was the Romeo and Juliet championship battle getting underway... Van Zieks: Mr Metermann... ...allow me to confirm one final time: Apart from the accused, can you state with certainty, that no one else visited the victim on the night in question? Metermann: No question! Gasman's honour!Ryunosuke: (So that's the entire testimony...)Susato: What do you think, Mr Naruhodo?Ryunosuke: Well...erm... ...I can't see any obvious holes at all, to be honest.Susato: No... Oh dear... If nobody else visited Mr Shamspeare's room that night apart from Mr Natsume... ...I imagine the members of the jury will all conclude the same thing.Ryunosuke: (Right. That he's guilty...) Well, all we can do is press these witnesses for more information and hope for a breakthrough.Susato: Yes!After pressing all statements:???:Juror No. 1: My Looord!Judge: Goodness me! Yes, Mr Foreman?Juror No. 1: I've kept my mouth shut and listened up to now, but this has gone on long enough. Are you all with me?YEEEEEESSS!Van Zieks: Are we to understand...that you ladies and gentlemen of the jury are in agreement with one another? That you've reached a unanimous decision?Juror No. 1: Too right, we have!  Are you all with me?YEEEEEESSS!Ryunosuke: Wait! No! The defence is in the middle of a cross-examination!Juror No. 1: To be honest, I was holding out a bit of hope for you, young man. Especially after you identified those few hours that followed the accused leaving the victim's room.Juror No. 2: Yes, the three 'missing hours' as you put it.Juror No. 3: But in the end, what difference do they make? None, as far as I can see.Juror No. 4: And since that's now apparent, there's really no reason to delay our decision any longer.Juror No. 5: Like I was saying before: if I don't take five bob home with me tonight, the missus will blow her top!Juror No. 6: Hm? What's that? Sorry, I didn't quite catch what you said...Judge: Very well, let the court be apprised of your decisions. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you will state your leanings as to the defendant's culpability!Juror No. 1: Guilty!Juror No. 2: Guilty!Juror No. 3: Guilty!Juror No. 4: Guilty!Juror No. 5: Guilty!Juror No. 6: Guilty!Ryunosuke: A-All of you...?Judge: Well, it would appear that the jury is indeed unanimous.Van Zieks: So...this time at least, it seems justice will be done. All's well that ends well, as they say. This calls for a toast, I feel... To the guilty being punished!Ryunosuke: Ugh... UWAAAAAAAAAAAAH!Susato: Get up, Mr Naruhodo! Please! The trial isn't over yet!Ryunosuke: Wh-What do you mean, Miss Susato?Susato: What about the information I found in this Encyclopaedia of British Law that I have? That obscure right that belongs to the defence in these situations...remember?Ryunosuke: ......... ...A summation examination... ...Yes, that's right... We don't have a jury in Japanese courts, of course. But here in a British court of law, if we can reverse the decisions of a majority of the jurors... ...we can force the trial to continue. (This trial can't end now. Whatever it takes, I just can't let that happen!) The defence moves to invoke its right to a summation examination, My Lord!Van Zieks: Why am I not surprised...at my learned Nipponese friend's inability to admit defeat? You choose to cling desperately to some archaic rule you barely comprehend instead of accepting the truth.Judge: Certainly no other defence counsellor in recent times has exercised the right to a summation examination.Van Zieks: Because they all know that once the jury's mind is set, it cannot be altered.Judge: Nevertheless, the right remains and must be upheld. The defence counsel's request is granted. This court will proceed with a summation examination, as outlined in the Encyclopaedia of British Law!Ryunosuke: Thank you, My Lord!Judge: Are you and your fellows prepared, Mr Foreman?Juror No. 1: Believe me, My Lord, we know all about this young lad's tenacity. And we're ready for it!Judge: Very well. In that case, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I hereby call upon each of you... ...to state the grounds upon which you find the defendant guilty of the crime for which he stands accused!Judicial Findings - The Jurors' Contentions -Juror No. 1: The victim may not be well off, but he's a noble man and straight up! There's no reason to doubt the man.Juror No. 2: Well, I do declare the good gentleman has no reason to lie. In fact...I think he's rather splendid.Juror No. 3: Just look at the accused by comparison! He's Japanese, stoops all the while, and has a moustache! Very fishy...Juror No. 4: There's no evidence to suggest the gangling actor is a fraudsman. ...For now, at least.Juror No. 5: Agh! I really don't care, like! I just need this trial to end quickly!Juror No. 6: Three hours of 'missing time' is nothing when you reach my age, you know. Nothing at all.Ryunosuke: (I knew it... Every single one of them seems completely convinced...)Susato: It would seem that all the jurors... ...have come to the conclusion that Mr Shamspeare is a fine, upstanding and honest citizen.Ryunosuke: If you ask me, they've all been bewitched by his strange theatrical movements.Susato: And sadly, nothing Mr Natsume has said appears to have registered at all.Ryunosuke: Well...here goes! (Let's not forget... ...I've pleaded with the jury on Soseki-san's behalf before and it worked. So you never know!)Susato: Before we begin... ...it might be an idea for me to remind you exactly how a summation examination works, Mr Naruhodo.Ryunosuke: Oh.Susato: Well, you're still very new to British law, after all.Ryunosuke: (That's true, I suppose. And Soseki-san's fate is entirely in my hands now, too. There's always a chance I might have forgotten some crucial detail. Perhaps I should hear Susato-san out. I wonder...should I let her talk me through it again or not bother?)Refresh my memory! Susato: Alright! So, if you remember... ...the key to changing the jurors' minds is the things that they say themselves. Ryunosuke: ...Yes, it's coming back to me. First, it's important to listen very carefully to each juror's statement. Then, if it sounds as though one of those statements might contradict another... ...I have to pit the corresponding two jurors against each other to prove one or the other of them wrong! Susato: Yes, that's right. In many ways, it's very similar to a normal cross-examination. Ryunosuke: (Alright then. All that remains now...is to do it!) Leads to: \"Without further ado, please, Counsel.\"No need! Ryunosuke: Thank you for the kind offer, Miss Susato... ...but I've been through plenty of these summation examinations already now. I think it's important that we don't delay the start any longer than necessary. Susato: Of course, I understand. And I'm quite sure you're right. If you're confused by anything at any point, you can turn to me for advice whenever you like. I'll be here for you! Ryunosuke: (The key to this is really listening carefully to each juror's statement... ...finding two that are contradictory, and pitting the corresponding jurors against each other!) Leads to: \"Without further ado, please, Counsel.\"Judge: Without further ado, please, Counsel. Proceed with the summation examination!Ryunosuke: ...Yes, My Lord!Jury Examination - The Defence's Rebuttal -Juror No. 1: The victim may not be well off, but he's a noble man and straight up! There's no reason to doubt the man.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Well, there are plenty of people in London who seem noble but poor. Couldn't some of them also be liars? Juror No. 1: I've no doubt about it. Like that shaky client of yours, for example. Ryunosuke: Absolutely not! Mr Natsume is no liar! Juror No. 1: Look, the point is, the only thing that passed the victim's lips that night was that Japanese man's tea. When you take the gasman's testimony into account as well, the truth couldn't be any clearer. Ryunosuke: Ah...well... (...that's alarmingly logical.) Juror No. 1: But let me be frank here. I'm a gentleman, with a gentleman's values. If it turns out that the old Shakespearean chum is a rotten liar after all... ...I'd gladly change my decision about the defendant. And I'm sure my fellow gentlemen on the jury would do the same. ...Isn't that right? Juror No. 3: Well, um...yes, perhaps. Though I don't see it happening. Juror No. 6: Eh? What's that? Elderly gent on the end here, you know. You'll have to speak up! Juror No. 5: Look, I really don't care about all this nonsense. I just need this trial to be over! Ryunosuke: (How many 'gentlemen' do we actually have on the jury, then...?) Alright, sir, I may hold you to that. Don't forget what you said. Juror No. 1: Hmph. Changes Juror No. 1's statement to \"Alright, if you can show me that the victim's a liar, I'll reconsider my position!\"Juror No. 1: Alright, if you can show me that the victim's a liar, I'll reconsider my position!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: ...Will you stand by that statement? Juror No. 1: What do you take me for? I'm a gentleman, sir. A man of my word. So let me be perfectly clear about this. If it turns out that the old Shakespearean chum is a rotten liar after all... ...I'd gladly change my decision about the defendant. And I'm sure my fellow gentlemen on the jury would do the same. ...Isn't that right? Juror No. 3: Well, um...yes, perhaps. Though I don't see it happening. Juror No. 6: Eh? What's that? Elderly gent on the end here, you know. You'll have to speak up! Juror No. 5: Look, I really don't care about all this nonsense. I just need this trial to be over! Ryunosuke: (How many 'gentlemen' do we actually have on the jury, then...?) Alright, sir, I may hold you to that. Don't forget what you said. Juror No. 1: Hmph.Pit against Juror No. 4's statement (after Juror No. 4 changes her statement) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Those two statements clearly contradict each other!\"Juror No. 2: Well, I do declare the good gentleman has no reason to lie. In fact...I think he's rather splendid.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Are you saying you believe the man to be trustworthy because he's 'rather splendid'? Juror No. 2: No, that's not what I said. The point is, the man is the victim here. What reason would he have to lie? And yes...he is rather splendid. Ryunosuke: So you say...yet again. Juror No. 2: Meanwhile the man who stands accused behaves so suspiciously, it's exhausting to look at him! I'm afraid...he's not splendid at all. Ryunosuke: (Splendid logic there, madam. Thank you so much.)Juror No. 3: Just look at the accused by comparison! He's Japanese, stoops all the while, and has a moustache! Very fishy...Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: No no no! Not one of those things is a reason to find the man guilty! Juror No. 3: But he is fishy. There's no point dancing around the fact. He's Japanese, he has a moustache and he stoops. You see, you arrive at the conclusion in just three steps. Three steps...like a waltz, in fact! You know, the more I think about it, the more this trial seems like a dance! Ryunosuke: (You seem to be several steps ahead of yourself, though... and you're on the wrong foot!) No! There's nothing but circumstantial evidence here! There's no actual proof of the defendant's guilt! Juror No. 3: But the victim's version of events is backed up by what the big-chinned man next to him says, isn't it? One, he saw the Japanese man there. Two, he saw no one else. And three, he saw the Japanese man there. ...Oh! That's another three steps! All this really does seem more and more like a waltz, doesn't it? Ryunosuke: (Right...and the prosecution will waltz its way to victory if I let you speak much more...)Juror No. 4: There's no evidence to suggest the gangling actor is a fraudsman. ...For now, at least.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: A fraudsman? What do you mean by that, madam? Juror No. 4: ......... It really is a most tiresome problem for the company. Most irritating. We can be absolutely certain that a customer is stealing from us, but without hard evidence... ...we can't even threaten to take action for fear of being sued. Ryunosuke: ......... I'm sorry, you've lost me a little there. ...Who are you? Juror No. 4: I'm the wife of Augustus Altamont, owner of the Altamont Gas Company. Judge: Good gracious! Altamont Gas, you say? Juror No. 4: Gas is the future of energy in this country and around the globe. But proper handling is essential. ...As I'm sure our employee from the East End branch office would be the first to agree. Metermann: Absolutely, Lady Quinby! Gotta be used properly! Altamont Gas is the best in the world, of course! Susato: ...Ah, I think we may have solved the mystery of the bow from earlier, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: (Right... He bowed in deference to his employer's wife, did he?) Ah! So...would I be right in assuming... ...that the reason Mr Metermann was watching what Mr Shamspeare was up to in his room... Juror No. 4: I'm afraid that there's no end to the lengths the population of the East End will go to in order to steal our gas. So I really have no choice when the company identifies somebody as a possible fraudsman... ...but to dispatch a worker to watch the suspect day and night. We're very thorough in our investigations. Ryunosuke: So you mean, Mr Shamspeare is... Juror No. 4: I wouldn't come out and say it in public...but you can finish that sentence with 'a grubby little gas thief'! Ryunosuke: ...You have noticed the public gallery in here, have you? Shamspeare: 'The eye of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not seen...' Faith, wouldst thou wound me with thy words...were I to let them penetrate the skin. But seraphs hear not insults, only choirs of angels in song! Juror No. 4: We may not have evidence yet. But my workers won't stop buzzing around you until they find it! And when they do...you'll find yourself blasted back to your angelic heights in an Altamont Gas explosion! Ryunosuke: (So Mr Shamspeare has been stealing gas...) I wonder, juror number four, if you wouldn't mind adding that information to your statement? Juror No. 4: My pleasure. Was it the bit about ripping that thief apart you enjoyed? Ryunosuke: ...A little before the part about abject violence, if it's not too much trouble. Juror No. 4: Yes, of course. Ryunosuke: (This could be it! This could shift the balance...!) Changes Juror No. 4's statement to \"The 'victim' puts on a fine performance, but in reality, he's a common thief...of my company's gas!\"Juror No. 4: The 'victim' puts on a fine performance, but in reality, he's a common thief...of my company's gas!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: That's a bold claim. How can you be so sure? Juror No. 4: It's really very simple. Shamspeare: Noble lady of gas, I pray thee! Hold thy tongue! Juror No. 4: I beg your pardon? Shamspeare: Hath that rank-odoured air that doth our darkness illuminate any place in this assembly? Nay! 'Tis of sole import here that someone wouldst extinguish the light of mine own life! Juror No. 4: ...! Shamspeare: Verily, I ne'er recall stealing thy gas. But pray, let the matter rest till anon! Juror No. 4: Why, you little... Metermann: Beggin' your pardon, my lady, but might I suggest you don't say any more at this stage? We need hard evidence first. If I keep secretly watchin' this bloke, I'll get him in the end. He'll slip up! Ryunosuke: (Do you think maybe that secret's out of the bag?) Juror No. 4: Hmph! Oh, this is so frustrating!Pit against Juror No. 1's statement (after Juror No. 1 changes his statement) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Those two statements clearly contradict each other!\"Juror No. 5: Agh! I really don't care, like! I just need this trial to end quickly!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You keep talking about needing to take home some money. What's that all about, sir? Juror No. 5: ...Finnish Lass, that's what it's about. Ryunosuke: What's that?! Juror No. 5: I'm talking about the derby at Hyde Park, aren't I? It was the Queen's Cup last week, wasn't it? Ryunosuke: A...derby? Juror No. 5: It was a dead cert, that's the thing! I couldn't lose! So I took my wife's secret savings, like... But then that hopeless old mare went and did the unthinkable! Argh, that stupid Finnish Lass! Susato: ...Oh dear. I think it's clear what happened, isn't it? Juror No. 5: This is the day the missus uses her savings for a trip down the pub! So, come on! Let this business lie now! Just give it up! Ryunosuke: No! That's...not going to happen!Juror No. 6: Three hours of 'missing time' is nothing when you reach my age, you know. Nothing at all.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What do you really mean by that, sir? Juror No. 6: Well, I'm not one to boast, but I get up at five every morning, I do. Ryunosuke: At five?! You're a really early riser then, aren't you? Juror No. 6: Hm? What's that now? Ryunosuke: I said, you're an early riser! Juror No. 6: Oh well, I wouldn't say that. I mean, I like to while away the hours in the evening reading books as well. But by about two in the morning, I'm usually too tired to go on. Susato: He sleeps at two in the morning and gets up at five...? Oh my! That means he only has three hours of sleep each night! Juror No. 6: Hm? What's that, dear? Susato: ONLY THREE HOURS OF SLEEP EACH NIGHT! Juror No. 6: That's right, you see. Three hours of missing time, like I said. It's not much, is it? Ryunosuke: (...This really isn't helping.)Susato: The key to summation examinations is identifying contradictions between jurors' statements, Mr Naruhodo.Ryunosuke: Right, and once I've found two jurors whose statements can't coexist, I need to pit those jurors against each other. Then hopefully, when they see that what they're saying doesn't make sense, they'll change their leaning.Susato: Yes. And if you're able to change the minds of a majority of the jurors, the trial will continue. But conversely, if you're unable to do that, the judge will declare the trial over and move to adjudication.Ryunosuke: (And I can't let that happen. Somehow or other, I have to turn this trial around!)Ryunosuke: Those two statements clearly contradict each other!Judge: Good gracious! To whose statements do you refer, Counsel?Ryunosuke: Juror number one!Juror No. 1: Eh? What are you yelling about, lad?Ryunosuke: I presume you've heard juror number four's statement? Made by the wife of the owner of Altamont Gas.Juror No. 1: Well, yes...Ryunosuke: The victim, who you claim to be a noble, 'straight up' man... ...in fact turns out to be a 'common thief'.Juror No. 1: So the good lady says. But there's no evidence, is there? You and I both heard them say as much!Juror No. 4: It's true, we don't have evidence as such...just yet. But the claims aren't baseless, you know.Juror No. 1: What?Juror No. 4: You heard me. Seeing as his operation has already been compromised... ...I would suggest that the court hears testimony from our East End branch office employee over there.Metermann: I'll do whatever you say, my lady! Gasman's honour!Ryunosuke: Juror number one! You say you're a man of your word!Juror No. 1: ...!Ryunosuke: If I could show that Mr Shamspeare was a liar, you assured me... ...that you would reconsider your decision about the defendant's guilt.Juror No. 1: ......... Hm, yes, I did say that. And as a man of honour, I'll hold to it. ...As I'm sure the other gentlemen of the jury will!Juror No. 3: Me?! Oh, well, yes... Now that we've found out the man's a liar, perhaps we ought to consider the matter further.Juror No. 6: Well...if I'm perfectly honest, I haven't heard half of what you've all been saying. So if this means you'll recap a few points, that would suit me down to the ground.Juror No. 5: Oh no, I'm not having any part of this! I want this trial over and done with!Juror No. 4: In that case, I shall change my leaning.Juror No. 1: So, Mr William Shamspeare...if that is your real name... ...we of the jury demand to know exactly what kind of a man you really are!Ryunosuke: That's...four jurors! Four for 'not guilty'!Susato: Yes, Mr Naruhodo! Victory!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Well...this is quite extraordinary, I must say. As a result of the defence's summation examination, the jury's leaning has changed. Now only two jurors say 'guilty', whilst four say 'not guilty'. I therefore declare this court to be in a state of disaccord... ...and order the trial to continue!Van Zieks: You have spoilt the bouquet...Mr Shamspeare.Shamspeare: .........Van Zieks: The ladies and gentlemen of the jury now find they are unable to trust you, the victim.Shamspeare: ......... 'But you gods will give us, Some faults to make us men.' So God mend me, I do swear... This gasman speaketh that which concerns him most: nought but gas! Nought but thin air! Ay, it burneth bright a while, but it hath no substance. And it doth reek foul!Metermann: Oi, what did you say?!Judge: Do I take it, Mr Shamspeare, that you deny the allegations of gas thievery?Shamspeare: Most heartily, My Lord! Hast thou forgot? I am as a seraph! An angel! Noble of mind, sweet of nature and verily, honest of heart.Metermann: Argh, you flowery-mouthed, pompous beanpole! Just cos I haven't got the evidence yet...Ryunosuke: Mr Shamspeare! If, in fact, you are NOT noble of mind, sweet of nature or honest of heart... If you are a liar... ...then your testimony should have no sway in this courtroom!Shamspeare: .........Judge: It is my considered opinion... ...that at the present time, no other possible culprit of this crime has been identified. All testimony heard by the court thus far heavily implicates the defendant. In short, it would not be unreasonable at this stage for me to rule on the case.Susato: Oh no...Judge: However...in light of the fact that the jury has expressed concern about the fidelity of this witness... ...I believe it would be inappropriate for this court not to pursue the point further.Van Zieks:Van Zieks: I assure you, My Lord, that would be a waste of the court's time. The gas and this case are unrelated.Ryunosuke: Juror number four!Juror No. 4: Yes?Ryunosuke: Didn't you say before that although you had no hard evidence to prove this man has been stealing gas... ...you have strong grounds for suspecting him?Juror No. 4: That's right, we do. ...Don't we, hm, worker?Metermann: Absolutely, Lady Quinby! Gasman's honour!Judge: Very well, then. We will hear your testimony now. You will tell the court precisely why you believe the victim, Mr William Shamspeare, has been stealing gas.Metermann: Yes, My Lord, it'll be my pleasure! On the Altamont Gas name, I swear-Juror No. 4: If I may, My Lord...?Judge: Go ahead, madam.Juror No. 4: This worker's testimony may have a significant bearing on the good name of my husband's company. Therefore, I should like to take the stand alongside him, in a supervisory role. If you wouldn't mind.Metermann: Wahoo! Oh, yeah! Sweet as honey! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!Judge: ...Very well. As an exception, I shall honour your request.Juror No. 4: Thank you, My Lord.Metermann: You wait till the boss gives you an earful! Ooh, it's gonna sting, you mark my words!Judge: So, you will both testify before the court... ...on the subject of the illegal consumption of the Altamont Gas Company's fuel!Juror No. 4: Yes... ...Is that clear, my good man?Metermann: Clear as Altamont gas, my lady! ...Which is the clearest in the world!Ryunosuke: Do you think the gas has gone to his head, Miss Susato?Susato: I think the man is just a very dedicated employee, Mr Naruhodo.Witness Testimony - The Altamont Gas Company's Investigation -Metermann: I'm proud to be the company's East End branch investigator and meter money collection agent. Altamont gas meters accept thruppenny bits, each coin givin' customers about two hours of gorgeous gas!Altamont: And yet, the meter in Mr Shamspeare's room didn't have a single coin in it! The meter doesn't appear to have been tampered with, though, and the collection agent has the only key.Metermann: Somehow, he's usin' all the flamin' gas he wants without payin' a penny! If that's not thievin', what is?!Van Zieks: ...Pray forgive the discourtesy. The irrelevance of this testimony caused me to turn to my hallowed chalice.Judge: What do you mean by that remark, Lord van Zieks?Van Zieks: Did the moustachioed Nipponese poison the gangling excuse for an actor or didn't he? That is all that should concern this court. And yet now we must listen to this...abhorrence. Clearly what separates the vast British Empire and your Eastern island nation is more than geographical distance.Ryunosuke: But...but this could turn out to be crucial testimony! The cross-examination must go ahead!Van Zieks: ...Do what you will.Susato: Lord van Zieks appears to be in a violent mood.Ryunosuke: Yes...he does. (An attempted poisoning...and an incidence of gas theft with no supporting evidence... It's true that they would appear completely unrelated at first glance. But I wonder... The truth tends to be buried in the most unusual places. And the first step in uncovering it...will be to establish just who and what this man really is!)Cross-Examination - The Altamont Gas Company's Investigation -\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Susato Mikotoba\nDescription: A judicial assistant sent to Britain on a study tour.

    "cot": "The statement in Testimony 3 (\"The meter doesn't appear to have been tampered with, though, and the collection agent has the only key.\") asserts that the gas meter is completely secure and can't be opened or tampered with, except by someone with the collection agent's key. However, Evidence 8 (Gas Meter) describes a meter box that \"sports a very strong lock, and there is a tiny hole in its base.\" The presence of this hole directly undermines the \"not tampered with\" claim, since it suggests the possibility of unauthorized access or manipulation without the key—providing a method Mr Shamspeare could have stolen gas, contrary to the company witness's assertions.\n",

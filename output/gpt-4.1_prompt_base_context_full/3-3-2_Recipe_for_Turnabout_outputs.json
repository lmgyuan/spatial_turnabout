This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. I-It wasn't me! I swear it wasn't me! Judge: The evidence and testimony we have seen and heard are conclusive! The victim was alone at his table when he drank from that poisoned cup of coffee. No! You're wrong! I know what I saw...! I saw... I saw...! I saw someone else there! A man. He's the real killer! Why won't anyone believe me? Payne: Well... I'd say that pretty much wraps this case up, wouldn't you... ...Mr. Wright!? Judge: This court finds the defendant... Guilty Judge: The court is adjourned. January 6, 10:03 AMWright & Co. Law Offices Maya: Ahh! The start of the new year always makes me feel like I can take on the whole world! Phoenix: I bet it does, Maya. Maya: So! I've decided that our resolution should be... Zvarri! \"Take on the world!\" What do you think? Phoenix: Sure, whatever, Maya... But I think maybe you've had more than enough mistletoe cake. Maya: Never! You've got to eat a lot of cake during New Year's! It's practically a tradition! Like watching the fireworks on TV or playing a board game. ???: HEY, PAL! Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe... Maya: Happy New Year, Detective! Gumshoe: Uh... likewise... NOW LISTEN UP, WRIGHT! I WANNA... Maya: Here's to another fruitful year of lawyer-police cooperation! Gumshoe: Um... Yeah... Me too... ALRIGHT, PAL! YOU'VE GOT SOME EXPLAINING TO... Maya: Have you got a holiday present for me, Detective? Gumshoe: A what? Well... I, um... Here, have this. It-It's really nothing much, but... Maya: Yay! Thanks! Gumshoe: LOOK, PAL, WE NEED TO HAVE A TALK. TAKE A SEAT! Maya: Hey! What about Pearly? You haven't forgotten her present, have you? Gumshoe: Ah... N-No... I mean, yes... I mean, no... Are you doing this on purpose? Maya: Ha ha, guess I'm busted. How did you like my first practical joke of the year? Gumshoe: Very funny, pal. Now let's see how funny you think it is when I show you this! Phoenix: What is it? A magazine? Maya: Hey, I wanna see! \"Deadly Poisoning Brings Guilty Verdict. Defense Attorney Wright Trounced.\" Phoenix: Tr-Trounced!? Let me see that! \"The defense attorney gave an almost childishly amateur performance yesterday...\" What the heck is this!? Gumshoe: It's a report, pal. About you! Maya: Listen to this! \"Mr. Wright must take full responsibility for the ruling in this case.\" Gumshoe: WELL!? And don't tell me you don't remember anything about it! Phoenix: But I don't remember anything about it! When was that issue from anyway? Gumshoe: Umm... December of last year, which I guess makes it last month. Maya: Which makes it old news, you mean. Phoenix: But I wasn't involved in a poisoning case in December! Maya: Hmm, so what do you think this is all about, Nick? Gumshoe: If it wasn't you, pal, then that leaves only one possibility... Maya: No way. You don't mean... Phoenix: A pho... Maya: A phony Nick!? Phoenix: (This must be Gumshoe's idea of a joke. Guess he's starting off the year with one, too...) Magazine Clipping added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: SO!? What are you gonna do about it, pal!? Phoenix: What do you mean, what am I going to do about it? Maya: Well, it's your fault that the judge found the defendant guilty in this case! Phoenix: My fault!? How do you figure that? Maya: Because THE Phoenix Wright is super famous now! Well, maybe only sort of... Gumshoe: Yeah. See what happens when you hotshots start getting too full of yourselves? Phoenix: (But I didn't do anything wrong! ...At least, not that I can remember...) Gumshoe: You better make this right, pal. Now! And that means taking the case back to court. Got it? Maya: Sounds like we've got our first case of the new year! Let's tackle it with gusto! Phoenix: I don't know... The judge already issued a guilty verdict once in this case. It's not going to be easy to get it overturned. Maya: ... I guess that New Year's resolution is going to have to wait until next year. Gumshoe: So you're taking the case, right!? Good! I'm gonna head over to the courthouse then. After that, I'll go back to the precinct. Drop by if you need something, OK pal!? Phoenix: (I guess people are starting to know the name \"Phoenix Wright\". If a client entrusted a case to me based on my reputation... I guess I am kind of responsible. But why would someone want to impersonate me? What sort of a guy would do that?) Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. ...Actually, I've neglected them for so long that they're covered in a layer of dust. I guess I should at least pretend to read them once in a while. Charley the plant Phoenix: Charley. A quite decorative plant. He's sort of a keepsake... something to remember Mia by. Sure, the office is a mess, but I never forget to water this little fella. Desk Phoenix: It's my desk. I don't get to use it much, so it's still super neat and tidy from when Pearls cleaned it. Movie poster Phoenix: An old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it, a long time ago. Maya watched it recently, and said she cried all night, too! ...Which, I guess, is why it's back up on the wall. I have to check it out one of these days. Window Phoenix: There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. The chain is getting so rich that they bought a whole chunk of the next town over... ...and started building a huge theme park. It's going to be called \"Gatewater Land\". ...I wonder if that bellboy is going to send me a greeting card this year, too? Talk What to do Maya: So, what's our first move? Phoenix: I guess we go down to the detention center and talk-- Maya: Wait a sec, Nick. This person's behind bars because of you. Whoever it is isn't going to be jumping at the chance to meet you, right? Phoenix: Hey, hey! Let's get one thing straight. It wasn't me, it was a fake me that did this! Maya: Hmm, I wonder if he looks exactly like you... Your phony, Xin Eohp, I mean. Phoenix: (I hope not. *shudder* ...And what kind of name for an evil double is Xin Eohp anyway!?) Maya: Ah! Nick! I've got it! Phoenix: If you're going to ask whether I've got a twin brother, the answer is no. Maya: ...Spoilsport. Any ideas Maya: Did you notice Gumshoe was acting weirder than usual, or was it just me? Phoenix: What do you mean? Maya: I mean, he was really worked up. Like a guy who's just found out he's going to be a dad or something. Phoenix: Yeah, I guess he was acting kind of strange. Maya: Maybe he realized he's got strong feelings for you, Nick! Phoenix: ... Considering how we interact, I seriously doubt that, Maya... Maya: Well, if he wasn't nervous because of you... Phoenix: ...then maybe it's because of our new guilty client? Present Attorney's Badge Maya: So you've still got that badge, I see. Phoenix: Huh!? Well, I'm a lawyer, aren't I? Maya: Yeah, but I guess I just didn't think you'd keep on being one for this long. You have to admit, you've had some close brushes with death because of your job. Phoenix: (...I fail to see how being a lawyer is more dangerous than channeling dead people.) Magazine Clipping Maya: I can't believe you've got an impersonator. Phoenix: I can't either. *sigh* Maya: Aww, but look on the bright side. Only famous stars have people impersonating them! Phoenix: This isn't funny, Maya. It's not just an impersonation. This guy stole my identity! And someone may have been wrongly convicted as a result. Maya: ...Guess you should've gone into showbiz, huh, Nick? Phoenix: (...*sigh* I will never understand how your mind works, Maya.) Maya Fey profile Phoenix: So? How's your spirit medium training going? Maya: Well... I stand under the rushing waters of the shower head every day. Phoenix: ...That's called \"taking a shower\". What happened to the rushing waters of a waterfall? Maya: Well, I'm kind of taking a break... I'm having a bit of trouble right now, you know? Phoenix: (Last year's incident must still be on her mind... I haven't seen Maya train at all since that time. I think Mia said it's because Maya's at a loss these days...) Mia Fey profile Phoenix: Mia helped me out in court again last time. Maya: It's so cool that you get to meet my sis like that. Phoenix: Yeah... Maya: We mediums lose consciousness when we're channeling, so I don't get to see my sis... Phoenix: ...I never really thought about it that way. Hey! If you want to meet Mia... ...why don't we just have Pearls call her? Maya: No... I couldn't do that. I'd be too worried about her. Phoenix: (I guess Maya's got all sorts of things to think about, too. ...Despite her immaturity saying otherwise.) Godot profile Maya: So you still can't remember anything about Godot, huh? Phoenix: I already told you. I have no idea who he is, let alone why he dislikes me so much. Maya: Well he sure seems to have a problem with you for some reason. You'd better watch your back, Nick. Coffee lovers can be quite bitter. Phoenix: You're just making that up, Maya! Dick Gumshoe profile Maya: Digging up an old case that's already been ruled on... That's not like Gumshoe, is it? Phoenix: No. He barely manages to stay on top of the cases in front of him. Maya: Yeah, he's always busy, and gets dirt pay. I mean, look at that dusty old coat he wears! Phoenix: (Did you mean he \"gets paid dirt\" or do you really think they pay him in gravel?) Any other evidence Phoenix: Do you know anything about this, Maya? Maya: Hmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everything, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this object. Phoenix: (A simple yes or no, Maya... It's not as if you had to give me a dissertation...) Any other profile Phoenix: Do you know anything about this person? Maya: Hmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everyone, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this individual. Phoenix: (A simple yes or no, Maya... It's not as if you had to give me a dissertation...) January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Maya: It's been ages since we came down to the precinct, huh, Nick? Phoenix: Looks like Gumshoe isn't around. Maya: He's got it so easy, leaving everyone else to do the work! Phoenix: No, he's been out there somewhere. My bet is on the courthouse. He's probably trying to arrange the retrial of this case. Maya: Guess that means we should go to the detention center and chat with our killer, huh? Phoenix: After being convicted without a fair trial, I'm not sure killer is the right label... Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Don't die running a red light. Die the old-fashioned way -- of old age!\" We have a winner! Inject a bit of humor, that's the key. Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a safety campaign. ...I guess? Desks Phoenix: These are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I expected. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks. Poster Phoenix: A poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest \"Babes in Uniform\" calendar. My bad. Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: WHAT! Mask☆DeMasque turned up at the bank? What's he doing!? \"Hands up, you scalawags!\" \"You're under arrest!\" Hey! That's our job! Phoenix: (Looks like Ron DeLite's opted for a new career.) Detective: Quit surfing the net, Chief! Chief: S-Sorry... I was just, um... Phoenix: (Things feel pretty tense in here...) Badgers Maya: Hey, that's the police mascot, isn't it? It's so cute! Chief: That's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police force! Phoenix: So what's with the pink one? It's new, right? Maya: She's not an \"it\", Nick. She's a \"she\", right Chief? Chief: Yup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\". Maya: So one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"? Chief: You got it! They're both married. Maya: Umm... Mr. & Mrs. Badger seem to be cuffed together, Chief. Chief: You got it! That's marriage for you! Phoenix: (Whoa... A mascot that's deeper than the deepest of deep oceans...) January 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room Maya: This is so nerve-wracking, waiting to meet our new client. I wonder just what kind of person you tricked and got found guilty...? Phoenix: K-Keep it down, Maya! That kind of talk could ruin me! ???: Aaaaaaaah! How could you, Mr. Wright!? How could you do this to me!? They put me in solitary! I haven't been able to stop crying. Phoenix: A-Aren't... you... ???: Yes, I am! I am totally and utterly let down! Maya: Aah! You're... Are you...? ??? Don't pretend you don't know me! It's me, Maggey, remember!? Maggey Byrde! Phoenix: Maggey Byrde... Ah! (Maggey Byrde... She's the policewoman I defended that one time. She was accused of murdering her lover. He was a cop, too.) What are you doing in here!? Didn't I get you acquitt-- Byrde: Oh, sure! Very funny! After that fifth-rate defense job, you come in here and start making jokes!? Maya: You better hurry up and tell her what happened, Nick. Byrde: O-Oh... I see... Phoenix: So that's where we stand right now. Maya: I'm sorry you've been caught up in another murder... Byrde: My whole life has been nothing but a whirlwind of bad luck and failures. Phoenix: (I vaguely remember her saying the exact same thing last time...) Byrde: But I don't mind! What's one more disaster in my life? At least now the real Mr. Wright is here with me. I won't let the world keep me down, sir! Examine Surveillance camera Phoenix: Smile, you're on candid camera. Guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. I bet they don't get too many waitresses in here. He looks like he's getting a bit restless. Talk Maggey Byrde Maya: So, how come you're dressed like that, Maggey? Last year you looked so sharp in that police uniform. Byrde: Hmph. I was fired after that... incident last year. Maya: Oh. I'm sorry. Byrde: It's OK. I don't mind one bit. I enjoyed being on the force, but I think it was time for me to move on. Maya: So, what do you do now? Byrde: In the second act of \"The Life of Maggey Byrde\", I'm playing the role of a waitress! Maya: A waitress!? Byrde: Yes. In a French restaurant. It's a small place, but it's quite fashionable. My charming smile and shapely figure came through for me. And the owner, Mr. Armstrong, hired me straight away, sir. Phoenix: And then you got into this mess straight away, right? Byrde: Yeah, you could put it that way... What happened Byrde: This whole mess started on the 3rd of last month... And it happened at Trés Bien. Maya: \"Treh Bee-an\"...? Byrde: Yes. It's a restaurant where good service and a friendly smile are always included! Maya: Oh... Byrde: There were two men at the table, both drinking coffee. And then... One of the men slipped some poison into the victim's cup! The victim took just one sip and was gasping for air! I was so shocked, I passed out. Maya: Hey, hold on there, Maggey. Byrde: What? Maya: You keep calling the guy, \"the victim\". Didn't you know the guy who was killed? Byrde: Not at all! I'd never even seen the guy before! Maya: Oh... Phoenix: (So she wouldn't have a motive to kill him then, I guess...) And the other man, the killer. You saw him, right? Byrde: Of course! A good waitress must be attentive to the clientele. Phoenix: So, you saw the killer, but you were found guilty of the crime anyway? How come? Byrde: ......... You tell me, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Ack! (Guess the answer to my question is \"my phony\"... Anyway, she saw the killer. Better see if I can get a description of the guy.) Guilty verdict (appears after \"What happened\") Maya: So, if you saw the murderer, why were you still convicted? Byrde: Because no one else saw. Maya: Saw what? Byrde: The other man. The one who put the poison in the victim's coffee. Everyone testified that way. Mr. Armstrong, the customer... Everyone. \"The victim was sitting alone at his table the whole time.\" Phoenix: But how's that possible? Byrde: I don't know. But nobody, not one person, would believe me, sir. Even Phoenix Wright, my one last hope for a fair trial, failed me. What a pathetic defense! My granny could've done a better job! Phoenix: Look! That wasn't me, OK? Byrde: And then! ...They found something a bit incriminating in my apron pocket. Maya: What? Byrde: A small bottle... of poison. Maya: WHAT!? P-Poison!? It was in your pocket!? Byrde: Well, I passed out when the victim collapsed. The killer must've slipped the poison into my pocket when I was unconscious. Phoenix: And no one else saw this other guy? Byrde: No, sir. That's what everyone said. But I don't see how they could've missed him... The other guy (appears after \"Guilty verdict\") Byrde: I was the one who took the coffee to the two men. Phoenix: O-Oh...? And what was your impression of them? Byrde: Well... When I first saw them, I kind of thought they might be in the music industry. Maya: In music? How come? Byrde: Well, one of them had some sort of earpiece, and an emo musician's look about him. And there was a sample CD on the table, sir. Maya: An earpiece and a sample CD, huh? Did you get a look at the CD at all? Byrde: It had a band's name written on it. I think it was \"MC\"-something. They must've been preparing for their debut, I guess. Phoenix: So it was a band's CD. Maybe a promo disc? Maya: Maybe it was \"MC Screwdriver\"! Phoenix: Get serious, Maya. Would you buy the CD of a group named that? Byrde: Nngh... What was the name of that group again...? \"MC Hacksaw...\"? No... \"MC...\" Maya: And what about the killer? What did he look like? Byrde: Well, I, um... I don't really remember. Only that he was a young man. Well-built like the victim, really. Present Attorney's Badge Byrde: That badge! Is it real? Phoenix: Of course it's real! Byrde: That's what they all say. But I've been duped before. Give it to me for a sec! Phoenix: Ah...! ...*chomp!* Maya: She... She bit into it... Byrde: And I left a few teeth marks, too! Phoenix: I can see that... Byrde: I just wish I could remember if that means it's real or a fake. Phoenix: *sigh* (I said it was real!) Magazine Clipping Phoenix: Oh, yeah. I need to ask you about this... Byrde: Hey! This article's about my case! Phoenix: Can you tell me anything about the guy who was pretending to be me? Byrde: Yes, sir! It was the morning after I'd been arrested... I met you in the visitor's room here. You were wearing one of your super-sharp suits. Phoenix: Me? Byrde: Yes, you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Argh... Maya: Hey, Maggey! Was my evil double Ayam here, too? Byrde: No. I don't remember a phony you, Maya. Maya: Oh... *sigh* It would've been so cool... Byrde: Then you got really worked up and passionate. \"I'm gonna get you' cleared'a dis crime!\" you said. (Changed from ['I'm gonna get you cleared of this crime!' you said.] in the original release) Phoenix: OK, I get the picture. But you've met me in person before... So how come you didn't realize that guy wasn't the real me? Byrde: ... I guess, looking back now, it was a little strange... Phoenix: Only a little? Byrde: Well, OK, so you were a bit taller than normal. And you looked a bit shady. And your voice was a bit weird. Oh, and you had this funny accent. And... Phoenix: So the guy was nothing like me, then!? Byrde: But he had your spiky hair and blue suit. Phoenix: (... Is that all it takes for someone to imitate me...?) Maya: How about everyone else in the courtroom, like the judge and the observers...? Didn't they realize he was an imposter? Byrde: Everyone had these big question marks on their faces... But it seemed that no one wanted to say anything, sir. Maya: This case just keeps getting weirder and weirder... Maya Fey profile Byrde: Thanks for your help last year! Maya: Aw, it was nothing. I'm glad we got you off the hook. Byrde: I hope you can help me out this year, too! Maya: Yeah, me too. It's be sweet if we could get that verdict overturned. Dick Gumshoe profile Byrde: Oh, Detective Gumshoe! He really looked out for me when I was on the force! Phoenix: Have you seen him recently? Byrde: No. He's never been to the restaurant. Maya: Guess he's not a fan of French cuisine, huh? He's an instant noodle type of guy, after all. Byrde: Yeah, he prefers the simple things in life. Phoenix: (...Or he's just simply too poor to afford anything else.) Maggey Byrde profile Byrde: No matter what happens, I never let anything get me down! Maya: You're always so positive, aren't you, Maggey? Byrde: Macho Maggey Byrde, they say! The early Byrde catches the worm! A Byrde in the hand! Maya: Wow! All those phrases are named after you? Byrde: And I never turn my back on anything! Maya: You're always so strong, aren't you, Maggey? Byrde: Macho Maggey Byrde, they say! I'm a tough old Byrde! Maya: \"Tough old byrde\", Nick! Hee hee! Do you get it? Phoenix: ...Yeah, I get it. Anything else Byrde: I know I used to be on the police force, sir. But I'm incarcerated, now. So I can't use my connections to help you. All I can tell you about now is info about ex-cons or the clientele of Trés Bien, sir... Maya: Aww, don't let it get you down, Maggey! After clearing all Talk options and presenting Magazine Clipping: Byrde: Mr. Wright... Do you think it's possible to get a retrial? Phoenix: Probably. The court ruled in the absence of a genuine defense attorney. So we should be able to get a retrial. Byrde: Um... Mr. Wright...? Phoenix: ? Byrde: Do you think we'll win next time? ...Sir? Phoenix: ...! Byrde: My life has been a full course meal of bad luck, complete with defeat for dessert. Since I was 6 months old, when I fell from the 9th floor of my apartment building... ...I've been hit by all sorts of vehicles, gotten sick from all sorts of foods... ...failed at almost every test I've taken, experienced almost every kind of disaster... I even landed a phony lawyer when I had the misfortune of being accused of murder. But! I will survive! Because Maggey Byrde always lives to fight another day! And one day, I'll find it! Just you wait and see, sir! I'll find that one, single moment of good luck! Maya: Argh, Xin Eohp is really gonna pay for this! Phoenix: Wh-What are you staring at me like that for...? (But Maya's right... Whoever it is that thought it was a good idea to use my name... ...and get an innocent girl convicted of murder had better watch out!) Maya: We'll find him! Don't you worry. We'll get Xin Eohp for you! Byrde: Thank you! Oh! I'll tell you where Trés Bien is then! Phoenix: Trés... Ah, right. The restaurant where the murder took place. Byrde: Yes, sir. When you go, please tell Mr. Armstrong I said hi! Maya: Sure! Alright, Nick! Let's go check out this restaurant and its food! January 6Trés Bien Maya: Wow! Look at this place. Phoenix: \"Look\"? More like \"smell\"... What is with the suffocating scent of flowers in here...? Then again, girls like that sort of thing, right? Maya: Actually, I'm not all that into it... Phoenix: ... Maya: ... No one's coming to seat us. Maybe there's no one here. Phoenix: Don't be silly, Maya. This is a restaurant, and it's open for business. HELLO! ANYONE HERE? ... I don't believe it! There really isn't anyone here! Maya: Perfect! Let's get intrusive! If there's no one here, we can take anything we want! Phoenix: (Yeah, I suppose we can...) Examine Cash register Maya: Look, it's one of those magical boxes that spits out money. Phoenix: You know, you're the only person who would ever describe a cash register in that way! Trinkets Maya: Look at all the little trinkets tucked away in here. Phoenix: I bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally. Let's see... A bouquet of flowers, some potpourri, and look! Fine bone china cups! Maya: ... I never knew you were so... cultured. Phoenix: Come on, Maya! This is common knowledge! Any Joe Schmoe knows this much! Front entrance Phoenix: It's the restaurant's front entrance. There's a sign hanging on the door written in French. It probably says, \"Open\" or \"Closed\". It must be one or the other, but I don't know which since I dunno Jacques about French. Magazine rack Maya: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Phoenix: Why don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" something, huh, Maya? Maya: Yeah. I guess I could. I'm always in my acolyte clothes, aren't I? It'd be fun to wear normal clothes every now and then. Phoenix: Hm? There's something stuffed in behind the rack. Maya: ...Looks like a sports paper to me. Hey, and look at this! Someone's scribbled a little doodle on one of the pages. \"MC Bomber\", and one, two, three, four, five zeros... A-A hundred thousand... dollars... maybe? Phoenix: I wonder what \"MC Bomber\" is supposed to be...? ! (This paper! It's from December 3rd...) This paper's from the day of the poisoning! Maya: WHAT!? Sports Paper added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (A paper from the day of the murder... This has got to be a clue! I should see if I can find out some more about this paper...) Magazine rack (subsequent times) Maya: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Phoenix: Looks like Mr. Armstrong doesn't get any newspapers. Maya: Well, it wouldn't exactly suit the feel of the place, would it? Phoenix: Why don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" like in these mags, Maya? Maya: Yeah. I'd look stunning in some of those Parisian frocks, huh? Phoenix: (We found that sports paper behind this magazine rack earlier... I'd better try to find out everything I can about it...) Table Phoenix: This table's set nicely. It just needs a customer. Maya: What do you think this flower is, Nick? Phoenix: Let's see... Well, it doesn't look like a tulip, and it's not a sunflower, I don't think... Maya: Duh. Even I could've told you that. Phoenix: Well, those are the only kinds of flowers I know. Dagnabit, I'm a lawyer, not a botanist! Windows Phoenix: Wow! It's a beautiful winter wonderland out there. Maya: Really!? Cool! I love snow! Let me see! Huh? It's not white. It's not even snowing. Phoenix: Got you! I was only kidding, Maya. Maya: Nick! There are lies that are OK to tell, and lies that definitely aren't. Phoenix: (...All I did was tell an itty-bitty white lie about nonexistent white snow.) Partition Phoenix: This restaurant has partitions that separate the tables. When you're seated at a table, you can only see the tables to your right or left. Crime scene Phoenix: This must be the table where the murder occurred. Maya: I guess so, with all this police tape all around it. Phoenix: And that stain must be from the poisoned coffee. Don't go licking the tablecloth, OK, Maya? Maya: Why would I lick it? I'm not a cat, you know! Phoenix: (Then why can I picture you doing just that?) Wright & Co. Law Offices Present Sports Paper Maya: Hmm... \"MC Bomber\"... Phoenix: And don't forget the \"100,000\", too. Maya: There's something about that name, \"MC Bomber\". Phoenix: Yeah, It's a pretty unusual name. Phoenix: And don't forget the \"100,000\", too. Maya: Everyone's worried about bombs these days, I guess. Phoenix: I'm not sure that has any bearing on anything related to this case...) Maya: Anyway, we should really look into this some more! Maggey Byrde profile Maya: This is Maggey's second time as a murder suspect, huh? Phoenix: Yeah. The first time was a little over a year ago... She was on the police force back then. Maya: Wasn't she working under Gumshoe? That does it, Nick! We're gonna get her off the hook or I'll give up hamburgers! Detention Center Present Sports Paper Byrde: Oh! A sports paper. Let's see, let's see... Did Gutsen Brawn manage to defend his heavyweight title? Phoenix: Sorry, Maggey. That paper is actually a month old... It's from the day of the murder... Maya: And Gutsen got knocked out yesterday, I'm afraid. Byrde: Oh, no... Phoenix: I found this paper in the magazine rack at Trés Bien. Byrde: Really? That's strange... Trés Bien doesn't get newspapers. Mr. Armstrong says he's not really fond of them. Maya: Then maybe one of the customers left it behind? Phoenix: Anyway, what I want you to take a look at is this scribble here. Byrde: Ah-ha! That's it, sir! \"MC Bomber\"! That was the name that was written on the CD! Phoenix: (Just as I thought...) Maya: I guess it wasn't \"MC Screwdriver\" after all, huh... Byrde: So, that $100,000 must be a down payment for a record deal, right? Maya: If someone gave me $100,000, I'd sing for sure! \"The Master of Kurain\" or \"The Spirit Song\" or even \"Maya's Theme\"! Phoenix: Um, OK, Maya... So, if the sample CD was on the victim's table... That means this newspaper may have belonged to the victim! Maya: You're right! Phoenix: (So the victim left this behind on the day of the murder, huh...) Maya: I think we better step up the investigation, don't you Nick? After presenting Sports Paper in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: January 6Trés Bien ???: Oh là là! Bon-JOUR! Welcome to la Trés Bien! Maya: Oh! Hel... lo... ... Phoenix: (What happened to Maya? She's frozen stiff...) ???: Bienvenue! Welcome to my petite restauranté! Maya: Huh? \"Bee Avenue\"? ???: Oh, non, my petite chulip! Maya: Huh? Me? ???: Look at z'is face! Like la kitten rejected by its own mother. You are fatigued, non? Alors! You need z'is! An aromatic bath oil mélange of la néroli and la rose. My personal recommendation! Maya: You think I need what...? ???: Oui, oui! Just add a couple of drops of z'is mixture to la bath water, and voilá! It will soothe your body and your mind. It's simply fantastique! Maya: Really? ???: And for la monsieur! Phoenix: Who? Me? ???: Look at z'at face! Like la puppy rejected by life itself! You are fatigued, non? For you, monsieur, I recommend z'is! Oil of bergamot. And maybe a 'int of... Oui, oui! I will add la peppermint and la clary sage for a fragrance exceptionnel! Such an invigorating recipe will bring out your delicious beauty, monsieur! Phoenix: M-My beauty!? ???: Alors. If you will be seated, I will bring you la special menu of z'e day! Phoenix: Actually, we're not here to eat. We're lawyers. ???: Mais bien sûr! I know z'is already, monsieur. You are la Phoenix Wright, non? Phoenix: Um, yes... You know me? ???: Mais, oui oui! I never forget a man who flirts wiz me! Especially in court! Maya: I guess he was cross-examined by our mysterious Xin Eohp... Phoenix: It looks like everyone to do with this case knows who \"I\" am already. Maya: I wonder what sort of impression Xin Eohp's been leaving on people, don't you? Armstrong: Allow me to introduce myself to you again. I am Jean Armstrong. Enchanté! Talk Trés Bien Maya: So what does \"Trés Bien\" mean? I know \"trés\". That means \"three\", right? Armstrong: Non, non, non! \"Trés Bien\" is Français! In English, you would say, \"Very Good\". Maya: Oh. Very good... Armstrong: Oui, exactement! La atmosphere is trés bien, and la cuisine is trés bien! Phoenix: (If the food's good, why aren't there any customers in here?) Armstrong: My cuisine is not for all. Some people, z'ey do not appreciate la haute cuisine. Phoenix: (I thought everyone liked hot cuisine...) Armstrong: Since I 'ave lost Maggey, I do not 'ave enough 'ands. Phoenix: So, you're running this place on your own now? Armstrong: Oui. For la moment. No one 'as answered my advertisement. Oh, poor moi! Phoenix: (... Please don't eyeball me while you say that.) Armstrong: I am la chef. I am la manager. I am also a trained aromatherapist. Maya: A roaming what? Armstrong: A practitioner d'aromatherapy. La art of soothing la soul wiz z'e delicate floral aromas. Phoenix: (Delicate? The smell coming from that bottle earlier was anything but...) What happened Phoenix: So, could you tell me what you know about the incident? Armstrong: Bien. It makes me sad to remember it, yet I remember it so well. More z'an a month 'as passed since it 'appened. Phoenix: (Yeah, I guess it's been about a month since Maggey's sentencing...) Armstrong: So. It was z'e third of last month. Just after one in z'e afternoon. A man who was in 'ere for a coffee suddenly became ill. Phoenix: Because of the poison in his coffee? Armstrong: Z'at is la truth as I know it. It was Maggey who took 'is drink to 'im. I was in la kitchen. I 'eard z'e sound of someone collapsing. When I came out to see what it was, 'e was already slumped in 'is chair. Maya: He was dead? Armstrong: Mon dieu! Oui! 'E was dead! Maggey 'ad passed out also. Phoenix: And this man who died... Was he alone? Armstrong: Oui, monsieur. All alone. I know z'at Maggey said z'ere was someone else, but... Maya: I see... Armstrong: La police, z'ey asked me many times. \"Are you sure z'ere was no one else at z'e table?\" z'ey asked. But I am not z'e only one. La old man said z'e same thing. Phoenix: Old man? What old man? Old man (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: Um... So who is the old man that you mentioned? Armstrong: At z'e time of la murder, z'ere was another customer in 'ere. Maya: What!? Someone else saw it? Armstrong: Mais, oui! As usual, 'e came alone z'at day. At z'e time of la murder, 'e was 'ere. 'E saw it, too. But 'e said z'e same thing, z'at z'ere was no one else at la victim's table. Maya: But Maggey swears there were two people! Armstrong: Mais, mademoiselle. La lawyer, 'e could not prove z'is, non? Phoenix: About the lawyer. That was me, I suppose? Armstrong: Mais bien sûr! Phoenix: ... Wow! He's the first person who's said it wasn't me. Maya: Don't kid yourself, Nick! Hmph. Now who's the one making stuff up!? Maggey's motive (appears after presenting Maggey Byrde profile) Phoenix: When Maggey took the coffee over to the victim... ...did anything happen? Armstrong: Ou... Oui. I-I suppose you could say so. Phoenix: So what happened? Armstrong: Non. It was, er... It was nothing. Maya: Look, Maggey says she didn't even know the guy! But she's still been indicted for murder! The prosecution must have come up with some kind of motive! Armstrong: Oui. It is true. Phoenix: If there was anything at all between Maggey and the victim, it could be relevant. Maya: So please! Tell us anything you know. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Psyche-Locks!?) (Changed from [A Psyche-Lock!?] in the original release) Maya: No way! What are we going to do, Nick? Phoenix: We'll just have to remov... WHAT THE!? Maya: Wh-What's wrong? Phoenix: The Magatama... It's gone! Maya: Huh? Phoenix: I had it in my pocket, but... It has vanished into thin air! Maya: WHAT!? Phoenix: (But I could see the Psyche-Locks. (Changed from [But I could see the Psyche-Lock.] in the original release) Maybe that means the Magatama's nearby...?) Maggey's motive (subsequent times) Phoenix: Maggey wouldn't just have put poison in the coffee of some guy she didn't even know. If she's really guilty, there must have been something between her and the victim. 3 PSYCHE LOCKS Armstrong: N-Non. It was nothing. I am sure. Qué será, será. Perhaps Maggey 'ad another reason. Phoenix: (What's Maggey's motive got to do with this chef? Why is he hiding things from me? And another thing... Where did I drop the Magatama? The fact that I can see the lock [sic] must mean it's nearby.) Maya: I only loaned it to you, you know. So you better find it, Nick! OK? Phoenix: (...And here I thought it was mine to keep!) Present Attorney's Badge Armstrong: Please, monsieur. Z'ere is no need to show me z'at. You are Mon. Phoenix Wright, z'e worst defense lawyer in town. Phoenix: (I think I can imagine how he formed this completely wrong impression of me...) Um, the last time we met, did I show you this badge? Armstrong: Oui. You flashed it to everyone in la restaurant! Maya: Looks like Xin Eohp is a bigger fan of flashing stuff than you are, Nick! Magazine Clipping Armstrong: I am not a lawyer myself. I do not wish to speak out of turn. But your defense in court z'at day was a little, how you say, \"lacking\", per'aps? Phoenix: *sigh* Armstrong: Even a Frenchman who cannot speak any English could 'ave done a better job! You were very cool, though. Oh, oui, oui! So 'andsome. Maya: Wow, I wonder just how bad the defense could've been... Armstrong: Every time you opened your mouth, z'e 'ole courthouse stirred. Phoenix: (Oh, man. That is something I don't want to imagine...) Sports Paper Phoenix: We found this sports paper in the magazine rack here. Armstrong: One of my customers must 'ave left it behind. Maya: Do you have any idea which customer it was? Armstrong: Z'e only ideas I 'ave, mademoiselle, I save for my kitchen! Maya Fey profile Armstrong: Oh là, là! You 'ave such a pretty smile, my petite chulip! Maya: Who, me? Armstrong: Oui. La smile is the most important thing for us girls, n'est-ce pas? Maya: Um... Sure! Armstrong: If you want a job 'ere, it is yours, precious! Mia Fey profile Armstrong: Mon dieu! What beauty! Maya: That's my sister! Armstrong: Ah, oui? Another delight! But you 'ave a certain je ne sais quois z'at I do not sense from your sister. Maya: I do? Armstrong: So throw your head 'ead 'igh! Thrust out your feminine features! Do not lose 'eart, ma fille! You are a woman! A woman extraordinaire! Maya: Do I look like I need cheering up or something? Maggey Byrde profile Armstrong: Maggey was a policewoman once, n'est-ce pas? Phoenix: Yes. But she had to quit for, um, reasons beyond her control. Armstrong: Oui, oui. She was la suspect in la murder investigation, non? Maya: Oh... You know about that? Armstrong: Z'at is why I gave to 'er la perfume for la 'appiness. Phoenix: Happiness perfume? Armstrong: Oui. Blended from bergamot, like I 'ave given to you before. Phoenix: But she's been arrested again. And found guilty this time. Armstrong: Z'is is true. 'Er natural aroma of un'appiness must 'ave been very strong. Phoenix: (Just admit it! Your perfume doesn't work!) Armstrong: I am not surprised she was la prime suspect. After something like z'at took place before my very eyes. Maya: Something like what? Phoenix: (What's this guy talking about!?) Maya: Does this mean... Maggey did have a motive? Phoenix: We've got to ask this guy for more info, stat! Jean Armstrong profile Armstrong: It is 'ard to imagine, I know, but I was an apprentice for five years in la gay Paris. Maya: Wow! In Paris!? Armstrong: It was something la chef z'ere said to me z'at made me decide to open my own restaurant. Phoenix: What was it? Armstrong: Z'at awful man said to me, \"You must train for another ten years!\" Oh! It was such a shock! So unexpected! But you would 'ave to be a fool to do z'is, non? Anything else Phoenix: Um, about this... Armstrong: Félicitations! Mais... qu'est-ce que c'est? Phoenix: Ack! Um... Je... Je no comprehend... Maya: Nick! Don't just make something up! After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: Um, Mr. Armstrong... Could I just confirm something with you again? The table where the victim was sitting... Was anyone else sitting there? Armstrong: ... Z'at is a question you will 'ave to ask 'im yourselves. Maya: Huh? \"'Im\"? Armstrong: La old man spends all of 'is time dans la parc. Phoenix: La p-parc? Oh, a park? What park's that? Armstrong: Behind la restaurant. It is called, \"Vitamin Square\". Maya: Thank you! Armstrong: Je vous en prie, my dear! Maya: Let's go check out this Vitamin Square right now, Nick! January 6Vitamin Square Maya: So this is Vitamin Square. Phoenix: Yeah. I see where they get the name from now. The fruits scream \"VITAMINS!\" at you. Maya: Hey, Nick! That's the guy, right? Isn't that the old man Mr. Armstrong was talking about? Phoenix: That grouchy-looking grandpa? Maya: He's throwing seeds out for the pigeons. Phoenix: Maya, he's not throwing seeds for them, he's throwing seeds AT them! Old Man: ... Phoenix: (Ugh... My grumpiness-threat level has just been raised to red...) Examine Sandbox Maya: I used to love sandboxes like you wouldn't believe! Phoenix: Really? You? Maya: Sure. Finding iron filings in the sand with a magnet was my favorite thing to do. Phoenix: Iron filings? Wow... That's too exciting for words. Maya: It was my ambition to collect every single shred of iron in the sandbox. I was such a kid back then! Phoenix: So, did you manage to get all the iron? Maya: No, I never did. I think I came close, though. Come to think of it, I still have all the iron filings I found way back when. You want them? Phoenix: No. Fruit attractions Maya: This place is so fruity! Phoenix: That's not a bad thing. Besides, I love apples. They're among my favorites. Maya: Then that apple slide is perfect for you! Phoenix: ... And what is so \"perfect\" about it? Maya: Oh come on. Don't be a stick in the mud! Slide down it a few times. Go on! Woo! Phoenix: No way! I'd get covered in sand if I slid down that slide. Anyone can see that. Maya: Yeah, you're right. Otherwise, I'd give it a try, too. Pigeons Maya: Hey, look. Pigeons! Phoenix: Yeah. And heaps of them, too. Maya: Did you know that pigeons are a symbol of peace? Phoenix: That's a dove, not a pigeon. Maya: ... Poor things. Just because they're gray means they can't be symbols of peace and harmony? Phoenix: You're over-thinking this one by just a smidge, Maya. Magazine on orange-themed seat Maya: Ooh, there's a magazine here. Phoenix: It's a magazine full of job listings. Old Man: You disgusting rogue, picking up something someone else threw away! Phoenix: \"Threw away\"? Did you throw this away? Are you looking for a job? Old Man: Kah! That's none of your business! Phoenix: Sorry! I guess I'll take the magazine with me then. Old Man: I don't want anyone else having it! Give it back! Phoenix: (Too bad. Now that you want it so bad, I don't want to give it up!) Job Listings added to the Court Record. Old Man: Hey! That's mine! Closer orange-themed seat (after examining magazine on orange-themed seat) Maya: Looking at this orange reminds me... Phoenix: Of what? Maya: That you're supposed to eat a lot of them to ward off colds in the winter. You can't have fun during the holidays if you're sick in bed, you know. Phoenix: You don't have to tell me twice. Talk What you saw Phoenix: Um... Excuse me. Old Man: ... Phoenix: Would you mind if I had a word with you? Old Man: Yes! Phoenix: I just want to ask you a couple of questions... Old Man: What's the matter with you!? Can't you see I'm busy? So you don't like my seeds, eh, pigeons!? Phoenix: (He's really chucking those seeds at them! That's got to hurt!) Old Man: Go on! Eat this! Phoenix: (*sigh*) Maggey Byrde Phoenix: Excuse me, sir. Can I ask you about Maggey Byrde? Old Man: I don't know any Maggey Byrde! Maya: Yes, you do. Maggey. The waitress at Trés Bien. Old Man: Kah! It's a disgrace, I tell you. An utter disgrace! Maya: A disgrace? Old Man: An innocent young girl revealing herself like that! Phoenix: Revealing!? You mean her uniform? Old Man: The youth of today! They don't have any shame! No shame, I tell you! Not one ounce! Whatever happened to the old bushido values of Japan, like honor and modesty? Maya: What about me? I'm not wearing anything revealing. Old Man: You!? Your problem is you lack any sense of grace! Maya: Talk about hitting a girl where it hurts... Trés Bien Phoenix: Do you go to Trés Bien a lot? Old Man: Hmph! That miserable excuse for a restaurant? That garbage they serve in there's not food. Where's the sushi? The tempura? The rice!? Phoenix: Trés Bien is a French restaurant, sir... Old Man: Where do you think we are, boy? In Paris!? I want real food, not those snooty snacks! And what about those shameless girls!? Phoenix: You mean the waitresses? Old Man: You can see all the way up to their... their... Yes! The waitresses! They're practically naked! It's a disgrace, isn't it? Well, isn't it!? Phoenix: Listen, it's not my restaurant. Old Man: Kah! It's a miserable excuse for a restaurant, that place! Miserable! Phoenix: (He certainly knows the place. He must be a regular! But if he hates it so much, why does he keep going?) Trés Bien regular (appears after \"Trés Bien\") Maya: Are you a regular at that restaurant, sir? Old Man: ... Maya: It's just, if you dislike it so much, why would you keep going there? Old Man: ... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: There you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha! Take that! Maya: He must be hiding something, right? Phoenix: If he is, I should be able to see a Psyche-Lock... Oh, wait... I don't exactly have the Magatama right now, huh... Maya: Remember, Nick. That Magatama is only on loan. You better find it or else! Phoenix: (If Pearls ever gets wind of this, I'm going to be in a world of pain...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, excuse me, sir. Could I just ask you about this... Old Man: ... Hmm, ha-hmm, hmm... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: Here you go, boy! How does some pigeon feed sound to you!? Phoenix: (This wasn't exactly what I was hoping to get out of this guy...) Detention Center Present Job Listings Maya: Um, Maggey... Byrde: Oh, are you looking for some part-time work, Maya? Why don't you take a job at the restaurant? I bet Mr. Armstrong would hire you. Maya: Really? Me? Byrde: It's pretty cool being a waitress, you know. And in the kitchen, you'll get to see all of the chef's greatest secrets! Maya: What secrets...? Byrde: You can't make it obvious, but just spy on him for a bit. You'll see. It's interesting. Maya: Wow! I can't wait to get my apron on now! Phoenix: Yeah, he has a pretty intense aroma, too. Maya: So did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...? Byrde: Apparently not. Well, he's in the kitchen all the time, so I guess it's possible that he didn't. Jean Armstrong profile Byrde: Oh, so you met the owner, Mr. Armstrong! Phoenix: He's, um... Oh, how can I put this... pretty unique, huh? Byrde: He has a really intense aura. As a chef and as a person. Phoenix: Yeah, he has a pretty intense aroma, too. Maya: So did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...? Byrde: Apparently not. Well, he's in the kitchen all the time, so I guess it's possible that he didn't. Trés Bien Examine Cash register (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It's really tight behind the cash register counter. Can Mr. Armstrong even get in there? And if he got in... could he get out again? Trinkets (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: There's a bunch of little trinkets on a shelf by the door. I bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally. Magazine rack (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Ugh. All the clothes in these are absolutely atrocious! ...Some of them have been circled in red. ... I really hope Mr. Armstrong is not thinking of buying those. Table (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: Mr. Armstrong must be a pretty big neat-freak. He already has this table ready to go. Now if only the food in this place was edible... Windows (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It looks pretty cold out there on the streets. Peaceful, though. It's nice that people can take it easy after the holiday rush. Crime scene (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: This must be the table where the poisoning occurred. The stain tells the story well. The whole area is still cordoned off with police tape. I guess it must still be under investigation. Present Job Listings Armstrong: Mademoiselle! Maya: Y-Yes? Armstrong: Are you looking for la job? Maya: What!? N-No, no. I was just... Armstrong: Let me see. Your style is un peu différent, but you 'ave a good face. Maya: ...Different? Armstrong: Félicitations! You 'ave passed! I will 'ire you! Bien! Come wiz me. I will teach you everyz'ing I know! Maya: N-Nick! HEEEEEELP! Phoenix: (I don't know whether to laugh or feel bad for Maya... Maybe I should do both...?) Vitamin Square Examine Sandbox Phoenix: When I think back to when I was young... ...I wonder what I found so great about playing in a sandbox. Maybe I'll come back here in the middle of the night one of these days to relive it. ... On second thought, being arrested by Gumshoe would be too embarrassing to bear. Fruit attractions Phoenix: You don't see many parks like this anymore. What a great place for kids to play. But that old man's the only one here, chucking his seeds at the pigeons. Pigeons Phoenix: The pigeons are so busy pecking at the seeds, they don't notice anything else. Seeing those birds eat with such intense focus... ...reminds me of Maya when she's scarfing down a burger. Closer orange-themed seat Phoenix: This is where I found that job listings magazine before. A guy like me carrying around a magazine like that kind of gives the wrong impression. I guess I better give it back to that old man once this investigation's over. Talk Maggey Byrde Phoenix: Excuse me, sir. Can I ask you about Maggey Byrde? Old Man: I don't know any Maggey Byrde! Phoenix: Yes, you do. You know, the waitress at Trés Bien. Old Man: Hmph! If you ask me It's a disgrace! Th-That's what it is! An innocent young girl revealing herself like that! Phoenix: So, you didn't like that kind of thing, then? Old Man: ... Wh-What are you trying to say about me, boy!? Explain yourself! Phoenix: Um, nothing! I'm not saying anything about you... Old Man: I know your kind! You young ones with your spiky hair and your fancy suits! That heads of yours is over-flowing with filthy ideas! Phoenix: (...I know someone who needs to learn some stress management.) Old Man: Get out of here, you young brat! Trés Bien regular Phoenix: So, you are a regular at that restaurant, right, sir? Old Man: ... Phoenix: You're always complaining about the place, so why do you go there? Old Man: ... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: There you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha! Take that! Phoenix: (Something's not right about this guy... But If he's hiding something, I should be able to see a Psyche-Lock.) Oh, wait... (I don't exactly have the Magatama right now, huh... I need to find it before I can get anywhere with this old man.) After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: Looks like they have Maggey in questioning. I guess I've asked her pretty much everything... I'll come back if there's anything else I need to ask her later. Examine Guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. There's nothing for him to do right now, so he's catching some vertical z's. After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Wright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Poor Maya. It looks like Mr. Armstrong's really taken a shine to her. I suppose I'll just have to let her work at the restaurant for a while. I'll go pick her up from Trés Bien once things have cooled off. After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Gumshoe: Well, pal!? Have you found the evidence yet!? The one that's gonna find her innocent!? Phoenix: Um, no. Not yet. We've only just started our investigation. Gumshoe: Well, whatever you need to know, I'll give you the dirt on it. I'm putting off all my other cases for now, pal! Phoenix: (Gumshoe's really fired up about this...) Gumshoe: Oh, yeah! One more thing! The retrial's been approved. Court's sitting at 10 AM tomorrow. And Godot's gonna be the prosecutor... Phoenix: (Oh. ... Him.) Gumshoe: Now, listen up, pal! If Maggey's found guilty again... Phoenix: Y-Yes...? Gumshoe: Um... I'll... I'll make sure you get locked up good for it, got it!? Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Hitting the gas is like hitting the fast-forward button on your life.\" No. That's too obscure. You don't really get the \"you'll die before your time\" idea. I need something more direct. Something a bit more light-hearted. Something like, \"Hitting the gas is your passport to paradise!\" Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a safety campaign. ...I guess? Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: WHAT!? Poisoned coffee waitress gets a retrial!? I knew it! I knew there was something funny about the taste of this coffee! OK! Who brought me this coffee today? Hands up! Phoenix: (Yeesh! Have a little faith in your subordinates!) Detective: Quit surfing the net, Chief! Chief: S-Sorry... I was just, um... Phoenix: (Things feel pretty tense in here...) Badgers Phoenix: No matter what, whenever I come here, that mascot's there to greet me. Chief: You got that right. That's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police force! Phoenix: So what's with the pink one? It's new, right? Chief: Yup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\". Phoenix: So one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"? Chief: You got it! They're married. Phoenix: (So should I expect to see Baby Badger next time I'm here...?) Talk Maggey Byrde Phoenix: So the guilty party was Maggey Byrde, huh? Gumshoe: Yeah... Phoenix: Back when she was on the police force... ...you were her mentor when she was a rookie, right? Gumshoe: Yeah, I kept a close eye on her. I-I mean, not too close. You know. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ...... ......... Hey, what's with the funny looks, pal? I was with her... It wasn't anything like... Look! Sure, I was her boss when she was doing her training. But that was it. Nothing happened. Phoenix: (Gumshoe sure is sweating up a storm over nothing... ...Ah, so that's it! Our big ol' Gumshoe has a little ol' crush on Maggey!) Gumshoe: I... I don't like her or anything! I... I was... Aaaargh! Phoenix: (Note to self: Gossip with Maya about this later!) Gumshoe: Look, pal! Don't tell anyone, OK!? You've gotta keep it a secret, got it!? Phoenix: S-Sure... And would you mind not guessing what I'm thinking all the time? Gumshoe: Hey, tell your face, pal, not me. You'd have to be blind not to see what's on your mind. The victim Phoenix: So I was wondering... Could you fill me in on the victim? Gumshoe: Glen Elg, he was a computer programmer. Phoenix: I see. A programmer... Gumshoe: He was just a regular Joe working for a small-time computer firm. Maggey never had any contact with the guy before that day. ...And all she did was take him his coffee on the day of the murder, pal. Phoenix: (Yeah, Maggey also claimed to have never seen the guy before...) Did the victim go to the restaurant often? Gumshoe: Not according to the chef. Said it was the first time he'd seen the guy. Phoenix: (A programmer... and a first-time customer at that...) (Changed from [A programmer... and a first-time customer...] in the original release) What possible reason could Maggey have had to kill a guy like that? Gumshoe: That's what I thought. But a motive was still somehow established in her trial. Phoenix: You're kidding! What was her supposed \"motive\"? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal. I'm real busy. I haven't even got enough time to sift through these papers. Look into it yourself, OK? Phoenix: (What could this motive have been...?) The investigation Gumshoe: This isn't really a proper investigation. I'm kind of working on it by myself. Phoenix: O-Oh, that's right... Gumshoe: The judge already ruled on the case, and all the evidence is in already. The only problem is with Maggey's testimony. Phoenix: Yeah... Doesn't sound very good for us, huh? Gumshoe: Look, pal. I've got a mountain of papers on this case to look over before tomorrow. So I'm just gonna say this... Maggey Byrde's no liar. She's... She's... OK, so she's a bit out there, and a bit off base sometimes. But she was a good cop. Phoenix: (That's not exactly complimentary, you know!) So what do you think really happened? And just how contradictory is her testimony? Contradictions (appears after \"The investigation\") Gumshoe: The biggest problem with Maggey's testimony is the number of people at the table. Phoenix: Yeah. My thoughts exactly. Maggey still insists there was another guy sitting with the victim. Gumshoe: Right. But get this... Everyone else in the place says the guy was alone. Even the chef. And then there's that CD... Phoenix: (CD? Oh, yeah. She did mention something about a CD...) Byrde: And there was a sample CD on the table, sir. Gumshoe: But our guys turned that place upside down. There was no CD. Phoenix: What? Gumshoe: Not on the table. Not anywhere in the whole restaurant, pal. Phoenix: But didn't Maggey say the victim was wearing an earpiece, too? Gumshoe: Yeah, but that was for the portable radio in the front pocket of his hoodie. Phoenix: A radio? He didn't have a CD player? Gumshoe: You got it. Your phony never explained that contradiction at all. Phoenix: (Come to think of it... The owner of Trés Bien didn't mention that CD either. I don't know why, but I get the feeling Mr. Armstrong's got something to hide...) The charming chef (appears after presenting Jean Armstrong profile) Phoenix: So what exactly is it that caught your attention about the chef at Trés Bien? Gumshoe: It's, um... kind of hard to say... The guy's probably not even connected with the case anyway... Phoenix: Hey, come on, Detective. Didn't you say you'd give me the dirt on anything? Gumshoe: Well, this sort of stuff is kinda... unimportant, gossipy stuff, you know pal? Look, how about this? You go to Trés Bien and investigate the place yourself. And if you find out anything suspicious about the guy... you report back to me, OK? Phoenix: Um... Don't suppose I get a choice in this, huh? (Guess I better find out more about the chef and Trés Bien; then report back to Gumshoe.) Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: Is that thing real, pal? Phoenix: Why does everybody keep asking me that? Gumshoe: I wonder what this phony of yours is like... Phoenix: He had Maggey found guilty of murder. Doesn't that tell you? (I've got to track this creep down!) Magazine Clipping Gumshoe: I wasn't at the trial myself. But I asked this one detective I know how your defense was. Phoenix: And what did he say? Gumshoe: He started off by saying, \"I'm at a complete loss for words...\" But he must have found some quick because he went on about how bad you were for an hour. Phoenix: But... Gumshoe: He said you sucked so much, it seemed like you were trying to get Maggey found guilty! Phoenix: (It looked like I was \"trying to get Maggey found guilty\"...?) Sports Paper Gumshoe: What's that? A sports paper? Phoenix: Yeah. I found it in the magazine rack at Trés Bien. Gumshoe: It's dated the same day as the murder. You may be onto something here. Phoenix: And take a look at this. See this writing here? Gumshoe: \"MC Bomber\"... Hey! Phoenix: What is it? Gumshoe: I've heard that name somewhere before. Yeah, \"MC Bomber\"... Phoenix: (Wow, he actually seems to be thinking for once!) Gumshoe: Ack, it's no good. I can't remember... Phoenix: (...And he goes back to being the Gumshoe we all know and love.) Gumshoe: Hey, pal. I'm gonna borrow this paper for a bit, OK? I wanna get a handwriting analysis done on this scribble. Phoenix: (Handwriting, huh? It'd be good to know more about that, in any case...) Gumshoe: Thanks, pal! I bet this'll turn out to be interesting clue! Sports Paper given to Detective Gumshoe. Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: Hey! So how come she's not with you today? Phoenix: She's working down at the restaurant right now. Gumshoe: Working, huh? Yeah, it's tough being broke. I would know. Phoenix: Um... OK...? Gumshoe: Next time I see her, I'll show her how to make the world's best instant noodles. We low earners have to stick together! It's the only way! Phoenix: (Um... Why is he shaking my hand with such enthusiasm...?) Mia Fey profile Gumshoe: She cross-examined me once, you know. Phoenix: What? Mia did? Gumshoe: Yeah. That was us. The big guns locking horns. Witness versus lawyer! It was a battle of cunning tactics and tricks. Phoenix: (But the witness isn't supposed to play any tricks...) Gumshoe: I can't believe she's gone... Godot profile Gumshoe: That's the guy who's gonna be the prosecutor in Maggey's retrial tomorrow. Phoenix: O-Oh, really? Gumshoe: He was working on a bunch of more important cases at the moment... ...but he canceled them all just so he could take you on, pal. Phoenix: (Why's that guy so determined to see me fail?) Gumshoe: You sure attract a lot of attention, huh? Too bad it's all the wrong kind. Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: I'm such a loser. I had high hopes for Maggey. I was gonna make her the best detective there ever was. But then all the sudden she was charged with murder and arrested. I never saw it coming. I never imagined they'd find her guilty. I hate myself for not being able to do anything. Phoenix: It's OK, Detective Gumshoe. We still have a chance to make this right. Gumshoe: ... You know what? You're not such a bad guy after all, pal. Maggey Byrde profile Phoenix: Have you gone to see Maggey? Gumshoe: Of course I have! But I... I wasn't much good at consoling her. I'm... I'm not very good with words. Phoenix: Oh... Gumshoe: Yeah. I guess I must've looked a bit down. Maggey was really supportive of me. It was great to have someone to talk to. Phoenix: (Did he go for her, or for himself...?) Jean Armstrong profile Gumshoe: The chef of Trés Bien, huh? You know what that chef said to me? \"Oh là là! Your body is full of la toxins.\" And then he gave me this bottle. Phoenix: What's in it? Gumshoe: I don't know. The label says, \"Juniper\". I'm under orders to put a few drops of it in my bath every day. Phoenix: Under orders? Old Man: Yeah. You know, there's something about the lady... I mean, guy. Phoenix: Huh!? You can't stop thinking about him!? Gumshoe: Not like that, pal! Gimme a break! He's not my type. I mean, I can't stop thinking that he's involved with this case somehow! Phoenix: (Sounds like he knows a little something more about our charming chef.) Anything else Phoenix: What do you make of this...? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal. All I can think about is Maggey at the moment. ... ...... N-No! I didn't mean it like that! I meant... Phoenix: (You don't have to explain... Really...) After clearing all Talk options and presenting Sports Paper in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept.: January 6Trés Bien Phoenix: The scent of flowers sure is strong. It's almost making me dizzy... Oh, um... Hello. (Who was that just now? A customer? She had sort of a dark aura about her...) ???: Ah! Welcome! Bee avenue! Phoenix: (Wow. What a cute voice.) Maya: Oh, it's just you, Nick. Phoenix: M-Maya! Maya: Well? How do I look? Phoenix: ... Maybe you should quit being a spirit medium... Maya: Maybe. But it's kind of boring being a waitress. I mean, you're my first ever customer. Phoenix: (Then who was that woman I just saw?) Maya: Oh, oh! Since you're here, you might as well have something to eat! Phoenix: ... I am kind of hungry, actually. Talk Waitress Phoenix: So, how do you like your new job, Maya? Maya: I never knew there was so much for a waitress to do! Take people's orders, bringing them their food, make coffee, work the cash register... Of course, we need a customer before I can do any of that. Phoenix: Yeah, it's a nice-looking restaurant. It's a shame more people don't come. Maya: Don't forget about the ultra cute waitress! Check out my \"gimme a tip\" smile! Lunch special Maya: Hey, Nick! Why don't you order something? The chef's preparing a tasty lunch set at the moment. Or so he says. Phoenix: How much is it? Maya: It's the Twin-T set. So it's 20 dollars, of course. Phoenix: The Twin-T set? I believe I'll be taking a pass. It's kind of expensive. Maya: What!? But you can't! Come on, Nick! It's not every day I get to be a waitress! I want to try carrying plates and working the cash register! Phoenix: How about cleaning the toilets? That should keep you busy. Maya: Yeah, right! Maybe later. Present Anything Phoenix: About this... Maya: Sorry, Nick! I'm a waitress now. I've got a pile of work waiting for little ol' me. After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: Um... About the lunch... Maya: Oh! A fine choice, sir. Phoenix: No. I, um... Maya: KITCHEN! A LUNCH SPECIAL, PLEASE! WITH ALL THE EXTRAS: DRINK, SIDE SALAD, DESSERT, AND GIFT! Phoenix: I don't need any of that! Maya: Just a moment, please, sir. Phoenix: (Maya's really getting into this! So how much is this set lunch, then? 20 dollars, huh? But with the drink, side salad, and dessert, it's... 45 dollars!?) Hey, wait a sec! Maya! Maya: Sorry to keep you waiting, sir! Here you are, our deluxe Fortify lunch set! Phoenix: Whoa! Maya: A dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Bon appétit! Phoenix: Um, thanks...? Maya: Come on, Nick! Hurry up and try it already! Phoenix: (Lobster, huh? Alright... Down the hatch it goes...) ... Urp! Maya: Well? Phoenix: Are you hungry, Maya? Maya: I'm starving! Phoenix: Here. It's yours. Maya: Really!? ... Urp! Phoenix: Remember, Maya. My wallet doesn't print money, so you'd better polish off that plate! Maya: ... I-I've just remembered! I've got to clean the toilets! Phoenix: Hey! (You can't be in that much of a hurry to clean the toilets!) Trés Bien Lunch Special added to the Court Record. Phoenix: How does that guy manage to make good food taste so bad? Maya: Hey, Nick... You want to take a peek at the kitchen? Phoenix: (The kitchen, huh? Not a bad idea.) Talk Kitchen Phoenix: Hmm, now what was it that Maggey said again? \"In the kitchen, you'll get to see all of the chef's greatest secrets!\" Maya: In the kitchen? Mmm. That sounds tasty! Phoenix: Hey, wait up! Maya! Maya: What is it? I'm pretty busy right now. Phoenix: Weren't you going to show me around? Maya: Tsk. There goes my plan to find some cool clue and show it off in your face... Phoenix: (I'd better conduct the search in the kitchen myself!) After clearing \"Kitchen\" Talk option in Trés Bien: January 6Trés BienKitchen Maya: And here it is! The famous Trés Bien kitchen! It's my first time in here too, actually. Phoenix: ... There is a weird atmosphere in here, that's for sure. Maya: Mr. Armstrong will be back soon, so we'd better search quickly! Chop, chop! Examine Mirror Maya: Now THIS is one large mirror! I bet this is where he makes himself look pretty. Phoenix: There's a book on the dresser. \"Claurice Armstrong's Bedtime Literature\". Maya: Not exactly Pulitzer Prize material, is it? Phoenix: It looks like a collection of poems he's written. Maya: Poems? Cool! Read one out! And say it in your best French accent... with intensity! OK? Phoenix: OK, um... Here's one. Ahem! It's called, \"Printemps\". \"Zee two of zem, like actors from a film. Zee coffee still undrunk. Sweet nothings over too soon, on zat sad Sunday morning. Zee foolish cocktail so delicious. Take zee last sip of your tea and I know what I will do. I must lie to you. I must.\" Maya: Huh? That's it!? Phoenix: Yup. That's a poem for you. Oil bottles Phoenix: What's this? It looks like a treasure chest or something. Maya: Wow! Look at all these little bottles! Phoenix: Oh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor... Maya: Let's see... 1, 2, 3... ...98, 99, 100! They're all the same, too. Hey, wait a minute... Phoenix: What is it? Maya: There's one bottle that's different from all the others. Phoenix: Well what do you know. And it doesn't have a label either. Maya: And... *sniff* It doesn't smell. Phoenix: (So what's that liquid inside then, I wonder?) Maya: Hey, Nick, we should borrow this. I mean, look how many bottles he's got. He won't miss one, will he? Small Bottle added to the Court Record. Oil bottles (subsequent times) Phoenix: What's this? It looks like a treasure chest or something. Maya: Wow! Look at all these little bottles! Phoenix: Oh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor... Maya: Let's see... 1, 2, 3... ...98, 99, 100! They're all the same, too. Lace curtains Phoenix: What are these lace curtains for? Maya: I don't know. But they give the place a real homey feel, don't they? Hmm... Lace curtains... You know, if I was a cooking pot, I'd be perfectly happy to sit on a shelf under those. Phoenix: (How do you respond to something like that!?) Table Maya: Now I know for sure I'm in a French restaurant. I've never heard of most of these seasonings. Hey, Nick! This container has... oyster sauce? What's that? Phoenix: (Isn't that used in Chinese food...?) Ack! Look! Right there on the counter! Maya: My Magatama! What's it doing there!? Phoenix: (What indeed...) Magatama put into pocket. Table (subsequent times) Maya: Now I know for sure I'm in a French restaurant. I've never heard of most of these seasonings. Hey, Nick! This container has... oyster sauce? What's that? Phoenix: (Isn't that used in Chinese food...?) Maya: And look at these knives. They look really sharp! Phoenix: I'd like to see how one of those slices through a cheesecake. Maya: A cheesecake? You don't exactly need a sharp knife for one of those, Nick. Stove Maya: Mmm. That smells good. Something's bubbling away nicely in that pot. It must be the lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Phoenix: Isn't that what I just ate for lunch? Maya: Maybe... What you ate is the only French dish I know the name of. After examining oil bottles in Trés Bien - Kitchen: January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Gumshoe: Hey, you're just in time! Phoenix: What is it, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: The lab got back to me about that newspaper you gave me. Phoenix: (He must mean this sports paper with the memo scribbled on it...) So? What did they say? Did the analysis turn up anything? Gumshoe: They said the doodle was written by the victim, Glen Elg. No doubt about it. Phoenix: (I expected as much...) Gumshoe: The victim took the paper with him to the restaurant on the day of the murder. That's our best interpretation of the facts at the moment. Sports Paper refiled into the Court Record. Gumshoe: \"MC Bomber\"... I get the feeling I've heard that name somewhere before... Oh, well. I guess it'll come back to me. Don't forget to report back to me with whatever you find in the restaurant, OK, pal? Phoenix: (Since when did I start taking orders from Gumshoe...? Although... I get the feeling there's something I need to show him...) Talk Armstrong's secret (appears after presenting Small Bottle) Phoenix: So what's Mr. Armstrong's secret? Gumshoe: You ever had lunch at Trés Bien, pal? Phoenix: Um... Yes... Gumshoe: So, how was it? Phoenix: To put it nicely... it was inedible. Gumshoe: Hey, don't worry about being nice around me, pal. You and I both know the reason that place is so empty is because of the food. I mean, the place is clean, and he's got a girl like Maggey as a waitress, so... Phoenix: Yeah... I guess it's probably the food. Gumshoe: The real scoop on the guy is he's up to his ears in debt. Phoenix: Really? How much does he owe? Gumshoe: This is a copy of his loan contract. He's about half a million in the red. Phoenix: H-Half a million? Are we talking dollars? Gumshoe: Yeah. Hey, if it was Sterling, he'd really be in trouble! Phoenix: Sorry. That figure just took me by surprise. Gumshoe: Yeah, this case is full of surprises. And I'd be willing to bet that chef's got something to do with most of them. That's my hunch. Jean's Loan Contract added to the Court Record. Armstrong's secret (subsequent times) Phoenix: So what's Mr. Armstrong's secret? Gumshoe: You ever had lunch at Trés Bien, pal? Phoenix: Um... Yes...

Present Sports Paper Gumshoe: So according to the boys down at the lab, the doodles were probably made by the victim. Phoenix: Probably? Gumshoe: Analyzing this kind of writing is difficult since it's done with a fiber-tipped pen. But don't worry! I'll vouch for it. Phoenix: (Why would Gumshoe have to vouch for it? Can't it stand on its own?) Small Bottle Gumshoe: You got one of those aroma bottles too, huh? Phoenix: Only this one doesn't smell. Gumshoe: Huh? I don't get you... Phoenix: This was mixed in with all the other aromatherapy bottles, but it's not the same. It doesn't even look the same, wouldn't you agree? Gumshoe: A cologne bottle that doesn't smell, huh? Smells like a skunk to me, pal! Mind letting me borrow that bottle for a while? I wanna send it to the lab for analysis. Phoenix: (The victim was poisoned, so the contents of this bottle are pretty important...) Small Bottle given to Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: I had a lunch there was something funny about that chef. Phoenix: You suspect Jean Armstrong? Gumshoe: I've got that guy's number. I know what his secret is. Phoenix: (That must be the same secret Gumshoe was talking about before.) Gumshoe: I guess I'd better fill you in on the details. About this Armstrong guy's secret, I mean... Jean's Loan Contract Gumshoe: It's for half a million dollars, pal! That's... um... half a million dollar bills! Phoenix: (What was the \"um\" in there for!?) Is there really that much money tied up in this case? Gumshoe: I can't give you an answer on that, pal. Not without the case file in front of me. But I'll tell you this... That Armstrong guy would've done anything for cash. He was desperate, you know? Phoenix: No, I don't. But I think I sort of get the picture. After examining table in Trés Bien - Kitchen: January 6Vitamin Square Phoenix: Hmm, the old guy's not here anymore. (Drat. And I still have some unanswered questions for him.) Examine Motor scooter Leads to: \"A scooter, huh?\" Phoenix: A scooter, huh? Who'd leave it right in the middle of the park like this? The wheel guard and the light are busted... I guess it must have been in an accident.

Take that! 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (I knew it... This old guy has got something to hide. But what could it be?) Trés Bien regular (subsequent times, before breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: Why are you a regular at a restaurant that you clearly hate, sir? Old Man: Take that, pigeons! See how you like these seeds! 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (It's no good. I'm gonna have to break his Psyche-Lock. I just can't figure out what he would be hiding. I mean, I'm only asking him why he goes to a particular restaurant.) Trés Bien regular (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: Um... Sir... Old Man: Yes, it's true! I was there for the young girl. Fine, so I'm a dirty, wicked, sinful old devil! Phoenix: No, no... I didn't mean it like that... Old Man: I even get one of those lousy cups of javaccino every time. For 8 dollars! All because of the serving girl! Punish me! Lock me up! Phoenix: Really, that's not what I'm here for. Old Man: You'll be the same! Another 20 years and you'll understand what it's like! You'll know how painful it is to be an old man like me! Phoenix: No, really. Listen, sir... Old Man: Stop calling me that! I have a name you know, boy! So show some respect, hmm!? I'm Victor Kudo. Phoenix: S-Sorry... Mr. Kudo. Kudo: You young ones think you know it all, don't you? Well, I'm not saying another word! I won't tell you anything more! Phoenix: (This guy was in the restaurant at the time of the incident. Which means I have to hear his testimony, one way or another!) Kudo: Hmph! Phoenix: (I don't believe this... I even broke his Psyche-Locks and everything... (Changed from [I don't believe this... I even broke his Psyche-Lock and everything...] in the original release) I guess I'll have to try to get him when he's in a better mood.)

Old Man: Wh-What do you mean!? Phoenix: I don't think you go to that restaurant for the food at all. Old Man: You insolent brat! How dare you accuse me! What proof have you got!?

I haven't done a jot of work since I was born. Other than feeding the pigeons. Phoenix: (What a load of crock!) Old Man: The taste's another story, but the price... It's nothing to me. Phoenix: So, you're saying that you go there because you've got money to burn? Old Man: Exactly! I have so much cash, I go for a swim in my money vault every day!

Old Man: What's your problem? You think a poor man would be better off drinking dishwater, do you? Is that it!? Phoenix: N-No. I wasn't thinking that. I was wondering if the coffee there is really that great... Old Man: No, it's not. But... But anyway! Yes! That place has free newspapers to read every day. Phoenix: Newspapers? Old Man: Exactly.

Phoenix: And you are probably telling the truth here. Because you weren't looking at the girl's face... But at her outfit! Old Man: *gulp* Phoenix: That's the truth, isn't it?

Kudo: Eating the food at that restaurant really takes me back to my days in France. Mia: What a lovely story. Phoenix: (London's in England, not France!) Kudo: Oh, yes! France is wonderful. I'd love to show you around the city some time! It-It's too much! I can't take it! I want... France! Mia: Ha ha ha! Phoenix: (I can't believe Mia's laughing at the guy... *sigh*) Trés Bien regular Mia: You visit Trés Bien a lot, don't you? Kudo: Of course! I mean, yes. I'd like to come and see you there. Heh heh heh. Mia: Really? Oh, you flatter me so! (Changed from [Really? Oh, you're so flattering!] in the original release) The owner would be delighted to welcome you, I'm sure. Kudo: Be careful of that chef, my dear! Phoenix: The chef? You mean Mr. Armstrong? Kudo: That's right. The man's an ex-con. Phoenix: He... He's an ex-con!? Armstrong's record (appears after \"Trés Bien regular\") Leads to: \"Whatever did Mr. Armstrong do!?\" Mia: Whatever did Mr. Armstrong do!? Kudo: Oh, no! Those eyes! I can't take this! Phoenix: (Mia's really got this guy eating out of her hand...) Kudo: He steals things. From his customers. Phoenix: From his customers? Kudo: Gloves, handkerchiefs... Little things, mainly. He's a pilferer! So you be careful around him, my dear. Mia: Are you sure about this? Kudo: Of course! He was arrested for it once. I was there when it happened, having my javaccino. Phoenix: (He really is a regular!) Kudo: Let me write you a little haiku about it. Phoenix: A haiku? Kudo: A Japanese poem. It'll explain all you need to know about that chef. Victor's Note added to the Court Record. Kudo: If he takes anything again, you let me know! If it's not too expensive, I'll buy you a replacement! Phoenix: (Poor guy. He couldn't do enough for Mia.) Mia: OK, Phoenix. That's about as much as I can do to help. Phoenix: Thanks, Mia. We got some really important information thanks to you. Mia: Honestly! I can't believe Maya called me for something like this! Criminal Affairs Dept. Present Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: You're looking upbeat, as usual. Maya: And you're looking tired as usual, Detective Gumshoe! Gumshoe: Yeah. That's life, huh? One guy's got it all, and one guy's got squat. Maya: Is it just me or did the room get darker all of a sudden...? You know, Detective. This is the year of the, um... gum! Gumshoe: I-It is? Maya: Yeah. ...I think. Gumshoe: Gum, huh? This is gonna be a great year for this ol' Gumshoe then, right? Maya: Look at that. He perked up in no time! Phoenix: Maya... Don't mess with him like that. After clearing \"Armstrong's secret\" Talk option in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept. and clearing \"Armstrong's record\" Talk option in Vitamin Square: January 6Trés Bien Maya: I guess it's about time to wrap up today's investigation. Phoenix: Had enough of being a waitress? Maya: Yeah. Plus, no one came to the restaurant... Armstrong: Oh là là! Mademoiselle Maya! Non! 'Ow can you leave like z'is!? Maya: I-I'm sorry... Phoenix: (That reminds me. Mr. Armstrong had a Psyche-Lock or three, didn't he? I'm going to have to break those...) Mr. Armstrong. I hope you won't mind, but I'd like to have another word with you... Armstrong: Volontiers! Of course! Talk Maggey's motive Phoenix: When Maggey took the coffee over to the victim... ...did anything happen? Armstrong: M-Monsieur... I cannot... Phoenix: Maggey wouldn't just have put poison in the coffee of some guy she didn't even know. If she's really guilty, there must have been something between her and the victim. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Armstrong: N-Non. It was nothing. I am sure. Phoenix: (Somehow... I've gotta get this guy to spill the beans on everything he knows.) Maggey's motive (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: Mr. Armstrong. You said that the victim had a winning lottery ticket for half a million dollars. How did you know he had something like that in the first place? Armstrong: Z'e man... 'E was listening to la radio wi'z 'is earpiece. Phoenix: (Hmm, Maggey said something about that, too.) Armstrong: La winning number was announced on la news, I think. All of a sudden, 'e exploded! \"Yes! 'Alf a million!\" 'e shouted. Phoenix: And the ticket? Armstrong: Oui. 'E 'ad all of 'is tickets spread out on la table. I... I was so desperately in need of money, so I... Phoenix: Put the poison in his coffee? Armstrong: Non, non, non, non, non! Oh, non, you naughty man! I simply 'elped myself to one of 'is tickets. Maya: What? Armstrong: La victim collapsed, and Maggey passed out. I thought to myself, \"Pourquoi pas?\" 'E 'ad so many of zem. Phoenix: (Yeah, but only one of them was the winning ticket, right?) Maya: How could you do that, Mr. Armstrong!? Maggey was arrested because of you! Armstrong: Non! Z'is is not true! Winning ticket (appears after \"Maggey's motive\") Leads to: \"I did not take it! La ticket for 'alf a million, I mean.\" Present Job Listings Armstrong: Oh lá lá! You are looking for la job also? Phoenix: N-No! Armstrong: Oui, oui. Your looks are un peu, unusual, shall we say? But I love your style! Phoenix: I look \"unusual\"? Armstrong: It will suit you perfectly, la uniform of la waitress! Phoenix: (I just knew it...) Lunch Special Armstrong: Oh lá lá! So you 'ave eaten my lunch, oui? Tell me, monsieur. Did you enjoy la lunch I prepared for you? Phoenix: It was a... unique and... wild mixture of flavors. Maya: That was the first time I ever had lobster, you know! Armstrong: Lobster? Z'ere was no lobster in my lunch... Maya: Huh? But, it said, \"lobster\" right on the menu. Armstrong: Mademoiselle Maya. Please, you must read la menu more carefully. It says, \"A dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricassée with a balsamic vinaigrette. Maya: Oh. It's only inspired, is it? Armstrong: Oui. Inspired by z'ese ingredients, but not per'aps made from z'em, n'est-ce pas? Maya: Well, guess that's the way the cookie crumbles, Nick. Phoenix: (The way the lunch tasted, it's probably 99% perspiration and 1% inspiration.) Magatama Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Maggey's Motive -- Armstrong: Wh-What is 'appening? I do not like zis 'orrible feeling. Phoenix: I have to know the truth. What happened that day? Armstrong: ... Alors, alors! I will confess everything! Just don't 'urt me! Phoenix: Huh? (Well that was a new world record!) Armstrong: It was a lottery ticket. Phoenix: A lottery ticket? Armstrong: La man who died 'ere 'ad a lottery ticket. For 'alf a million dollars! Phoenix: H-HALF A MILLION!? Armstrong: Oui. But after la incident, z'is ticket... It disappeared! Phoenix: (The ticket disappeared...?) Armstrong: Z'is was la motive z'at la prosecution gave for Maggey. Z'ey said z'at she poisoned the man to get ze 'alf a million dollar lottery ticket. Phoenix: Why didn't you tell me about this sooner? Armstrong: Mais, alors... Phoenix: You've been trying to hide this information about the lottery ticket from me. And I want to know the reason why! Armstrong: Non, monsieur! You doubt me? But I 'ave confessed to you everything I know! Phoenix: Mr. Armstrong. The half a million dollar lottery ticket... I think I know who took it. I think the winning ticket was stolen by this person. Present Jean Armstrong profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Armstrong! I believe there is a very high probability that it was you.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well? How about it? Armstrong: Ça va? Phoenix: Excuse me? Armstrong: It means, \"'Ow are you?\" Phoenix: Oh. Um... I'm fine, thanks. Armstrong: Bien. I am 'appy to 'ear it. Phoenix: ... (Doesn't sound like I'm doing so fine with this Psyche-Lock though...) Armstrong: Poor Maggey, she was tempted by la evil, non? Phoenix: (No! If it was really Maggey, then you'd have no reason to hide the facts from me!) Leads back to: \"Mr. Armstrong.\" Phoenix: Mr. Armstrong! I believe there is a very high probability that it was you. Armstrong: Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: (Wow! That is one piercing scream, even for a man like him...) Armstrong: Mais pourquoi moi!? Why!? You 'ave no evidence! I am not Mask☆DeMasque! I'm not z'e kind of person who steals z'e property of others. Phoenix: Sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Armstrong, but I have evidence to the contrary. I present to you, proof that you have stolen from others in the past! Present Victor's Note Phoenix: Leads to: \"What is z'is!? A poem? Oh, monsieur, you know me so well! I adore poems!\" Present anything else Phoenix: Armstrong: Oui. Per'aps duck would be nice. A terrine, maybe? Phoenix: Sorry? Armstrong: I was just thinking about my lunch menu. Terrine de canard. What do you think? Phoenix: Th-That sounds lovely... Armstrong: Alors, Au revoir, monsieur. I must go to buy la ingredients. Phoenix: (I guess my evidence is a bit of a lame duck...) Leads back to: \"I am not Mask☆DeMasque! I'm not z'e kind of person who steals z'e property of others.\" Armstrong: What is z'is!? A poem? Oh, monsieur, you know me so well! I adore poems! Phoenix: Please, read it. And put some feeling into it. Armstrong: \"Convicted before, a wicked man... or woman, repeat offender\"... Phoenix: I'm sorry to have to bring it up, Mr. Armstrong... ...but you have been arrested for stealing from your customers before, haven't you? Armstrong: Mon dieu! Le mensonge! You are z'e liar! Phoenix: You deny it? Armstrong: Do not make la false accusations, s'il vous plaît! So do you 'ave any proof? I want to see la incontestable proof that I 'ave ever stolen from one of my customers!

Sing together w'iz me. ♪Im~bécile, im~bécile, U ar an im~bécile...♪ Phoenix: (Armstrong's definitely stolen from his customers before... I just need to find the right evidence to prove it...) Leads back to: \"So do you 'ave any proof?\" Phoenix: It seems old habits die hard, Mr. Armstrong. Armstrong: Wh-What is z'at? Phoenix: This is my Magatama. And I found it in your kitchen. Armstrong: Nooooon! 1 LOCK BROKEN Phoenix: (Wow, that scream just about broke some windows...) Armstrong: Oui... oui... I-I 'ave a weakness for la little trinkets and la figurines. My 'and, it just slips out. I cannot stop it. Phoenix: You've stolen handkerchiefs, gloves, and other things from your customers, right? Armstrong: Oui! It is la truth! I am just a timid little girl inside, monsieur. A timid little girl! Besides, z'is time, it was not la small trinket, oui? It was 500,000 dollars! Mais, non! Why would I steal it? I 'ave no need for such money. Phoenix: Really now? Armstrong: Oh, monsieur. What is it? Phoenix: Isn't it true that you're in some pretty serious trouble? And that you are in desperate need of a large amount of cash? Present Jean's Loan Contract Phoenix: Leads to: \"This restaurant is deep in the red, isn't it?\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well, Mr. Armstrong!? Armstrong: Mais, monsieur. It is not I who is in trouble. Is it you, non? Phoenix: Huh? Armstrong: Une petite question... Phoenix: Wh-What? Armstrong: It means, \"a little question\". Together now, w'iz me! Une petite question. Phoenix: Oon put it keschon. Armstrong: Bravo, monsieur! Oh, you are a dream! Excellent! Phoenix: (We're definitely not on the same page here... let alone book...) Armstrong: Is z'at all...? Leads back to: \"Besides, z'is time, it was not la small trinket, oui? It was 500,000 dollars!\" Phoenix: This restaurant is deep in the red, isn't it? Armstrong: Ah! Phoenix: You have a loan... to the tune of half a million dollars! That lottery ticket would have wiped out your debts. Armstrong: Gnnngh... Phoenix: Well, Mr. Armstrong!? What do you have to say for yourself now!? Armstrong: Ah... Aaaaaaaah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Jean's Loan Contract or Victor's Note Armstrong: Pardon, pardon. W'izout my reading glasses, I cannot see z'is. I do not read English well. Maya: He's not even looking at it. Phoenix: (We better find a way to make him look, then.) Maya Fey profile Armstrong: Mademoiselle Maya! 'Ow are you finding my restaurant? Maya: I think I've got the hang of it now... But I think it's time for me to... Armstrong: Oh lá lá, non! You are quitting already? It will be a new record for z'e shortest period of employment ever! Glen Elg profile Armstrong: Ah, la dead man. 'E was la first in my restaurant. Maya: No way! You mean, the first customer you ever had!? Armstrong: Non, non, non. It was z'e first time I've 'ad a dead man in my restaurant. Such a s'ame to lose a customer after only 'is first meal 'ere! Victor Kudo profile Armstrong: Ah, z'is old man. 'E is a regular 'ere. My specialty of cappuccino and cold water is one of 'is favorites. Phoenix: Was he here at the time of the incident? Armstrong: Oui. 'E was 'ere. I am sure of it. When la incident 'appened, z'e old man was 'ere. Maya: ...? Armstrong: I did not take it! La ticket for 'alf a million, I mean. Maya: But you just told us you did! You said you took a ticket! Armstrong: Mais non, ma fille! It was not... ???: That's enough. Maya: Huh? AAAAAAAAAH! Mr. Godot! Phoenix: What in the heck are you doing here!? Godot: Urgh! This is without doubt... the worst coffee I have ever tasted, Mr. Armstrong. Phoenix: (He came in here for coffee!? Does his craving for coffee know no bounds!?) Godot: Perhaps Mr. Armstrong stole one of the victim's tickets on the day in question. Armstrong: I am la air'ead, non? Just a pretty little girl who everyone is laughing at. Maya: But, in that case, Maggey shouldn't be the only one under suspicion... Godot: He had the wrong ticket. Phoenix: ...What? Godot: Mr. Armstrong made off with the winning ticket's pretty neighbor. Maya: So... the ticket he took was worthless? Godot: Not quite. He did win something. A dollar. Armstrong: You see! I am just a pretty face! W'izout my looks, I 'ave nothing! Phoenix: So... What happened to the winning ticket, then? The one he meant to steal. Godot: Indeed. What did happen to it? I don't like spoiling myself by watching trailers, so... ...we'll just wait and see how the movie turns out tomorrow, won't we? Maya: Nngh... Armstrong: Voilà! You two! Time to laugh at la pretty little air'ead! Phoenix: (Looks like I won't be needing this note anymore.) Victor's Note thrown into the trash. Phoenix: Looks like we've got a new mystery now. Namely, where did the winning ticket go? Maya: I've got a bad feeling about this. Phoenix: Well, anyway. We can't let Maggey suffer any longer for this. And certainly not again. To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Phoenix: (Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!)\n-- The Incident --Gumshoe: When the incident took place, the victim was alone at his table, sir.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Can I stop you for just a minute? Gumshoe: Huh? What is it? Did I say something that contradicts the evidence? Phoenix: (He'd so desperate for that to be true, he's practically crying!) Your testimony just now doesn't match the testimony given by Ms. Byrde. She claims that there was another man at the victim's table. Gumshoe: Yeah, that's what she said. And I-- Godot: Godot: What killer wouldn't say that when faced with a homicide conviction? Phoenix: Hey! Godot: Sadly, her testimony isn't supported by the owner or the other customer. Isn't that right, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Yeah, it's true. Their two testimonies tie up on that. They both said there was no other guy at the table. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.) Maya: If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad. Phoenix: ...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Well, maybe the other witnesses just missed him! Perhaps their view of the victim's table was obscured in some way. Godot: Ha...! That argument is as weak as the coffee at Trés Bien, Trite! Phoenix: ...! Godot: I have here in my possession a ticket. Phoenix: A ticket? (Looks more like a photo to me.) Godot: Yes. A one-way ticket to guilty-ville! Population: the defendant! This is a photograph taken from near the entrance to the kitchen. Judge: This is the scene as witnessed by the chef, moments after the poisoning took place, correct? Godot: I think the court will agree that with such a clear view of the scene of the crime... ...how, Mr. Trite, could anyone have overlooked a second person at the table? Phoenix: Urk! Judge: It certainly seems to show the victim's table extremely clearly. Crime Photo added to the Court Record. Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after Crime Photo is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: Can I stop you for just a minute? Gumshoe: Huh? What is it?

They both said there was no other guy at the table. Judge: Hmm...Gumshoe: We understand that the guy, Glen Elg, was listening to the radio at the time.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He was listening to his radio, you say? Gumshoe: Yeah. He had a portable radio in his chest pocket. Maya: Maggey told us that too, didn't she? Something about how \"one of them had some sort of earpiece\". Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.) Maya: If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad. Phoenix: ...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: And what was it that the victim was listening to on the radio, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: Huh? How should I know? Phoenix: (Thanks a lot... We're now one step closer to the middle of nowhere.) Maya: This isn't going very well, is it...? Judge: Hmm... Detective. Could you perhaps tell us about the poison and how it was used? Leads back to cross-examinationGumshoe: Traces of poison were found in his coffee cup.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else? Gumshoe: Not sure I get you, pal. Phoenix: Was the poison a liquid? Or was it a powder? Gumshoe: If I had to put it in layman's terms, I'd say it was a powdery substance. Phoenix: So the poison could've been in anything that was on the table. Sugar, salt, pepper... Godot: Godot: Ha...! Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite? Gumshoe: The victim took his coffee black, with no sugar. Phoenix: Nngh... Judge: It seems that the poison could only have been in the coffee. Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.) Maya: If you got a bad feeling about this, then maybe you should leave it alone. I once had a bad feeling that I was about to have a bad feeling. It was really bad. Phoenix: ...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Are you absolutely certain that the victim even drank any of his coffee? Gumshoe: Huh!? What do you mean? Phoenix: According to this file, \"the poison was found in the victim's coffee cup.\" But what proof is there that the victim ever drank any of it!? Gumshoe: Oh, hey! You're right! That's what I was think-- Godot: Godot: In case you were wondering, that last objection was for the detective there. Gumshoe: Huh? For me? Godot: \"Oh, hey! You're right!\"? You may be fooling the court, but I'm not falling for it. If you have the time to waste, you have the time to present that piece of evidence. Gumshoe: Th... THAT piece... sir? Godot: Yes. THAT piece. Gumshoe: ... Um... Aheh heh heh! Wh-What piece was it again? Godot: This! Phoenix: (Should I be grateful this coffee's only hot enough to give me 1st degree burns...?) Gumshoe: Oh. Now I remember! Um... This is the, uh... victim's coffee cup. Godot: Yes, the victim's cup. Take a good look at the rim. Judge: Oh, yes. It's unmistakable. There is clearly a coffee stain on it. Godot: Conclusive proof that the victim did drink the poisoned coffee that was in this cup. The victim gulped down the bitter death that the waitress brought to him... like this! Phoenix: Uuuurgh! Gumshoe: For the record, the only prints on the cup were the victim's and the defendant's. Coffee Cup added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: Upon further investigation of this cup... we found a certain chemical substance... Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after Coffee Cup is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: So, traces of the poison were found in the coffee cup and nowhere else?

Phoenix: So the poison could've been in anything that was on the table. Sugar, salt, pepper... Godot: Godot: Ha...! Do you put salt and pepper in your coffee, Trite? Gumshoe: The victim took his coffee black, with no sugar. Phoenix: Nngh... Judge: It seems that the poison could only have been in the coffee.Gumshoe: And what we found was potassium cyanide. That stuff really packs a punch!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: (Potassium cyanide? I've heard of that chemical before...) Exactly how strong is this poison, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: It's... Well... That stuff's lethal! Eat too much, and you're history. Maya: How much is too much? Godot: A lethal dose is 0.2 grams. That's about enough to finish anyone off. Maya: 0.2 grams? How much is that? Gumshoe: You know when you swab your ears for earwax? Yeah, about that much. Phoenix: (Earwax, huh? Sounds like something Gumshoe's got an abundance of...) Judge: Hmm... Such a small quantity of poison could have been concealed anywhere.Gumshoe: And, um... it looks like Ms. Byrde might've had, well... some kind of a motive.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Some kind of a motive\"? Gumshoe: Yeah. But if you ask me, it's been blown way out of proportion. Godot: Godot: You know what my golden rule is, Detective? Chuck out a bad cup of coffee. You can always get another. Gumshoe: Huh? I don't get it. Godot: I'm saying, we can always get another witness on the stand, if we have to chuck you out. Gumshoe: *gulp* Godot: So stick to the facts, Detective. Now then, what was Ms. Byrde's motive? Phoenix: (Come on, Gumshoe...) Gumshoe: She was... They said she wanted to steal a lottery ticket. Phoenix: I knew it... (That's what we heard yesterday, too.) Gumshoe: It disappeared from the scene of the crime. Godot: And it wasn't just any lottery ticket. It was a winning ticket for half a million! Maya: Mr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn't he? But he stole the wrong one... Phoenix: (Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one? What should I do? Should I press on this point a little harder or not?) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I should leave it alone. I've got a bad feeling about where this is going.)

Phoenix: ...Maybe I should move on to another part of his testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Wait a minute! The mere fact that the lottery ticket disappeared in no way implicates my client! Godot: Ha...! I have here in my hand... the very ticket in question! Judge: Th-That's the half a million dollar lottery ticket...? Gumshoe: One of the female police officers found it when she was conducting a search... ...of the defendant. Phoenix: WH-WHAAAAAT!? Judge: Order! Order! Godot: Ha...! She's quite a lucky bird, our little waitress. Judge: Y-You will submit that ticket as evidence to the court! Immediately! Phoenix: (Hmm, I'd better keep an eye on that ticket. The way the judge's voice is quivering...) Victim's Lottery Ticket added to the Court Record. Judge: The ticket was presented to the court in the previous trial, too. But it feels heavier now somehow. H-Half a million dollars, you say...? Godot: It's just a scrap of paper. What matters is where it was found, Your Honor. Phoenix: (And that's on Maggey's person, unfortunately...)

Maya: Mr. Armstrong knew about the ticket too, didn't he? But he stole the wrong one... Phoenix: (Then is it possible Maggey stole the winning one?)Maya: You really think there are any contradictions in this testimony?Phoenix: To be honest, I don't know.Maya: But Gumshoe told us out in the lobby. He said we'd be forming a united front, right? How will we win the case if he doesn't throw us a line?Phoenix: (I don't have a whole lot of options right now... The best I can do is gather the facts together, I guess.)After selecting \"Press harder\" upon pressing first, third, and fifth statements:Judge: That's enough! The facts of this case seem overwhelmingly clear to me. The defendant had ample opportunity to commit the crime of which she is charged. Furthermore, it seems beyond reasonable doubt that she did indeed commit this crime.Godot: I like an old man who knows the score.Judge: There is also the matter of the half a million dollar lottery ticket. That alone provides a very credible motive. I mean, for that sum of money even I might be tempted to bend the rules!Godot: I don't mind an old man who is weak to the siren call of money.Maya: Not good, Nick... The evidence against Maggey is starting to pile up fast.Phoenix: Yeah, that's because the court has ruled guilty once already.Godot: I'd say it's about time to wrap up this repeat performance... ...with one final, decisive piece of evidence.Phoenix: (He's got more evidence against Maggey!?)Godot: This is the apron the delightful Ms. Byrde was wearing at the time.Maya: Wow... That's not the cleanest apron I've seen...Phoenix: Th-That stain looks like...! (It can't be... blood, can it!?)Godot: Ha...! It seems the star of our play was a little flustered... And somehow spilled coffee on herself.Phoenix: The coffee!? That's not exactly the first thing that caught my eye...Godot: Of course. The coffee stain isn't the most interesting thing about this apron. No, there's something else that stands out even more.Judge: Something else? I presume you mean...Godot: Of course. I'm referring to the pocket.Phoenix: The... pocket?Godot: A search carried out right after the incident uncovered this... Potassium cyanide. The very poison used by the killer, was in her apron pocket!Phoenix: A bottle of poison... In Maggey's pocket?Gumshoe: Yeah. And Maggey's prints were the only ones on it.Phoenix: WHAAAT!?Judge: Order! Order! Order! The court will accept these items into evidence.Apron added to the Court Record.Potassium Cyanide added to the Court Record.Judge: There's something still bothering me, Mr. Godot. Why have you not explained the bloodstain to the court?Godot: Bloodstain? What bloodstain would that be?Judge: Don't play games, prosecutor! The blood-colored stain that's smeared all over the apron!Godot: That's ridiculous! No one told me anything about a bloodstain!Phoenix: (You don't need to be told! Just look at it!)Godot: Well, Detective!? Could this stain really be... BLOOD!?Gumshoe: N-No way, sir! That's... It's just ketchup. Sir.Phoenix: Ketchup!?Gumshoe: She must've gotten some on her an apron while taking someone their breakfast that day.Judge: ... You could have spoken up a little sooner, Detective Gumshoe!Godot: Pull a stunt like that again, and I'll have you drink 17 cups of ketchup, witness!Gumshoe: Unnngh... I thought everyone knew what it was already.Judge: Hmm... I haven't seen anything yet to make me doubt the last verdict I ruled on this case.Phoenix: ...!Judge: The motive, the opportunity, and the supporting evidence... They have all been clearly established.Godot: Well, Trite... It seems you really are a phony after all.Phoenix: (Argh! You really know how to drive a man nuts!)Judge: Witness, please continue with your testimony. Describe for the court the crime scene and the findings of your investigation there.Witness Testimony-- The Investigation --Gumshoe: The crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir. Poor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her. The victim didn't have any identification on him. But we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly. When Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison. And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.Judge: Hmm... You identified the victim and secured your prime suspect... Very good.Godot: Last chance to convince the court you're a real lawyer, Trite!Phoenix: ...!Godot: Don't court on any more cross-examinations after this one! So, let the fun begin!Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Investigation --Gumshoe: The crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Scary old man\", Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: There's an old man who's a regular at the restaurant where the incident happened. Phoenix: (Ah, we're obviously talking about the same old man...) Gumshoe: Officers were dispatched right after the report came in, but the old guy still made a fuss. \"What took you so long!?\" Then he hurled abuse at them. And seeds... Judge: Hmm... Seeds... Godot: Ha...! It was nothing! I caught each one with my teeth. Phoenix: (I guess not even the mighty Godot can avoid being attacked by that guy...) Godot: The old man was only other customer in the place at the time. He took his time finding a pay phone apparently, so he was late reporting the crime.Gumshoe: Poor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How long was the defendant unconscious for? Gumshoe: The officers got to the crime scene at around 2:40. Maggey was still out cold in the kitchen at that time. It took another 10 minutes or so before she came to. I woulda liked to have been on the scene myself. Phoenix: (I bet you would've liked to have carried out the search, too...) Gumshoe: I woulda loved to see Maggey asleep like that, all pretty and peaceful. Phoenix: (You're a professional detective, Gumshoe. Not a professional bird watcher!) Godot: Save the romantics for your own time, Detective. All we need to know about is the investigation. Gumshoe: Oops! I guess I'm pretty red right now, aren't I?Gumshoe: The victim didn't have any identification on him.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He didn't have any? Are you saying that it was stolen, then? Gumshoe: No, I don't think so. The victim didn't have a driver's license or even a credit card on him, pal. All he had was 58 cents in his wallet. Phoenix: Fifty-eight cents...? Gumshoe: Yeah. I can't believe I found someone with less in their wallet than me, pal! Judge: The victim sounds like he was a thoroughly miserable young man. Godot: Or some kind of outlaw... Why not give him a bit of an edge? Phoenix: (I think I'm on to something here...)Gumshoe: But we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait a sec! Gumshoe: Huh? D-Did I say something dumb again!? Phoenix: Let me paraphrase what you just testified to this court. \"The victim didn't have any form of ID on him.\" That's basically what you said, yes? Gumshoe: Yeah, basically. Phoenix: In that case, how were you able to identify the victim so quickly? Gumshoe: ... Oh... That. Phoenix: (He's so let down, he's got the whole sagging shoulders and puppy eyes thing going...) Gumshoe: There was a prescription bag on the victim's table along with the lottery ticket. Godot: It seems Mr. Glen Elg visited his doctor before he went to Trés Bien. Gumshoe: We got the victim's name from the medical records of the doc who prescribed the meds. Judge: Hmm... That's a reliable enough source for the court. Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I leave this alone or ask to hear more?) Leave it Phoenix: (I guess it doesn't really matter how they figured out who the victim was. There are more important avenues to explore.) Leads back to cross-examination Ask about the prescription bag Phoenix: So what sort of medicine was in the bag? Gumshoe: Well... Actually, the bag we found was empty. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: Yeah. Completely empty. Phoenix: (It was completely empty...?) Victim's Prescription Bag added to the Court Record. Godot: Ha...! You're entering an empty paper bag as evidence? Desperate, are you, Trite? Phoenix: ...! Godot: Now, what happened with the investigation after that, Detective? Leads back to cross-examination Ask about his health insurance Phoenix: So, the victim had no form of identification on him, correct? Gumshoe: Yeah. Phoenix: And yet, before arriving at the restaurant, he went to see a doctor. Which means... He must've had his medical insurance card with him! Judge: Oh! That is very true! Phoenix: The fact that it hasn't been found points to only one obvious conclusion. The victim's medical card was stolen! Godot: Ha...! True, the victim didn't have a medical insurance card. But why? Because Mr. Glen Elg didn't have medical insurance to begin with! Phoenix: Huh? Judge: Hmm... As I thought, a thoroughly miserable young man. Godot: Or some kind of outlaw... A bit of an edge never hurt anyone. Maya: Looks like we're off course again, Nick. Judge: Witness. Please continue with your testimony. Explain for the court the events following the preliminary investigation. Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after Victim's Prescription Bag is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait a sec! Gumshoe: Huh? D-Did I say something dumb again!? Phoenix: Let me paraphrase what you just testified to this court. \"The victim didn't have any form of ID on him.\" That's basically what you said, yes? Gumshoe: Yeah, basically. Phoenix: In that case, how were you able to identify the victim so quickly? Gumshoe: ... Oh... That. Phoenix: (He's so let down, he's got the whole sagging shoulders and puppy eyes thing going...) Gumshoe: There was a prescription bag on the victim's table along with the lottery ticket. Godot: It seems Mr. Glen Elg visited his doctor before he went to Trés Bien. Gumshoe: We got the victim's name from the medical records of the doc who prescribed the meds. Judge: Hmm... That's a reliable enough source for the court.Gumshoe: When Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But the defendant had been passed out for a while, correct? In that case... Isn't it possible someone planted the evidence in Maggey's pocket!? Gumshoe: Hey! Y-Yeah! You've nailed it, pal! Judge: Hmm... Gumshoe: It happens to me all the time! We had a department party the other day, and when I got home... ...I was wearing the boss's shoes! Godot: Godot: Keep up this crazy testimony, Detective, and those shoes will end up down your throat! Gumshoe: Sorry... Godot: So, Trite. \"Someone planted the evidence in Maggey's pocket\"...? That's a pretty bold statement. Care to back it up with some evidence? Phoenix: Um... Well... (I'd love to, if I had any...) Judge: It appears you have no evidence to support your theory, Mr. Wright. Continue with your testimony, witness.Gumshoe: And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So the half a million dollar lottery ticket and the bottle of poison were accounted for. Gumshoe: Yeah. Phoenix: Interesting... It's true that those two items are accounted for... ..but wasn't there another lottery ticket that was stolen that day? Gumshoe: Oh, yeah. The one the restaurant owner took. He won a whole dollar with it. What a lucky guy, huh? Phoenix: (And they're just going to let him get away with it...?) Judge: It was just one dollar, Detective. Maya: I guess no one cares when it's that little... Unless it's Gumshoe.Present Victim's Prescription Bag Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you.\"Phoenix: If I don't find a hole in this testimony, the judge is going to hand down his verdict!Maya: Gumshoe isn't giving us anything to work with... And we can't find any contradictions if he doesn't give us something!Phoenix: Yeah, that's true... But Maggey and Gumshoe are like dumb and dumber. Our only hope is that they were so dumb, they missed something obvious.Maya: Come on, Gumshoe!

    "cot": "The most direct contradiction is between Evidence 17: Victim's Prescription Bag and Testimony 3: \"But we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.\" Gumshoe says investigation was smooth after identifying the victim. However, it's odd that the victim had no ID but left a prescription bag behind. Since the bag was empty (no medicine, no ID), it's strange that they could so quickly and smoothly identify him, unless the lack of contents is suspicious. His testimony fails to account for the mystery of the empty prescription bag, suggesting identification should have been more difficult or that something was removed.\n",

This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. I-It wasn't me! I swear it wasn't me! Judge: The evidence and testimony we have seen and heard are conclusive! The victim was alone at his table when he drank from that poisoned cup of coffee. No! You're wrong! I know what I saw...! I saw... I saw...! I saw someone else there! A man. He's the real killer! Why won't anyone believe me? Payne: Well... I'd say that pretty much wraps this case up, wouldn't you... ...Mr. Wright!? Judge: This court finds the defendant... Guilty Judge: The court is adjourned. January 6, 10:03 AMWright & Co. Law Offices Maya: Ahh! The start of the new year always makes me feel like I can take on the whole world! Phoenix: I bet it does, Maya. Maya: So! I've decided that our resolution should be... Zvarri! \"Take on the world!\" What do you think? Phoenix: Sure, whatever, Maya... But I think maybe you've had more than enough mistletoe cake. Maya: Never! You've got to eat a lot of cake during New Year's! It's practically a tradition! Like watching the fireworks on TV or playing a board game. ???: HEY, PAL! Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe... Maya: Happy New Year, Detective! Gumshoe: Uh... likewise... NOW LISTEN UP, WRIGHT! I WANNA... Maya: Here's to another fruitful year of lawyer-police cooperation! Gumshoe: Um... Yeah... Me too... ALRIGHT, PAL! YOU'VE GOT SOME EXPLAINING TO... Maya: Have you got a holiday present for me, Detective? Gumshoe: A what? Well... I, um... Here, have this. It-It's really nothing much, but... Maya: Yay! Thanks! Gumshoe: LOOK, PAL, WE NEED TO HAVE A TALK. TAKE A SEAT! Maya: Hey! What about Pearly? You haven't forgotten her present, have you? Gumshoe: Ah... N-No... I mean, yes... I mean, no... Are you doing this on purpose? Maya: Ha ha, guess I'm busted. How did you like my first practical joke of the year? Gumshoe: Very funny, pal. Now let's see how funny you think it is when I show you this! Phoenix: What is it? A magazine? Maya: Hey, I wanna see! \"Deadly Poisoning Brings Guilty Verdict. Defense Attorney Wright Trounced.\" Phoenix: Tr-Trounced!? Let me see that! \"The defense attorney gave an almost childishly amateur performance yesterday...\" What the heck is this!? Gumshoe: It's a report, pal. About you! Maya: Listen to this! \"Mr. Wright must take full responsibility for the ruling in this case.\" Gumshoe: WELL!? And don't tell me you don't remember anything about it! Phoenix: But I don't remember anything about it! When was that issue from anyway? Gumshoe: Umm... December of last year, which I guess makes it last month. Maya: Which makes it old news, you mean. Phoenix: But I wasn't involved in a poisoning case in December! Maya: Hmm, so what do you think this is all about, Nick? Gumshoe: If it wasn't you, pal, then that leaves only one possibility... Maya: No way. You don't mean... Phoenix: A pho... Maya: A phony Nick!? Phoenix: (This must be Gumshoe's idea of a joke. Guess he's starting off the year with one, too...) Magazine Clipping added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: SO!? What are you gonna do about it, pal!? Phoenix: What do you mean, what am I going to do about it? Maya: Well, it's your fault that the judge found the defendant guilty in this case! Phoenix: My fault!? How do you figure that? Maya: Because THE Phoenix Wright is super famous now! Well, maybe only sort of... Gumshoe: Yeah. See what happens when you hotshots start getting too full of yourselves? Phoenix: (But I didn't do anything wrong! ...At least, not that I can remember...) Gumshoe: You better make this right, pal. Now! And that means taking the case back to court. Got it? Maya: Sounds like we've got our first case of the new year! Let's tackle it with gusto! Phoenix: I don't know... The judge already issued a guilty verdict once in this case. It's not going to be easy to get it overturned. Maya: ... I guess that New Year's resolution is going to have to wait until next year. Gumshoe: So you're taking the case, right!? Good! I'm gonna head over to the courthouse then. After that, I'll go back to the precinct. Drop by if you need something, OK pal!? Phoenix: (I guess people are starting to know the name \"Phoenix Wright\". If a client entrusted a case to me based on my reputation... I guess I am kind of responsible. But why would someone want to impersonate me? What sort of a guy would do that?) Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. ...Actually, I've neglected them for so long that they're covered in a layer of dust. I guess I should at least pretend to read them once in a while. Charley the plant Phoenix: Charley. A quite decorative plant. He's sort of a keepsake... something to remember Mia by. Sure, the office is a mess, but I never forget to water this little fella. Desk Phoenix: It's my desk. I don't get to use it much, so it's still super neat and tidy from when Pearls cleaned it. Movie poster Phoenix: An old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it, a long time ago. Maya watched it recently, and said she cried all night, too! ...Which, I guess, is why it's back up on the wall. I have to check it out one of these days. Window Phoenix: There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. The chain is getting so rich that they bought a whole chunk of the next town over... ...and started building a huge theme park. It's going to be called \"Gatewater Land\". ...I wonder if that bellboy is going to send me a greeting card this year, too? Talk What to do Maya: So, what's our first move? Phoenix: I guess we go down to the detention center and talk-- Maya: Wait a sec, Nick. This person's behind bars because of you. Whoever it is isn't going to be jumping at the chance to meet you, right? Phoenix: Hey, hey! Let's get one thing straight. It wasn't me, it was a fake me that did this! Maya: Hmm, I wonder if he looks exactly like you... Your phony, Xin Eohp, I mean. Phoenix: (I hope not. *shudder* ...And what kind of name for an evil double is Xin Eohp anyway!?) Maya: Ah! Nick! I've got it! Phoenix: If you're going to ask whether I've got a twin brother, the answer is no. Maya: ...Spoilsport. Any ideas Maya: Did you notice Gumshoe was acting weirder than usual, or was it just me? Phoenix: What do you mean? Maya: I mean, he was really worked up. Like a guy who's just found out he's going to be a dad or something. Phoenix: Yeah, I guess he was acting kind of strange. Maya: Maybe he realized he's got strong feelings for you, Nick! Phoenix: ... Considering how we interact, I seriously doubt that, Maya... Maya: Well, if he wasn't nervous because of you... Phoenix: ...then maybe it's because of our new guilty client? Present Attorney's Badge Maya: So you've still got that badge, I see. Phoenix: Huh!? Well, I'm a lawyer, aren't I? Maya: Yeah, but I guess I just didn't think you'd keep on being one for this long. You have to admit, you've had some close brushes with death because of your job. Phoenix: (...I fail to see how being a lawyer is more dangerous than channeling dead people.) Magazine Clipping Maya: I can't believe you've got an impersonator. Phoenix: I can't either. *sigh* Maya: Aww, but look on the bright side. Only famous stars have people impersonating them! Phoenix: This isn't funny, Maya. It's not just an impersonation. This guy stole my identity! And someone may have been wrongly convicted as a result. Maya: ...Guess you should've gone into showbiz, huh, Nick? Phoenix: (...*sigh* I will never understand how your mind works, Maya.) Maya Fey profile Phoenix: So? How's your spirit medium training going? Maya: Well... I stand under the rushing waters of the shower head every day. Phoenix: ...That's called \"taking a shower\". What happened to the rushing waters of a waterfall? Maya: Well, I'm kind of taking a break... I'm having a bit of trouble right now, you know? Phoenix: (Last year's incident must still be on her mind... I haven't seen Maya train at all since that time. I think Mia said it's because Maya's at a loss these days...) Mia Fey profile Phoenix: Mia helped me out in court again last time. Maya: It's so cool that you get to meet my sis like that. Phoenix: Yeah... Maya: We mediums lose consciousness when we're channeling, so I don't get to see my sis... Phoenix: ...I never really thought about it that way. Hey! If you want to meet Mia... ...why don't we just have Pearls call her? Maya: No... I couldn't do that. I'd be too worried about her. Phoenix: (I guess Maya's got all sorts of things to think about, too. ...Despite her immaturity saying otherwise.) Godot profile Maya: So you still can't remember anything about Godot, huh? Phoenix: I already told you. I have no idea who he is, let alone why he dislikes me so much. Maya: Well he sure seems to have a problem with you for some reason. You'd better watch your back, Nick. Coffee lovers can be quite bitter. Phoenix: You're just making that up, Maya! Dick Gumshoe profile Maya: Digging up an old case that's already been ruled on... That's not like Gumshoe, is it? Phoenix: No. He barely manages to stay on top of the cases in front of him. Maya: Yeah, he's always busy, and gets dirt pay. I mean, look at that dusty old coat he wears! Phoenix: (Did you mean he \"gets paid dirt\" or do you really think they pay him in gravel?) Any other evidence Phoenix: Do you know anything about this, Maya? Maya: Hmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everything, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this object. Phoenix: (A simple yes or no, Maya... It's not as if you had to give me a dissertation...) Any other profile Phoenix: Do you know anything about this person? Maya: Hmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everyone, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this individual. Phoenix: (A simple yes or no, Maya... It's not as if you had to give me a dissertation...) January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Maya: It's been ages since we came down to the precinct, huh, Nick? Phoenix: Looks like Gumshoe isn't around. Maya: He's got it so easy, leaving everyone else to do the work! Phoenix: No, he's been out there somewhere. My bet is on the courthouse. He's probably trying to arrange the retrial of this case. Maya: Guess that means we should go to the detention center and chat with our killer, huh? Phoenix: After being convicted without a fair trial, I'm not sure killer is the right label... Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Don't die running a red light. Die the old-fashioned way -- of old age!\" We have a winner! Inject a bit of humor, that's the key. Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a safety campaign. ...I guess? Desks Phoenix: These are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I expected. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks. Poster Phoenix: A poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest \"Babes in Uniform\" calendar. My bad. Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: WHAT! Mask☆DeMasque turned up at the bank? What's he doing!? \"Hands up, you scalawags!\" \"You're under arrest!\" Hey! That's our job! Phoenix: (Looks like Ron DeLite's opted for a new career.) Detective: Quit surfing the net, Chief! Chief: S-Sorry... I was just, um... Phoenix: (Things feel pretty tense in here...) Badgers Maya: Hey, that's the police mascot, isn't it? It's so cute! Chief: That's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police force! Phoenix: So what's with the pink one? It's new, right? Maya: She's not an \"it\", Nick. She's a \"she\", right Chief? Chief: Yup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\". Maya: So one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"? Chief: You got it! They're both married. Maya: Umm... Mr. & Mrs. Badger seem to be cuffed together, Chief. Chief: You got it! That's marriage for you! Phoenix: (Whoa... A mascot that's deeper than the deepest of deep oceans...) January 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room Maya: This is so nerve-wracking, waiting to meet our new client. I wonder just what kind of person you tricked and got found guilty...? Phoenix: K-Keep it down, Maya! That kind of talk could ruin me! ???: Aaaaaaaah! How could you, Mr. Wright!? How could you do this to me!? They put me in solitary! I haven't been able to stop crying. Phoenix: A-Aren't... you... ???: Yes, I am! I am totally and utterly let down! Maya: Aah! You're... Are you...? ??? Don't pretend you don't know me! It's me, Maggey, remember!? Maggey Byrde! Phoenix: Maggey Byrde... Ah! (Maggey Byrde... She's the policewoman I defended that one time. She was accused of murdering her lover. He was a cop, too.) What are you doing in here!? Didn't I get you acquitt-- Byrde: Oh, sure! Very funny! After that fifth-rate defense job, you come in here and start making jokes!? Maya: You better hurry up and tell her what happened, Nick. Byrde: O-Oh... I see... Phoenix: So that's where we stand right now. Maya: I'm sorry you've been caught up in another murder... Byrde: My whole life has been nothing but a whirlwind of bad luck and failures. Phoenix: (I vaguely remember her saying the exact same thing last time...) Byrde: But I don't mind! What's one more disaster in my life? At least now the real Mr. Wright is here with me. I won't let the world keep me down, sir! Examine Surveillance camera Phoenix: Smile, you're on candid camera. Guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. I bet they don't get too many waitresses in here. He looks like he's getting a bit restless. Talk Maggey Byrde Maya: So, how come you're dressed like that, Maggey? Last year you looked so sharp in that police uniform. Byrde: Hmph. I was fired after that... incident last year. Maya: Oh. I'm sorry. Byrde: It's OK. I don't mind one bit. I enjoyed being on the force, but I think it was time for me to move on. Maya: So, what do you do now? Byrde: In the second act of \"The Life of Maggey Byrde\", I'm playing the role of a waitress! Maya: A waitress!? Byrde: Yes. In a French restaurant. It's a small place, but it's quite fashionable. My charming smile and shapely figure came through for me. And the owner, Mr. Armstrong, hired me straight away, sir. Phoenix: And then you got into this mess straight away, right? Byrde: Yeah, you could put it that way... What happened Byrde: This whole mess started on the 3rd of last month... And it happened at Trés Bien. Maya: \"Treh Bee-an\"...? Byrde: Yes. It's a restaurant where good service and a friendly smile are always included! Maya: Oh... Byrde: There were two men at the table, both drinking coffee. And then... One of the men slipped some poison into the victim's cup! The victim took just one sip and was gasping for air! I was so shocked, I passed out. Maya: Hey, hold on there, Maggey. Byrde: What? Maya: You keep calling the guy, \"the victim\". Didn't you know the guy who was killed? Byrde: Not at all! I'd never even seen the guy before! Maya: Oh... Phoenix: (So she wouldn't have a motive to kill him then, I guess...) And the other man, the killer. You saw him, right? Byrde: Of course! A good waitress must be attentive to the clientele. Phoenix: So, you saw the killer, but you were found guilty of the crime anyway? How come? Byrde: ......... You tell me, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Ack! (Guess the answer to my question is \"my phony\"... Anyway, she saw the killer. Better see if I can get a description of the guy.) Guilty verdict (appears after \"What happened\") Maya: So, if you saw the murderer, why were you still convicted? Byrde: Because no one else saw. Maya: Saw what? Byrde: The other man. The one who put the poison in the victim's coffee. Everyone testified that way. Mr. Armstrong, the customer... Everyone. \"The victim was sitting alone at his table the whole time.\" Phoenix: But how's that possible? Byrde: I don't know. But nobody, not one person, would believe me, sir. Even Phoenix Wright, my one last hope for a fair trial, failed me. What a pathetic defense! My granny could've done a better job! Phoenix: Look! That wasn't me, OK? Byrde: And then! ...They found something a bit incriminating in my apron pocket. Maya: What? Byrde: A small bottle... of poison. Maya: WHAT!? P-Poison!? It was in your pocket!? Byrde: Well, I passed out when the victim collapsed. The killer must've slipped the poison into my pocket when I was unconscious. Phoenix: And no one else saw this other guy? Byrde: No, sir. That's what everyone said. But I don't see how they could've missed him... The other guy (appears after \"Guilty verdict\") Byrde: I was the one who took the coffee to the two men. Phoenix: O-Oh...? And what was your impression of them? Byrde: Well... When I first saw them, I kind of thought they might be in the music industry. Maya: In music? How come? Byrde: Well, one of them had some sort of earpiece, and an emo musician's look about him. And there was a sample CD on the table, sir. Maya: An earpiece and a sample CD, huh? Did you get a look at the CD at all? Byrde: It had a band's name written on it. I think it was \"MC\"-something. They must've been preparing for their debut, I guess. Phoenix: So it was a band's CD. Maybe a promo disc? Maya: Maybe it was \"MC Screwdriver\"! Phoenix: Get serious, Maya. Would you buy the CD of a group named that? Byrde: Nngh... What was the name of that group again...? \"MC Hacksaw...\"? No... \"MC...\" Maya: And what about the killer? What did he look like? Byrde: Well, I, um... I don't really remember. Only that he was a young man. Well-built like the victim, really. Present Attorney's Badge Byrde: That badge! Is it real? Phoenix: Of course it's real! Byrde: That's what they all say. But I've been duped before. Give it to me for a sec! Phoenix: Ah...! ...*chomp!* Maya: She... She bit into it... Byrde: And I left a few teeth marks, too! Phoenix: I can see that... Byrde: I just wish I could remember if that means it's real or a fake. Phoenix: *sigh* (I said it was real!) Magazine Clipping Phoenix: Oh, yeah. I need to ask you about this... Byrde: Hey! This article's about my case! Phoenix: Can you tell me anything about the guy who was pretending to be me? Byrde: Yes, sir! It was the morning after I'd been arrested... I met you in the visitor's room here. You were wearing one of your super-sharp suits. Phoenix: Me? Byrde: Yes, you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Argh... Maya: Hey, Maggey! Was my evil double Ayam here, too? Byrde: No. I don't remember a phony you, Maya. Maya: Oh... *sigh* It would've been so cool... Byrde: Then you got really worked up and passionate. \"I'm gonna get you' cleared'a dis crime!\" you said. (Changed from ['I'm gonna get you cleared of this crime!' you said.] in the original release) Phoenix: OK, I get the picture. But you've met me in person before... So how come you didn't realize that guy wasn't the real me? Byrde: ... I guess, looking back now, it was a little strange... Phoenix: Only a little? Byrde: Well, OK, so you were a bit taller than normal. And you looked a bit shady. And your voice was a bit weird. Oh, and you had this funny accent. And... Phoenix: So the guy was nothing like me, then!? Byrde: But he had your spiky hair and blue suit. Phoenix: (... Is that all it takes for someone to imitate me...?) Maya: How about everyone else in the courtroom, like the judge and the observers...? Didn't they realize he was an imposter? Byrde: Everyone had these big question marks on their faces... But it seemed that no one wanted to say anything, sir. Maya: This case just keeps getting weirder and weirder... Maya Fey profile Byrde: Thanks for your help last year! Maya: Aw, it was nothing. I'm glad we got you off the hook. Byrde: I hope you can help me out this year, too! Maya: Yeah, me too. It's be sweet if we could get that verdict overturned. Dick Gumshoe profile Byrde: Oh, Detective Gumshoe! He really looked out for me when I was on the force! Phoenix: Have you seen him recently? Byrde: No. He's never been to the restaurant. Maya: Guess he's not a fan of French cuisine, huh? He's an instant noodle type of guy, after all. Byrde: Yeah, he prefers the simple things in life. Phoenix: (...Or he's just simply too poor to afford anything else.) Maggey Byrde profile Byrde: No matter what happens, I never let anything get me down! Maya: You're always so positive, aren't you, Maggey? Byrde: Macho Maggey Byrde, they say! The early Byrde catches the worm! A Byrde in the hand! Maya: Wow! All those phrases are named after you? Byrde: And I never turn my back on anything! Maya: You're always so strong, aren't you, Maggey? Byrde: Macho Maggey Byrde, they say! I'm a tough old Byrde! Maya: \"Tough old byrde\", Nick! Hee hee! Do you get it? Phoenix: ...Yeah, I get it. Anything else Byrde: I know I used to be on the police force, sir. But I'm incarcerated, now. So I can't use my connections to help you. All I can tell you about now is info about ex-cons or the clientele of Trés Bien, sir... Maya: Aww, don't let it get you down, Maggey! After clearing all Talk options and presenting Magazine Clipping: Byrde: Mr. Wright... Do you think it's possible to get a retrial? Phoenix: Probably. The court ruled in the absence of a genuine defense attorney. So we should be able to get a retrial. Byrde: Um... Mr. Wright...? Phoenix: ? Byrde: Do you think we'll win next time? ...Sir? Phoenix: ...! Byrde: My life has been a full course meal of bad luck, complete with defeat for dessert. Since I was 6 months old, when I fell from the 9th floor of my apartment building... ...I've been hit by all sorts of vehicles, gotten sick from all sorts of foods... ...failed at almost every test I've taken, experienced almost every kind of disaster... I even landed a phony lawyer when I had the misfortune of being accused of murder. But! I will survive! Because Maggey Byrde always lives to fight another day! And one day, I'll find it! Just you wait and see, sir! I'll find that one, single moment of good luck! Maya: Argh, Xin Eohp is really gonna pay for this! Phoenix: Wh-What are you staring at me like that for...? (But Maya's right... Whoever it is that thought it was a good idea to use my name... ...and get an innocent girl convicted of murder had better watch out!) Maya: We'll find him! Don't you worry. We'll get Xin Eohp for you! Byrde: Thank you! Oh! I'll tell you where Trés Bien is then! Phoenix: Trés... Ah, right. The restaurant where the murder took place. Byrde: Yes, sir. When you go, please tell Mr. Armstrong I said hi! Maya: Sure! Alright, Nick! Let's go check out this restaurant and its food! January 6Trés Bien Maya: Wow! Look at this place. Phoenix: \"Look\"? More like \"smell\"... What is with the suffocating scent of flowers in here...? Then again, girls like that sort of thing, right? Maya: Actually, I'm not all that into it... Phoenix: ... Maya: ... No one's coming to seat us. Maybe there's no one here. Phoenix: Don't be silly, Maya. This is a restaurant, and it's open for business. HELLO! ANYONE HERE? ... I don't believe it! There really isn't anyone here! Maya: Perfect! Let's get intrusive! If there's no one here, we can take anything we want! Phoenix: (Yeah, I suppose we can...) Examine Cash register Maya: Look, it's one of those magical boxes that spits out money. Phoenix: You know, you're the only person who would ever describe a cash register in that way! Trinkets Maya: Look at all the little trinkets tucked away in here. Phoenix: I bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally. Let's see... A bouquet of flowers, some potpourri, and look! Fine bone china cups! Maya: ... I never knew you were so... cultured. Phoenix: Come on, Maya! This is common knowledge! Any Joe Schmoe knows this much! Front entrance Phoenix: It's the restaurant's front entrance. There's a sign hanging on the door written in French. It probably says, \"Open\" or \"Closed\". It must be one or the other, but I don't know which since I dunno Jacques about French. Magazine rack Maya: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Phoenix: Why don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" something, huh, Maya? Maya: Yeah. I guess I could. I'm always in my acolyte clothes, aren't I? It'd be fun to wear normal clothes every now and then. Phoenix: Hm? There's something stuffed in behind the rack. Maya: ...Looks like a sports paper to me. Hey, and look at this! Someone's scribbled a little doodle on one of the pages. \"MC Bomber\", and one, two, three, four, five zeros... A-A hundred thousand... dollars... maybe? Phoenix: I wonder what \"MC Bomber\" is supposed to be...? ! (This paper! It's from December 3rd...) This paper's from the day of the poisoning! Maya: WHAT!? Sports Paper added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (A paper from the day of the murder... This has got to be a clue! I should see if I can find out some more about this paper...) Magazine rack (subsequent times) Maya: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Phoenix: Looks like Mr. Armstrong doesn't get any newspapers. Maya: Well, it wouldn't exactly suit the feel of the place, would it? Phoenix: Why don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" like in these mags, Maya? Maya: Yeah. I'd look stunning in some of those Parisian frocks, huh? Phoenix: (We found that sports paper behind this magazine rack earlier... I'd better try to find out everything I can about it...) Table Phoenix: This table's set nicely. It just needs a customer. Maya: What do you think this flower is, Nick? Phoenix: Let's see... Well, it doesn't look like a tulip, and it's not a sunflower, I don't think... Maya: Duh. Even I could've told you that. Phoenix: Well, those are the only kinds of flowers I know. Dagnabit, I'm a lawyer, not a botanist! Windows Phoenix: Wow! It's a beautiful winter wonderland out there. Maya: Really!? Cool! I love snow! Let me see! Huh? It's not white. It's not even snowing. Phoenix: Got you! I was only kidding, Maya. Maya: Nick! There are lies that are OK to tell, and lies that definitely aren't. Phoenix: (...All I did was tell an itty-bitty white lie about nonexistent white snow.) Partition Phoenix: This restaurant has partitions that separate the tables. When you're seated at a table, you can only see the tables to your right or left. Crime scene Phoenix: This must be the table where the murder occurred. Maya: I guess so, with all this police tape all around it. Phoenix: And that stain must be from the poisoned coffee. Don't go licking the tablecloth, OK, Maya? Maya: Why would I lick it? I'm not a cat, you know! Phoenix: (Then why can I picture you doing just that?) Wright & Co. Law Offices Present Sports Paper Maya: Hmm... \"MC Bomber\"... Phoenix: And don't forget the \"100,000\", too. Maya: There's something about that name, \"MC Bomber\". Phoenix: Yeah, It's a pretty unusual name. Phoenix: And don't forget the \"100,000\", too. Maya: Everyone's worried about bombs these days, I guess. Phoenix: I'm not sure that has any bearing on anything related to this case...) Maya: Anyway, we should really look into this some more! Maggey Byrde profile Maya: This is Maggey's second time as a murder suspect, huh? Phoenix: Yeah. The first time was a little over a year ago... She was on the police force back then. Maya: Wasn't she working under Gumshoe? That does it, Nick! We're gonna get her off the hook or I'll give up hamburgers! Detention Center Present Sports Paper Byrde: Oh! A sports paper. Let's see, let's see... Did Gutsen Brawn manage to defend his heavyweight title? Phoenix: Sorry, Maggey. That paper is actually a month old... It's from the day of the murder... Maya: And Gutsen got knocked out yesterday, I'm afraid. Byrde: Oh, no... Phoenix: I found this paper in the magazine rack at Trés Bien. Byrde: Really? That's strange... Trés Bien doesn't get newspapers. Mr. Armstrong says he's not really fond of them. Maya: Then maybe one of the customers left it behind? Phoenix: Anyway, what I want you to take a look at is this scribble here. Byrde: Ah-ha! That's it, sir! \"MC Bomber\"! That was the name that was written on the CD! Phoenix: (Just as I thought...) Maya: I guess it wasn't \"MC Screwdriver\" after all, huh... Byrde: So, that $100,000 must be a down payment for a record deal, right? Maya: If someone gave me $100,000, I'd sing for sure! \"The Master of Kurain\" or \"The Spirit Song\" or even \"Maya's Theme\"! Phoenix: Um, OK, Maya... So, if the sample CD was on the victim's table... That means this newspaper may have belonged to the victim! Maya: You're right! Phoenix: (So the victim left this behind on the day of the murder, huh...) Maya: I think we better step up the investigation, don't you Nick? After presenting Sports Paper in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: January 6Trés Bien ???: Oh là là! Bon-JOUR! Welcome to la Trés Bien! Maya: Oh! Hel... lo... ... Phoenix: (What happened to Maya? She's frozen stiff...) ???: Bienvenue! Welcome to my petite restauranté! Maya: Huh? \"Bee Avenue\"? ???: Oh, non, my petite chulip! Maya: Huh? Me? ???: Look at z'is face! Like la kitten rejected by its own mother. You are fatigued, non? Alors! You need z'is! An aromatic bath oil mélange of la néroli and la rose. My personal recommendation! Maya: You think I need what...? ???: Oui, oui! Just add a couple of drops of z'is mixture to la bath water, and voilá! It will soothe your body and your mind. It's simply fantastique! Maya: Really? ???: And for la monsieur! Phoenix: Who? Me? ???: Look at z'at face! Like la puppy rejected by life itself! You are fatigued, non? For you, monsieur, I recommend z'is! Oil of bergamot. And maybe a 'int of... Oui, oui! I will add la peppermint and la clary sage for a fragrance exceptionnel! Such an invigorating recipe will bring out your delicious beauty, monsieur! Phoenix: M-My beauty!? ???: Alors. If you will be seated, I will bring you la special menu of z'e day! Phoenix: Actually, we're not here to eat. We're lawyers. ???: Mais bien sûr! I know z'is already, monsieur. You are la Phoenix Wright, non? Phoenix: Um, yes... You know me? ???: Mais, oui oui! I never forget a man who flirts wiz me! Especially in court! Maya: I guess he was cross-examined by our mysterious Xin Eohp... Phoenix: It looks like everyone to do with this case knows who \"I\" am already. Maya: I wonder what sort of impression Xin Eohp's been leaving on people, don't you? Armstrong: Allow me to introduce myself to you again. I am Jean Armstrong. Enchanté! Talk Trés Bien Maya: So what does \"Trés Bien\" mean? I know \"trés\". That means \"three\", right? Armstrong: Non, non, non! \"Trés Bien\" is Français! In English, you would say, \"Very Good\". Maya: Oh. Very good... Armstrong: Oui, exactement! La atmosphere is trés bien, and la cuisine is trés bien! Phoenix: (If the food's good, why aren't there any customers in here?) Armstrong: My cuisine is not for all. Some people, z'ey do not appreciate la haute cuisine. Phoenix: (I thought everyone liked hot cuisine...) Armstrong: Since I 'ave lost Maggey, I do not 'ave enough 'ands. Phoenix: So, you're running this place on your own now? Armstrong: Oui. For la moment. No one 'as answered my advertisement. Oh, poor moi! Phoenix: (... Please don't eyeball me while you say that.) Armstrong: I am la chef. I am la manager. I am also a trained aromatherapist. Maya: A roaming what? Armstrong: A practitioner d'aromatherapy. La art of soothing la soul wiz z'e delicate floral aromas. Phoenix: (Delicate? The smell coming from that bottle earlier was anything but...) What happened Phoenix: So, could you tell me what you know about the incident? Armstrong: Bien. It makes me sad to remember it, yet I remember it so well. More z'an a month 'as passed since it 'appened. Phoenix: (Yeah, I guess it's been about a month since Maggey's sentencing...) Armstrong: So. It was z'e third of last month. Just after one in z'e afternoon. A man who was in 'ere for a coffee suddenly became ill. Phoenix: Because of the poison in his coffee? Armstrong: Z'at is la truth as I know it. It was Maggey who took 'is drink to 'im. I was in la kitchen. I 'eard z'e sound of someone collapsing. When I came out to see what it was, 'e was already slumped in 'is chair. Maya: He was dead? Armstrong: Mon dieu! Oui! 'E was dead! Maggey 'ad passed out also. Phoenix: And this man who died... Was he alone? Armstrong: Oui, monsieur. All alone. I know z'at Maggey said z'ere was someone else, but... Maya: I see... Armstrong: La police, z'ey asked me many times. \"Are you sure z'ere was no one else at z'e table?\" z'ey asked. But I am not z'e only one. La old man said z'e same thing. Phoenix: Old man? What old man? Old man (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: Um... So who is the old man that you mentioned? Armstrong: At z'e time of la murder, z'ere was another customer in 'ere. Maya: What!? Someone else saw it? Armstrong: Mais, oui! As usual, 'e came alone z'at day. At z'e time of la murder, 'e was 'ere. 'E saw it, too. But 'e said z'e same thing, z'at z'ere was no one else at la victim's table. Maya: But Maggey swears there were two people! Armstrong: Mais, mademoiselle. La lawyer, 'e could not prove z'is, non? Phoenix: About the lawyer. That was me, I suppose? Armstrong: Mais bien sûr! Phoenix: ... Wow! He's the first person who's said it wasn't me. Maya: Don't kid yourself, Nick! Hmph. Now who's the one making stuff up!? Maggey's motive (appears after presenting Maggey Byrde profile) Phoenix: When Maggey took the coffee over to the victim... ...did anything happen? Armstrong: Ou... Oui. I-I suppose you could say so. Phoenix: So what happened? Armstrong: Non. It was, er... It was nothing. Maya: Look, Maggey says she didn't even know the guy! But she's still been indicted for murder! The prosecution must have come up with some kind of motive! Armstrong: Oui. It is true. Phoenix: If there was anything at all between Maggey and the victim, it could be relevant. Maya: So please! Tell us anything you know. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Psyche-Locks!?) (Changed from [A Psyche-Lock!?] in the original release) Maya: No way! What are we going to do, Nick? Phoenix: We'll just have to remov... WHAT THE!? Maya: Wh-What's wrong? Phoenix: The Magatama... It's gone! Maya: Huh? Phoenix: I had it in my pocket, but... It has vanished into thin air! Maya: WHAT!? Phoenix: (But I could see the Psyche-Locks. (Changed from [But I could see the Psyche-Lock.] in the original release) Maybe that means the Magatama's nearby...?) Maggey's motive (subsequent times) Phoenix: Maggey wouldn't just have put poison in the coffee of some guy she didn't even know. If she's really guilty, there must have been something between her and the victim. 3 PSYCHE LOCKS Armstrong: N-Non. It was nothing. I am sure. Qué será, será. Perhaps Maggey 'ad another reason. Phoenix: (What's Maggey's motive got to do with this chef? Why is he hiding things from me? And another thing... Where did I drop the Magatama? The fact that I can see the lock [sic] must mean it's nearby.) Maya: I only loaned it to you, you know. So you better find it, Nick! OK? Phoenix: (...And here I thought it was mine to keep!) Present Attorney's Badge Armstrong: Please, monsieur. Z'ere is no need to show me z'at. You are Mon. Phoenix Wright, z'e worst defense lawyer in town. Phoenix: (I think I can imagine how he formed this completely wrong impression of me...) Um, the last time we met, did I show you this badge? Armstrong: Oui. You flashed it to everyone in la restaurant! Maya: Looks like Xin Eohp is a bigger fan of flashing stuff than you are, Nick! Magazine Clipping Armstrong: I am not a lawyer myself. I do not wish to speak out of turn. But your defense in court z'at day was a little, how you say, \"lacking\", per'aps? Phoenix: *sigh* Armstrong: Even a Frenchman who cannot speak any English could 'ave done a better job! You were very cool, though. Oh, oui, oui! So 'andsome. Maya: Wow, I wonder just how bad the defense could've been... Armstrong: Every time you opened your mouth, z'e 'ole courthouse stirred. Phoenix: (Oh, man. That is something I don't want to imagine...) Sports Paper Phoenix: We found this sports paper in the magazine rack here. Armstrong: One of my customers must 'ave left it behind. Maya: Do you have any idea which customer it was? Armstrong: Z'e only ideas I 'ave, mademoiselle, I save for my kitchen! Maya Fey profile Armstrong: Oh là, là! You 'ave such a pretty smile, my petite chulip! Maya: Who, me? Armstrong: Oui. La smile is the most important thing for us girls, n'est-ce pas? Maya: Um... Sure! Armstrong: If you want a job 'ere, it is yours, precious! Mia Fey profile Armstrong: Mon dieu! What beauty! Maya: That's my sister! Armstrong: Ah, oui? Another delight! But you 'ave a certain je ne sais quois z'at I do not sense from your sister. Maya: I do? Armstrong: So throw your head 'ead 'igh! Thrust out your feminine features! Do not lose 'eart, ma fille! You are a woman! A woman extraordinaire! Maya: Do I look like I need cheering up or something? Maggey Byrde profile Armstrong: Maggey was a policewoman once, n'est-ce pas? Phoenix: Yes. But she had to quit for, um, reasons beyond her control. Armstrong: Oui, oui. She was la suspect in la murder investigation, non? Maya: Oh... You know about that? Armstrong: Z'at is why I gave to 'er la perfume for la 'appiness. Phoenix: Happiness perfume? Armstrong: Oui. Blended from bergamot, like I 'ave given to you before. Phoenix: But she's been arrested again. And found guilty this time. Armstrong: Z'is is true. 'Er natural aroma of un'appiness must 'ave been very strong. Phoenix: (Just admit it! Your perfume doesn't work!) Armstrong: I am not surprised she was la prime suspect. After something like z'at took place before my very eyes. Maya: Something like what? Phoenix: (What's this guy talking about!?) Maya: Does this mean... Maggey did have a motive? Phoenix: We've got to ask this guy for more info, stat! Jean Armstrong profile Armstrong: It is 'ard to imagine, I know, but I was an apprentice for five years in la gay Paris. Maya: Wow! In Paris!? Armstrong: It was something la chef z'ere said to me z'at made me decide to open my own restaurant. Phoenix: What was it? Armstrong: Z'at awful man said to me, \"You must train for another ten years!\" Oh! It was such a shock! So unexpected! But you would 'ave to be a fool to do z'is, non? Anything else Phoenix: Um, about this... Armstrong: Félicitations! Mais... qu'est-ce que c'est? Phoenix: Ack! Um... Je... Je no comprehend... Maya: Nick! Don't just make something up! After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: Um, Mr. Armstrong... Could I just confirm something with you again? The table where the victim was sitting... Was anyone else sitting there? Armstrong: ... Z'at is a question you will 'ave to ask 'im yourselves. Maya: Huh? \"'Im\"? Armstrong: La old man spends all of 'is time dans la parc. Phoenix: La p-parc? Oh, a park? What park's that? Armstrong: Behind la restaurant. It is called, \"Vitamin Square\". Maya: Thank you! Armstrong: Je vous en prie, my dear! Maya: Let's go check out this Vitamin Square right now, Nick! January 6Vitamin Square Maya: So this is Vitamin Square. Phoenix: Yeah. I see where they get the name from now. The fruits scream \"VITAMINS!\" at you. Maya: Hey, Nick! That's the guy, right? Isn't that the old man Mr. Armstrong was talking about? Phoenix: That grouchy-looking grandpa? Maya: He's throwing seeds out for the pigeons. Phoenix: Maya, he's not throwing seeds for them, he's throwing seeds AT them! Old Man: ... Phoenix: (Ugh... My grumpiness-threat level has just been raised to red...) Examine Sandbox Maya: I used to love sandboxes like you wouldn't believe! Phoenix: Really? You? Maya: Sure. Finding iron filings in the sand with a magnet was my favorite thing to do. Phoenix: Iron filings? Wow... That's too exciting for words. Maya: It was my ambition to collect every single shred of iron in the sandbox. I was such a kid back then! Phoenix: So, did you manage to get all the iron? Maya: No, I never did. I think I came close, though. Come to think of it, I still have all the iron filings I found way back when. You want them? Phoenix: No. Fruit attractions Maya: This place is so fruity! Phoenix: That's not a bad thing. Besides, I love apples. They're among my favorites. Maya: Then that apple slide is perfect for you! Phoenix: ... And what is so \"perfect\" about it? Maya: Oh come on. Don't be a stick in the mud! Slide down it a few times. Go on! Woo! Phoenix: No way! I'd get covered in sand if I slid down that slide. Anyone can see that. Maya: Yeah, you're right. Otherwise, I'd give it a try, too. Pigeons Maya: Hey, look. Pigeons! Phoenix: Yeah. And heaps of them, too. Maya: Did you know that pigeons are a symbol of peace? Phoenix: That's a dove, not a pigeon. Maya: ... Poor things. Just because they're gray means they can't be symbols of peace and harmony? Phoenix: You're over-thinking this one by just a smidge, Maya. Magazine on orange-themed seat Maya: Ooh, there's a magazine here. Phoenix: It's a magazine full of job listings. Old Man: You disgusting rogue, picking up something someone else threw away! Phoenix: \"Threw away\"? Did you throw this away? Are you looking for a job? Old Man: Kah! That's none of your business! Phoenix: Sorry! I guess I'll take the magazine with me then. Old Man: I don't want anyone else having it! Give it back! Phoenix: (Too bad. Now that you want it so bad, I don't want to give it up!) Job Listings added to the Court Record. Old Man: Hey! That's mine! Closer orange-themed seat (after examining magazine on orange-themed seat) Maya: Looking at this orange reminds me... Phoenix: Of what? Maya: That you're supposed to eat a lot of them to ward off colds in the winter. You can't have fun during the holidays if you're sick in bed, you know. Phoenix: You don't have to tell me twice. Talk What you saw Phoenix: Um... Excuse me. Old Man: ... Phoenix: Would you mind if I had a word with you? Old Man: Yes! Phoenix: I just want to ask you a couple of questions... Old Man: What's the matter with you!? Can't you see I'm busy? So you don't like my seeds, eh, pigeons!? Phoenix: (He's really chucking those seeds at them! That's got to hurt!) Old Man: Go on! Eat this! Phoenix: (*sigh*) Maggey Byrde Phoenix: Excuse me, sir. Can I ask you about Maggey Byrde? Old Man: I don't know any Maggey Byrde! Maya: Yes, you do. Maggey. The waitress at Trés Bien. Old Man: Kah! It's a disgrace, I tell you. An utter disgrace! Maya: A disgrace? Old Man: An innocent young girl revealing herself like that! Phoenix: Revealing!? You mean her uniform? Old Man: The youth of today! They don't have any shame! No shame, I tell you! Not one ounce! Whatever happened to the old bushido values of Japan, like honor and modesty? Maya: What about me? I'm not wearing anything revealing. Old Man: You!? Your problem is you lack any sense of grace! Maya: Talk about hitting a girl where it hurts... Trés Bien Phoenix: Do you go to Trés Bien a lot? Old Man: Hmph! That miserable excuse for a restaurant? That garbage they serve in there's not food. Where's the sushi? The tempura? The rice!? Phoenix: Trés Bien is a French restaurant, sir... Old Man: Where do you think we are, boy? In Paris!? I want real food, not those snooty snacks! And what about those shameless girls!? Phoenix: You mean the waitresses? Old Man: You can see all the way up to their... their... Yes! The waitresses! They're practically naked! It's a disgrace, isn't it? Well, isn't it!? Phoenix: Listen, it's not my restaurant. Old Man: Kah! It's a miserable excuse for a restaurant, that place! Miserable! Phoenix: (He certainly knows the place. He must be a regular! But if he hates it so much, why does he keep going?) Trés Bien regular (appears after \"Trés Bien\") Maya: Are you a regular at that restaurant, sir? Old Man: ... Maya: It's just, if you dislike it so much, why would you keep going there? Old Man: ... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: There you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha! Take that! Maya: He must be hiding something, right? Phoenix: If he is, I should be able to see a Psyche-Lock... Oh, wait... I don't exactly have the Magatama right now, huh... Maya: Remember, Nick. That Magatama is only on loan. You better find it or else! Phoenix: (If Pearls ever gets wind of this, I'm going to be in a world of pain...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, excuse me, sir. Could I just ask you about this... Old Man: ... Hmm, ha-hmm, hmm... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: Here you go, boy! How does some pigeon feed sound to you!? Phoenix: (This wasn't exactly what I was hoping to get out of this guy...) Detention Center Present Job Listings Maya: Um, Maggey... Byrde: Oh, are you looking for some part-time work, Maya? Why don't you take a job at the restaurant? I bet Mr. Armstrong would hire you. Maya: Really? Me? Byrde: It's pretty cool being a waitress, you know. And in the kitchen, you'll get to see all of the chef's greatest secrets! Maya: What secrets...? Byrde: You can't make it obvious, but just spy on him for a bit. You'll see. It's interesting. Maya: Wow! I can't wait to get my apron on now! Phoenix: Yeah, he has a pretty intense aroma, too. Maya: So did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...? Byrde: Apparently not. Well, he's in the kitchen all the time, so I guess it's possible that he didn't. Jean Armstrong profile Byrde: Oh, so you met the owner, Mr. Armstrong! Phoenix: He's, um... Oh, how can I put this... pretty unique, huh? Byrde: He has a really intense aura. As a chef and as a person. Phoenix: Yeah, he has a pretty intense aroma, too. Maya: So did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...? Byrde: Apparently not. Well, he's in the kitchen all the time, so I guess it's possible that he didn't. Trés Bien Examine Cash register (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It's really tight behind the cash register counter. Can Mr. Armstrong even get in there? And if he got in... could he get out again? Trinkets (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: There's a bunch of little trinkets on a shelf by the door. I bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally. Magazine rack (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Ugh. All the clothes in these are absolutely atrocious! ...Some of them have been circled in red. ... I really hope Mr. Armstrong is not thinking of buying those. Table (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: Mr. Armstrong must be a pretty big neat-freak. He already has this table ready to go. Now if only the food in this place was edible... Windows (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It looks pretty cold out there on the streets. Peaceful, though. It's nice that people can take it easy after the holiday rush. Crime scene (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: This must be the table where the poisoning occurred. The stain tells the story well. The whole area is still cordoned off with police tape. I guess it must still be under investigation. Present Job Listings Armstrong: Mademoiselle! Maya: Y-Yes? Armstrong: Are you looking for la job? Maya: What!? N-No, no. I was just... Armstrong: Let me see. Your style is un peu différent, but you 'ave a good face. Maya: ...Different? Armstrong: Félicitations! You 'ave passed! I will 'ire you! Bien! Come wiz me. I will teach you everyz'ing I know! Maya: N-Nick! HEEEEEELP! Phoenix: (I don't know whether to laugh or feel bad for Maya... Maybe I should do both...?) Vitamin Square Examine Sandbox Phoenix: When I think back to when I was young... ...I wonder what I found so great about playing in a sandbox. Maybe I'll come back here in the middle of the night one of these days to relive it. ... On second thought, being arrested by Gumshoe would be too embarrassing to bear. Fruit attractions Phoenix: You don't see many parks like this anymore. What a great place for kids to play. But that old man's the only one here, chucking his seeds at the pigeons. Pigeons Phoenix: The pigeons are so busy pecking at the seeds, they don't notice anything else. Seeing those birds eat with such intense focus... ...reminds me of Maya when she's scarfing down a burger. Closer orange-themed seat Phoenix: This is where I found that job listings magazine before. A guy like me carrying around a magazine like that kind of gives the wrong impression. I guess I better give it back to that old man once this investigation's over. Talk Maggey Byrde Phoenix: Excuse me, sir. Can I ask you about Maggey Byrde? Old Man: I don't know any Maggey Byrde! Phoenix: Yes, you do. You know, the waitress at Trés Bien. Old Man: Hmph! If you ask me It's a disgrace! Th-That's what it is! An innocent young girl revealing herself like that! Phoenix: So, you didn't like that kind of thing, then? Old Man: ... Wh-What are you trying to say about me, boy!? Explain yourself! Phoenix: Um, nothing! I'm not saying anything about you... Old Man: I know your kind! You young ones with your spiky hair and your fancy suits! That heads of yours is over-flowing with filthy ideas! Phoenix: (...I know someone who needs to learn some stress management.) Old Man: Get out of here, you young brat! Trés Bien regular Phoenix: So, you are a regular at that restaurant, right, sir? Old Man: ... Phoenix: You're always complaining about the place, so why do you go there? Old Man: ... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: There you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha! Take that! Phoenix: (Something's not right about this guy... But If he's hiding something, I should be able to see a Psyche-Lock.) Oh, wait... (I don't exactly have the Magatama right now, huh... I need to find it before I can get anywhere with this old man.) After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: Looks like they have Maggey in questioning. I guess I've asked her pretty much everything... I'll come back if there's anything else I need to ask her later. Examine Guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. There's nothing for him to do right now, so he's catching some vertical z's. After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Wright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Poor Maya. It looks like Mr. Armstrong's really taken a shine to her. I suppose I'll just have to let her work at the restaurant for a while. I'll go pick her up from Trés Bien once things have cooled off. After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Gumshoe: Well, pal!? Have you found the evidence yet!? The one that's gonna find her innocent!? Phoenix: Um, no. Not yet. We've only just started our investigation. Gumshoe: Well, whatever you need to know, I'll give you the dirt on it. I'm putting off all my other cases for now, pal! Phoenix: (Gumshoe's really fired up about this...) Gumshoe: Oh, yeah! One more thing! The retrial's been approved. Court's sitting at 10 AM tomorrow. And Godot's gonna be the prosecutor... Phoenix: (Oh. ... Him.) Gumshoe: Now, listen up, pal! If Maggey's found guilty again... Phoenix: Y-Yes...? Gumshoe: Um... I'll... I'll make sure you get locked up good for it, got it!? Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Hitting the gas is like hitting the fast-forward button on your life.\" No. That's too obscure. You don't really get the \"you'll die before your time\" idea. I need something more direct. Something a bit more light-hearted. Something like, \"Hitting the gas is your passport to paradise!\" Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a safety campaign. ...I guess? Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: WHAT!? Poisoned coffee waitress gets a retrial!? I knew it! I knew there was something funny about the taste of this coffee! OK! Who brought me this coffee today? Hands up! Phoenix: (Yeesh! Have a little faith in your subordinates!) Detective: Quit surfing the net, Chief! Chief: S-Sorry... I was just, um... Phoenix: (Things feel pretty tense in here...) Badgers Phoenix: No matter what, whenever I come here, that mascot's there to greet me. Chief: You got that right. That's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police force! Phoenix: So what's with the pink one? It's new, right? Chief: Yup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\". Phoenix: So one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"? Chief: You got it! They're married. Phoenix: (So should I expect to see Baby Badger next time I'm here...?) Talk Maggey Byrde Phoenix: So the guilty party was Maggey Byrde, huh? Gumshoe: Yeah... Phoenix: Back when she was on the police force... ...you were her mentor when she was a rookie, right? Gumshoe: Yeah, I kept a close eye on her. I-I mean, not too close. You know. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ...... ......... Hey, what's with the funny looks, pal? I was with her... It wasn't anything like... Look! Sure, I was her boss when she was doing her training. But that was it. Nothing happened. Phoenix: (Gumshoe sure is sweating up a storm over nothing... ...Ah, so that's it! Our big ol' Gumshoe has a little ol' crush on Maggey!) Gumshoe: I... I don't like her or anything! I... I was... Aaaargh! Phoenix: (Note to self: Gossip with Maya about this later!) Gumshoe: Look, pal! Don't tell anyone, OK!? You've gotta keep it a secret, got it!? Phoenix: S-Sure... And would you mind not guessing what I'm thinking all the time? Gumshoe: Hey, tell your face, pal, not me. You'd have to be blind not to see what's on your mind. The victim Phoenix: So I was wondering... Could you fill me in on the victim? Gumshoe: Glen Elg, he was a computer programmer. Phoenix: I see. A programmer... Gumshoe: He was just a regular Joe working for a small-time computer firm. Maggey never had any contact with the guy before that day. ...And all she did was take him his coffee on the day of the murder, pal. Phoenix: (Yeah, Maggey also claimed to have never seen the guy before...) Did the victim go to the restaurant often? Gumshoe: Not according to the chef. Said it was the first time he'd seen the guy. Phoenix: (A programmer... and a first-time customer at that...) (Changed from [A programmer... and a first-time customer...] in the original release) What possible reason could Maggey have had to kill a guy like that? Gumshoe: That's what I thought. But a motive was still somehow established in her trial. Phoenix: You're kidding! What was her supposed \"motive\"? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal. I'm real busy. I haven't even got enough time to sift through these papers. Look into it yourself, OK? Phoenix: (What could this motive have been...?) The investigation Gumshoe: This isn't really a proper investigation. I'm kind of working on it by myself. Phoenix: O-Oh, that's right... Gumshoe: The judge already ruled on the case, and all the evidence is in already. The only problem is with Maggey's testimony. Phoenix: Yeah... Doesn't sound very good for us, huh? Gumshoe: Look, pal. I've got a mountain of papers on this case to look over before tomorrow. So I'm just gonna say this... Maggey Byrde's no liar. She's... She's... OK, so she's a bit out there, and a bit off base sometimes. But she was a good cop. Phoenix: (That's not exactly complimentary, you know!) So what do you think really happened? And just how contradictory is her testimony? Contradictions (appears after \"The investigation\") Gumshoe: The biggest problem with Maggey's testimony is the number of people at the table. Phoenix: Yeah. My thoughts exactly. Maggey still insists there was another guy sitting with the victim. Gumshoe: Right. But get this... Everyone else in the place says the guy was alone. Even the chef. And then there's that CD... Phoenix: (CD? Oh, yeah. She did mention something about a CD...) Byrde: And there was a sample CD on the table, sir. Gumshoe: But our guys turned that place upside down. There was no CD. Phoenix: What? Gumshoe: Not on the table. Not anywhere in the whole restaurant, pal. Phoenix: But didn't Maggey say the victim was wearing an earpiece, too? Gumshoe: Yeah, but that was for the portable radio in the front pocket of his hoodie. Phoenix: A radio? He didn't have a CD player? Gumshoe: You got it. Your phony never explained that contradiction at all. Phoenix: (Come to think of it... The owner of Trés Bien didn't mention that CD either. I don't know why, but I get the feeling Mr. Armstrong's got something to hide...) The charming chef (appears after presenting Jean Armstrong profile) Phoenix: So what exactly is it that caught your attention about the chef at Trés Bien? Gumshoe: It's, um... kind of hard to say... The guy's probably not even connected with the case anyway... Phoenix: Hey, come on, Detective. Didn't you say you'd give me the dirt on anything? Gumshoe: Well, this sort of stuff is kinda... unimportant, gossipy stuff, you know pal? Look, how about this? You go to Trés Bien and investigate the place yourself. And if you find out anything suspicious about the guy... you report back to me, OK? Phoenix: Um... Don't suppose I get a choice in this, huh? (Guess I better find out more about the chef and Trés Bien; then report back to Gumshoe.) Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: Is that thing real, pal? Phoenix: Why does everybody keep asking me that? Gumshoe: I wonder what this phony of yours is like... Phoenix: He had Maggey found guilty of murder. Doesn't that tell you? (I've got to track this creep down!) Magazine Clipping Gumshoe: I wasn't at the trial myself. But I asked this one detective I know how your defense was. Phoenix: And what did he say? Gumshoe: He started off by saying, \"I'm at a complete loss for words...\" But he must have found some quick because he went on about how bad you were for an hour. Phoenix: But... Gumshoe: He said you sucked so much, it seemed like you were trying to get Maggey found guilty! Phoenix: (It looked like I was \"trying to get Maggey found guilty\"...?) Sports Paper Gumshoe: What's that? A sports paper? Phoenix: Yeah. I found it in the magazine rack at Trés Bien. Gumshoe: It's dated the same day as the murder. You may be onto something here. Phoenix: And take a look at this. See this writing here? Gumshoe: \"MC Bomber\"... Hey! Phoenix: What is it? Gumshoe: I've heard that name somewhere before. Yeah, \"MC Bomber\"... Phoenix: (Wow, he actually seems to be thinking for once!) Gumshoe: Ack, it's no good. I can't remember... Phoenix: (...And he goes back to being the Gumshoe we all know and love.) Gumshoe: Hey, pal. I'm gonna borrow this paper for a bit, OK? I wanna get a handwriting analysis done on this scribble. Phoenix: (Handwriting, huh? It'd be good to know more about that, in any case...) Gumshoe: Thanks, pal! I bet this'll turn out to be interesting clue! Sports Paper given to Detective Gumshoe. Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: Hey! So how come she's not with you today? Phoenix: She's working down at the restaurant right now. Gumshoe: Working, huh? Yeah, it's tough being broke. I would know. Phoenix: Um... OK...? Gumshoe: Next time I see her, I'll show her how to make the world's best instant noodles. We low earners have to stick together! It's the only way! Phoenix: (Um... Why is he shaking my hand with such enthusiasm...?) Mia Fey profile Gumshoe: She cross-examined me once, you know. Phoenix: What? Mia did? Gumshoe: Yeah. That was us. The big guns locking horns. Witness versus lawyer! It was a battle of cunning tactics and tricks. Phoenix: (But the witness isn't supposed to play any tricks...) Gumshoe: I can't believe she's gone... Godot profile Gumshoe: That's the guy who's gonna be the prosecutor in Maggey's retrial tomorrow. Phoenix: O-Oh, really? Gumshoe: He was working on a bunch of more important cases at the moment... ...but he canceled them all just so he could take you on, pal. Phoenix: (Why's that guy so determined to see me fail?) Gumshoe: You sure attract a lot of attention, huh? Too bad it's all the wrong kind. Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: I'm such a loser. I had high hopes for Maggey. I was gonna make her the best detective there ever was. But then all the sudden she was charged with murder and arrested. I never saw it coming. I never imagined they'd find her guilty. I hate myself for not being able to do anything. Phoenix: It's OK, Detective Gumshoe. We still have a chance to make this right. Gumshoe: ... You know what? You're not such a bad guy after all, pal. Maggey Byrde profile Phoenix: Have you gone to see Maggey? Gumshoe: Of course I have! But I... I wasn't much good at consoling her. I'm... I'm not very good with words. Phoenix: Oh... Gumshoe: Yeah. I guess I must've looked a bit down. Maggey was really supportive of me. It was great to have someone to talk to. Phoenix: (Did he go for her, or for himself...?) Jean Armstrong profile Gumshoe: The chef of Trés Bien, huh? You know what that chef said to me? \"Oh là là! Your body is full of la toxins.\" And then he gave me this bottle. Phoenix: What's in it? Gumshoe: I don't know. The label says, \"Juniper\". I'm under orders to put a few drops of it in my bath every day. Phoenix: Under orders? Old Man: Yeah. You know, there's something about the lady... I mean, guy. Phoenix: Huh!? You can't stop thinking about him!? Gumshoe: Not like that, pal! Gimme a break! He's not my type. I mean, I can't stop thinking that he's involved with this case somehow! Phoenix: (Sounds like he knows a little something more about our charming chef.) Anything else Phoenix: What do you make of this...? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal. All I can think about is Maggey at the moment. ... ...... N-No! I didn't mean it like that! I meant... Phoenix: (You don't have to explain... Really...) After clearing all Talk options and presenting Sports Paper in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept.: January 6Trés Bien Phoenix: The scent of flowers sure is strong. It's almost making me dizzy... Oh, um... Hello. (Who was that just now? A customer? She had sort of a dark aura about her...) ???: Ah! Welcome! Bee avenue! Phoenix: (Wow. What a cute voice.) Maya: Oh, it's just you, Nick. Phoenix: M-Maya! Maya: Well? How do I look? Phoenix: ... Maybe you should quit being a spirit medium... Maya: Maybe. But it's kind of boring being a waitress. I mean, you're my first ever customer. Phoenix: (Then who was that woman I just saw?) Maya: Oh, oh! Since you're here, you might as well have something to eat! Phoenix: ... I am kind of hungry, actually. Talk Waitress Phoenix: So, how do you like your new job, Maya? Maya: I never knew there was so much for a waitress to do! Take people's orders, bringing them their food, make coffee, work the cash register... Of course, we need a customer before I can do any of that. Phoenix: Yeah, it's a nice-looking restaurant. It's a shame more people don't come. Maya: Don't forget about the ultra cute waitress! Check out my \"gimme a tip\" smile! Lunch special Maya: Hey, Nick! Why don't you order something? The chef's preparing a tasty lunch set at the moment. Or so he says. Phoenix: How much is it? Maya: It's the Twin-T set. So it's 20 dollars, of course. Phoenix: The Twin-T set? I believe I'll be taking a pass. It's kind of expensive. Maya: What!? But you can't! Come on, Nick! It's not every day I get to be a waitress! I want to try carrying plates and working the cash register! Phoenix: How about cleaning the toilets? That should keep you busy. Maya: Yeah, right! Maybe later. Present Anything Phoenix: About this... Maya: Sorry, Nick! I'm a waitress now. I've got a pile of work waiting for little ol' me. After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: Um... About the lunch... Maya: Oh! A fine choice, sir. Phoenix: No. I, um... Maya: KITCHEN! A LUNCH SPECIAL, PLEASE! WITH ALL THE EXTRAS: DRINK, SIDE SALAD, DESSERT, AND GIFT! Phoenix: I don't need any of that! Maya: Just a moment, please, sir. Phoenix: (Maya's really getting into this! So how much is this set lunch, then? 20 dollars, huh? But with the drink, side salad, and dessert, it's... 45 dollars!?) Hey, wait a sec! Maya! Maya: Sorry to keep you waiting, sir! Here you are, our deluxe Fortify lunch set! Phoenix: Whoa! Maya: A dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Bon appétit! Phoenix: Um, thanks...? Maya: Come on, Nick! Hurry up and try it already! Phoenix: (Lobster, huh? Alright... Down the hatch it goes...) ... Urp! Maya: Well? Phoenix: Are you hungry, Maya? Maya: I'm starving! Phoenix: Here. It's yours. Maya: Really!? ... Urp! Phoenix: Remember, Maya. My wallet doesn't print money, so you'd better polish off that plate! Maya: ... I-I've just remembered! I've got to clean the toilets! Phoenix: Hey! (You can't be in that much of a hurry to clean the toilets!) Trés Bien Lunch Special added to the Court Record. Phoenix: How does that guy manage to make good food taste so bad? Maya: Hey, Nick... You want to take a peek at the kitchen? Phoenix: (The kitchen, huh? Not a bad idea.) Talk Kitchen Phoenix: Hmm, now what was it that Maggey said again? \"In the kitchen, you'll get to see all of the chef's greatest secrets!\" Maya: In the kitchen? Mmm. That sounds tasty! Phoenix: Hey, wait up! Maya! Maya: What is it? I'm pretty busy right now. Phoenix: Weren't you going to show me around? Maya: Tsk. There goes my plan to find some cool clue and show it off in your face... Phoenix: (I'd better conduct the search in the kitchen myself!) After clearing \"Kitchen\" Talk option in Trés Bien: January 6Trés BienKitchen Maya: And here it is! The famous Trés Bien kitchen! It's my first time in here too, actually. Phoenix: ... There is a weird atmosphere in here, that's for sure. Maya: Mr. Armstrong will be back soon, so we'd better search quickly! Chop, chop! Examine Mirror Maya: Now THIS is one large mirror! I bet this is where he makes himself look pretty. Phoenix: There's a book on the dresser. \"Claurice Armstrong's Bedtime Literature\". Maya: Not exactly Pulitzer Prize material, is it? Phoenix: It looks like a collection of poems he's written. Maya: Poems? Cool! Read one out! And say it in your best French accent... with intensity! OK? Phoenix: OK, um... Here's one. Ahem! It's called, \"Printemps\". \"Zee two of zem, like actors from a film. Zee coffee still undrunk. Sweet nothings over too soon, on zat sad Sunday morning. Zee foolish cocktail so delicious. Take zee last sip of your tea and I know what I will do. I must lie to you. I must.\" Maya: Huh? That's it!? Phoenix: Yup. That's a poem for you. Oil bottles Phoenix: What's this? It looks like a treasure chest or something. Maya: Wow! Look at all these little bottles! Phoenix: Oh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor... Maya: Let's see... 1, 2, 3... ...98, 99, 100! They're all the same, too. Hey, wait a minute... Phoenix: What is it? Maya: There's one bottle that's different from all the others. Phoenix: Well what do you know. And it doesn't have a label either. Maya: And... *sniff* It doesn't smell. Phoenix: (So what's that liquid inside then, I wonder?) Maya: Hey, Nick, we should borrow this. I mean, look how many bottles he's got. He won't miss one, will he? Small Bottle added to the Court Record. Oil bottles (subsequent times) Phoenix: What's this? It looks like a treasure chest or something. Maya: Wow! Look at all these little bottles! Phoenix: Oh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor... Maya: Let's see... 1, 2, 3... ...98, 99, 100! They're all the same, too. Lace curtains Phoenix: What are these lace curtains for? Maya: I don't know. But they give the place a real homey feel, don't they? Hmm... Lace curtains... You know, if I was a cooking pot, I'd be perfectly happy to sit on a shelf under those. Phoenix: (How do you respond to something like that!?) Table Maya: Now I know for sure I'm in a French restaurant. I've never heard of most of these seasonings. Hey, Nick! This container has... oyster sauce? What's that? Phoenix: (Isn't that used in Chinese food...?) Ack! Look! Right there on the counter! Maya: My Magatama! What's it doing there!? Phoenix: (What indeed...) Magatama put into pocket. Table (subsequent times) Maya: Now I know for sure I'm in a French restaurant. I've never heard of most of these seasonings. Hey, Nick! This container has... oyster sauce? What's that? Phoenix: (Isn't that used in Chinese food...?) Maya: And look at these knives. They look really sharp! Phoenix: I'd like to see how one of those slices through a cheesecake. Maya: A cheesecake? You don't exactly need a sharp knife for one of those, Nick. Stove Maya: Mmm. That smells good. Something's bubbling away nicely in that pot. It must be the lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Phoenix: Isn't that what I just ate for lunch? Maya: Maybe... What you ate is the only French dish I know the name of. After examining oil bottles in Trés Bien - Kitchen: January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Gumshoe: Hey, you're just in time! Phoenix: What is it, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: The lab got back to me about that newspaper you gave me. Phoenix: (He must mean this sports paper with the memo scribbled on it...) So? What did they say? Did the analysis turn up anything? Gumshoe: They said the doodle was written by the victim, Glen Elg. No doubt about it. Phoenix: (I expected as much...) Gumshoe: The victim took the paper with him to the restaurant on the day of the murder. That's our best interpretation of the facts at the moment. Sports Paper refiled into the Court Record. Gumshoe: \"MC Bomber\"... I get the feeling I've heard that name somewhere before... Oh, well. I guess it'll come back to me. Don't forget to report back to me with whatever you find in the restaurant, OK, pal? Phoenix: (Since when did I start taking orders from Gumshoe...? Although... I get the feeling there's something I need to show him...) Talk Armstrong's secret (appears after presenting Small Bottle) Phoenix: So what's Mr. Armstrong's secret? Gumshoe: You ever had lunch at Trés Bien, pal? Phoenix: Um... Yes... Gumshoe: So, how was it? Phoenix: To put it nicely... it was inedible. Gumshoe: Hey, don't worry about being nice around me, pal.

I guess it's probably the food. Gumshoe: The real scoop on the guy is he's up to his ears in debt. Phoenix: Really? How much does he owe? Gumshoe: This is a copy of his loan contract. He's about half a million in the red. Phoenix: H-Half a million? Are we talking dollars? Gumshoe: Yeah. Hey, if it was Sterling, he'd really be in trouble! Phoenix: Sorry.

You are quitting already? It will be a new record for z'e shortest period of employment ever! Glen Elg profile Armstrong: Ah, la dead man. 'E was la first in my restaurant. Maya: No way! You mean, the first customer you ever had!? Armstrong: Non, non, non. It was z'e first time I've 'ad a dead man in my restaurant. Such a s'ame to lose a customer after only 'is first meal 'ere! Victor Kudo profile Armstrong: Ah, z'is old man. 'E is a regular 'ere. My specialty of cappuccino and cold water is one of 'is favorites. Phoenix: Was he here at the time of the incident? Armstrong: Oui. 'E was 'ere. I am sure of it. When la incident 'appened, z'e old man was 'ere. Maya: ...? Armstrong: I did not take it! La ticket for 'alf a million, I mean. Maya: But you just told us you did! You said you took a ticket! Armstrong: Mais non, ma fille! It was not... ???: That's enough. Maya: Huh? AAAAAAAAAH! Mr. Godot! Phoenix: What in the heck are you doing here!? Godot: Urgh! This is without doubt... the worst coffee I have ever tasted, Mr. Armstrong. Phoenix: (He came in here for coffee!? Does his craving for coffee know no bounds!?) Godot: Perhaps Mr. Armstrong stole one of the victim's tickets on the day in question. Armstrong: I am la air'ead, non? Just a pretty little girl who everyone is laughing at. Maya: But, in that case, Maggey shouldn't be the only one under suspicion... Godot: He had the wrong ticket. Phoenix: ...What? Godot: Mr. Armstrong made off with the winning ticket's pretty neighbor. Maya: So... the ticket he took was worthless? Godot: Not quite. He did win something. A dollar. Armstrong: You see! I am just a pretty face! W'izout my looks, I 'ave nothing! Phoenix: So... What happened to the winning ticket, then? The one he meant to steal. Godot: Indeed. What did happen to it? I don't like spoiling myself by watching trailers, so... ...we'll just wait and see how the movie turns out tomorrow, won't we? Maya: Nngh... Armstrong: Voilà! You two! Time to laugh at la pretty little air'ead! Phoenix: (Looks like I won't be needing this note anymore.) Victor's Note thrown into the trash. Phoenix: Looks like we've got a new mystery now. Namely, where did the winning ticket go? Maya: I've got a bad feeling about this. Phoenix: Well, anyway. We can't let Maggey suffer any longer for this. And certainly not again. To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Phoenix: (Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!)\n-- The Investigation --Gumshoe: The crime was reported at 2:25 PM by a kind of scary old man, sir.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"Scary old man\", Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: There's an old man who's a regular at the restaurant where the incident happened. Phoenix: (Ah, we're obviously talking about the same old man...) Gumshoe: Officers were dispatched right after the report came in, but the old guy still made a fuss. \"What took you so long!?\" Then he hurled abuse at them. And seeds... Judge: Hmm... Seeds... Godot: Ha...! It was nothing! I caught each one with my teeth. Phoenix: (I guess not even the mighty Godot can avoid being attacked by that guy...) Godot: The old man was only other customer in the place at the time. He took his time finding a pay phone apparently, so he was late reporting the crime.Gumshoe: Poor Maggey had passed out from the shock. It must've been real tough for her.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: How long was the defendant unconscious for? Gumshoe: The officers got to the crime scene at around 2:40. Maggey was still out cold in the kitchen at that time. It took another 10 minutes or so before she came to. I woulda liked to have been on the scene myself. Phoenix: (I bet you would've liked to have carried out the search, too...) Gumshoe: I woulda loved to see Maggey asleep like that, all pretty and peaceful. Phoenix: (You're a professional detective, Gumshoe. Not a professional bird watcher!) Godot: Save the romantics for your own time, Detective. All we need to know about is the investigation. Gumshoe: Oops! I guess I'm pretty red right now, aren't I?Gumshoe: The victim didn't have any identification on him.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He didn't have any? Are you saying that it was stolen, then? Gumshoe: No, I don't think so. The victim didn't have a driver's license or even a credit card on him, pal. All he had was 58 cents in his wallet. Phoenix: Fifty-eight cents...? Gumshoe: Yeah. I can't believe I found someone with less in their wallet than me, pal! Judge: The victim sounds like he was a thoroughly miserable young man. Godot: Or some kind of outlaw... Why not give him a bit of an edge? Phoenix: (I think I'm on to something here...)Gumshoe: But we figured out who he was pretty quick, and then the investigation went smoothly.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait a sec! Gumshoe: Huh? D-Did I say something dumb again!? Phoenix: Let me paraphrase what you just testified to this court. \"The victim didn't have any form of ID on him.\" That's basically what you said, yes? Gumshoe: Yeah, basically. Phoenix: In that case, how were you able to identify the victim so quickly? Gumshoe: ... Oh... That. Phoenix: (He's so let down, he's got the whole sagging shoulders and puppy eyes thing going...) Gumshoe: There was a prescription bag on the victim's table along with the lottery ticket. Godot: It seems Mr. Glen Elg visited his doctor before he went to Trés Bien. Gumshoe: We got the victim's name from the medical records of the doc who prescribed the meds. Judge: Hmm... That's a reliable enough source for the court. Phoenix: (What should I do? Should I leave this alone or ask to hear more?) Leave it Phoenix: (I guess it doesn't really matter how they figured out who the victim was. There are more important avenues to explore.) Leads back to cross-examination Ask about the prescription bag Phoenix: So what sort of medicine was in the bag? Gumshoe: Well... Actually, the bag we found was empty. Phoenix: Huh? Gumshoe: Yeah. Completely empty. Phoenix: (It was completely empty...?) Victim's Prescription Bag added to the Court Record. Godot: Ha...! You're entering an empty paper bag as evidence? Desperate, are you, Trite? Phoenix: ...! Godot: Now, what happened with the investigation after that, Detective? Leads back to cross-examination Ask about his health insurance Phoenix: So, the victim had no form of identification on him, correct? Gumshoe: Yeah. Phoenix: And yet, before arriving at the restaurant, he went to see a doctor. Which means... He must've had his medical insurance card with him! Judge: Oh! That is very true! Phoenix: The fact that it hasn't been found points to only one obvious conclusion. The victim's medical card was stolen! Godot: Ha...! True, the victim didn't have a medical insurance card. But why? Because Mr. Glen Elg didn't have medical insurance to begin with! Phoenix: Huh? Judge: Hmm... As I thought, a thoroughly miserable young man. Godot: Or some kind of outlaw... A bit of an edge never hurt anyone. Maya: Looks like we're off course again, Nick. Judge: Witness. Please continue with your testimony. Explain for the court the events following the preliminary investigation. Leads back to cross-examinationPress (after Victim's Prescription Bag is added to the Court Record) Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait a sec! Gumshoe: Huh? D-Did I say something dumb again!? Phoenix: Let me paraphrase what you just testified to this court. \"The victim didn't have any form of ID on him.\" That's basically what you said, yes? Gumshoe: Yeah, basically. Phoenix: In that case, how were you able to identify the victim so quickly? Gumshoe: ... Oh... That. Phoenix: (He's so let down, he's got the whole sagging shoulders and puppy eyes thing going...) Gumshoe: There was a prescription bag on the victim's table along with the lottery ticket. Godot: It seems Mr. Glen Elg visited his doctor before he went to Trés Bien. Gumshoe: We got the victim's name from the medical records of the doc who prescribed the meds. Judge: Hmm... That's a reliable enough source for the court.Gumshoe: When Maggey was searched, we found the lottery ticket and the bottle of poison.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: But the defendant had been passed out for a while, correct? In that case... Isn't it possible someone planted the evidence in Maggey's pocket!? Gumshoe: Hey! Y-Yeah! You've nailed it, pal! Judge: Hmm... Gumshoe: It happens to me all the time! We had a department party the other day, and when I got home... ...I was wearing the boss's shoes! Godot: Godot: Keep up this crazy testimony, Detective, and those shoes will end up down your throat! Gumshoe: Sorry... Godot: So, Trite. \"Someone planted the evidence in Maggey's pocket\"...? That's a pretty bold statement. Care to back it up with some evidence? Phoenix: Um... Well... (I'd love to, if I had any...) Judge: It appears you have no evidence to support your theory, Mr. Wright. Continue with your testimony, witness.Gumshoe: And that was it. There was nothing else missing from the crime scene.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So the half a million dollar lottery ticket and the bottle of poison were accounted for. Gumshoe: Yeah. Phoenix: Interesting... It's true that those two items are accounted for... ..but wasn't there another lottery ticket that was stolen that day? Gumshoe: Oh, yeah. The one the restaurant owner took. He won a whole dollar with it. What a lucky guy, huh? Phoenix: (And they're just going to let him get away with it...?) Judge: It was just one dollar, Detective. Maya: I guess no one cares when it's that little... Unless it's Gumshoe.Present Victim's Prescription Bag Phoenix: Leads to: \"Detective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you.\"Phoenix: If I don't find a hole in this testimony, the judge is going to hand down his verdict!Maya: Gumshoe isn't giving us anything to work with... And we can't find any contradictions if he doesn't give us something!Phoenix: Yeah, that's true... But Maggey and Gumshoe are like dumb and dumber. Our only hope is that they were so dumb, they missed something obvious.Maya: Come on, Gumshoe! Be the dumbest you've ever been!Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe. I think I should point something out to you. There is just one small contradiction in your testimony.Gumshoe: Oho! Finally! I'm getting all anxious just waiting, so hurry up, will you?Phoenix: You testified that, \"nothing else was missing from the crime scene.\" However! The prescription bag you mentioned was empty! Did the officers recover the medicine from the scene of the crime later?Gumshoe: Um, no. They didn't.Phoenix: The victim was given a prescription right before going to Trés Bien. Where, then, did the medicine disappear to!?Gumshoe: Y-You... ...are toooooo coool, pal!!Judge: I-Indeed! Due consideration wasn't given to the victim's prescription in the previous trial. Witness! Why do you always overlook such vital pieces of evidence!?Gumshoe: I, er... I guess that's the most careless thing I've done so far, huh?Phoenix: The victim was killed by poison! And the victim's \"medicine\" mysteriously disappeared! The victim's own prescription could have been the lethal poison itself!Judge: O-Order! Order! Well, Mr. Godot? What do you have to say to that?Godot: Ha...! That's all.Phoenix: What!?Godot: Read for the court the name of the clinic on the prescription bag, if you will.Phoenix: What's the clinic's name got to do with anything...? \"New Ear Otolaryngological Clinic\" O-Otolaryngological?Judge: Just what kind of illness was the victim suffering from, Mr. Godot?Godot: Hardly an illness, Your Honor. More like a bitter war wound, you could say.Judge: A war wound?Godot: The day before the incident, Mr. Elg found himself in a fight. He took a blow to the side of the head, and ruptured his eardrum.Phoenix: He ruptured his eardrum!?Judge: Then what on earth was the prescription he was given?Godot: It was a cream that was to be applied topically inside his ear canal, not to be ingested!Phoenix: What!?Godot: It's mentioned in the autopsy report, if you read the fine print. They found traces of the medication in the victim's left ear.Judge: Yes. Here it is. In very, very fine print.Godot: It seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Trés Bien. Therefore, it would be absurd to believe that he would have eaten his medication.Phoenix: Uuurgh...Judge: It seems that this medication is irrelevant to the case after all.Phoenix: N-No...Maya: Nick! If you don't think of something quick, it'll all be over!Phoenix: (She's right. But I can't get away with any old weak objection. What should I do...?)Push the medication issue Leads to: \"Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement.\"Leave it Phoenix: It does seem as it the medication isn't connected to the case. Godot: Ha...! Maybe the last Mr. Trite was the real one. At least he didn't waste time. Judge: Indeed... If you have nothing further to add to this medication issue... ...the facts of this case seem no different to those presented on the last trial. I would therefore have no choice but to hand down my verdict. Phoenix: Uh... Umm...! Maya: Nick! Don't let him to do this! You've got to stand your ground! Judge: Now then... Phoenix: Phoenix: Wait, Your Honor! Actually, this prescription... is absolutely pivotal to the case! Judge: Mr. Wright! Did you not just say the exact opposite only moments ago!? Phoenix: (Gotta lose a few battles in order to win the war, I suppose.) Leads to: \"Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement.\"Phoenix: Only moments ago, Mr. Godot made the following statement. \"It seems Mr. Elg correctly applied some of his medication while he was at Trés Bien.\" If that's the case, then why was the medication not found at the scene of the crime!?Godot: ...!Judge: But the medication in question was for topical use inside the ear canal!Phoenix:Phoenix: That doesn't change the fact that it could not be found at the crime scene! However insignificant it may seem, it's a lawyer's duty to pursue the truth!Godot:Godot: You know as well as I do that the medication is irrelevant. It hardly seems likely that a prescription drug would contain potassium cyanide.Phoenix:Phoenix: It hardly seems likely that the coffee the waitress served would contain it, either! But it did! The possibility is undeniable!Godot: Aaargh!Judge: That's enough. Mr. Godot. Is the detective the only witness the prosecution wishes to call?Godot: ...Judge: Mr. Godot...?Godot: ...Gumshoe: Um... I, ah... I've got my own witness I'd like to call, sir. It's the old man who was there in the restaurant on the day of the murder.Phoenix: (Victor Kudo? The pigeon-hater?)Judge: Very well. The matter of the disappearing medication seems little more than trivial at best. However! It wasn't explored at all in the previous trial. And that is something that bothers me.Maya: Yay! Good job, Nick!Judge: The court will adjourn for a 10 minute recess. After which we will hear the prosecution's next witness.Godot: Ha...! I suppose this means I'll just have to finish you off in my last 6 cups.Judge: Court is adjourned for recess!January 7, 11:03 AMDistrict CourtDefendant Lobby No. 1Maya: Phew! That was close!Phoenix: Tell me about it... I nearly died in there!Byrde: That's my line, sir!Maya: No! It's my line! I think I really did die a little bit.Byrde: Looks like we all nearly died in there... I can't believe Detective Gumshoe! How could he betray us like that!?Maya: Huh?Byrde: He said he'd help me. But he totally set me up!Phoenix: I don't think he meant to do that, Maggey. He was backed into a corner. I mean, the guy's got to do his job, right?Byrde: It's OK. I know all about lies and betrayal. I've had them my whole life. But it really hurt this time. It felt like someone punched me hard in the stomach! I hate that guy! I don't ever want to see him again!Phoenix: (Poor Gumshoe...)Maya: So the next witness is going to be that old guy from the park, right?Phoenix: Yeah. Mr. Kudo. Lover of waitress outfits and projectile seeds!Byrde: I bet he's gonna be really stubborn. I mean, he's pretty set in his ways, you know?Maya: Yeah, he's a big old grouch. Are you going to be able to handle him, Nick?Phoenix: Yeah, I can take whatever he throws at me. Even those never-ending bird seeds!January 7, 11:15 AMDistrict CourtCourtroom No. 4Judge: Court will now reconvene for the trial of Maggey Byrde. Mr. Godot. Your next witness, please.Godot: The prosecution calls the lucky old-timer who caught the show over a cup of coffee. Will the witness please take the stand.Godot: Name and occupation, if you don't mind.Kudo: The name is Victor Kudo. Born and bred in the Land of the Rising Sun! Honor and duty are what make me. Mind you, I can be quite emotional at times, too.Phoenix: We don't need to hear about that, Mr. Kudo. Just tell the court your occupation.Kudo: My occupation? Kah! Listen, young'un! How much call d'you think there is for kimono embroidery here!?Phoenix: Kimono embroidery?Kudo: That's what I do! Or did, back in Japan. I embroidered family crests on kimonos! My ancestors were embroidering kimonos before this country even existed!Maya: Wow, a real craftsman! They're a dying breed! Hey! Maybe he could embroider my costume sometime.Kudo: Anyway, like I said. There's not much demand for that kind of thing here. So I had to take a job working the cash register at a burger joint... pretending to smile!Phoenix: (That burger joint would've been better off putting him in the kitchen...)Judge: Now then, witness. Were you in the restaurant at the time of the incident?Kudo: Oh, yes! I was eating some seeds over a cup of javaccino.Judge: Seeds?Kudo: What do you think these are, hmm!?Judge: I-I see...Godot: So you saw everything that happened, gramps?Kudo: Did I!? Oh, yes! Oh, yes I did! I saw it all!Godot: Then please, tell the court. We're all ears.Kudo: Sure, sure. I'll tell you. I'll tell you every last detail!Phoenix: (He's really getting into this...)Witness Testimony-- What I Witnessed --Kudo: The young man was reading the sports paper. The serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it! The man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed. That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!Judge: Mr. Kudo. she is not a \"serving girl\". Please refer to her as a waitress.Kudo: Kah! You're as bad as the rest of them! All these newfangled words! What's wrong with old-fashioned ones, hmm!?Judge: N-Newfangled?Kudo: All this talk of \"radios\" and \"glasses\"! It's \"wireless\" and \"spectacles\", I tell you!Judge: E-Excuse me...Kudo: Listen to me, everyone! Don't forget the old values! Don't let the good old days slip away!Judge: Well, um... I think it's time to begin the cross-examination, Mr. Wright.Phoenix: Y-Yes, Your Honor.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- What I Witnessed --Kudo: The young man was reading the sports paper.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So you saw the victim, then? You saw Mr. Glen Elg? Kudo: I wanted to know if Gusten Brawn retained his championship or not. Phoenix: (So he was looking at the sports paper the victim was reading, huh...) And at the location in question... ...there are partitions between tables on the same side of the restaurant, right? Kudo: So what if there are? Phoenix: If you say that you could see the victim... ...that means you were sitting at a table on the other side of the restaurant, correct? Kudo: Kah! I go to that place to drink javaccino! I don't go to sit! I don't remember what table I was sitting at! Phoenix: (You mean you go there to eye the waitress!)Kudo: The serving girl brought him a javaccino... But she put something in it!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. That is a very grave accusation. Are you sure about what you saw? Kudo: Victor Kudo never makes mistakes! I dot every t and cross every i! Phoenix: I see... Kudo: My eyesight's fine. The doctor said I only need spectacles for reading and driving. Phoenix: (...I bet his eyes are only really \"fine\" when he's scoping out a waitress.) Kudo: And I saw what the serving girl put into the javaccino as well! Phoenix: (I bet I know what's coming up and something tells me I'm not going to like it...) Leave it Phoenix: (It'd be dangerous to press this too much. I'd better ignore it for now.) So, what happened next? Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Your Honor. We need more clarification on what was put into the victim's coffee. I'd like to ask that the witness add what he knows about this to his testimony. Judge: Hmm... I agree. Witness, will you enlighten us, please? Kudo: Sure, sure. Adds statement \"There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.\"Press (after adding statement \"There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.\") Phoenix: Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. That is a very grave accusation. Are you sure about what you saw? Kudo: Victor Kudo never makes mistakes!

Phoenix: (...I bet his eyes are only really \"fine\" when he's scoping out a waitress.) Kudo: And I saw what the serving girl put into the javaccino as well!Kudo: There's no question about it! She very conspicuously put some white powder in there.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: D-Did she really put that into the coffee? Kudo: You doubt me, boy!? She too some out of a small, brown bottle and sprinkled it in. Phoenix: Couldn't she have been adding sugar? Kudo: Sugar!? In a small, brown bottle like that!? Judge: \"Like that\"? Witness, could you please describe the bottle in more concrete terms? Godot: Ha...! A bottle like this, perhaps? Kudo: Oh, there it is! That's the one! Judge: That's the bottle of potassium cyanide, I presume? Godot: So what did the accused put into the coffee? I think it's clear, don't you? Phoenix: Argh...Kudo: The man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He took just one sip? Kudo: You young'uns! You waste everything! Those javaccinos cost 8 dollars! In the good old days, we would have drank every last drop, eaten the cup, and then died! Phoenix: (Congratulations. You have earned the title of Battiest Man To Grace A Courtroom.) Godot: So it was an immediate death? Well, with potassium cyanide, I suppose that is possible. Kudo: Oh, yes. He slumped over without so much as a twitch! I felt the javaccino I'd just drank turn sour in my stomach. Godot: Oh, yes. I know that feeling. Judge: And the waitress? I presume she is...?Kudo: That's the serving girl, right there in the defendant's chair. I remember her well!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You said, \"I remember her well\" in reference to the waitress... Did she have any particular features that you can identify her by? Kudo: Particular features!? It's a disgrace, that's what it is! Phoenix: Sorry? Kudo: You can see all the way up to her... her... You know! She's practically naked in that uniform! Phoenix: Phoenix: So the particular feature you recognize about the waitress is... her outfit!? But anyone could wear just such an [sic] uniform! Even me! Judge: Mr. Wright! Please spare the court of any further mental anguish from that image. Maya: Don't get all excited, Nick! You've gotta keep yourself together! Phoenix: (I-I guess I got a bit carried away...) Kudo: Kah! There are other things I recognize about her, too. Phoenix: (He seems pretty sure of himself. What should I do?) Leave it Phoenix: (There's got to be a better line of attack than this. That's what I should be looking for now...) Leads back to cross-examination Press harder Phoenix: Sure, you saw a waitress take the coffee over to the victim. But what matters is whether that waitress was Maggey Byrde or not. Judge: Quite right. Mr. Kudo. These other \"features\" that you recognize about the defendant... I would ask you to add them to your testimony. Kudo: Sure, sure. Adds statement \"There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\"Press (after adding statement \"There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.\") Phoenix: Phoenix: You said, \"I remember her well\" in reference to the waitress...

There are other things I recognize about her, too.Kudo: There was a ribbon in her hair, and her apron's straps were loose.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You do seem to remember several details about her appearance. But what about the most crucial detail of all... her face? Kudo: Kah! As if I wouldn't remember that! Godot: Godot: The witness noticed the straps on the accused's apron. He'd unlikely to make a mistake about her face. Kudo: That's right! I can even tell you the color of the ribbon in her hair. It was red! Godot: So you see, there's nothing wrong with the witness's eyesight. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: (There's no doubt he remembers the waitress pretty well. What should I do? I get the feeling there's something more to this somehow...) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I must be imagining it. I need to find another angle with this guy.) Leads back to cross-examination Ask about the straps Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. You seem especially interested in straps. Why is that? Kudo: Wh-What? Phoenix: The ribbon in her hair, the straps on her apron. What's the fascination? Kudo: F-Fascination? Godot: Godot: People have all kinds of fetishes, Trite. We don't need to embarrass the witness. Kudo: Listen, you young upstarts! I haven't got some sick strap fetish! Judge: Hmm... Is there any relevance to the witness's unusual love of straps, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: I was just curious as to why he was so fixated on the waitress's straps... Kudo: I said I haven't got a strap fetish! How many times do I have to repeat myself!? Judge: Very well. Continue with your testimony, Mr. Kudo. And make it strapless. Kudo: *grumble grumble* Leads back to cross-examination Ask about the waitress's back Phoenix: The identifying \"features\" you described are all things you would see from the back. Kudo: So what? Phoenix: Is it possible that... ...you never saw the waitress from the front at all!? Godot: Godot: Ha...! He's got you there, gramps! Phoenix: People normally talk about facial features when they're asked to describe someone. But this witness's testimony is nothing but straps and ribbons! Kudo: Th-This is harassment! I tell you I'm not obsessed with straps or ribbons! I'm just telling you what I saw! Judge: Mr. Kudo, the court requests that you add details about any identifying features... Features you observed from the front, that is, to your testimony. Kudo: Sure, sure. Maya: The old man's testimony is getting longer and longer! Phoenix: And if I can't find a hole in it soon, it'll get even longer, I bet. Adds statement \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\"Press (after adding statement \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\") Phoenix: Phoenix: You do seem to remember several details about her appearance.

Kudo: No question about it! I didn't come this far to back down now! Victor Kudo never backs down! Phoenix: (That's not the answer I was looking for, but OK...) Maya: This has turned into a matter of pride for Old Seedy now, I guess... I wonder if he really did see Maggey's face or not... Phoenix: (Like I thought, we need some concrete proof of this. Proof that the old guy didn't see the waitress clearly from the front.)Present Apron Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. I would like you to please take a look at this.\"Maya: Do you think Old Seedy really saw Maggey do it?Phoenix: Well, he probably had his eye on the waitress the whole time. That's why he was there.Maya: But he was there for the cute outfits, right? Not the waitress...Phoenix: I-I guess... (Hmm, she makes a good point though...)Maya: Hey! Did I just say something clever?Phoenix: I wonder if the waitress Mr. Kudo saw really was Maggey...Maya: That's what we have to figure out, Nick!\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Maya Fey\nDescription: My assistant and a disciple in the Kurain Tradition of spirit channeling.\nCharacter 1\nName: Mia Fey\nDescription: Maya's older sister and my eternal mentor in life and law.

Maggey's apron has small pockets but big stains, which would certainly catch the eye of someone observant, especially given Kudo's claim that he was paying close attention to the waitress's features and uniform. The conspicuous stains should have caught his interest if he truly saw the waitress from the front, casting doubt on his testimony.\n",

This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. I-It wasn't me! I swear it wasn't me! Judge: The evidence and testimony we have seen and heard are conclusive! The victim was alone at his table when he drank from that poisoned cup of coffee. No! You're wrong! I know what I saw...! I saw... I saw...! I saw someone else there! A man. He's the real killer! Why won't anyone believe me? Payne: Well... I'd say that pretty much wraps this case up, wouldn't you... ...Mr. Wright!? Judge: This court finds the defendant... Guilty Judge: The court is adjourned. January 6, 10:03 AMWright & Co. Law Offices Maya: Ahh! The start of the new year always makes me feel like I can take on the whole world! Phoenix: I bet it does, Maya. Maya: So! I've decided that our resolution should be... Zvarri! \"Take on the world!\" What do you think? Phoenix: Sure, whatever, Maya... But I think maybe you've had more than enough mistletoe cake. Maya: Never! You've got to eat a lot of cake during New Year's! It's practically a tradition! Like watching the fireworks on TV or playing a board game. ???: HEY, PAL! Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe... Maya: Happy New Year, Detective! Gumshoe: Uh... likewise... NOW LISTEN UP, WRIGHT! I WANNA... Maya: Here's to another fruitful year of lawyer-police cooperation! Gumshoe: Um... Yeah... Me too... ALRIGHT, PAL! YOU'VE GOT SOME EXPLAINING TO... Maya: Have you got a holiday present for me, Detective? Gumshoe: A what? Well... I, um... Here, have this. It-It's really nothing much, but... Maya: Yay! Thanks! Gumshoe: LOOK, PAL, WE NEED TO HAVE A TALK. TAKE A SEAT! Maya: Hey! What about Pearly? You haven't forgotten her present, have you? Gumshoe: Ah... N-No... I mean, yes... I mean, no... Are you doing this on purpose? Maya: Ha ha, guess I'm busted. How did you like my first practical joke of the year? Gumshoe: Very funny, pal. Now let's see how funny you think it is when I show you this! Phoenix: What is it? A magazine? Maya: Hey, I wanna see! \"Deadly Poisoning Brings Guilty Verdict. Defense Attorney Wright Trounced.\" Phoenix: Tr-Trounced!? Let me see that! \"The defense attorney gave an almost childishly amateur performance yesterday...\" What the heck is this!? Gumshoe: It's a report, pal. About you! Maya: Listen to this! \"Mr. Wright must take full responsibility for the ruling in this case.\" Gumshoe: WELL!? And don't tell me you don't remember anything about it! Phoenix: But I don't remember anything about it! When was that issue from anyway? Gumshoe: Umm... December of last year, which I guess makes it last month. Maya: Which makes it old news, you mean. Phoenix: But I wasn't involved in a poisoning case in December! Maya: Hmm, so what do you think this is all about, Nick? Gumshoe: If it wasn't you, pal, then that leaves only one possibility... Maya: No way. You don't mean... Phoenix: A pho... Maya: A phony Nick!? Phoenix: (This must be Gumshoe's idea of a joke. Guess he's starting off the year with one, too...) Magazine Clipping added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: SO!? What are you gonna do about it, pal!? Phoenix: What do you mean, what am I going to do about it? Maya: Well, it's your fault that the judge found the defendant guilty in this case! Phoenix: My fault!? How do you figure that? Maya: Because THE Phoenix Wright is super famous now! Well, maybe only sort of... Gumshoe: Yeah. See what happens when you hotshots start getting too full of yourselves? Phoenix: (But I didn't do anything wrong! ...At least, not that I can remember...) Gumshoe: You better make this right, pal. Now! And that means taking the case back to court. Got it? Maya: Sounds like we've got our first case of the new year! Let's tackle it with gusto! Phoenix: I don't know... The judge already issued a guilty verdict once in this case. It's not going to be easy to get it overturned. Maya: ... I guess that New Year's resolution is going to have to wait until next year. Gumshoe: So you're taking the case, right!? Good! I'm gonna head over to the courthouse then. After that, I'll go back to the precinct. Drop by if you need something, OK pal!? Phoenix: (I guess people are starting to know the name \"Phoenix Wright\". If a client entrusted a case to me based on my reputation... I guess I am kind of responsible. But why would someone want to impersonate me? What sort of a guy would do that?) Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. ...Actually, I've neglected them for so long that they're covered in a layer of dust. I guess I should at least pretend to read them once in a while. Charley the plant Phoenix: Charley. A quite decorative plant. He's sort of a keepsake... something to remember Mia by. Sure, the office is a mess, but I never forget to water this little fella. Desk Phoenix: It's my desk. I don't get to use it much, so it's still super neat and tidy from when Pearls cleaned it. Movie poster Phoenix: An old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it, a long time ago. Maya watched it recently, and said she cried all night, too! ...Which, I guess, is why it's back up on the wall. I have to check it out one of these days. Window Phoenix: There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. The chain is getting so rich that they bought a whole chunk of the next town over... ...and started building a huge theme park. It's going to be called \"Gatewater Land\". ...I wonder if that bellboy is going to send me a greeting card this year, too? Talk What to do Maya: So, what's our first move? Phoenix: I guess we go down to the detention center and talk-- Maya: Wait a sec, Nick. This person's behind bars because of you. Whoever it is isn't going to be jumping at the chance to meet you, right? Phoenix: Hey, hey! Let's get one thing straight. It wasn't me, it was a fake me that did this! Maya: Hmm, I wonder if he looks exactly like you... Your phony, Xin Eohp, I mean. Phoenix: (I hope not. *shudder* ...And what kind of name for an evil double is Xin Eohp anyway!?) Maya: Ah! Nick! I've got it! Phoenix: If you're going to ask whether I've got a twin brother, the answer is no. Maya: ...Spoilsport. Any ideas Maya: Did you notice Gumshoe was acting weirder than usual, or was it just me? Phoenix: What do you mean? Maya: I mean, he was really worked up. Like a guy who's just found out he's going to be a dad or something. Phoenix: Yeah, I guess he was acting kind of strange. Maya: Maybe he realized he's got strong feelings for you, Nick! Phoenix: ... Considering how we interact, I seriously doubt that, Maya... Maya: Well, if he wasn't nervous because of you... Phoenix: ...then maybe it's because of our new guilty client? Present Attorney's Badge Maya: So you've still got that badge, I see. Phoenix: Huh!? Well, I'm a lawyer, aren't I? Maya: Yeah, but I guess I just didn't think you'd keep on being one for this long. You have to admit, you've had some close brushes with death because of your job. Phoenix: (...I fail to see how being a lawyer is more dangerous than channeling dead people.) Magazine Clipping Maya: I can't believe you've got an impersonator. Phoenix: I can't either. *sigh* Maya: Aww, but look on the bright side. Only famous stars have people impersonating them! Phoenix: This isn't funny, Maya. It's not just an impersonation. This guy stole my identity! And someone may have been wrongly convicted as a result. Maya: ...Guess you should've gone into showbiz, huh, Nick? Phoenix: (...*sigh* I will never understand how your mind works, Maya.) Maya Fey profile Phoenix: So? How's your spirit medium training going? Maya: Well... I stand under the rushing waters of the shower head every day. Phoenix: ...That's called \"taking a shower\". What happened to the rushing waters of a waterfall? Maya: Well, I'm kind of taking a break... I'm having a bit of trouble right now, you know? Phoenix: (Last year's incident must still be on her mind... I haven't seen Maya train at all since that time. I think Mia said it's because Maya's at a loss these days...) Mia Fey profile Phoenix: Mia helped me out in court again last time. Maya: It's so cool that you get to meet my sis like that. Phoenix: Yeah... Maya: We mediums lose consciousness when we're channeling, so I don't get to see my sis... Phoenix: ...I never really thought about it that way. Hey! If you want to meet Mia... ...why don't we just have Pearls call her? Maya: No... I couldn't do that. I'd be too worried about her. Phoenix: (I guess Maya's got all sorts of things to think about, too. ...Despite her immaturity saying otherwise.) Godot profile Maya: So you still can't remember anything about Godot, huh? Phoenix: I already told you. I have no idea who he is, let alone why he dislikes me so much. Maya: Well he sure seems to have a problem with you for some reason. You'd better watch your back, Nick. Coffee lovers can be quite bitter. Phoenix: You're just making that up, Maya! Dick Gumshoe profile Maya: Digging up an old case that's already been ruled on... That's not like Gumshoe, is it? Phoenix: No. He barely manages to stay on top of the cases in front of him. Maya: Yeah, he's always busy, and gets dirt pay. I mean, look at that dusty old coat he wears! Phoenix: (Did you mean he \"gets paid dirt\" or do you really think they pay him in gravel?) Any other evidence Phoenix: Do you know anything about this, Maya? Maya: Hmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everything, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this object. Phoenix: (A simple yes or no, Maya... It's not as if you had to give me a dissertation...) Any other profile Phoenix: Do you know anything about this person? Maya: Hmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everyone, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this individual. Phoenix: (A simple yes or no, Maya... It's not as if you had to give me a dissertation...) January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Maya: It's been ages since we came down to the precinct, huh, Nick? Phoenix: Looks like Gumshoe isn't around. Maya: He's got it so easy, leaving everyone else to do the work! Phoenix: No, he's been out there somewhere. My bet is on the courthouse. He's probably trying to arrange the retrial of this case. Maya: Guess that means we should go to the detention center and chat with our killer, huh? Phoenix: After being convicted without a fair trial, I'm not sure killer is the right label... Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Don't die running a red light. Die the old-fashioned way -- of old age!\" We have a winner! Inject a bit of humor, that's the key. Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a safety campaign. ...I guess? Desks Phoenix: These are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I expected. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks. Poster Phoenix: A poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest \"Babes in Uniform\" calendar. My bad. Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: WHAT! Mask☆DeMasque turned up at the bank? What's he doing!? \"Hands up, you scalawags!\" \"You're under arrest!\" Hey! That's our job! Phoenix: (Looks like Ron DeLite's opted for a new career.) Detective: Quit surfing the net, Chief! Chief: S-Sorry... I was just, um... Phoenix: (Things feel pretty tense in here...) Badgers Maya: Hey, that's the police mascot, isn't it? It's so cute! Chief: That's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police force! Phoenix: So what's with the pink one? It's new, right? Maya: She's not an \"it\", Nick. She's a \"she\", right Chief? Chief: Yup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\". Maya: So one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"? Chief: You got it! They're both married. Maya: Umm... Mr. & Mrs. Badger seem to be cuffed together, Chief. Chief: You got it! That's marriage for you! Phoenix: (Whoa... A mascot that's deeper than the deepest of deep oceans...) January 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room Maya: This is so nerve-wracking, waiting to meet our new client. I wonder just what kind of person you tricked and got found guilty...? Phoenix: K-Keep it down, Maya! That kind of talk could ruin me! ???: Aaaaaaaah! How could you, Mr. Wright!? How could you do this to me!? They put me in solitary! I haven't been able to stop crying. Phoenix: A-Aren't... you... ???: Yes, I am! I am totally and utterly let down! Maya: Aah! You're... Are you...? ??? Don't pretend you don't know me! It's me, Maggey, remember!? Maggey Byrde! Phoenix: Maggey Byrde... Ah! (Maggey Byrde... She's the policewoman I defended that one time. She was accused of murdering her lover. He was a cop, too.) What are you doing in here!? Didn't I get you acquitt-- Byrde: Oh, sure! Very funny! After that fifth-rate defense job, you come in here and start making jokes!? Maya: You better hurry up and tell her what happened, Nick. Byrde: O-Oh... I see... Phoenix: So that's where we stand right now. Maya: I'm sorry you've been caught up in another murder... Byrde: My whole life has been nothing but a whirlwind of bad luck and failures. Phoenix: (I vaguely remember her saying the exact same thing last time...) Byrde: But I don't mind! What's one more disaster in my life? At least now the real Mr. Wright is here with me. I won't let the world keep me down, sir! Examine Surveillance camera Phoenix: Smile, you're on candid camera. Guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. I bet they don't get too many waitresses in here. He looks like he's getting a bit restless. Talk Maggey Byrde Maya: So, how come you're dressed like that, Maggey? Last year you looked so sharp in that police uniform. Byrde: Hmph. I was fired after that... incident last year. Maya: Oh. I'm sorry. Byrde: It's OK. I don't mind one bit. I enjoyed being on the force, but I think it was time for me to move on. Maya: So, what do you do now? Byrde: In the second act of \"The Life of Maggey Byrde\", I'm playing the role of a waitress! Maya: A waitress!? Byrde: Yes. In a French restaurant. It's a small place, but it's quite fashionable. My charming smile and shapely figure came through for me. And the owner, Mr. Armstrong, hired me straight away, sir. Phoenix: And then you got into this mess straight away, right? Byrde: Yeah, you could put it that way... What happened Byrde: This whole mess started on the 3rd of last month... And it happened at Trés Bien. Maya: \"Treh Bee-an\"...? Byrde: Yes. It's a restaurant where good service and a friendly smile are always included! Maya: Oh... Byrde: There were two men at the table, both drinking coffee. And then... One of the men slipped some poison into the victim's cup! The victim took just one sip and was gasping for air! I was so shocked, I passed out. Maya: Hey, hold on there, Maggey. Byrde: What? Maya: You keep calling the guy, \"the victim\". Didn't you know the guy who was killed? Byrde: Not at all! I'd never even seen the guy before! Maya: Oh... Phoenix: (So she wouldn't have a motive to kill him then, I guess...) And the other man, the killer. You saw him, right? Byrde: Of course! A good waitress must be attentive to the clientele. Phoenix: So, you saw the killer, but you were found guilty of the crime anyway? How come? Byrde: ......... You tell me, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Ack! (Guess the answer to my question is \"my phony\"... Anyway, she saw the killer. Better see if I can get a description of the guy.) Guilty verdict (appears after \"What happened\") Maya: So, if you saw the murderer, why were you still convicted? Byrde: Because no one else saw. Maya: Saw what? Byrde: The other man. The one who put the poison in the victim's coffee. Everyone testified that way. Mr. Armstrong, the customer... Everyone. \"The victim was sitting alone at his table the whole time.\" Phoenix: But how's that possible? Byrde: I don't know. But nobody, not one person, would believe me, sir. Even Phoenix Wright, my one last hope for a fair trial, failed me. What a pathetic defense! My granny could've done a better job! Phoenix: Look! That wasn't me, OK? Byrde: And then! ...They found something a bit incriminating in my apron pocket. Maya: What? Byrde: A small bottle... of poison. Maya: WHAT!? P-Poison!? It was in your pocket!? Byrde: Well, I passed out when the victim collapsed. The killer must've slipped the poison into my pocket when I was unconscious. Phoenix: And no one else saw this other guy? Byrde: No, sir. That's what everyone said. But I don't see how they could've missed him... The other guy (appears after \"Guilty verdict\") Byrde: I was the one who took the coffee to the two men. Phoenix: O-Oh...? And what was your impression of them? Byrde: Well... When I first saw them, I kind of thought they might be in the music industry. Maya: In music? How come? Byrde: Well, one of them had some sort of earpiece, and an emo musician's look about him. And there was a sample CD on the table, sir. Maya: An earpiece and a sample CD, huh? Did you get a look at the CD at all? Byrde: It had a band's name written on it. I think it was \"MC\"-something. They must've been preparing for their debut, I guess. Phoenix: So it was a band's CD. Maybe a promo disc? Maya: Maybe it was \"MC Screwdriver\"! Phoenix: Get serious, Maya. Would you buy the CD of a group named that? Byrde: Nngh... What was the name of that group again...? \"MC Hacksaw...\"? No... \"MC...\" Maya: And what about the killer? What did he look like? Byrde: Well, I, um... I don't really remember. Only that he was a young man. Well-built like the victim, really. Present Attorney's Badge Byrde: That badge! Is it real? Phoenix: Of course it's real! Byrde: That's what they all say. But I've been duped before. Give it to me for a sec! Phoenix: Ah...! ...*chomp!* Maya: She... She bit into it... Byrde: And I left a few teeth marks, too! Phoenix: I can see that... Byrde: I just wish I could remember if that means it's real or a fake. Phoenix: *sigh* (I said it was real!) Magazine Clipping Phoenix: Oh, yeah. I need to ask you about this... Byrde: Hey! This article's about my case! Phoenix: Can you tell me anything about the guy who was pretending to be me? Byrde: Yes, sir! It was the morning after I'd been arrested... I met you in the visitor's room here. You were wearing one of your super-sharp suits. Phoenix: Me? Byrde: Yes, you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Argh... Maya: Hey, Maggey! Was my evil double Ayam here, too? Byrde: No. I don't remember a phony you, Maya. Maya: Oh... *sigh* It would've been so cool... Byrde: Then you got really worked up and passionate. \"I'm gonna get you' cleared'a dis crime!\" you said. (Changed from ['I'm gonna get you cleared of this crime!' you said.] in the original release) Phoenix: OK, I get the picture. But you've met me in person before... So how come you didn't realize that guy wasn't the real me? Byrde: ... I guess, looking back now, it was a little strange... Phoenix: Only a little? Byrde: Well, OK, so you were a bit taller than normal. And you looked a bit shady. And your voice was a bit weird. Oh, and you had this funny accent. And... Phoenix: So the guy was nothing like me, then!? Byrde: But he had your spiky hair and blue suit. Phoenix: (... Is that all it takes for someone to imitate me...?) Maya: How about everyone else in the courtroom, like the judge and the observers...? Didn't they realize he was an imposter? Byrde: Everyone had these big question marks on their faces... But it seemed that no one wanted to say anything, sir. Maya: This case just keeps getting weirder and weirder... Maya Fey profile Byrde: Thanks for your help last year! Maya: Aw, it was nothing. I'm glad we got you off the hook. Byrde: I hope you can help me out this year, too! Maya: Yeah, me too. It's be sweet if we could get that verdict overturned. Dick Gumshoe profile Byrde: Oh, Detective Gumshoe! He really looked out for me when I was on the force! Phoenix: Have you seen him recently? Byrde: No. He's never been to the restaurant. Maya: Guess he's not a fan of French cuisine, huh? He's an instant noodle type of guy, after all. Byrde: Yeah, he prefers the simple things in life. Phoenix: (...Or he's just simply too poor to afford anything else.) Maggey Byrde profile Byrde: No matter what happens, I never let anything get me down! Maya: You're always so positive, aren't you, Maggey? Byrde: Macho Maggey Byrde, they say! The early Byrde catches the worm! A Byrde in the hand! Maya: Wow! All those phrases are named after you? Byrde: And I never turn my back on anything! Maya: You're always so strong, aren't you, Maggey? Byrde: Macho Maggey Byrde, they say! I'm a tough old Byrde! Maya: \"Tough old byrde\", Nick! Hee hee! Do you get it? Phoenix: ...Yeah, I get it. Anything else Byrde: I know I used to be on the police force, sir. But I'm incarcerated, now. So I can't use my connections to help you. All I can tell you about now is info about ex-cons or the clientele of Trés Bien, sir... Maya: Aww, don't let it get you down, Maggey! After clearing all Talk options and presenting Magazine Clipping: Byrde: Mr. Wright... Do you think it's possible to get a retrial? Phoenix: Probably. The court ruled in the absence of a genuine defense attorney. So we should be able to get a retrial. Byrde: Um... Mr. Wright...? Phoenix: ? Byrde: Do you think we'll win next time? ...Sir? Phoenix: ...! Byrde: My life has been a full course meal of bad luck, complete with defeat for dessert. Since I was 6 months old, when I fell from the 9th floor of my apartment building... ...I've been hit by all sorts of vehicles, gotten sick from all sorts of foods... ...failed at almost every test I've taken, experienced almost every kind of disaster... I even landed a phony lawyer when I had the misfortune of being accused of murder. But! I will survive! Because Maggey Byrde always lives to fight another day! And one day, I'll find it! Just you wait and see, sir! I'll find that one, single moment of good luck! Maya: Argh, Xin Eohp is really gonna pay for this! Phoenix: Wh-What are you staring at me like that for...? (But Maya's right... Whoever it is that thought it was a good idea to use my name... ...and get an innocent girl convicted of murder had better watch out!) Maya: We'll find him! Don't you worry. We'll get Xin Eohp for you! Byrde: Thank you! Oh! I'll tell you where Trés Bien is then! Phoenix: Trés... Ah, right. The restaurant where the murder took place. Byrde: Yes, sir. When you go, please tell Mr. Armstrong I said hi! Maya: Sure! Alright, Nick! Let's go check out this restaurant and its food! January 6Trés Bien Maya: Wow! Look at this place. Phoenix: \"Look\"? More like \"smell\"... What is with the suffocating scent of flowers in here...? Then again, girls like that sort of thing, right? Maya: Actually, I'm not all that into it... Phoenix: ... Maya: ... No one's coming to seat us. Maybe there's no one here. Phoenix: Don't be silly, Maya. This is a restaurant, and it's open for business. HELLO! ANYONE HERE? ... I don't believe it! There really isn't anyone here! Maya: Perfect! Let's get intrusive! If there's no one here, we can take anything we want! Phoenix: (Yeah, I suppose we can...) Examine Cash register Maya: Look, it's one of those magical boxes that spits out money. Phoenix: You know, you're the only person who would ever describe a cash register in that way! Trinkets Maya: Look at all the little trinkets tucked away in here. Phoenix: I bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally. Let's see... A bouquet of flowers, some potpourri, and look! Fine bone china cups! Maya: ... I never knew you were so... cultured. Phoenix: Come on, Maya! This is common knowledge! Any Joe Schmoe knows this much! Front entrance Phoenix: It's the restaurant's front entrance. There's a sign hanging on the door written in French. It probably says, \"Open\" or \"Closed\". It must be one or the other, but I don't know which since I dunno Jacques about French. Magazine rack Maya: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Phoenix: Why don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" something, huh, Maya? Maya: Yeah. I guess I could. I'm always in my acolyte clothes, aren't I? It'd be fun to wear normal clothes every now and then. Phoenix: Hm? There's something stuffed in behind the rack. Maya: ...Looks like a sports paper to me. Hey, and look at this! Someone's scribbled a little doodle on one of the pages. \"MC Bomber\", and one, two, three, four, five zeros... A-A hundred thousand... dollars... maybe? Phoenix: I wonder what \"MC Bomber\" is supposed to be...? ! (This paper! It's from December 3rd...) This paper's from the day of the poisoning! Maya: WHAT!? Sports Paper added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (A paper from the day of the murder... This has got to be a clue! I should see if I can find out some more about this paper...) Magazine rack (subsequent times) Maya: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Phoenix: Looks like Mr. Armstrong doesn't get any newspapers. Maya: Well, it wouldn't exactly suit the feel of the place, would it? Phoenix: Why don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" like in these mags, Maya? Maya: Yeah. I'd look stunning in some of those Parisian frocks, huh? Phoenix: (We found that sports paper behind this magazine rack earlier... I'd better try to find out everything I can about it...) Table Phoenix: This table's set nicely. It just needs a customer. Maya: What do you think this flower is, Nick? Phoenix: Let's see... Well, it doesn't look like a tulip, and it's not a sunflower, I don't think... Maya: Duh. Even I could've told you that. Phoenix: Well, those are the only kinds of flowers I know. Dagnabit, I'm a lawyer, not a botanist! Windows Phoenix: Wow! It's a beautiful winter wonderland out there. Maya: Really!? Cool! I love snow! Let me see! Huh? It's not white. It's not even snowing. Phoenix: Got you! I was only kidding, Maya. Maya: Nick! There are lies that are OK to tell, and lies that definitely aren't. Phoenix: (...All I did was tell an itty-bitty white lie about nonexistent white snow.) Partition Phoenix: This restaurant has partitions that separate the tables. When you're seated at a table, you can only see the tables to your right or left. Crime scene Phoenix: This must be the table where the murder occurred. Maya: I guess so, with all this police tape all around it. Phoenix: And that stain must be from the poisoned coffee. Don't go licking the tablecloth, OK, Maya? Maya: Why would I lick it? I'm not a cat, you know! Phoenix: (Then why can I picture you doing just that?) Wright & Co. Law Offices Present Sports Paper Maya: Hmm... \"MC Bomber\"... Phoenix: And don't forget the \"100,000\", too. Maya: There's something about that name, \"MC Bomber\". Phoenix: Yeah, It's a pretty unusual name. Phoenix: And don't forget the \"100,000\", too. Maya: Everyone's worried about bombs these days, I guess. Phoenix: I'm not sure that has any bearing on anything related to this case...) Maya: Anyway, we should really look into this some more! Maggey Byrde profile Maya: This is Maggey's second time as a murder suspect, huh? Phoenix: Yeah. The first time was a little over a year ago... She was on the police force back then. Maya: Wasn't she working under Gumshoe? That does it, Nick! We're gonna get her off the hook or I'll give up hamburgers! Detention Center Present Sports Paper Byrde: Oh! A sports paper. Let's see, let's see... Did Gutsen Brawn manage to defend his heavyweight title? Phoenix: Sorry, Maggey. That paper is actually a month old... It's from the day of the murder... Maya: And Gutsen got knocked out yesterday, I'm afraid. Byrde: Oh, no... Phoenix: I found this paper in the magazine rack at Trés Bien. Byrde: Really? That's strange... Trés Bien doesn't get newspapers. Mr. Armstrong says he's not really fond of them. Maya: Then maybe one of the customers left it behind? Phoenix: Anyway, what I want you to take a look at is this scribble here. Byrde: Ah-ha! That's it, sir! \"MC Bomber\"! That was the name that was written on the CD! Phoenix: (Just as I thought...) Maya: I guess it wasn't \"MC Screwdriver\" after all, huh... Byrde: So, that $100,000 must be a down payment for a record deal, right? Maya: If someone gave me $100,000, I'd sing for sure! \"The Master of Kurain\" or \"The Spirit Song\" or even \"Maya's Theme\"! Phoenix: Um, OK, Maya... So, if the sample CD was on the victim's table... That means this newspaper may have belonged to the victim! Maya: You're right! Phoenix: (So the victim left this behind on the day of the murder, huh...) Maya: I think we better step up the investigation, don't you Nick? After presenting Sports Paper in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: January 6Trés Bien ???: Oh là là! Bon-JOUR! Welcome to la Trés Bien! Maya: Oh! Hel... lo... ... Phoenix: (What happened to Maya? She's frozen stiff...) ???: Bienvenue! Welcome to my petite restauranté! Maya: Huh? \"Bee Avenue\"? ???: Oh, non, my petite chulip! Maya: Huh? Me? ???: Look at z'is face! Like la kitten rejected by its own mother. You are fatigued, non? Alors! You need z'is! An aromatic bath oil mélange of la néroli and la rose. My personal recommendation! Maya: You think I need what...? ???: Oui, oui! Just add a couple of drops of z'is mixture to la bath water, and voilá! It will soothe your body and your mind. It's simply fantastique! Maya: Really? ???: And for la monsieur! Phoenix: Who? Me? ???: Look at z'at face! Like la puppy rejected by life itself! You are fatigued, non? For you, monsieur, I recommend z'is! Oil of bergamot. And maybe a 'int of... Oui, oui! I will add la peppermint and la clary sage for a fragrance exceptionnel! Such an invigorating recipe will bring out your delicious beauty, monsieur! Phoenix: M-My beauty!? ???: Alors. If you will be seated, I will bring you la special menu of z'e day! Phoenix: Actually, we're not here to eat. We're lawyers. ???: Mais bien sûr! I know z'is already, monsieur. You are la Phoenix Wright, non? Phoenix: Um, yes... You know me? ???: Mais, oui oui! I never forget a man who flirts wiz me! Especially in court! Maya: I guess he was cross-examined by our mysterious Xin Eohp... Phoenix: It looks like everyone to do with this case knows who \"I\" am already. Maya: I wonder what sort of impression Xin Eohp's been leaving on people, don't you? Armstrong: Allow me to introduce myself to you again. I am Jean Armstrong. Enchanté! Talk Trés Bien Maya: So what does \"Trés Bien\" mean? I know \"trés\". That means \"three\", right? Armstrong: Non, non, non! \"Trés Bien\" is Français! In English, you would say, \"Very Good\". Maya: Oh. Very good... Armstrong: Oui, exactement! La atmosphere is trés bien, and la cuisine is trés bien! Phoenix: (If the food's good, why aren't there any customers in here?) Armstrong: My cuisine is not for all. Some people, z'ey do not appreciate la haute cuisine. Phoenix: (I thought everyone liked hot cuisine...) Armstrong: Since I 'ave lost Maggey, I do not 'ave enough 'ands. Phoenix: So, you're running this place on your own now? Armstrong: Oui. For la moment. No one 'as answered my advertisement. Oh, poor moi! Phoenix: (... Please don't eyeball me while you say that.) Armstrong: I am la chef. I am la manager. I am also a trained aromatherapist. Maya: A roaming what? Armstrong: A practitioner d'aromatherapy. La art of soothing la soul wiz z'e delicate floral aromas. Phoenix: (Delicate? The smell coming from that bottle earlier was anything but...) What happened Phoenix: So, could you tell me what you know about the incident? Armstrong: Bien. It makes me sad to remember it, yet I remember it so well. More z'an a month 'as passed since it 'appened. Phoenix: (Yeah, I guess it's been about a month since Maggey's sentencing...) Armstrong: So. It was z'e third of last month. Just after one in z'e afternoon. A man who was in 'ere for a coffee suddenly became ill. Phoenix: Because of the poison in his coffee? Armstrong: Z'at is la truth as I know it. It was Maggey who took 'is drink to 'im. I was in la kitchen. I 'eard z'e sound of someone collapsing. When I came out to see what it was, 'e was already slumped in 'is chair. Maya: He was dead? Armstrong: Mon dieu! Oui! 'E was dead! Maggey 'ad passed out also. Phoenix: And this man who died... Was he alone? Armstrong: Oui, monsieur. All alone. I know z'at Maggey said z'ere was someone else, but... Maya: I see... Armstrong: La police, z'ey asked me many times. \"Are you sure z'ere was no one else at z'e table?\" z'ey asked. But I am not z'e only one. La old man said z'e same thing. Phoenix: Old man? What old man? Old man (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: Um... So who is the old man that you mentioned? Armstrong: At z'e time of la murder, z'ere was another customer in 'ere. Maya: What!? Someone else saw it? Armstrong: Mais, oui! As usual, 'e came alone z'at day. At z'e time of la murder, 'e was 'ere. 'E saw it, too. But 'e said z'e same thing, z'at z'ere was no one else at la victim's table. Maya: But Maggey swears there were two people! Armstrong: Mais, mademoiselle. La lawyer, 'e could not prove z'is, non? Phoenix: About the lawyer. That was me, I suppose? Armstrong: Mais bien sûr! Phoenix: ... Wow! He's the first person who's said it wasn't me. Maya: Don't kid yourself, Nick! Hmph. Now who's the one making stuff up!? Maggey's motive (appears after presenting Maggey Byrde profile) Phoenix: When Maggey took the coffee over to the victim... ...did anything happen? Armstrong: Ou... Oui. I-I suppose you could say so. Phoenix: So what happened? Armstrong: Non. It was, er... It was nothing. Maya: Look, Maggey says she didn't even know the guy! But she's still been indicted for murder! The prosecution must have come up with some kind of motive! Armstrong: Oui. It is true. Phoenix: If there was anything at all between Maggey and the victim, it could be relevant. Maya: So please! Tell us anything you know. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Psyche-Locks!?) (Changed from [A Psyche-Lock!?] in the original release) Maya: No way! What are we going to do, Nick? Phoenix: We'll just have to remov... WHAT THE!? Maya: Wh-What's wrong? Phoenix: The Magatama... It's gone! Maya: Huh? Phoenix: I had it in my pocket, but... It has vanished into thin air! Maya: WHAT!? Phoenix: (But I could see the Psyche-Locks. (Changed from [But I could see the Psyche-Lock.] in the original release) Maybe that means the Magatama's nearby...?) Maggey's motive (subsequent times) Phoenix: Maggey wouldn't just have put poison in the coffee of some guy she didn't even know. If she's really guilty, there must have been something between her and the victim. 3 PSYCHE LOCKS Armstrong: N-Non. It was nothing. I am sure. Qué será, será. Perhaps Maggey 'ad another reason. Phoenix: (What's Maggey's motive got to do with this chef? Why is he hiding things from me? And another thing... Where did I drop the Magatama? The fact that I can see the lock [sic] must mean it's nearby.) Maya: I only loaned it to you, you know. So you better find it, Nick! OK? Phoenix: (...And here I thought it was mine to keep!) Present Attorney's Badge Armstrong: Please, monsieur. Z'ere is no need to show me z'at. You are Mon. Phoenix Wright, z'e worst defense lawyer in town. Phoenix: (I think I can imagine how he formed this completely wrong impression of me...) Um, the last time we met, did I show you this badge? Armstrong: Oui. You flashed it to everyone in la restaurant! Maya: Looks like Xin Eohp is a bigger fan of flashing stuff than you are, Nick! Magazine Clipping Armstrong: I am not a lawyer myself. I do not wish to speak out of turn. But your defense in court z'at day was a little, how you say, \"lacking\", per'aps? Phoenix: *sigh* Armstrong: Even a Frenchman who cannot speak any English could 'ave done a better job! You were very cool, though. Oh, oui, oui! So 'andsome. Maya: Wow, I wonder just how bad the defense could've been... Armstrong: Every time you opened your mouth, z'e 'ole courthouse stirred. Phoenix: (Oh, man. That is something I don't want to imagine...) Sports Paper Phoenix: We found this sports paper in the magazine rack here. Armstrong: One of my customers must 'ave left it behind. Maya: Do you have any idea which customer it was? Armstrong: Z'e only ideas I 'ave, mademoiselle, I save for my kitchen! Maya Fey profile Armstrong: Oh là, là! You 'ave such a pretty smile, my petite chulip! Maya: Who, me? Armstrong: Oui. La smile is the most important thing for us girls, n'est-ce pas? Maya: Um... Sure! Armstrong: If you want a job 'ere, it is yours, precious! Mia Fey profile Armstrong: Mon dieu! What beauty! Maya: That's my sister! Armstrong: Ah, oui? Another delight! But you 'ave a certain je ne sais quois z'at I do not sense from your sister. Maya: I do? Armstrong: So throw your head 'ead 'igh! Thrust out your feminine features! Do not lose 'eart, ma fille! You are a woman! A woman extraordinaire! Maya: Do I look like I need cheering up or something? Maggey Byrde profile Armstrong: Maggey was a policewoman once, n'est-ce pas? Phoenix: Yes. But she had to quit for, um, reasons beyond her control. Armstrong: Oui, oui. She was la suspect in la murder investigation, non? Maya: Oh... You know about that? Armstrong: Z'at is why I gave to 'er la perfume for la 'appiness. Phoenix: Happiness perfume? Armstrong: Oui. Blended from bergamot, like I 'ave given to you before. Phoenix: But she's been arrested again. And found guilty this time. Armstrong: Z'is is true. 'Er natural aroma of un'appiness must 'ave been very strong. Phoenix: (Just admit it! Your perfume doesn't work!) Armstrong: I am not surprised she was la prime suspect. After something like z'at took place before my very eyes. Maya: Something like what? Phoenix: (What's this guy talking about!?) Maya: Does this mean... Maggey did have a motive? Phoenix: We've got to ask this guy for more info, stat! Jean Armstrong profile Armstrong: It is 'ard to imagine, I know, but I was an apprentice for five years in la gay Paris. Maya: Wow! In Paris!? Armstrong: It was something la chef z'ere said to me z'at made me decide to open my own restaurant. Phoenix: What was it? Armstrong: Z'at awful man said to me, \"You must train for another ten years!\" Oh! It was such a shock! So unexpected! But you would 'ave to be a fool to do z'is, non? Anything else Phoenix: Um, about this... Armstrong: Félicitations! Mais... qu'est-ce que c'est? Phoenix: Ack! Um... Je... Je no comprehend... Maya: Nick! Don't just make something up! After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: Um, Mr. Armstrong... Could I just confirm something with you again? The table where the victim was sitting... Was anyone else sitting there? Armstrong: ... Z'at is a question you will 'ave to ask 'im yourselves. Maya: Huh? \"'Im\"? Armstrong: La old man spends all of 'is time dans la parc. Phoenix: La p-parc? Oh, a park? What park's that? Armstrong: Behind la restaurant. It is called, \"Vitamin Square\". Maya: Thank you! Armstrong: Je vous en prie, my dear! Maya: Let's go check out this Vitamin Square right now, Nick! January 6Vitamin Square Maya: So this is Vitamin Square. Phoenix: Yeah. I see where they get the name from now. The fruits scream \"VITAMINS!\" at you. Maya: Hey, Nick! That's the guy, right? Isn't that the old man Mr. Armstrong was talking about? Phoenix: That grouchy-looking grandpa? Maya: He's throwing seeds out for the pigeons. Phoenix: Maya, he's not throwing seeds for them, he's throwing seeds AT them! Old Man: ... Phoenix: (Ugh... My grumpiness-threat level has just been raised to red...) Examine Sandbox Maya: I used to love sandboxes like you wouldn't believe! Phoenix: Really? You? Maya: Sure. Finding iron filings in the sand with a magnet was my favorite thing to do. Phoenix: Iron filings? Wow... That's too exciting for words. Maya: It was my ambition to collect every single shred of iron in the sandbox. I was such a kid back then! Phoenix: So, did you manage to get all the iron? Maya: No, I never did. I think I came close, though. Come to think of it, I still have all the iron filings I found way back when. You want them? Phoenix: No. Fruit attractions Maya: This place is so fruity! Phoenix: That's not a bad thing. Besides, I love apples. They're among my favorites. Maya: Then that apple slide is perfect for you! Phoenix: ... And what is so \"perfect\" about it? Maya: Oh come on. Don't be a stick in the mud! Slide down it a few times. Go on! Woo! Phoenix: No way! I'd get covered in sand if I slid down that slide. Anyone can see that. Maya: Yeah, you're right. Otherwise, I'd give it a try, too. Pigeons Maya: Hey, look. Pigeons! Phoenix: Yeah. And heaps of them, too. Maya: Did you know that pigeons are a symbol of peace? Phoenix: That's a dove, not a pigeon. Maya: ... Poor things. Just because they're gray means they can't be symbols of peace and harmony? Phoenix: You're over-thinking this one by just a smidge, Maya. Magazine on orange-themed seat Maya: Ooh, there's a magazine here. Phoenix: It's a magazine full of job listings. Old Man: You disgusting rogue, picking up something someone else threw away! Phoenix: \"Threw away\"? Did you throw this away? Are you looking for a job? Old Man: Kah! That's none of your business! Phoenix: Sorry! I guess I'll take the magazine with me then. Old Man: I don't want anyone else having it! Give it back! Phoenix: (Too bad. Now that you want it so bad, I don't want to give it up!) Job Listings added to the Court Record. Old Man: Hey! That's mine! Closer orange-themed seat (after examining magazine on orange-themed seat) Maya: Looking at this orange reminds me... Phoenix: Of what? Maya: That you're supposed to eat a lot of them to ward off colds in the winter. You can't have fun during the holidays if you're sick in bed, you know. Phoenix: You don't have to tell me twice. Talk What you saw Phoenix: Um... Excuse me. Old Man: ... Phoenix: Would you mind if I had a word with you? Old Man: Yes! Phoenix: I just want to ask you a couple of questions... Old Man: What's the matter with you!? Can't you see I'm busy? So you don't like my seeds, eh, pigeons!? Phoenix: (He's really chucking those seeds at them! That's got to hurt!) Old Man: Go on! Eat this! Phoenix: (*sigh*) Maggey Byrde Phoenix: Excuse me, sir. Can I ask you about Maggey Byrde? Old Man: I don't know any Maggey Byrde! Maya: Yes, you do. Maggey. The waitress at Trés Bien. Old Man: Kah! It's a disgrace, I tell you. An utter disgrace! Maya: A disgrace? Old Man: An innocent young girl revealing herself like that! Phoenix: Revealing!? You mean her uniform? Old Man: The youth of today! They don't have any shame! No shame, I tell you! Not one ounce! Whatever happened to the old bushido values of Japan, like honor and modesty? Maya: What about me? I'm not wearing anything revealing. Old Man: You!? Your problem is you lack any sense of grace! Maya: Talk about hitting a girl where it hurts... Trés Bien Phoenix: Do you go to Trés Bien a lot? Old Man: Hmph! That miserable excuse for a restaurant? That garbage they serve in there's not food. Where's the sushi? The tempura? The rice!? Phoenix: Trés Bien is a French restaurant, sir... Old Man: Where do you think we are, boy? In Paris!? I want real food, not those snooty snacks! And what about those shameless girls!? Phoenix: You mean the waitresses? Old Man: You can see all the way up to their... their... Yes! The waitresses! They're practically naked! It's a disgrace, isn't it? Well, isn't it!? Phoenix: Listen, it's not my restaurant. Old Man: Kah! It's a miserable excuse for a restaurant, that place! Miserable! Phoenix: (He certainly knows the place. He must be a regular! But if he hates it so much, why does he keep going?) Trés Bien regular (appears after \"Trés Bien\") Maya: Are you a regular at that restaurant, sir? Old Man: ... Maya: It's just, if you dislike it so much, why would you keep going there? Old Man: ... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: There you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha! Take that! Maya: He must be hiding something, right? Phoenix: If he is, I should be able to see a Psyche-Lock... Oh, wait... I don't exactly have the Magatama right now, huh... Maya: Remember, Nick. That Magatama is only on loan. You better find it or else! Phoenix: (If Pearls ever gets wind of this, I'm going to be in a world of pain...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, excuse me, sir. Could I just ask you about this... Old Man: ... Hmm, ha-hmm, hmm... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: Here you go, boy! How does some pigeon feed sound to you!? Phoenix: (This wasn't exactly what I was hoping to get out of this guy...) Detention Center Present Job Listings Maya: Um, Maggey... Byrde: Oh, are you looking for some part-time work, Maya? Why don't you take a job at the restaurant? I bet Mr. Armstrong would hire you. Maya: Really? Me? Byrde: It's pretty cool being a waitress, you know. And in the kitchen, you'll get to see all of the chef's greatest secrets! Maya: What secrets...? Byrde: You can't make it obvious, but just spy on him for a bit. You'll see. It's interesting. Maya: Wow! I can't wait to get my apron on now! Phoenix: Yeah, he has a pretty intense aroma, too. Maya: So did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...? Byrde: Apparently not. Well, he's in the kitchen all the time, so I guess it's possible that he didn't. Jean Armstrong profile Byrde: Oh, so you met the owner, Mr. Armstrong! Phoenix: He's, um... Oh, how can I put this... pretty unique, huh? Byrde: He has a really intense aura. As a chef and as a person. Phoenix: Yeah, he has a pretty intense aroma, too. Maya: So did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...? Byrde: Apparently not. Well, he's in the kitchen all the time, so I guess it's possible that he didn't. Trés Bien Examine Cash register (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It's really tight behind the cash register counter. Can Mr. Armstrong even get in there? And if he got in... could he get out again? Trinkets (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: There's a bunch of little trinkets on a shelf by the door. I bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally. Magazine rack (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Ugh. All the clothes in these are absolutely atrocious! ...Some of them have been circled in red. ... I really hope Mr. Armstrong is not thinking of buying those. Table (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: Mr. Armstrong must be a pretty big neat-freak. He already has this table ready to go. Now if only the food in this place was edible... Windows (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It looks pretty cold out there on the streets. Peaceful, though. It's nice that people can take it easy after the holiday rush. Crime scene (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: This must be the table where the poisoning occurred. The stain tells the story well. The whole area is still cordoned off with police tape. I guess it must still be under investigation. Present Job Listings Armstrong: Mademoiselle! Maya: Y-Yes? Armstrong: Are you looking for la job? Maya: What!? N-No, no. I was just... Armstrong: Let me see. Your style is un peu différent, but you 'ave a good face. Maya: ...Different? Armstrong: Félicitations! You 'ave passed! I will 'ire you! Bien! Come wiz me. I will teach you everyz'ing I know! Maya: N-Nick! HEEEEEELP! Phoenix: (I don't know whether to laugh or feel bad for Maya... Maybe I should do both...?) Vitamin Square Examine Sandbox Phoenix: When I think back to when I was young... ...I wonder what I found so great about playing in a sandbox. Maybe I'll come back here in the middle of the night one of these days to relive it. ... On second thought, being arrested by Gumshoe would be too embarrassing to bear. Fruit attractions Phoenix: You don't see many parks like this anymore. What a great place for kids to play. But that old man's the only one here, chucking his seeds at the pigeons. Pigeons Phoenix: The pigeons are so busy pecking at the seeds, they don't notice anything else. Seeing those birds eat with such intense focus... ...reminds me of Maya when she's scarfing down a burger. Closer orange-themed seat Phoenix: This is where I found that job listings magazine before. A guy like me carrying around a magazine like that kind of gives the wrong impression. I guess I better give it back to that old man once this investigation's over. Talk Maggey Byrde Phoenix: Excuse me, sir. Can I ask you about Maggey Byrde? Old Man: I don't know any Maggey Byrde! Phoenix: Yes, you do. You know, the waitress at Trés Bien. Old Man: Hmph! If you ask me It's a disgrace! Th-That's what it is! An innocent young girl revealing herself like that! Phoenix: So, you didn't like that kind of thing, then? Old Man: ... Wh-What are you trying to say about me, boy!? Explain yourself! Phoenix: Um, nothing! I'm not saying anything about you... Old Man: I know your kind! You young ones with your spiky hair and your fancy suits! That heads of yours is over-flowing with filthy ideas! Phoenix: (...I know someone who needs to learn some stress management.) Old Man: Get out of here, you young brat! Trés Bien regular Phoenix: So, you are a regular at that restaurant, right, sir? Old Man: ... Phoenix: You're always complaining about the place, so why do you go there? Old Man: ... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: There you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha! Take that! Phoenix: (Something's not right about this guy... But If he's hiding something, I should be able to see a Psyche-Lock.) Oh, wait... (I don't exactly have the Magatama right now, huh... I need to find it before I can get anywhere with this old man.) After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: Looks like they have Maggey in questioning. I guess I've asked her pretty much everything... I'll come back if there's anything else I need to ask her later. Examine Guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. There's nothing for him to do right now, so he's catching some vertical z's. After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Wright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Poor Maya. It looks like Mr. Armstrong's really taken a shine to her. I suppose I'll just have to let her work at the restaurant for a while. I'll go pick her up from Trés Bien once things have cooled off. After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Gumshoe: Well, pal!? Have you found the evidence yet!? The one that's gonna find her innocent!? Phoenix: Um, no. Not yet. We've only just started our investigation. Gumshoe: Well, whatever you need to know, I'll give you the dirt on it. I'm putting off all my other cases for now, pal! Phoenix: (Gumshoe's really fired up about this...) Gumshoe: Oh, yeah! One more thing! The retrial's been approved. Court's sitting at 10 AM tomorrow. And Godot's gonna be the prosecutor... Phoenix: (Oh. ... Him.) Gumshoe: Now, listen up, pal! If Maggey's found guilty again... Phoenix: Y-Yes...? Gumshoe: Um... I'll... I'll make sure you get locked up good for it, got it!? Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Hitting the gas is like hitting the fast-forward button on your life.\" No. That's too obscure. You don't really get the \"you'll die before your time\" idea. I need something more direct. Something a bit more light-hearted. Something like, \"Hitting the gas is your passport to paradise!\" Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a safety campaign. ...I guess? Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: WHAT!? Poisoned coffee waitress gets a retrial!? I knew it! I knew there was something funny about the taste of this coffee! OK! Who brought me this coffee today? Hands up! Phoenix: (Yeesh! Have a little faith in your subordinates!) Detective: Quit surfing the net, Chief! Chief: S-Sorry... I was just, um... Phoenix: (Things feel pretty tense in here...) Badgers Phoenix: No matter what, whenever I come here, that mascot's there to greet me. Chief: You got that right. That's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police force! Phoenix: So what's with the pink one? It's new, right? Chief: Yup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\". Phoenix: So one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"? Chief: You got it! They're married. Phoenix: (So should I expect to see Baby Badger next time I'm here...?) Talk Maggey Byrde Phoenix: So the guilty party was Maggey Byrde, huh? Gumshoe: Yeah... Phoenix: Back when she was on the police force... ...you were her mentor when she was a rookie, right? Gumshoe: Yeah, I kept a close eye on her. I-I mean, not too close. You know. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ...... ......... Hey, what's with the funny looks, pal? I was with her... It wasn't anything like... Look! Sure, I was her boss when she was doing her training. But that was it. Nothing happened. Phoenix: (Gumshoe sure is sweating up a storm over nothing... ...Ah, so that's it! Our big ol' Gumshoe has a little ol' crush on Maggey!) Gumshoe: I... I don't like her or anything! I... I was... Aaaargh! Phoenix: (Note to self: Gossip with Maya about this later!) Gumshoe: Look, pal! Don't tell anyone, OK!? You've gotta keep it a secret, got it!? Phoenix: S-Sure... And would you mind not guessing what I'm thinking all the time? Gumshoe: Hey, tell your face, pal, not me. You'd have to be blind not to see what's on your mind. The victim Phoenix: So I was wondering... Could you fill me in on the victim? Gumshoe: Glen Elg, he was a computer programmer. Phoenix: I see. A programmer... Gumshoe: He was just a regular Joe working for a small-time computer firm. Maggey never had any contact with the guy before that day. ...And all she did was take him his coffee on the day of the murder, pal. Phoenix: (Yeah, Maggey also claimed to have never seen the guy before...) Did the victim go to the restaurant often? Gumshoe: Not according to the chef. Said it was the first time he'd seen the guy. Phoenix: (A programmer... and a first-time customer at that...) (Changed from [A programmer... and a first-time customer...] in the original release) What possible reason could Maggey have had to kill a guy like that? Gumshoe: That's what I thought. But a motive was still somehow established in her trial. Phoenix: You're kidding! What was her supposed \"motive\"? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal. I'm real busy. I haven't even got enough time to sift through these papers. Look into it yourself, OK? Phoenix: (What could this motive have been...?) The investigation Gumshoe: This isn't really a proper investigation. I'm kind of working on it by myself. Phoenix: O-Oh, that's right... Gumshoe: The judge already ruled on the case, and all the evidence is in already. The only problem is with Maggey's testimony. Phoenix: Yeah... Doesn't sound very good for us, huh? Gumshoe: Look, pal. I've got a mountain of papers on this case to look over before tomorrow. So I'm just gonna say this... Maggey Byrde's no liar. She's... She's... OK, so she's a bit out there, and a bit off base sometimes. But she was a good cop. Phoenix: (That's not exactly complimentary, you know!) So what do you think really happened? And just how contradictory is her testimony? Contradictions (appears after \"The investigation\") Gumshoe: The biggest problem with Maggey's testimony is the number of people at the table. Phoenix: Yeah. My thoughts exactly. Maggey still insists there was another guy sitting with the victim. Gumshoe: Right. But get this... Everyone else in the place says the guy was alone. Even the chef. And then there's that CD... Phoenix: (CD? Oh, yeah. She did mention something about a CD...) Byrde: And there was a sample CD on the table, sir. Gumshoe: But our guys turned that place upside down. There was no CD. Phoenix: What? Gumshoe: Not on the table. Not anywhere in the whole restaurant, pal. Phoenix: But didn't Maggey say the victim was wearing an earpiece, too? Gumshoe: Yeah, but that was for the portable radio in the front pocket of his hoodie. Phoenix: A radio? He didn't have a CD player? Gumshoe: You got it. Your phony never explained that contradiction at all. Phoenix: (Come to think of it... The owner of Trés Bien didn't mention that CD either. I don't know why, but I get the feeling Mr. Armstrong's got something to hide...) The charming chef (appears after presenting Jean Armstrong profile) Phoenix: So what exactly is it that caught your attention about the chef at Trés Bien? Gumshoe: It's, um... kind of hard to say... The guy's probably not even connected with the case anyway... Phoenix: Hey, come on, Detective. Didn't you say you'd give me the dirt on anything? Gumshoe: Well, this sort of stuff is kinda... unimportant, gossipy stuff, you know pal? Look, how about this? You go to Trés Bien and investigate the place yourself. And if you find out anything suspicious about the guy... you report back to me, OK? Phoenix: Um... Don't suppose I get a choice in this, huh? (Guess I better find out more about the chef and Trés Bien; then report back to Gumshoe.) Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: Is that thing real, pal? Phoenix: Why does everybody keep asking me that? Gumshoe: I wonder what this phony of yours is like... Phoenix: He had Maggey found guilty of murder. Doesn't that tell you? (I've got to track this creep down!) Magazine Clipping Gumshoe: I wasn't at the trial myself. But I asked this one detective I know how your defense was. Phoenix: And what did he say? Gumshoe: He started off by saying, \"I'm at a complete loss for words...\" But he must have found some quick because he went on about how bad you were for an hour. Phoenix: But... Gumshoe: He said you sucked so much, it seemed like you were trying to get Maggey found guilty! Phoenix: (It looked like I was \"trying to get Maggey found guilty\"...?) Sports Paper Gumshoe: What's that? A sports paper? Phoenix: Yeah. I found it in the magazine rack at Trés Bien. Gumshoe: It's dated the same day as the murder. You may be onto something here. Phoenix: And take a look at this. See this writing here? Gumshoe: \"MC Bomber\"... Hey! Phoenix: What is it? Gumshoe: I've heard that name somewhere before. Yeah, \"MC Bomber\"... Phoenix: (Wow, he actually seems to be thinking for once!) Gumshoe: Ack, it's no good. I can't remember... Phoenix: (...And he goes back to being the Gumshoe we all know and love.) Gumshoe: Hey, pal. I'm gonna borrow this paper for a bit, OK? I wanna get a handwriting analysis done on this scribble. Phoenix: (Handwriting, huh? It'd be good to know more about that, in any case...) Gumshoe: Thanks, pal! I bet this'll turn out to be interesting clue! Sports Paper given to Detective Gumshoe. Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: Hey! So how come she's not with you today? Phoenix: She's working down at the restaurant right now. Gumshoe: Working, huh? Yeah, it's tough being broke. I would know. Phoenix: Um... OK...? Gumshoe: Next time I see her, I'll show her how to make the world's best instant noodles. We low earners have to stick together! It's the only way! Phoenix: (Um... Why is he shaking my hand with such enthusiasm...?) Mia Fey profile Gumshoe: She cross-examined me once, you know. Phoenix: What? Mia did? Gumshoe: Yeah. That was us. The big guns locking horns. Witness versus lawyer! It was a battle of cunning tactics and tricks. Phoenix: (But the witness isn't supposed to play any tricks...) Gumshoe: I can't believe she's gone... Godot profile Gumshoe: That's the guy who's gonna be the prosecutor in Maggey's retrial tomorrow. Phoenix: O-Oh, really? Gumshoe: He was working on a bunch of more important cases at the moment... ...but he canceled them all just so he could take you on, pal. Phoenix: (Why's that guy so determined to see me fail?) Gumshoe: You sure attract a lot of attention, huh? Too bad it's all the wrong kind. Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: I'm such a loser. I had high hopes for Maggey. I was gonna make her the best detective there ever was. But then all the sudden she was charged with murder and arrested. I never saw it coming. I never imagined they'd find her guilty. I hate myself for not being able to do anything. Phoenix: It's OK, Detective Gumshoe. We still have a chance to make this right. Gumshoe: ... You know what? You're not such a bad guy after all, pal. Maggey Byrde profile Phoenix: Have you gone to see Maggey? Gumshoe: Of course I have! But I... I wasn't much good at consoling her. I'm... I'm not very good with words. Phoenix: Oh... Gumshoe: Yeah. I guess I must've looked a bit down. Maggey was really supportive of me. It was great to have someone to talk to. Phoenix: (Did he go for her, or for himself...?) Jean Armstrong profile Gumshoe: The chef of Trés Bien, huh? You know what that chef said to me? \"Oh là là! Your body is full of la toxins.\" And then he gave me this bottle. Phoenix: What's in it? Gumshoe: I don't know. The label says, \"Juniper\". I'm under orders to put a few drops of it in my bath every day. Phoenix: Under orders? Old Man: Yeah. You know, there's something about the lady... I mean, guy. Phoenix: Huh!? You can't stop thinking about him!? Gumshoe: Not like that, pal! Gimme a break! He's not my type. I mean, I can't stop thinking that he's involved with this case somehow! Phoenix: (Sounds like he knows a little something more about our charming chef.) Anything else Phoenix: What do you make of this...? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal. All I can think about is Maggey at the moment. ... ...... N-No! I didn't mean it like that! I meant... Phoenix: (You don't have to explain... Really...) After clearing all Talk options and presenting Sports Paper in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept.: January 6Trés Bien Phoenix: The scent of flowers sure is strong. It's almost making me dizzy... Oh, um... Hello. (Who was that just now? A customer? She had sort of a dark aura about her...) ???: Ah! Welcome! Bee avenue! Phoenix: (Wow. What a cute voice.) Maya: Oh, it's just you, Nick. Phoenix: M-Maya! Maya: Well? How do I look? Phoenix: ... Maybe you should quit being a spirit medium... Maya: Maybe. But it's kind of boring being a waitress. I mean, you're my first ever customer. Phoenix: (Then who was that woman I just saw?) Maya: Oh, oh! Since you're here, you might as well have something to eat! Phoenix: ... I am kind of hungry, actually. Talk Waitress Phoenix: So, how do you like your new job, Maya? Maya: I never knew there was so much for a waitress to do! Take people's orders, bringing them their food, make coffee, work the cash register... Of course, we need a customer before I can do any of that. Phoenix: Yeah, it's a nice-looking restaurant. It's a shame more people don't come. Maya: Don't forget about the ultra cute waitress! Check out my \"gimme a tip\" smile! Lunch special Maya: Hey, Nick! Why don't you order something? The chef's preparing a tasty lunch set at the moment. Or so he says. Phoenix: How much is it? Maya: It's the Twin-T set. So it's 20 dollars, of course. Phoenix: The Twin-T set? I believe I'll be taking a pass. It's kind of expensive. Maya: What!? But you can't! Come on, Nick! It's not every day I get to be a waitress! I want to try carrying plates and working the cash register! Phoenix: How about cleaning the toilets? That should keep you busy. Maya: Yeah, right! Maybe later. Present Anything Phoenix: About this... Maya: Sorry, Nick! I'm a waitress now. I've got a pile of work waiting for little ol' me. After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: Um... About the lunch... Maya: Oh! A fine choice, sir. Phoenix: No. I, um... Maya: KITCHEN! A LUNCH SPECIAL, PLEASE! WITH ALL THE EXTRAS: DRINK, SIDE SALAD, DESSERT, AND GIFT! Phoenix: I don't need any of that! Maya: Just a moment, please, sir. Phoenix: (Maya's really getting into this! So how much is this set lunch, then? 20 dollars, huh? But with the drink, side salad, and dessert, it's... 45 dollars!?) Hey, wait a sec! Maya! Maya: Sorry to keep you waiting, sir! Here you are, our deluxe Fortify lunch set! Phoenix: Whoa! Maya: A dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Bon appétit! Phoenix: Um, thanks...? Maya: Come on, Nick! Hurry up and try it already! Phoenix: (Lobster, huh? Alright... Down the hatch it goes...) ... Urp! Maya: Well? Phoenix: Are you hungry, Maya? Maya: I'm starving! Phoenix: Here. It's yours. Maya: Really!? ... Urp! Phoenix: Remember, Maya. My wallet doesn't print money, so you'd better polish off that plate! Maya: ... I-I've just remembered! I've got to clean the toilets! Phoenix: Hey! (You can't be in that much of a hurry to clean the toilets!) Trés Bien Lunch Special added to the Court Record. Phoenix: How does that guy manage to make good food taste so bad? Maya: Hey, Nick... You want to take a peek at the kitchen? Phoenix: (The kitchen, huh? Not a bad idea.) Talk Kitchen Phoenix: Hmm, now what was it that Maggey said again? \"In the kitchen, you'll get to see all of the chef's greatest secrets!\" Maya: In the kitchen? Mmm. That sounds tasty! Phoenix: Hey, wait up! Maya! Maya: What is it? I'm pretty busy right now. Phoenix: Weren't you going to show me around? Maya: Tsk. There goes my plan to find some cool clue and show it off in your face... Phoenix: (I'd better conduct the search in the kitchen myself!) After clearing \"Kitchen\" Talk option in Trés Bien: January 6Trés BienKitchen Maya: And here it is! The famous Trés Bien kitchen! It's my first time in here too, actually. Phoenix: ... There is a weird atmosphere in here, that's for sure. Maya: Mr. Armstrong will be back soon, so we'd better search quickly! Chop, chop! Examine Mirror Maya: Now THIS is one large mirror! I bet this is where he makes himself look pretty. Phoenix: There's a book on the dresser. \"Claurice Armstrong's Bedtime Literature\". Maya: Not exactly Pulitzer Prize material, is it? Phoenix: It looks like a collection of poems he's written. Maya: Poems? Cool! Read one out! And say it in your best French accent... with intensity! OK? Phoenix: OK, um... Here's one. Ahem! It's called, \"Printemps\". \"Zee two of zem, like actors from a film. Zee coffee still undrunk. Sweet nothings over too soon, on zat sad Sunday morning. Zee foolish cocktail so delicious. Take zee last sip of your tea and I know what I will do. I must lie to you. I must.\" Maya: Huh? That's it!? Phoenix: Yup. That's a poem for you. Oil bottles Phoenix: What's this? It looks like a treasure chest or something. Maya: Wow! Look at all these little bottles! Phoenix: Oh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor... Maya: Let's see... 1, 2, 3... ...98, 99, 100! They're all the same, too. Hey, wait a minute... Phoenix: What is it? Maya: There's one bottle that's different from all the others. Phoenix: Well what do you know. And it doesn't have a label either. Maya: And... *sniff* It doesn't smell. Phoenix: (So what's that liquid inside then, I wonder?) Maya: Hey, Nick, we should borrow this. I mean, look how many bottles he's got. He won't miss one, will he? Small Bottle added to the Court Record. Oil bottles (subsequent times) Phoenix: What's this? It looks like a treasure chest or something. Maya: Wow! Look at all these little bottles! Phoenix: Oh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor... Maya: Let's see... 1, 2, 3... ...98, 99, 100! They're all the same, too. Lace curtains Phoenix: What are these lace curtains for? Maya: I don't know. But they give the place a real homey feel, don't they? Hmm... Lace curtains... You know, if I was a cooking pot, I'd be perfectly happy to sit on a shelf under those. Phoenix: (How do you respond to something like that!?) Table Maya: Now I know for sure I'm in a French restaurant. I've never heard of most of these seasonings. Hey, Nick! This container has... oyster sauce? What's that? Phoenix: (Isn't that used in Chinese food...?) Ack! Look! Right there on the counter! Maya: My Magatama! What's it doing there!? Phoenix: (What indeed...) Magatama put into pocket. Table (subsequent times) Maya: Now I know for sure I'm in a French restaurant. I've never heard of most of these seasonings. Hey, Nick! This container has... oyster sauce? What's that? Phoenix: (Isn't that used in Chinese food...?) Maya: And look at these knives. They look really sharp! Phoenix: I'd like to see how one of those slices through a cheesecake. Maya: A cheesecake? You don't exactly need a sharp knife for one of those, Nick. Stove Maya: Mmm. That smells good. Something's bubbling away nicely in that pot. It must be the lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Phoenix: Isn't that what I just ate for lunch? Maya: Maybe... What you ate is the only French dish I know the name of. After examining oil bottles in Trés Bien - Kitchen: January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Gumshoe: Hey, you're just in time! Phoenix: What is it, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: The lab got back to me about that newspaper you gave me. Phoenix: (He must mean this sports paper with the memo scribbled on it...) So? What did they say? Did the analysis turn up anything? Gumshoe: They said the doodle was written by the victim, Glen Elg. No doubt about it. Phoenix: (I expected as much...) Gumshoe: The victim took the paper with him to the restaurant on the day of the murder. That's our best interpretation of the facts at the moment. Sports Paper refiled into the Court Record. Gumshoe: \"MC Bomber\"... I get the feeling I've heard that name somewhere before... Oh, well. I guess it'll come back to me. Don't forget to report back to me with whatever you find in the restaurant, OK, pal? Phoenix: (Since when did I start taking orders from Gumshoe...? Although... I get the feeling there's something I need to show him...) Talk Armstrong's secret (appears after presenting Small Bottle) Phoenix: So what's Mr. Armstrong's secret? Gumshoe: You ever had lunch at Trés Bien, pal? Phoenix: Um... Yes... Gumshoe: So, how was it? Phoenix: To put it nicely... it was inedible. Gumshoe: Hey, don't worry about being nice around me, pal. You and I both know the reason that place is so empty is because of the food. I mean, the place is clean, and he's got a girl like Maggey as a waitress, so... Phoenix: Yeah... I guess it's probably the food. Gumshoe: The real scoop on the guy is he's up to his ears in debt. Phoenix: Really? How much does he owe? Gumshoe: This is a copy of his loan contract. He's about half a million in the red. Phoenix: H-Half a million? Are we talking dollars? Gumshoe: Yeah. Hey, if it was Sterling, he'd really be in trouble! Phoenix: Sorry. That figure just took me by surprise. Gumshoe: Yeah, this case is full of surprises. And I'd be willing to bet that chef's got something to do with most of them. That's my hunch. Jean's Loan Contract added to the Court Record. Armstrong's secret (subsequent times) Phoenix: So what's Mr. Armstrong's secret? Gumshoe: You ever had lunch at Trés Bien, pal? Phoenix: Um... Yes... Gumshoe: So, how was it? Phoenix: To put it nicely... it was inedible. Gumshoe: Hey, don't worry about being nice around me, pal. You and I both know the reason that place is so empty is because of the food. I mean, the place is clean, and he's got a girl like Maggey as a waitress, so... Phoenix: Yeah...

That figure just took me by surprise. Gumshoe: Yeah, this case is full of surprises. And I'd be willing to bet that chef's got something to do with most of them. That's my hunch. Present Sports Paper Gumshoe: So according to the boys down at the lab, the doodles were probably made by the victim. Phoenix: Probably? Gumshoe: Analyzing this kind of writing is difficult since it's done with a fiber-tipped pen. But don't worry! I'll vouch for it. Phoenix: (Why would Gumshoe have to vouch for it? Can't it stand on its own?) Small Bottle Gumshoe: You got one of those aroma bottles too, huh? Phoenix: Only this one doesn't smell. Gumshoe: Huh? I don't get you... Phoenix: This was mixed in with all the other aromatherapy bottles, but it's not the same. It doesn't even look the same, wouldn't you agree? Gumshoe: A cologne bottle that doesn't smell, huh? Smells like a skunk to me, pal! Mind letting me borrow that bottle for a while? I wanna send it to the lab for analysis. Phoenix: (The victim was poisoned, so the contents of this bottle are pretty important...) Small Bottle given to Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: I had a lunch there was something funny about that chef. Phoenix: You suspect Jean Armstrong? Gumshoe: I've got that guy's number. I know what his secret is. Phoenix: (That must be the same secret Gumshoe was talking about before.) Gumshoe: I guess I'd better fill you in on the details. About this Armstrong guy's secret, I mean... Jean's Loan Contract Gumshoe: It's for half a million dollars, pal! That's... um... half a million dollar bills! Phoenix: (What was the \"um\" in there for!?) Is there really that much money tied up in this case? Gumshoe: I can't give you an answer on that, pal. Not without the case file in front of me. But I'll tell you this... That Armstrong guy would've done anything for cash. He was desperate, you know? Phoenix: No, I don't. But I think I sort of get the picture. After examining table in Trés Bien - Kitchen: January 6Vitamin Square Phoenix: Hmm, the old guy's not here anymore. (Drat. And I still have some unanswered questions for him.) Examine Motor scooter Leads to: \"A scooter, huh?\" Phoenix: A scooter, huh? Who'd leave it right in the middle of the park like this? The wheel guard and the light are busted... I guess it must have been in an accident. It's totally wrecked. ???: Gwoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar!

Surely that guy wasn't my phony... was he...? ... He wasn't anything like me!! (Guess I better make a note of the scooter...) Scooter added to the Court Record. ???: Kah! Pathetic! Phoenix: Oh, it's you. Old Man: A few threats from a little brat like that... ...and you look like a pigeon that's got seeds in its eyes. Phoenix: Have you been here the whole time then? Old Man: I was in that strawberry. I had some thinking to do. Phoenix: (More like you had some cowering to do!) Talk Trés Bien regular Phoenix: Are you a regular at that restaurant, sir? Old Man: ... Phoenix: It's just if you dislike it so much, why would you keep going there? Old Man: ... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: There you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha! Take that! 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (I knew it... This old guy has got something to hide. But what could it be?) Trés Bien regular (subsequent times, before breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: Why are you a regular at a restaurant that you clearly hate, sir? Old Man: Take that, pigeons! See how you like these seeds! 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (It's no good. I'm gonna have to break his Psyche-Lock. I just can't figure out what he would be hiding. I mean, I'm only asking him why he goes to a particular restaurant.) Trés Bien regular (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: Um... Sir... Old Man: Yes, it's true! I was there for the young girl. Fine, so I'm a dirty, wicked, sinful old devil! Phoenix: No, no... I didn't mean it like that... Old Man: I even get one of those lousy cups of javaccino every time. For 8 dollars! All because of the serving girl! Punish me! Lock me up! Phoenix: Really, that's not what I'm here for. Old Man: You'll be the same! Another 20 years and you'll understand what it's like! You'll know how painful it is to be an old man like me! Phoenix: No, really. Listen, sir... Old Man: Stop calling me that! I have a name you know, boy! So show some respect, hmm!? I'm Victor Kudo. Phoenix: S-Sorry... Mr. Kudo. Kudo: You young ones think you know it all, don't you? Well, I'm not saying another word! I won't tell you anything more! Phoenix: (This guy was in the restaurant at the time of the incident. Which means I have to hear his testimony, one way or another!) Kudo: Hmph! Phoenix: (I don't believe this... I even broke his Psyche-Locks and everything... (Changed from [I don't believe this... I even broke his Psyche-Lock and everything...] in the original release) I guess I'll have to try to get him when he's in a better mood.) Any option (after breaking Psyche-Locks, then clearing \"Trés Bien regular\" Talk option) Phoenix: Mr. Kudo! Please! This is really important. Kudo: Hmm, ha-hmm, hmm... Hmm, pi-pi-pigeon, hmm... Kah! Phoenix: (Ack. He's really giving me the cold shoulder now. But this guy's an important witness. I can't afford to lose his testimony. There must be a way to soften him up...) Present Magatama (after clearing \"Trés Bien regular\" Talk option) Phoenix: 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS -- Trés Bien regular -- Phoenix: It's time you told me the truth. Why are you a regular at a restaurant that you dislike so much? Old Man: Isn't it obvious!? People only have one reason to go to restaurants. To eat! Phoenix: To eat? Is that the whole truth? Old Man: Wh-What do you mean!? Phoenix: I don't think you go to that restaurant for the food at all. Old Man: You insolent brat! How dare you accuse me! What proof have you got!? Phoenix: I can tell that not you nor anyone else in the world would go to that place for its food. Present Lunch Special Phoenix: Leads to: \"The proof is in the pudding. Or in this case, the lunch menu.\" Present anything else Phoenix: Phoenix: Well? Old Man: Take this! Phoenix: Argh! Old Man: You're a disgrace! An idiot! A clot! A fool! You're only worthy of this pigeon feed! Phoenix: Ow! (Looks like that evidence wasn't it!) L-Listen...

Old Man: What's your problem? You think a poor man would be better off drinking dishwater, do you? Is that it!? Phoenix: N-No. I wasn't thinking that. I was wondering if the coffee there is really that great... Old Man: No, it's not. But... But anyway! Yes! That place has free newspapers to read every day. Phoenix: Newspapers? Old Man: Exactly.

Witness, could you please describe the bottle in more concrete terms? Godot: Ha...! A bottle like this, perhaps? Kudo: Oh, there it is! That's the one! Judge: That's the bottle of potassium cyanide, I presume? Godot: So what did the accused put into the coffee? I think it's clear, don't you? Phoenix: Argh...Kudo: The man took one sip of it, looked like he was in terrible pain, and then collapsed.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: He took just one sip? Kudo: You young'uns! You waste everything!

But what about the most crucial detail of all... her face? Kudo: Kah! As if I wouldn't remember that! Godot: Godot: The witness noticed the straps on the accused's apron. He'd unlikely to make a mistake about her face. Kudo: That's right! I can even tell you the color of the ribbon in her hair. It was red! Godot: So you see, there's nothing wrong with the witness's eyesight. Judge: Hmm... Phoenix: (There's no doubt he remembers the waitress pretty well. What should I do? I get the feeling there's something more to this somehow...) Leave it Phoenix: (No, I must be imagining it. I need to find another angle with this guy.) Leads back to cross-examination Ask about the straps Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. You seem especially interested in straps. Why is that? Kudo: Wh-What? Phoenix: The ribbon in her hair, the straps on her apron. What's the fascination? Kudo: F-Fascination? Godot: Godot: People have all kinds of fetishes, Trite. We don't need to embarrass the witness. Kudo: Listen, you young upstarts! I haven't got some sick strap fetish! Judge: Hmm... Is there any relevance to the witness's unusual love of straps, Mr. Wright? Phoenix: I was just curious as to why he was so fixated on the waitress's straps... Kudo: I said I haven't got a strap fetish! How many times do I have to repeat myself!? Judge: Very well. Continue with your testimony, Mr. Kudo. And make it strapless. Kudo: *grumble grumble* Leads back to cross-examination Ask about the waitress's back Phoenix: The identifying \"features\" you described are all things you would see from the back. Kudo: So what? Phoenix: Is it possible that... ...you never saw the waitress from the front at all!? Godot: Godot: Ha...! He's got you there, gramps! Phoenix: People normally talk about facial features when they're asked to describe someone. But this witness's testimony is nothing but straps and ribbons! Kudo: Th-This is harassment! I tell you I'm not obsessed with straps or ribbons! I'm just telling you what I saw! Judge: Mr. Kudo, the court requests that you add details about any identifying features... Features you observed from the front, that is, to your testimony. Kudo: Sure, sure. Maya: The old man's testimony is getting longer and longer! Phoenix: And if I can't find a hole in it soon, it'll get even longer, I bet. Adds statement \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\"Press (after adding statement \"There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.\") Phoenix: Phoenix: You do seem to remember several details about her appearance. But what about the most crucial detail of all... her face? Kudo: Kah! As if I wouldn't remember that! Godot: Godot: The witness noticed the straps on the accused's apron. He'd unlikely to make a mistake about her face. Kudo: That's right! I can even tell you the color of the ribbon in her hair. It was red! Godot: So you see, there's nothing wrong with the witness's eyesight. Judge: Hmm...Kudo: There wasn't anything that caught my interest about her when I saw her from the front.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You didn't find anything to be distinct, but you did clearly see the witness's face, yes? Kudo: No question about it! I didn't come this far to back down now! Victor Kudo never backs down! Phoenix: (That's not the answer I was looking for, but OK...) Maya: This has turned into a matter of pride for Old Seedy now, I guess... I wonder if he really did see Maggey's face or not... Phoenix: (Like I thought, we need some concrete proof of this. Proof that the old guy didn't see the waitress clearly from the front.)Present Apron Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. I would like you to please take a look at this.\"Maya: Do you think Old Seedy really saw Maggey do it?Phoenix: Well, he probably had his eye on the waitress the whole time. That's why he was there.Maya: But he was there for the cute outfits, right? Not the waitress...Phoenix: I-I guess... (Hmm, she makes a good point though...)Maya: Hey! Did I just say something clever?Phoenix: I wonder if the waitress Mr. Kudo saw really was Maggey...Maya: That's what we have to figure out, Nick!Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. I would like you to please take a look at this.Kudo: Kah! That filthy thing would suit filth like you just perfectly. Actually, it reminds me of what my grandson looks like, just after he's done eating.Phoenix: Have you ever seen this before?Kudo: Of course I haven't! Do you think I'd forget something as dirty as that!? Hmm? Well? You half-witted clot!?Phoenix: ...Judge: ............Kudo: Wh-What!? What is it!? Ever since I said, \"you half-witted clot\", there's been an eerie silence in here.Phoenix: Mr. Kudo. This apron... ...is the apron worn by the defendant on the day of the poisoning!Kudo: Uh?Phoenix: And as you just said yourself... ...you wouldn't forget something like this. Which means, is you had really seen this apron before...Kudo: Er...Phoenix: Yes, you know what I'm getting at! You couldn't have possibly seen the waitress from the front!Kudo: ... Oops!Judge: Witness! You can't just \"oops\" your way out of this!Godot: Ha...! Well, well... Looks like we finally have a genuine trial on our hands.Phoenix: ...Godot: Listen, Trite. Here are the facts. On the day of the incident, there was only one waitress in the restaurant.Judge: That being the defendant, Ms. Maggey Byrde?Godot: Exactly. And when that one waitress put the poison into the coffee cup... ...this old guy was watching!Judge: Hmm... I hope you understand the gravity of the situation, Mr. Kudo. The fate of the defendant may rest on what you say you remember seeing.Godot: Just tell the court exactly what you saw, gramps.Kudo: You can rely on me, Captain! My noggin's in perfect working order. I can't remember a single occasion when I forgot what burger a customer wanted!Maya: He can't remember? Probably more like he messes up so many times, he's blocking it out...Judge: Very well. Let's test just how good your memory and attention to detail is, Mr. Kudo. Tell us what you remember about the victim.Witness Testimony-- About the Victim --Kudo: He was another of those pesky young types, wearing a broken pair of spectacles. He had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages! The young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well. Then the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino. The little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip.Judge: The testimony we have just heard was to test how credible the witness's memory is. It seems to me that he remembers the victim in a great deal of detail.Kudo: Oh, yes! I hate those you-know-what types who are so vague about everything!Maya: How are we going to handle this, Nick?Phoenix: We only need to do one thing. We just need to prove that the old man's memory is shot.Maya: Just trip him up, you mean? Isn't that kind of cruel?Phoenix: (I suppose... But it's what I do best.)Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- About the Victim --Kudo: He was another of those pesky young types, wearing a broken pair of spectacles.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Spectacles? Kudo: Dark glasses to you! One of the lenses was green, but the other was broken. Newfangled rubbish! That's why I remember him so well. Phoenix: (He did have some kind of lens over his left eye... But I wouldn't have called it a pair of glasses.) Judge: Hmm... He seems to have been wearing some rather modern-looking shades. Perhaps I should take to wearing some, and rival Mr. Godot's sharp appearance. Maya: Ah! We better come up with something sharp, and quick! Phoenix: (Guess I'll wait and see if I should challenge him about the \"spectacles\"...)Kudo: He had a newspaper in his right hand, and the noisy brat kept rustling its pages!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The newspaper was a sports paper, was it? Kudo: That young hooligan! I nearly asked him, \"Can't you even read without fidgeting, hmm!?\" How was I supposed to be able to read the back page with all that rustling going on!? I needed to find out if Gusten Brawn retained his championship title! Phoenix: (It was his paper, not yours! If you wanted to know so bad, why didn't you buy your own!?) Kudo: What are looking [sic] at me like that for, hmm!? How dare you judge me! Phoenix: Ow! Ooow! Maya: Gusten Brawn got beaten yesterday, by the way. Anyway...Kudo: The young man was listening to the wireless. I remember that well.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The wireless? Kudo: The decadent young rascal! In my day, it was one or the other! Read the paper, or listen to the wireless! Phoenix: (...Oh boy.) Kudo: And using an earpiece! It's selfish, that's what it is! I was straining my ears, but I couldn't catch any of it. Phoenix: (Was he that desperate to listen to the radio...?) Kudo: What are looking [sic] at me like that for, hmm!? 2 you feel sorry for me! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow!Kudo: Then the serving girl in question brought over the javaccino.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You mean the waitress, who you only saw from behind, right? Kudo: You're one of those, are you? You never let anything go, isn't that right? Phoenix: ...Maybe. Kudo: What does it matter if I saw her from the front or from behind!? My eyes don't lie! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! (I better not push it until I've got some hard evidence.)Kudo: The little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: \"His free hand\"? Kudo: Yes. Phoenix: Which hand was that? Kudo: Weren't you listening before, cloth-ears!? I said he was rustling the newspaper with his right hand, didn't I? If his free hand wasn't his right hand, then which hand was it, you moron! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! Godot: Ha...! Perhaps the great Mr. Trite has three hands! Phoenix: (Yeesh! I was only asking! No need to gang up on me and treat me like a freak!)Present Coffee Cup Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. Do you remember what you were told at the start of this testimony?\"Phoenix: (The whole point of this cross-examination is to establish just one thing... That this old guy's memory has more holes than a slice of Swiss.)Maya: I guess we just need to find a contradiction in his testimony somewhere, huh?Phoenix: (Anything will do. Even the smallest detail. We just need one mistake, and he's ours!)\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Maya Fey\nDescription: My assistant and a disciple in the Kurain Tradition of spirit channeling.\nCharacter 1\nName: Mia Fey\nDescription: Maya's older sister and my eternal mentor in life and law.

    "cot": "Let's look at the details:\n\nTestimony 4 (Kudo): \"The little fidget picked up the cup with his free hand and took a sip.\"\nFrom previous testimony, Kudo claims the victim was holding the newspaper in his right hand, so the \"free hand\" is the left hand.\n\nLet's check the Coffee Cup (Evidence 13):\nDescription: The coffee contained potassium cyanide. Covered in the victim and Maggey's fingerprints. Facing the cup, one can see a lip stain on the front, and a floral looking handle to the right.\n\nIf the victim picked up the cup with his left hand, the handle would be on the other side, which would not match the position of the cup and fingerprints, according to the crime photo (Evidence 12, but that's not what's in question here directly).\n\nBut, more decisively, if the cup's handle (floral-looking) was to the right of the lip stain, that means he picked it up with his right hand, not left! Kudo says \"free hand\" is left, but the cup position proves he used the right hand.\n\nTherefore, Kudo's memory is mistaken about which hand was holding the newspaper, or the cup, so his testimony is contradicted by the crime evidence (Coffee Cup).\n",

This court sees no reason to further prolong the trial. This case is extremely clear. I see no room for misinterpretation of the facts. I-It wasn't me! I swear it wasn't me! Judge: The evidence and testimony we have seen and heard are conclusive! The victim was alone at his table when he drank from that poisoned cup of coffee. No! You're wrong! I know what I saw...! I saw... I saw...! I saw someone else there! A man. He's the real killer! Why won't anyone believe me? Payne: Well... I'd say that pretty much wraps this case up, wouldn't you... ...Mr. Wright!? Judge: This court finds the defendant... Guilty Judge: The court is adjourned. January 6, 10:03 AMWright & Co. Law Offices Maya: Ahh! The start of the new year always makes me feel like I can take on the whole world! Phoenix: I bet it does, Maya. Maya: So! I've decided that our resolution should be... Zvarri! \"Take on the world!\" What do you think? Phoenix: Sure, whatever, Maya... But I think maybe you've had more than enough mistletoe cake. Maya: Never! You've got to eat a lot of cake during New Year's! It's practically a tradition! Like watching the fireworks on TV or playing a board game. ???: HEY, PAL! Phoenix: Detective Gumshoe... Maya: Happy New Year, Detective! Gumshoe: Uh... likewise... NOW LISTEN UP, WRIGHT! I WANNA... Maya: Here's to another fruitful year of lawyer-police cooperation! Gumshoe: Um... Yeah... Me too... ALRIGHT, PAL! YOU'VE GOT SOME EXPLAINING TO... Maya: Have you got a holiday present for me, Detective? Gumshoe: A what? Well... I, um... Here, have this. It-It's really nothing much, but... Maya: Yay! Thanks! Gumshoe: LOOK, PAL, WE NEED TO HAVE A TALK. TAKE A SEAT! Maya: Hey! What about Pearly? You haven't forgotten her present, have you? Gumshoe: Ah... N-No... I mean, yes... I mean, no... Are you doing this on purpose? Maya: Ha ha, guess I'm busted. How did you like my first practical joke of the year? Gumshoe: Very funny, pal. Now let's see how funny you think it is when I show you this! Phoenix: What is it? A magazine? Maya: Hey, I wanna see! \"Deadly Poisoning Brings Guilty Verdict. Defense Attorney Wright Trounced.\" Phoenix: Tr-Trounced!? Let me see that! \"The defense attorney gave an almost childishly amateur performance yesterday...\" What the heck is this!? Gumshoe: It's a report, pal. About you! Maya: Listen to this! \"Mr. Wright must take full responsibility for the ruling in this case.\" Gumshoe: WELL!? And don't tell me you don't remember anything about it! Phoenix: But I don't remember anything about it! When was that issue from anyway? Gumshoe: Umm... December of last year, which I guess makes it last month. Maya: Which makes it old news, you mean. Phoenix: But I wasn't involved in a poisoning case in December! Maya: Hmm, so what do you think this is all about, Nick? Gumshoe: If it wasn't you, pal, then that leaves only one possibility... Maya: No way. You don't mean... Phoenix: A pho... Maya: A phony Nick!? Phoenix: (This must be Gumshoe's idea of a joke. Guess he's starting off the year with one, too...) Magazine Clipping added to the Court Record. Gumshoe: SO!? What are you gonna do about it, pal!? Phoenix: What do you mean, what am I going to do about it? Maya: Well, it's your fault that the judge found the defendant guilty in this case! Phoenix: My fault!? How do you figure that? Maya: Because THE Phoenix Wright is super famous now! Well, maybe only sort of... Gumshoe: Yeah. See what happens when you hotshots start getting too full of yourselves? Phoenix: (But I didn't do anything wrong! ...At least, not that I can remember...) Gumshoe: You better make this right, pal. Now! And that means taking the case back to court. Got it? Maya: Sounds like we've got our first case of the new year! Let's tackle it with gusto! Phoenix: I don't know... The judge already issued a guilty verdict once in this case. It's not going to be easy to get it overturned. Maya: ... I guess that New Year's resolution is going to have to wait until next year. Gumshoe: So you're taking the case, right!? Good! I'm gonna head over to the courthouse then. After that, I'll go back to the precinct. Drop by if you need something, OK pal!? Phoenix: (I guess people are starting to know the name \"Phoenix Wright\". If a client entrusted a case to me based on my reputation... I guess I am kind of responsible. But why would someone want to impersonate me? What sort of a guy would do that?) Examine Bookshelf Phoenix: Difficult-looking legal books stand in a formidable row. They mock me. ...Actually, I've neglected them for so long that they're covered in a layer of dust. I guess I should at least pretend to read them once in a while. Charley the plant Phoenix: Charley. A quite decorative plant. He's sort of a keepsake... something to remember Mia by. Sure, the office is a mess, but I never forget to water this little fella. Desk Phoenix: It's my desk. I don't get to use it much, so it's still super neat and tidy from when Pearls cleaned it. Movie poster Phoenix: An old movie poster. Apparently, this was the first movie that made Mia cry when she saw it, a long time ago. Maya watched it recently, and said she cried all night, too! ...Which, I guess, is why it's back up on the wall. I have to check it out one of these days. Window Phoenix: There is a giant building just outside the window. It's the Gatewater Hotel, a high-class, luxury hotel. The chain is getting so rich that they bought a whole chunk of the next town over... ...and started building a huge theme park. It's going to be called \"Gatewater Land\". ...I wonder if that bellboy is going to send me a greeting card this year, too? Talk What to do Maya: So, what's our first move? Phoenix: I guess we go down to the detention center and talk-- Maya: Wait a sec, Nick. This person's behind bars because of you. Whoever it is isn't going to be jumping at the chance to meet you, right? Phoenix: Hey, hey! Let's get one thing straight. It wasn't me, it was a fake me that did this! Maya: Hmm, I wonder if he looks exactly like you... Your phony, Xin Eohp, I mean. Phoenix: (I hope not. *shudder* ...And what kind of name for an evil double is Xin Eohp anyway!?) Maya: Ah! Nick! I've got it! Phoenix: If you're going to ask whether I've got a twin brother, the answer is no. Maya: ...Spoilsport. Any ideas Maya: Did you notice Gumshoe was acting weirder than usual, or was it just me? Phoenix: What do you mean? Maya: I mean, he was really worked up. Like a guy who's just found out he's going to be a dad or something. Phoenix: Yeah, I guess he was acting kind of strange. Maya: Maybe he realized he's got strong feelings for you, Nick! Phoenix: ... Considering how we interact, I seriously doubt that, Maya... Maya: Well, if he wasn't nervous because of you... Phoenix: ...then maybe it's because of our new guilty client? Present Attorney's Badge Maya: So you've still got that badge, I see. Phoenix: Huh!? Well, I'm a lawyer, aren't I? Maya: Yeah, but I guess I just didn't think you'd keep on being one for this long. You have to admit, you've had some close brushes with death because of your job. Phoenix: (...I fail to see how being a lawyer is more dangerous than channeling dead people.) Magazine Clipping Maya: I can't believe you've got an impersonator. Phoenix: I can't either. *sigh* Maya: Aww, but look on the bright side. Only famous stars have people impersonating them! Phoenix: This isn't funny, Maya. It's not just an impersonation. This guy stole my identity! And someone may have been wrongly convicted as a result. Maya: ...Guess you should've gone into showbiz, huh, Nick? Phoenix: (...*sigh* I will never understand how your mind works, Maya.) Maya Fey profile Phoenix: So? How's your spirit medium training going? Maya: Well... I stand under the rushing waters of the shower head every day. Phoenix: ...That's called \"taking a shower\". What happened to the rushing waters of a waterfall? Maya: Well, I'm kind of taking a break... I'm having a bit of trouble right now, you know? Phoenix: (Last year's incident must still be on her mind... I haven't seen Maya train at all since that time. I think Mia said it's because Maya's at a loss these days...) Mia Fey profile Phoenix: Mia helped me out in court again last time. Maya: It's so cool that you get to meet my sis like that. Phoenix: Yeah... Maya: We mediums lose consciousness when we're channeling, so I don't get to see my sis... Phoenix: ...I never really thought about it that way. Hey! If you want to meet Mia... ...why don't we just have Pearls call her? Maya: No... I couldn't do that. I'd be too worried about her. Phoenix: (I guess Maya's got all sorts of things to think about, too. ...Despite her immaturity saying otherwise.) Godot profile Maya: So you still can't remember anything about Godot, huh? Phoenix: I already told you. I have no idea who he is, let alone why he dislikes me so much. Maya: Well he sure seems to have a problem with you for some reason. You'd better watch your back, Nick. Coffee lovers can be quite bitter. Phoenix: You're just making that up, Maya! Dick Gumshoe profile Maya: Digging up an old case that's already been ruled on... That's not like Gumshoe, is it? Phoenix: No. He barely manages to stay on top of the cases in front of him. Maya: Yeah, he's always busy, and gets dirt pay. I mean, look at that dusty old coat he wears! Phoenix: (Did you mean he \"gets paid dirt\" or do you really think they pay him in gravel?) Any other evidence Phoenix: Do you know anything about this, Maya? Maya: Hmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everything, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this object. Phoenix: (A simple yes or no, Maya... It's not as if you had to give me a dissertation...) Any other profile Phoenix: Do you know anything about this person? Maya: Hmm... Even someone as worldly-wise as me doesn't know everything about everyone, Nick. So I, the great Maya, am sad to say I can't tell you much about this individual. Phoenix: (A simple yes or no, Maya... It's not as if you had to give me a dissertation...) January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Maya: It's been ages since we came down to the precinct, huh, Nick? Phoenix: Looks like Gumshoe isn't around. Maya: He's got it so easy, leaving everyone else to do the work! Phoenix: No, he's been out there somewhere. My bet is on the courthouse. He's probably trying to arrange the retrial of this case. Maya: Guess that means we should go to the detention center and chat with our killer, huh? Phoenix: After being convicted without a fair trial, I'm not sure killer is the right label... Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Don't die running a red light. Die the old-fashioned way -- of old age!\" We have a winner! Inject a bit of humor, that's the key. Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a safety campaign. ...I guess? Desks Phoenix: These are the detectives' desks. There are computers and files on each one. Funny, they're a lot tidier than I expected. I guess the detectives don't spend a lot of time at their desks. Poster Phoenix: A poster of a female police officer... Wait, no. That's the latest \"Babes in Uniform\" calendar. My bad. Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: WHAT! Mask☆DeMasque turned up at the bank? What's he doing!? \"Hands up, you scalawags!\" \"You're under arrest!\" Hey! That's our job! Phoenix: (Looks like Ron DeLite's opted for a new career.) Detective: Quit surfing the net, Chief! Chief: S-Sorry... I was just, um... Phoenix: (Things feel pretty tense in here...) Badgers Maya: Hey, that's the police mascot, isn't it? It's so cute! Chief: That's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police force! Phoenix: So what's with the pink one? It's new, right? Maya: She's not an \"it\", Nick. She's a \"she\", right Chief? Chief: Yup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\". Maya: So one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"? Chief: You got it! They're both married. Maya: Umm... Mr. & Mrs. Badger seem to be cuffed together, Chief. Chief: You got it! That's marriage for you! Phoenix: (Whoa... A mascot that's deeper than the deepest of deep oceans...) January 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room Maya: This is so nerve-wracking, waiting to meet our new client. I wonder just what kind of person you tricked and got found guilty...? Phoenix: K-Keep it down, Maya! That kind of talk could ruin me! ???: Aaaaaaaah! How could you, Mr. Wright!? How could you do this to me!? They put me in solitary! I haven't been able to stop crying. Phoenix: A-Aren't... you... ???: Yes, I am! I am totally and utterly let down! Maya: Aah! You're... Are you...? ??? Don't pretend you don't know me! It's me, Maggey, remember!? Maggey Byrde! Phoenix: Maggey Byrde... Ah! (Maggey Byrde... She's the policewoman I defended that one time. She was accused of murdering her lover. He was a cop, too.) What are you doing in here!? Didn't I get you acquitt-- Byrde: Oh, sure! Very funny! After that fifth-rate defense job, you come in here and start making jokes!? Maya: You better hurry up and tell her what happened, Nick. Byrde: O-Oh... I see... Phoenix: So that's where we stand right now. Maya: I'm sorry you've been caught up in another murder... Byrde: My whole life has been nothing but a whirlwind of bad luck and failures. Phoenix: (I vaguely remember her saying the exact same thing last time...) Byrde: But I don't mind! What's one more disaster in my life? At least now the real Mr. Wright is here with me. I won't let the world keep me down, sir! Examine Surveillance camera Phoenix: Smile, you're on candid camera. Guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. I bet they don't get too many waitresses in here. He looks like he's getting a bit restless. Talk Maggey Byrde Maya: So, how come you're dressed like that, Maggey? Last year you looked so sharp in that police uniform. Byrde: Hmph. I was fired after that... incident last year. Maya: Oh. I'm sorry. Byrde: It's OK. I don't mind one bit. I enjoyed being on the force, but I think it was time for me to move on. Maya: So, what do you do now? Byrde: In the second act of \"The Life of Maggey Byrde\", I'm playing the role of a waitress! Maya: A waitress!? Byrde: Yes. In a French restaurant. It's a small place, but it's quite fashionable. My charming smile and shapely figure came through for me. And the owner, Mr. Armstrong, hired me straight away, sir. Phoenix: And then you got into this mess straight away, right? Byrde: Yeah, you could put it that way... What happened Byrde: This whole mess started on the 3rd of last month... And it happened at Trés Bien. Maya: \"Treh Bee-an\"...? Byrde: Yes. It's a restaurant where good service and a friendly smile are always included! Maya: Oh... Byrde: There were two men at the table, both drinking coffee. And then... One of the men slipped some poison into the victim's cup! The victim took just one sip and was gasping for air! I was so shocked, I passed out. Maya: Hey, hold on there, Maggey. Byrde: What? Maya: You keep calling the guy, \"the victim\". Didn't you know the guy who was killed? Byrde: Not at all! I'd never even seen the guy before! Maya: Oh... Phoenix: (So she wouldn't have a motive to kill him then, I guess...) And the other man, the killer. You saw him, right? Byrde: Of course! A good waitress must be attentive to the clientele. Phoenix: So, you saw the killer, but you were found guilty of the crime anyway? How come? Byrde: ......... You tell me, Mr. Wright! Phoenix: Ack! (Guess the answer to my question is \"my phony\"... Anyway, she saw the killer. Better see if I can get a description of the guy.) Guilty verdict (appears after \"What happened\") Maya: So, if you saw the murderer, why were you still convicted? Byrde: Because no one else saw. Maya: Saw what? Byrde: The other man. The one who put the poison in the victim's coffee. Everyone testified that way. Mr. Armstrong, the customer... Everyone. \"The victim was sitting alone at his table the whole time.\" Phoenix: But how's that possible? Byrde: I don't know. But nobody, not one person, would believe me, sir. Even Phoenix Wright, my one last hope for a fair trial, failed me. What a pathetic defense! My granny could've done a better job! Phoenix: Look! That wasn't me, OK? Byrde: And then! ...They found something a bit incriminating in my apron pocket. Maya: What? Byrde: A small bottle... of poison. Maya: WHAT!? P-Poison!? It was in your pocket!? Byrde: Well, I passed out when the victim collapsed. The killer must've slipped the poison into my pocket when I was unconscious. Phoenix: And no one else saw this other guy? Byrde: No, sir. That's what everyone said. But I don't see how they could've missed him... The other guy (appears after \"Guilty verdict\") Byrde: I was the one who took the coffee to the two men. Phoenix: O-Oh...? And what was your impression of them? Byrde: Well... When I first saw them, I kind of thought they might be in the music industry. Maya: In music? How come? Byrde: Well, one of them had some sort of earpiece, and an emo musician's look about him. And there was a sample CD on the table, sir. Maya: An earpiece and a sample CD, huh? Did you get a look at the CD at all? Byrde: It had a band's name written on it. I think it was \"MC\"-something. They must've been preparing for their debut, I guess. Phoenix: So it was a band's CD. Maybe a promo disc? Maya: Maybe it was \"MC Screwdriver\"! Phoenix: Get serious, Maya. Would you buy the CD of a group named that? Byrde: Nngh... What was the name of that group again...? \"MC Hacksaw...\"? No... \"MC...\" Maya: And what about the killer? What did he look like? Byrde: Well, I, um... I don't really remember. Only that he was a young man. Well-built like the victim, really. Present Attorney's Badge Byrde: That badge! Is it real? Phoenix: Of course it's real! Byrde: That's what they all say. But I've been duped before. Give it to me for a sec! Phoenix: Ah...! ...*chomp!* Maya: She... She bit into it... Byrde: And I left a few teeth marks, too! Phoenix: I can see that... Byrde: I just wish I could remember if that means it's real or a fake. Phoenix: *sigh* (I said it was real!) Magazine Clipping Phoenix: Oh, yeah. I need to ask you about this... Byrde: Hey! This article's about my case! Phoenix: Can you tell me anything about the guy who was pretending to be me? Byrde: Yes, sir! It was the morning after I'd been arrested... I met you in the visitor's room here. You were wearing one of your super-sharp suits. Phoenix: Me? Byrde: Yes, you, Mr. Wright. Phoenix: Argh... Maya: Hey, Maggey! Was my evil double Ayam here, too? Byrde: No. I don't remember a phony you, Maya. Maya: Oh... *sigh* It would've been so cool... Byrde: Then you got really worked up and passionate. \"I'm gonna get you' cleared'a dis crime!\" you said. (Changed from ['I'm gonna get you cleared of this crime!' you said.] in the original release) Phoenix: OK, I get the picture. But you've met me in person before... So how come you didn't realize that guy wasn't the real me? Byrde: ... I guess, looking back now, it was a little strange... Phoenix: Only a little? Byrde: Well, OK, so you were a bit taller than normal. And you looked a bit shady. And your voice was a bit weird. Oh, and you had this funny accent. And... Phoenix: So the guy was nothing like me, then!? Byrde: But he had your spiky hair and blue suit. Phoenix: (... Is that all it takes for someone to imitate me...?) Maya: How about everyone else in the courtroom, like the judge and the observers...? Didn't they realize he was an imposter? Byrde: Everyone had these big question marks on their faces... But it seemed that no one wanted to say anything, sir. Maya: This case just keeps getting weirder and weirder... Maya Fey profile Byrde: Thanks for your help last year! Maya: Aw, it was nothing. I'm glad we got you off the hook. Byrde: I hope you can help me out this year, too! Maya: Yeah, me too. It's be sweet if we could get that verdict overturned. Dick Gumshoe profile Byrde: Oh, Detective Gumshoe! He really looked out for me when I was on the force! Phoenix: Have you seen him recently? Byrde: No. He's never been to the restaurant. Maya: Guess he's not a fan of French cuisine, huh? He's an instant noodle type of guy, after all. Byrde: Yeah, he prefers the simple things in life. Phoenix: (...Or he's just simply too poor to afford anything else.) Maggey Byrde profile Byrde: No matter what happens, I never let anything get me down! Maya: You're always so positive, aren't you, Maggey? Byrde: Macho Maggey Byrde, they say! The early Byrde catches the worm! A Byrde in the hand! Maya: Wow! All those phrases are named after you? Byrde: And I never turn my back on anything! Maya: You're always so strong, aren't you, Maggey? Byrde: Macho Maggey Byrde, they say! I'm a tough old Byrde! Maya: \"Tough old byrde\", Nick! Hee hee! Do you get it? Phoenix: ...Yeah, I get it. Anything else Byrde: I know I used to be on the police force, sir. But I'm incarcerated, now. So I can't use my connections to help you. All I can tell you about now is info about ex-cons or the clientele of Trés Bien, sir... Maya: Aww, don't let it get you down, Maggey! After clearing all Talk options and presenting Magazine Clipping: Byrde: Mr. Wright... Do you think it's possible to get a retrial? Phoenix: Probably. The court ruled in the absence of a genuine defense attorney. So we should be able to get a retrial. Byrde: Um... Mr. Wright...? Phoenix: ? Byrde: Do you think we'll win next time? ...Sir? Phoenix: ...! Byrde: My life has been a full course meal of bad luck, complete with defeat for dessert. Since I was 6 months old, when I fell from the 9th floor of my apartment building... ...I've been hit by all sorts of vehicles, gotten sick from all sorts of foods... ...failed at almost every test I've taken, experienced almost every kind of disaster... I even landed a phony lawyer when I had the misfortune of being accused of murder. But! I will survive! Because Maggey Byrde always lives to fight another day! And one day, I'll find it! Just you wait and see, sir! I'll find that one, single moment of good luck! Maya: Argh, Xin Eohp is really gonna pay for this! Phoenix: Wh-What are you staring at me like that for...? (But Maya's right... Whoever it is that thought it was a good idea to use my name... ...and get an innocent girl convicted of murder had better watch out!) Maya: We'll find him! Don't you worry. We'll get Xin Eohp for you! Byrde: Thank you! Oh! I'll tell you where Trés Bien is then! Phoenix: Trés... Ah, right. The restaurant where the murder took place. Byrde: Yes, sir. When you go, please tell Mr. Armstrong I said hi! Maya: Sure! Alright, Nick! Let's go check out this restaurant and its food! January 6Trés Bien Maya: Wow! Look at this place. Phoenix: \"Look\"? More like \"smell\"... What is with the suffocating scent of flowers in here...? Then again, girls like that sort of thing, right? Maya: Actually, I'm not all that into it... Phoenix: ... Maya: ... No one's coming to seat us. Maybe there's no one here. Phoenix: Don't be silly, Maya. This is a restaurant, and it's open for business. HELLO! ANYONE HERE? ... I don't believe it! There really isn't anyone here! Maya: Perfect! Let's get intrusive! If there's no one here, we can take anything we want! Phoenix: (Yeah, I suppose we can...) Examine Cash register Maya: Look, it's one of those magical boxes that spits out money. Phoenix: You know, you're the only person who would ever describe a cash register in that way! Trinkets Maya: Look at all the little trinkets tucked away in here. Phoenix: I bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally. Let's see... A bouquet of flowers, some potpourri, and look! Fine bone china cups! Maya: ... I never knew you were so... cultured. Phoenix: Come on, Maya! This is common knowledge! Any Joe Schmoe knows this much! Front entrance Phoenix: It's the restaurant's front entrance. There's a sign hanging on the door written in French. It probably says, \"Open\" or \"Closed\". It must be one or the other, but I don't know which since I dunno Jacques about French. Magazine rack Maya: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Phoenix: Why don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" something, huh, Maya? Maya: Yeah. I guess I could. I'm always in my acolyte clothes, aren't I? It'd be fun to wear normal clothes every now and then. Phoenix: Hm? There's something stuffed in behind the rack. Maya: ...Looks like a sports paper to me. Hey, and look at this! Someone's scribbled a little doodle on one of the pages. \"MC Bomber\", and one, two, three, four, five zeros... A-A hundred thousand... dollars... maybe? Phoenix: I wonder what \"MC Bomber\" is supposed to be...? ! (This paper! It's from December 3rd...) This paper's from the day of the poisoning! Maya: WHAT!? Sports Paper added to the Court Record. Phoenix: (A paper from the day of the murder... This has got to be a clue! I should see if I can find out some more about this paper...) Magazine rack (subsequent times) Maya: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Phoenix: Looks like Mr. Armstrong doesn't get any newspapers. Maya: Well, it wouldn't exactly suit the feel of the place, would it? Phoenix: Why don't you try wearing something a bit more \"chic\" like in these mags, Maya? Maya: Yeah. I'd look stunning in some of those Parisian frocks, huh? Phoenix: (We found that sports paper behind this magazine rack earlier... I'd better try to find out everything I can about it...) Table Phoenix: This table's set nicely. It just needs a customer. Maya: What do you think this flower is, Nick? Phoenix: Let's see... Well, it doesn't look like a tulip, and it's not a sunflower, I don't think... Maya: Duh. Even I could've told you that. Phoenix: Well, those are the only kinds of flowers I know. Dagnabit, I'm a lawyer, not a botanist! Windows Phoenix: Wow! It's a beautiful winter wonderland out there. Maya: Really!? Cool! I love snow! Let me see! Huh? It's not white. It's not even snowing. Phoenix: Got you! I was only kidding, Maya. Maya: Nick! There are lies that are OK to tell, and lies that definitely aren't. Phoenix: (...All I did was tell an itty-bitty white lie about nonexistent white snow.) Partition Phoenix: This restaurant has partitions that separate the tables. When you're seated at a table, you can only see the tables to your right or left. Crime scene Phoenix: This must be the table where the murder occurred. Maya: I guess so, with all this police tape all around it. Phoenix: And that stain must be from the poisoned coffee. Don't go licking the tablecloth, OK, Maya? Maya: Why would I lick it? I'm not a cat, you know! Phoenix: (Then why can I picture you doing just that?) Wright & Co. Law Offices Present Sports Paper Maya: Hmm... \"MC Bomber\"... Phoenix: And don't forget the \"100,000\", too. Maya: There's something about that name, \"MC Bomber\". Phoenix: Yeah, It's a pretty unusual name. Phoenix: And don't forget the \"100,000\", too. Maya: Everyone's worried about bombs these days, I guess. Phoenix: I'm not sure that has any bearing on anything related to this case...) Maya: Anyway, we should really look into this some more! Maggey Byrde profile Maya: This is Maggey's second time as a murder suspect, huh? Phoenix: Yeah. The first time was a little over a year ago... She was on the police force back then. Maya: Wasn't she working under Gumshoe? That does it, Nick! We're gonna get her off the hook or I'll give up hamburgers! Detention Center Present Sports Paper Byrde: Oh! A sports paper. Let's see, let's see... Did Gutsen Brawn manage to defend his heavyweight title? Phoenix: Sorry, Maggey. That paper is actually a month old... It's from the day of the murder... Maya: And Gutsen got knocked out yesterday, I'm afraid. Byrde: Oh, no... Phoenix: I found this paper in the magazine rack at Trés Bien. Byrde: Really? That's strange... Trés Bien doesn't get newspapers. Mr. Armstrong says he's not really fond of them. Maya: Then maybe one of the customers left it behind? Phoenix: Anyway, what I want you to take a look at is this scribble here. Byrde: Ah-ha! That's it, sir! \"MC Bomber\"! That was the name that was written on the CD! Phoenix: (Just as I thought...) Maya: I guess it wasn't \"MC Screwdriver\" after all, huh... Byrde: So, that $100,000 must be a down payment for a record deal, right? Maya: If someone gave me $100,000, I'd sing for sure! \"The Master of Kurain\" or \"The Spirit Song\" or even \"Maya's Theme\"! Phoenix: Um, OK, Maya... So, if the sample CD was on the victim's table... That means this newspaper may have belonged to the victim! Maya: You're right! Phoenix: (So the victim left this behind on the day of the murder, huh...) Maya: I think we better step up the investigation, don't you Nick? After presenting Sports Paper in Detention Center - Visitor's Room: January 6Trés Bien ???: Oh là là! Bon-JOUR! Welcome to la Trés Bien! Maya: Oh! Hel... lo... ... Phoenix: (What happened to Maya? She's frozen stiff...) ???: Bienvenue! Welcome to my petite restauranté! Maya: Huh? \"Bee Avenue\"? ???: Oh, non, my petite chulip! Maya: Huh? Me? ???: Look at z'is face! Like la kitten rejected by its own mother. You are fatigued, non? Alors! You need z'is! An aromatic bath oil mélange of la néroli and la rose. My personal recommendation! Maya: You think I need what...? ???: Oui, oui! Just add a couple of drops of z'is mixture to la bath water, and voilá! It will soothe your body and your mind. It's simply fantastique! Maya: Really? ???: And for la monsieur! Phoenix: Who? Me? ???: Look at z'at face! Like la puppy rejected by life itself! You are fatigued, non? For you, monsieur, I recommend z'is! Oil of bergamot. And maybe a 'int of... Oui, oui! I will add la peppermint and la clary sage for a fragrance exceptionnel! Such an invigorating recipe will bring out your delicious beauty, monsieur! Phoenix: M-My beauty!? ???: Alors. If you will be seated, I will bring you la special menu of z'e day! Phoenix: Actually, we're not here to eat. We're lawyers. ???: Mais bien sûr! I know z'is already, monsieur. You are la Phoenix Wright, non? Phoenix: Um, yes... You know me? ???: Mais, oui oui! I never forget a man who flirts wiz me! Especially in court! Maya: I guess he was cross-examined by our mysterious Xin Eohp... Phoenix: It looks like everyone to do with this case knows who \"I\" am already. Maya: I wonder what sort of impression Xin Eohp's been leaving on people, don't you? Armstrong: Allow me to introduce myself to you again. I am Jean Armstrong. Enchanté! Talk Trés Bien Maya: So what does \"Trés Bien\" mean? I know \"trés\". That means \"three\", right? Armstrong: Non, non, non! \"Trés Bien\" is Français! In English, you would say, \"Very Good\". Maya: Oh. Very good... Armstrong: Oui, exactement! La atmosphere is trés bien, and la cuisine is trés bien! Phoenix: (If the food's good, why aren't there any customers in here?) Armstrong: My cuisine is not for all. Some people, z'ey do not appreciate la haute cuisine. Phoenix: (I thought everyone liked hot cuisine...) Armstrong: Since I 'ave lost Maggey, I do not 'ave enough 'ands. Phoenix: So, you're running this place on your own now? Armstrong: Oui. For la moment. No one 'as answered my advertisement. Oh, poor moi! Phoenix: (... Please don't eyeball me while you say that.) Armstrong: I am la chef. I am la manager. I am also a trained aromatherapist. Maya: A roaming what? Armstrong: A practitioner d'aromatherapy. La art of soothing la soul wiz z'e delicate floral aromas. Phoenix: (Delicate? The smell coming from that bottle earlier was anything but...) What happened Phoenix: So, could you tell me what you know about the incident? Armstrong: Bien. It makes me sad to remember it, yet I remember it so well. More z'an a month 'as passed since it 'appened. Phoenix: (Yeah, I guess it's been about a month since Maggey's sentencing...) Armstrong: So. It was z'e third of last month. Just after one in z'e afternoon. A man who was in 'ere for a coffee suddenly became ill. Phoenix: Because of the poison in his coffee? Armstrong: Z'at is la truth as I know it. It was Maggey who took 'is drink to 'im. I was in la kitchen. I 'eard z'e sound of someone collapsing. When I came out to see what it was, 'e was already slumped in 'is chair. Maya: He was dead? Armstrong: Mon dieu! Oui! 'E was dead! Maggey 'ad passed out also. Phoenix: And this man who died... Was he alone? Armstrong: Oui, monsieur. All alone. I know z'at Maggey said z'ere was someone else, but... Maya: I see... Armstrong: La police, z'ey asked me many times. \"Are you sure z'ere was no one else at z'e table?\" z'ey asked. But I am not z'e only one. La old man said z'e same thing. Phoenix: Old man? What old man? Old man (appears after \"What happened\") Phoenix: Um... So who is the old man that you mentioned? Armstrong: At z'e time of la murder, z'ere was another customer in 'ere. Maya: What!? Someone else saw it? Armstrong: Mais, oui! As usual, 'e came alone z'at day. At z'e time of la murder, 'e was 'ere. 'E saw it, too. But 'e said z'e same thing, z'at z'ere was no one else at la victim's table. Maya: But Maggey swears there were two people! Armstrong: Mais, mademoiselle. La lawyer, 'e could not prove z'is, non? Phoenix: About the lawyer. That was me, I suppose? Armstrong: Mais bien sûr! Phoenix: ... Wow! He's the first person who's said it wasn't me. Maya: Don't kid yourself, Nick! Hmph. Now who's the one making stuff up!? Maggey's motive (appears after presenting Maggey Byrde profile) Phoenix: When Maggey took the coffee over to the victim... ...did anything happen? Armstrong: Ou... Oui. I-I suppose you could say so. Phoenix: So what happened? Armstrong: Non. It was, er... It was nothing. Maya: Look, Maggey says she didn't even know the guy! But she's still been indicted for murder! The prosecution must have come up with some kind of motive! Armstrong: Oui. It is true. Phoenix: If there was anything at all between Maggey and the victim, it could be relevant. Maya: So please! Tell us anything you know. 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (Psyche-Locks!?) (Changed from [A Psyche-Lock!?] in the original release) Maya: No way! What are we going to do, Nick? Phoenix: We'll just have to remov... WHAT THE!? Maya: Wh-What's wrong? Phoenix: The Magatama... It's gone! Maya: Huh? Phoenix: I had it in my pocket, but... It has vanished into thin air! Maya: WHAT!? Phoenix: (But I could see the Psyche-Locks. (Changed from [But I could see the Psyche-Lock.] in the original release) Maybe that means the Magatama's nearby...?) Maggey's motive (subsequent times) Phoenix: Maggey wouldn't just have put poison in the coffee of some guy she didn't even know. If she's really guilty, there must have been something between her and the victim. 3 PSYCHE LOCKS Armstrong: N-Non. It was nothing. I am sure. Qué será, será. Perhaps Maggey 'ad another reason. Phoenix: (What's Maggey's motive got to do with this chef? Why is he hiding things from me? And another thing... Where did I drop the Magatama? The fact that I can see the lock [sic] must mean it's nearby.) Maya: I only loaned it to you, you know. So you better find it, Nick! OK? Phoenix: (...And here I thought it was mine to keep!) Present Attorney's Badge Armstrong: Please, monsieur. Z'ere is no need to show me z'at. You are Mon. Phoenix Wright, z'e worst defense lawyer in town. Phoenix: (I think I can imagine how he formed this completely wrong impression of me...) Um, the last time we met, did I show you this badge? Armstrong: Oui. You flashed it to everyone in la restaurant! Maya: Looks like Xin Eohp is a bigger fan of flashing stuff than you are, Nick! Magazine Clipping Armstrong: I am not a lawyer myself. I do not wish to speak out of turn. But your defense in court z'at day was a little, how you say, \"lacking\", per'aps? Phoenix: *sigh* Armstrong: Even a Frenchman who cannot speak any English could 'ave done a better job! You were very cool, though. Oh, oui, oui! So 'andsome. Maya: Wow, I wonder just how bad the defense could've been... Armstrong: Every time you opened your mouth, z'e 'ole courthouse stirred. Phoenix: (Oh, man. That is something I don't want to imagine...) Sports Paper Phoenix: We found this sports paper in the magazine rack here. Armstrong: One of my customers must 'ave left it behind. Maya: Do you have any idea which customer it was? Armstrong: Z'e only ideas I 'ave, mademoiselle, I save for my kitchen! Maya Fey profile Armstrong: Oh là, là! You 'ave such a pretty smile, my petite chulip! Maya: Who, me? Armstrong: Oui. La smile is the most important thing for us girls, n'est-ce pas? Maya: Um... Sure! Armstrong: If you want a job 'ere, it is yours, precious! Mia Fey profile Armstrong: Mon dieu! What beauty! Maya: That's my sister! Armstrong: Ah, oui? Another delight! But you 'ave a certain je ne sais quois z'at I do not sense from your sister. Maya: I do? Armstrong: So throw your head 'ead 'igh! Thrust out your feminine features! Do not lose 'eart, ma fille! You are a woman! A woman extraordinaire! Maya: Do I look like I need cheering up or something? Maggey Byrde profile Armstrong: Maggey was a policewoman once, n'est-ce pas? Phoenix: Yes. But she had to quit for, um, reasons beyond her control. Armstrong: Oui, oui. She was la suspect in la murder investigation, non? Maya: Oh... You know about that? Armstrong: Z'at is why I gave to 'er la perfume for la 'appiness. Phoenix: Happiness perfume? Armstrong: Oui. Blended from bergamot, like I 'ave given to you before. Phoenix: But she's been arrested again. And found guilty this time. Armstrong: Z'is is true. 'Er natural aroma of un'appiness must 'ave been very strong. Phoenix: (Just admit it! Your perfume doesn't work!) Armstrong: I am not surprised she was la prime suspect. After something like z'at took place before my very eyes. Maya: Something like what? Phoenix: (What's this guy talking about!?) Maya: Does this mean... Maggey did have a motive? Phoenix: We've got to ask this guy for more info, stat! Jean Armstrong profile Armstrong: It is 'ard to imagine, I know, but I was an apprentice for five years in la gay Paris. Maya: Wow! In Paris!? Armstrong: It was something la chef z'ere said to me z'at made me decide to open my own restaurant. Phoenix: What was it? Armstrong: Z'at awful man said to me, \"You must train for another ten years!\" Oh! It was such a shock! So unexpected! But you would 'ave to be a fool to do z'is, non? Anything else Phoenix: Um, about this... Armstrong: Félicitations! Mais... qu'est-ce que c'est? Phoenix: Ack! Um... Je... Je no comprehend... Maya: Nick! Don't just make something up! After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: Um, Mr. Armstrong... Could I just confirm something with you again? The table where the victim was sitting... Was anyone else sitting there? Armstrong: ... Z'at is a question you will 'ave to ask 'im yourselves. Maya: Huh? \"'Im\"? Armstrong: La old man spends all of 'is time dans la parc. Phoenix: La p-parc? Oh, a park? What park's that? Armstrong: Behind la restaurant. It is called, \"Vitamin Square\". Maya: Thank you! Armstrong: Je vous en prie, my dear! Maya: Let's go check out this Vitamin Square right now, Nick! January 6Vitamin Square Maya: So this is Vitamin Square. Phoenix: Yeah. I see where they get the name from now. The fruits scream \"VITAMINS!\" at you. Maya: Hey, Nick! That's the guy, right? Isn't that the old man Mr. Armstrong was talking about? Phoenix: That grouchy-looking grandpa? Maya: He's throwing seeds out for the pigeons. Phoenix: Maya, he's not throwing seeds for them, he's throwing seeds AT them! Old Man: ... Phoenix: (Ugh... My grumpiness-threat level has just been raised to red...) Examine Sandbox Maya: I used to love sandboxes like you wouldn't believe! Phoenix: Really? You? Maya: Sure. Finding iron filings in the sand with a magnet was my favorite thing to do. Phoenix: Iron filings? Wow... That's too exciting for words. Maya: It was my ambition to collect every single shred of iron in the sandbox. I was such a kid back then! Phoenix: So, did you manage to get all the iron? Maya: No, I never did. I think I came close, though. Come to think of it, I still have all the iron filings I found way back when. You want them? Phoenix: No. Fruit attractions Maya: This place is so fruity! Phoenix: That's not a bad thing. Besides, I love apples. They're among my favorites. Maya: Then that apple slide is perfect for you! Phoenix: ... And what is so \"perfect\" about it? Maya: Oh come on. Don't be a stick in the mud! Slide down it a few times. Go on! Woo! Phoenix: No way! I'd get covered in sand if I slid down that slide. Anyone can see that. Maya: Yeah, you're right. Otherwise, I'd give it a try, too. Pigeons Maya: Hey, look. Pigeons! Phoenix: Yeah. And heaps of them, too. Maya: Did you know that pigeons are a symbol of peace? Phoenix: That's a dove, not a pigeon. Maya: ... Poor things. Just because they're gray means they can't be symbols of peace and harmony? Phoenix: You're over-thinking this one by just a smidge, Maya. Magazine on orange-themed seat Maya: Ooh, there's a magazine here. Phoenix: It's a magazine full of job listings. Old Man: You disgusting rogue, picking up something someone else threw away! Phoenix: \"Threw away\"? Did you throw this away? Are you looking for a job? Old Man: Kah! That's none of your business! Phoenix: Sorry! I guess I'll take the magazine with me then. Old Man: I don't want anyone else having it! Give it back! Phoenix: (Too bad. Now that you want it so bad, I don't want to give it up!) Job Listings added to the Court Record. Old Man: Hey! That's mine! Closer orange-themed seat (after examining magazine on orange-themed seat) Maya: Looking at this orange reminds me... Phoenix: Of what? Maya: That you're supposed to eat a lot of them to ward off colds in the winter. You can't have fun during the holidays if you're sick in bed, you know. Phoenix: You don't have to tell me twice. Talk What you saw Phoenix: Um... Excuse me. Old Man: ... Phoenix: Would you mind if I had a word with you? Old Man: Yes! Phoenix: I just want to ask you a couple of questions... Old Man: What's the matter with you!? Can't you see I'm busy? So you don't like my seeds, eh, pigeons!? Phoenix: (He's really chucking those seeds at them! That's got to hurt!) Old Man: Go on! Eat this! Phoenix: (*sigh*) Maggey Byrde Phoenix: Excuse me, sir. Can I ask you about Maggey Byrde? Old Man: I don't know any Maggey Byrde! Maya: Yes, you do. Maggey. The waitress at Trés Bien. Old Man: Kah! It's a disgrace, I tell you. An utter disgrace! Maya: A disgrace? Old Man: An innocent young girl revealing herself like that! Phoenix: Revealing!? You mean her uniform? Old Man: The youth of today! They don't have any shame! No shame, I tell you! Not one ounce! Whatever happened to the old bushido values of Japan, like honor and modesty? Maya: What about me? I'm not wearing anything revealing. Old Man: You!? Your problem is you lack any sense of grace! Maya: Talk about hitting a girl where it hurts... Trés Bien Phoenix: Do you go to Trés Bien a lot? Old Man: Hmph! That miserable excuse for a restaurant? That garbage they serve in there's not food. Where's the sushi? The tempura? The rice!? Phoenix: Trés Bien is a French restaurant, sir... Old Man: Where do you think we are, boy? In Paris!? I want real food, not those snooty snacks! And what about those shameless girls!? Phoenix: You mean the waitresses? Old Man: You can see all the way up to their... their... Yes! The waitresses! They're practically naked! It's a disgrace, isn't it? Well, isn't it!? Phoenix: Listen, it's not my restaurant. Old Man: Kah! It's a miserable excuse for a restaurant, that place! Miserable! Phoenix: (He certainly knows the place. He must be a regular! But if he hates it so much, why does he keep going?) Trés Bien regular (appears after \"Trés Bien\") Maya: Are you a regular at that restaurant, sir? Old Man: ... Maya: It's just, if you dislike it so much, why would you keep going there? Old Man: ... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: There you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha! Take that! Maya: He must be hiding something, right? Phoenix: If he is, I should be able to see a Psyche-Lock... Oh, wait... I don't exactly have the Magatama right now, huh... Maya: Remember, Nick. That Magatama is only on loan. You better find it or else! Phoenix: (If Pearls ever gets wind of this, I'm going to be in a world of pain...) Present Anything Phoenix: Um, excuse me, sir. Could I just ask you about this... Old Man: ... Hmm, ha-hmm, hmm... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: Here you go, boy! How does some pigeon feed sound to you!? Phoenix: (This wasn't exactly what I was hoping to get out of this guy...) Detention Center Present Job Listings Maya: Um, Maggey... Byrde: Oh, are you looking for some part-time work, Maya? Why don't you take a job at the restaurant? I bet Mr. Armstrong would hire you. Maya: Really? Me? Byrde: It's pretty cool being a waitress, you know. And in the kitchen, you'll get to see all of the chef's greatest secrets! Maya: What secrets...? Byrde: You can't make it obvious, but just spy on him for a bit. You'll see. It's interesting. Maya: Wow! I can't wait to get my apron on now! Phoenix: Yeah, he has a pretty intense aroma, too. Maya: So did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...? Byrde: Apparently not. Well, he's in the kitchen all the time, so I guess it's possible that he didn't. Jean Armstrong profile Byrde: Oh, so you met the owner, Mr. Armstrong! Phoenix: He's, um... Oh, how can I put this... pretty unique, huh? Byrde: He has a really intense aura. As a chef and as a person. Phoenix: Yeah, he has a pretty intense aroma, too. Maya: So did Mr. Armstrong really not see the killer...? Byrde: Apparently not. Well, he's in the kitchen all the time, so I guess it's possible that he didn't. Trés Bien Examine Cash register (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It's really tight behind the cash register counter. Can Mr. Armstrong even get in there? And if he got in... could he get out again? Trinkets (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: There's a bunch of little trinkets on a shelf by the door. I bet Mr. Armstrong collected all of these personally. Magazine rack (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It's a rack full of fashion magazines. And they're all in French. Ugh. All the clothes in these are absolutely atrocious! ...Some of them have been circled in red. ... I really hope Mr. Armstrong is not thinking of buying those. Table (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: Mr. Armstrong must be a pretty big neat-freak. He already has this table ready to go. Now if only the food in this place was edible... Windows (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: It looks pretty cold out there on the streets. Peaceful, though. It's nice that people can take it easy after the holiday rush. Crime scene (after presenting Job Listings) Phoenix: This must be the table where the poisoning occurred. The stain tells the story well. The whole area is still cordoned off with police tape. I guess it must still be under investigation. Present Job Listings Armstrong: Mademoiselle! Maya: Y-Yes? Armstrong: Are you looking for la job? Maya: What!? N-No, no. I was just... Armstrong: Let me see. Your style is un peu différent, but you 'ave a good face. Maya: ...Different? Armstrong: Félicitations! You 'ave passed! I will 'ire you! Bien! Come wiz me. I will teach you everyz'ing I know! Maya: N-Nick! HEEEEEELP! Phoenix: (I don't know whether to laugh or feel bad for Maya... Maybe I should do both...?) Vitamin Square Examine Sandbox Phoenix: When I think back to when I was young... ...I wonder what I found so great about playing in a sandbox. Maybe I'll come back here in the middle of the night one of these days to relive it. ... On second thought, being arrested by Gumshoe would be too embarrassing to bear. Fruit attractions Phoenix: You don't see many parks like this anymore. What a great place for kids to play. But that old man's the only one here, chucking his seeds at the pigeons. Pigeons Phoenix: The pigeons are so busy pecking at the seeds, they don't notice anything else. Seeing those birds eat with such intense focus... ...reminds me of Maya when she's scarfing down a burger. Closer orange-themed seat Phoenix: This is where I found that job listings magazine before. A guy like me carrying around a magazine like that kind of gives the wrong impression. I guess I better give it back to that old man once this investigation's over. Talk Maggey Byrde Phoenix: Excuse me, sir. Can I ask you about Maggey Byrde? Old Man: I don't know any Maggey Byrde! Phoenix: Yes, you do. You know, the waitress at Trés Bien. Old Man: Hmph! If you ask me It's a disgrace! Th-That's what it is! An innocent young girl revealing herself like that! Phoenix: So, you didn't like that kind of thing, then? Old Man: ... Wh-What are you trying to say about me, boy!? Explain yourself! Phoenix: Um, nothing! I'm not saying anything about you... Old Man: I know your kind! You young ones with your spiky hair and your fancy suits! That heads of yours is over-flowing with filthy ideas! Phoenix: (...I know someone who needs to learn some stress management.) Old Man: Get out of here, you young brat! Trés Bien regular Phoenix: So, you are a regular at that restaurant, right, sir? Old Man: ... Phoenix: You're always complaining about the place, so why do you go there? Old Man: ... Phoenix: Sir? Old Man: There you are, you filthy pigeons! You want food? Ha-ha! Take that! Phoenix: (Something's not right about this guy... But If he's hiding something, I should be able to see a Psyche-Lock.) Oh, wait... (I don't exactly have the Magatama right now, huh... I need to find it before I can get anywhere with this old man.) After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Detention CenterVisitor's Room Phoenix: Looks like they have Maggey in questioning. I guess I've asked her pretty much everything... I'll come back if there's anything else I need to ask her later. Examine Guard Phoenix: This guard monitors the visitor's room. There's nothing for him to do right now, so he's catching some vertical z's. After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Wright & Co. Law Offices Phoenix: Poor Maya. It looks like Mr. Armstrong's really taken a shine to her. I suppose I'll just have to let her work at the restaurant for a while. I'll go pick her up from Trés Bien once things have cooled off. After presenting Job Listings in Trés Bien: January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Gumshoe: Well, pal!? Have you found the evidence yet!? The one that's gonna find her innocent!? Phoenix: Um, no. Not yet. We've only just started our investigation. Gumshoe: Well, whatever you need to know, I'll give you the dirt on it. I'm putting off all my other cases for now, pal! Phoenix: (Gumshoe's really fired up about this...) Gumshoe: Oh, yeah! One more thing! The retrial's been approved. Court's sitting at 10 AM tomorrow. And Godot's gonna be the prosecutor... Phoenix: (Oh. ... Him.) Gumshoe: Now, listen up, pal! If Maggey's found guilty again... Phoenix: Y-Yes...? Gumshoe: Um... I'll... I'll make sure you get locked up good for it, got it!? Examine Detective on left Phoenix: That must be one of the detectives. He's mumbling something to himself. Detective: \"Hitting the gas is like hitting the fast-forward button on your life.\" No. That's too obscure. You don't really get the \"you'll die before your time\" idea. I need something more direct. Something a bit more light-hearted. Something like, \"Hitting the gas is your passport to paradise!\" Phoenix: ... He must be coming up with slogans for a safety campaign. ...I guess? Chief Phoenix: This must be the chief of the detectives here. He's glued to his computer screen. Chief: WHAT!? Poisoned coffee waitress gets a retrial!? I knew it! I knew there was something funny about the taste of this coffee! OK! Who brought me this coffee today? Hands up! Phoenix: (Yeesh! Have a little faith in your subordinates!) Detective: Quit surfing the net, Chief! Chief: S-Sorry... I was just, um... Phoenix: (Things feel pretty tense in here...) Badgers Phoenix: No matter what, whenever I come here, that mascot's there to greet me. Chief: You got that right. That's the \"Blue Badger\". It was my idea! I made it! And now, it's the national symbol of the police force! Phoenix: So what's with the pink one? It's new, right? Chief: Yup. Meet the \"Pink Badger\". Phoenix: So one's called \"Blue\", and the other's called \"Pink\", but they're both called \"Badger\"? Chief: You got it! They're married. Phoenix: (So should I expect to see Baby Badger next time I'm here...?) Talk Maggey Byrde Phoenix: So the guilty party was Maggey Byrde, huh? Gumshoe: Yeah... Phoenix: Back when she was on the police force... ...you were her mentor when she was a rookie, right? Gumshoe: Yeah, I kept a close eye on her. I-I mean, not too close. You know. Phoenix: ... Gumshoe: ...... ......... Hey, what's with the funny looks, pal? I was with her... It wasn't anything like... Look! Sure, I was her boss when she was doing her training. But that was it. Nothing happened. Phoenix: (Gumshoe sure is sweating up a storm over nothing... ...Ah, so that's it! Our big ol' Gumshoe has a little ol' crush on Maggey!) Gumshoe: I... I don't like her or anything! I... I was... Aaaargh! Phoenix: (Note to self: Gossip with Maya about this later!) Gumshoe: Look, pal! Don't tell anyone, OK!? You've gotta keep it a secret, got it!? Phoenix: S-Sure... And would you mind not guessing what I'm thinking all the time? Gumshoe: Hey, tell your face, pal, not me. You'd have to be blind not to see what's on your mind. The victim Phoenix: So I was wondering... Could you fill me in on the victim? Gumshoe: Glen Elg, he was a computer programmer. Phoenix: I see. A programmer... Gumshoe: He was just a regular Joe working for a small-time computer firm. Maggey never had any contact with the guy before that day. ...And all she did was take him his coffee on the day of the murder, pal. Phoenix: (Yeah, Maggey also claimed to have never seen the guy before...) Did the victim go to the restaurant often? Gumshoe: Not according to the chef. Said it was the first time he'd seen the guy. Phoenix: (A programmer... and a first-time customer at that...) (Changed from [A programmer... and a first-time customer...] in the original release) What possible reason could Maggey have had to kill a guy like that? Gumshoe: That's what I thought. But a motive was still somehow established in her trial. Phoenix: You're kidding! What was her supposed \"motive\"? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal. I'm real busy. I haven't even got enough time to sift through these papers. Look into it yourself, OK? Phoenix: (What could this motive have been...?) The investigation Gumshoe: This isn't really a proper investigation. I'm kind of working on it by myself. Phoenix: O-Oh, that's right... Gumshoe: The judge already ruled on the case, and all the evidence is in already. The only problem is with Maggey's testimony. Phoenix: Yeah... Doesn't sound very good for us, huh? Gumshoe: Look, pal. I've got a mountain of papers on this case to look over before tomorrow. So I'm just gonna say this... Maggey Byrde's no liar. She's... She's... OK, so she's a bit out there, and a bit off base sometimes. But she was a good cop. Phoenix: (That's not exactly complimentary, you know!) So what do you think really happened? And just how contradictory is her testimony? Contradictions (appears after \"The investigation\") Gumshoe: The biggest problem with Maggey's testimony is the number of people at the table. Phoenix: Yeah. My thoughts exactly. Maggey still insists there was another guy sitting with the victim. Gumshoe: Right. But get this... Everyone else in the place says the guy was alone. Even the chef. And then there's that CD... Phoenix: (CD? Oh, yeah. She did mention something about a CD...) Byrde: And there was a sample CD on the table, sir. Gumshoe: But our guys turned that place upside down. There was no CD. Phoenix: What? Gumshoe: Not on the table. Not anywhere in the whole restaurant, pal. Phoenix: But didn't Maggey say the victim was wearing an earpiece, too? Gumshoe: Yeah, but that was for the portable radio in the front pocket of his hoodie. Phoenix: A radio? He didn't have a CD player? Gumshoe: You got it. Your phony never explained that contradiction at all. Phoenix: (Come to think of it... The owner of Trés Bien didn't mention that CD either. I don't know why, but I get the feeling Mr. Armstrong's got something to hide...) The charming chef (appears after presenting Jean Armstrong profile) Phoenix: So what exactly is it that caught your attention about the chef at Trés Bien? Gumshoe: It's, um... kind of hard to say... The guy's probably not even connected with the case anyway... Phoenix: Hey, come on, Detective. Didn't you say you'd give me the dirt on anything? Gumshoe: Well, this sort of stuff is kinda... unimportant, gossipy stuff, you know pal? Look, how about this? You go to Trés Bien and investigate the place yourself. And if you find out anything suspicious about the guy... you report back to me, OK? Phoenix: Um... Don't suppose I get a choice in this, huh? (Guess I better find out more about the chef and Trés Bien; then report back to Gumshoe.) Present Attorney's Badge Gumshoe: Is that thing real, pal? Phoenix: Why does everybody keep asking me that? Gumshoe: I wonder what this phony of yours is like... Phoenix: He had Maggey found guilty of murder. Doesn't that tell you? (I've got to track this creep down!) Magazine Clipping Gumshoe: I wasn't at the trial myself. But I asked this one detective I know how your defense was. Phoenix: And what did he say? Gumshoe: He started off by saying, \"I'm at a complete loss for words...\" But he must have found some quick because he went on about how bad you were for an hour. Phoenix: But... Gumshoe: He said you sucked so much, it seemed like you were trying to get Maggey found guilty! Phoenix: (It looked like I was \"trying to get Maggey found guilty\"...?) Sports Paper Gumshoe: What's that? A sports paper? Phoenix: Yeah. I found it in the magazine rack at Trés Bien. Gumshoe: It's dated the same day as the murder. You may be onto something here. Phoenix: And take a look at this. See this writing here? Gumshoe: \"MC Bomber\"... Hey! Phoenix: What is it? Gumshoe: I've heard that name somewhere before. Yeah, \"MC Bomber\"... Phoenix: (Wow, he actually seems to be thinking for once!) Gumshoe: Ack, it's no good. I can't remember... Phoenix: (...And he goes back to being the Gumshoe we all know and love.) Gumshoe: Hey, pal. I'm gonna borrow this paper for a bit, OK? I wanna get a handwriting analysis done on this scribble. Phoenix: (Handwriting, huh? It'd be good to know more about that, in any case...) Gumshoe: Thanks, pal! I bet this'll turn out to be interesting clue! Sports Paper given to Detective Gumshoe. Maya Fey profile Gumshoe: Hey! So how come she's not with you today? Phoenix: She's working down at the restaurant right now. Gumshoe: Working, huh? Yeah, it's tough being broke. I would know. Phoenix: Um... OK...? Gumshoe: Next time I see her, I'll show her how to make the world's best instant noodles. We low earners have to stick together! It's the only way! Phoenix: (Um... Why is he shaking my hand with such enthusiasm...?) Mia Fey profile Gumshoe: She cross-examined me once, you know. Phoenix: What? Mia did? Gumshoe: Yeah. That was us. The big guns locking horns. Witness versus lawyer! It was a battle of cunning tactics and tricks. Phoenix: (But the witness isn't supposed to play any tricks...) Gumshoe: I can't believe she's gone... Godot profile Gumshoe: That's the guy who's gonna be the prosecutor in Maggey's retrial tomorrow. Phoenix: O-Oh, really? Gumshoe: He was working on a bunch of more important cases at the moment... ...but he canceled them all just so he could take you on, pal. Phoenix: (Why's that guy so determined to see me fail?) Gumshoe: You sure attract a lot of attention, huh? Too bad it's all the wrong kind. Dick Gumshoe profile Gumshoe: I'm such a loser. I had high hopes for Maggey. I was gonna make her the best detective there ever was. But then all the sudden she was charged with murder and arrested. I never saw it coming. I never imagined they'd find her guilty. I hate myself for not being able to do anything. Phoenix: It's OK, Detective Gumshoe. We still have a chance to make this right. Gumshoe: ... You know what? You're not such a bad guy after all, pal. Maggey Byrde profile Phoenix: Have you gone to see Maggey? Gumshoe: Of course I have! But I... I wasn't much good at consoling her. I'm... I'm not very good with words. Phoenix: Oh... Gumshoe: Yeah. I guess I must've looked a bit down. Maggey was really supportive of me. It was great to have someone to talk to. Phoenix: (Did he go for her, or for himself...?) Jean Armstrong profile Gumshoe: The chef of Trés Bien, huh? You know what that chef said to me? \"Oh là là! Your body is full of la toxins.\" And then he gave me this bottle. Phoenix: What's in it? Gumshoe: I don't know. The label says, \"Juniper\". I'm under orders to put a few drops of it in my bath every day. Phoenix: Under orders? Old Man: Yeah. You know, there's something about the lady... I mean, guy. Phoenix: Huh!? You can't stop thinking about him!? Gumshoe: Not like that, pal! Gimme a break! He's not my type. I mean, I can't stop thinking that he's involved with this case somehow! Phoenix: (Sounds like he knows a little something more about our charming chef.) Anything else Phoenix: What do you make of this...? Gumshoe: Sorry, pal. All I can think about is Maggey at the moment. ... ...... N-No! I didn't mean it like that! I meant... Phoenix: (You don't have to explain... Really...) After clearing all Talk options and presenting Sports Paper in Police Station - Criminal Affairs Dept.: January 6Trés Bien Phoenix: The scent of flowers sure is strong. It's almost making me dizzy... Oh, um... Hello. (Who was that just now? A customer? She had sort of a dark aura about her...) ???: Ah! Welcome! Bee avenue! Phoenix: (Wow. What a cute voice.) Maya: Oh, it's just you, Nick. Phoenix: M-Maya! Maya: Well? How do I look? Phoenix: ... Maybe you should quit being a spirit medium... Maya: Maybe. But it's kind of boring being a waitress. I mean, you're my first ever customer. Phoenix: (Then who was that woman I just saw?) Maya: Oh, oh! Since you're here, you might as well have something to eat! Phoenix: ... I am kind of hungry, actually. Talk Waitress Phoenix: So, how do you like your new job, Maya? Maya: I never knew there was so much for a waitress to do! Take people's orders, bringing them their food, make coffee, work the cash register... Of course, we need a customer before I can do any of that. Phoenix: Yeah, it's a nice-looking restaurant. It's a shame more people don't come. Maya: Don't forget about the ultra cute waitress! Check out my \"gimme a tip\" smile! Lunch special Maya: Hey, Nick! Why don't you order something? The chef's preparing a tasty lunch set at the moment. Or so he says. Phoenix: How much is it? Maya: It's the Twin-T set. So it's 20 dollars, of course. Phoenix: The Twin-T set? I believe I'll be taking a pass. It's kind of expensive. Maya: What!? But you can't! Come on, Nick! It's not every day I get to be a waitress! I want to try carrying plates and working the cash register! Phoenix: How about cleaning the toilets? That should keep you busy. Maya: Yeah, right! Maybe later. Present Anything Phoenix: About this... Maya: Sorry, Nick! I'm a waitress now. I've got a pile of work waiting for little ol' me. After clearing all Talk options: Phoenix: Um... About the lunch... Maya: Oh! A fine choice, sir. Phoenix: No. I, um... Maya: KITCHEN! A LUNCH SPECIAL, PLEASE! WITH ALL THE EXTRAS: DRINK, SIDE SALAD, DESSERT, AND GIFT! Phoenix: I don't need any of that! Maya: Just a moment, please, sir. Phoenix: (Maya's really getting into this! So how much is this set lunch, then? 20 dollars, huh? But with the drink, side salad, and dessert, it's... 45 dollars!?) Hey, wait a sec! Maya! Maya: Sorry to keep you waiting, sir! Here you are, our deluxe Fortify lunch set! Phoenix: Whoa! Maya: A dish inspired by lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Bon appétit! Phoenix: Um, thanks...? Maya: Come on, Nick! Hurry up and try it already! Phoenix: (Lobster, huh? Alright... Down the hatch it goes...) ... Urp! Maya: Well? Phoenix: Are you hungry, Maya? Maya: I'm starving! Phoenix: Here. It's yours. Maya: Really!? ... Urp! Phoenix: Remember, Maya. My wallet doesn't print money, so you'd better polish off that plate! Maya: ... I-I've just remembered! I've got to clean the toilets! Phoenix: Hey! (You can't be in that much of a hurry to clean the toilets!) Trés Bien Lunch Special added to the Court Record. Phoenix: How does that guy manage to make good food taste so bad? Maya: Hey, Nick... You want to take a peek at the kitchen? Phoenix: (The kitchen, huh? Not a bad idea.) Talk Kitchen Phoenix: Hmm, now what was it that Maggey said again? \"In the kitchen, you'll get to see all of the chef's greatest secrets!\" Maya: In the kitchen? Mmm. That sounds tasty! Phoenix: Hey, wait up! Maya! Maya: What is it? I'm pretty busy right now. Phoenix: Weren't you going to show me around? Maya: Tsk. There goes my plan to find some cool clue and show it off in your face... Phoenix: (I'd better conduct the search in the kitchen myself!) After clearing \"Kitchen\" Talk option in Trés Bien: January 6Trés BienKitchen Maya: And here it is! The famous Trés Bien kitchen! It's my first time in here too, actually. Phoenix: ... There is a weird atmosphere in here, that's for sure. Maya: Mr. Armstrong will be back soon, so we'd better search quickly! Chop, chop! Examine Mirror Maya: Now THIS is one large mirror! I bet this is where he makes himself look pretty. Phoenix: There's a book on the dresser. \"Claurice Armstrong's Bedtime Literature\". Maya: Not exactly Pulitzer Prize material, is it? Phoenix: It looks like a collection of poems he's written. Maya: Poems? Cool! Read one out! And say it in your best French accent... with intensity! OK? Phoenix: OK, um... Here's one. Ahem! It's called, \"Printemps\". \"Zee two of zem, like actors from a film. Zee coffee still undrunk. Sweet nothings over too soon, on zat sad Sunday morning. Zee foolish cocktail so delicious. Take zee last sip of your tea and I know what I will do. I must lie to you. I must.\" Maya: Huh? That's it!? Phoenix: Yup. That's a poem for you. Oil bottles Phoenix: What's this? It looks like a treasure chest or something. Maya: Wow! Look at all these little bottles! Phoenix: Oh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor... Maya: Let's see... 1, 2, 3... ...98, 99, 100! They're all the same, too. Hey, wait a minute... Phoenix: What is it? Maya: There's one bottle that's different from all the others. Phoenix: Well what do you know. And it doesn't have a label either. Maya: And... *sniff* It doesn't smell. Phoenix: (So what's that liquid inside then, I wonder?) Maya: Hey, Nick, we should borrow this. I mean, look how many bottles he's got. He won't miss one, will he? Small Bottle added to the Court Record. Oil bottles (subsequent times) Phoenix: What's this? It looks like a treasure chest or something. Maya: Wow! Look at all these little bottles! Phoenix: Oh! They're aromatherapy oils! He's got so many, they're overflowing onto the floor... Maya: Let's see... 1, 2, 3... ...98, 99, 100! They're all the same, too. Lace curtains Phoenix: What are these lace curtains for? Maya: I don't know. But they give the place a real homey feel, don't they? Hmm... Lace curtains... You know, if I was a cooking pot, I'd be perfectly happy to sit on a shelf under those. Phoenix: (How do you respond to something like that!?) Table Maya: Now I know for sure I'm in a French restaurant. I've never heard of most of these seasonings. Hey, Nick! This container has... oyster sauce? What's that? Phoenix: (Isn't that used in Chinese food...?) Ack! Look! Right there on the counter! Maya: My Magatama! What's it doing there!? Phoenix: (What indeed...) Magatama put into pocket. Table (subsequent times) Maya: Now I know for sure I'm in a French restaurant. I've never heard of most of these seasonings. Hey, Nick! This container has... oyster sauce? What's that? Phoenix: (Isn't that used in Chinese food...?) Maya: And look at these knives. They look really sharp! Phoenix: I'd like to see how one of those slices through a cheesecake. Maya: A cheesecake? You don't exactly need a sharp knife for one of those, Nick. Stove Maya: Mmm. That smells good. Something's bubbling away nicely in that pot. It must be the lobster and abalone fricassée with balsamic vinaigrette. Phoenix: Isn't that what I just ate for lunch? Maya: Maybe... What you ate is the only French dish I know the name of. After examining oil bottles in Trés Bien - Kitchen: January 6Police StationCriminal Affairs Dept. Gumshoe: Hey, you're just in time! Phoenix: What is it, Detective Gumshoe? Gumshoe: The lab got back to me about that newspaper you gave me. Phoenix: (He must mean this sports paper with the memo scribbled on it...) So? What did they say? Did the analysis turn up anything? Gumshoe: They said the doodle was written by the victim, Glen Elg. No doubt about it. Phoenix: (I expected as much...) Gumshoe: The victim took the paper with him to the restaurant on the day of the murder. That's our best interpretation of the facts at the moment. Sports Paper refiled into the Court Record. Gumshoe: \"MC Bomber\"... I get the feeling I've heard that name somewhere before... Oh, well. I guess it'll come back to me. Don't forget to report back to me with whatever you find in the restaurant, OK, pal? Phoenix: (Since when did I start taking orders from Gumshoe...? Although... I get the feeling there's something I need to show him...) Talk Armstrong's secret (appears after presenting Small Bottle) Phoenix: So what's Mr. Armstrong's secret? Gumshoe: You ever had lunch at Trés Bien, pal? Phoenix: Um... Yes... Gumshoe: So, how was it? Phoenix: To put it nicely... it was inedible. Gumshoe: Hey, don't worry about being nice around me, pal. You and I both know the reason that place is so empty is because of the food. I mean, the place is clean, and he's got a girl like Maggey as a waitress, so... Phoenix: Yeah... I guess it's probably the food. Gumshoe: The real scoop on the guy is he's up to his ears in debt. Phoenix: Really? How much does he owe? Gumshoe: This is a copy of his loan contract. He's about half a million in the red. Phoenix: H-Half a million? Are we talking dollars? Gumshoe: Yeah. Hey, if it was Sterling, he'd really be in trouble! Phoenix: Sorry. That figure just took me by surprise. Gumshoe: Yeah, this case is full of surprises. And I'd be willing to bet that chef's got something to do with most of them. That's my hunch. Jean's Loan Contract added to the Court Record. Armstrong's secret (subsequent times) Phoenix: So what's Mr. Armstrong's secret? Gumshoe: You ever had lunch at Trés Bien, pal? Phoenix: Um... Yes...

Present Sports Paper Gumshoe: So according to the boys down at the lab, the doodles were probably made by the victim. Phoenix: Probably? Gumshoe: Analyzing this kind of writing is difficult since it's done with a fiber-tipped pen. But don't worry! I'll vouch for it. Phoenix: (Why would Gumshoe have to vouch for it? Can't it stand on its own?) Small Bottle Gumshoe: You got one of those aroma bottles too, huh? Phoenix: Only this one doesn't smell. Gumshoe: Huh? I don't get you... Phoenix: This was mixed in with all the other aromatherapy bottles, but it's not the same. It doesn't even look the same, wouldn't you agree? Gumshoe: A cologne bottle that doesn't smell, huh? Smells like a skunk to me, pal! Mind letting me borrow that bottle for a while? I wanna send it to the lab for analysis. Phoenix: (The victim was poisoned, so the contents of this bottle are pretty important...) Small Bottle given to Detective Gumshoe. Gumshoe: I had a lunch there was something funny about that chef. Phoenix: You suspect Jean Armstrong? Gumshoe: I've got that guy's number. I know what his secret is. Phoenix: (That must be the same secret Gumshoe was talking about before.) Gumshoe: I guess I'd better fill you in on the details. About this Armstrong guy's secret, I mean... Jean's Loan Contract Gumshoe: It's for half a million dollars, pal! That's... um... half a million dollar bills! Phoenix: (What was the \"um\" in there for!?) Is there really that much money tied up in this case? Gumshoe: I can't give you an answer on that, pal. Not without the case file in front of me. But I'll tell you this... That Armstrong guy would've done anything for cash. He was desperate, you know? Phoenix: No, I don't. But I think I sort of get the picture. After examining table in Trés Bien - Kitchen: January 6Vitamin Square Phoenix: Hmm, the old guy's not here anymore. (Drat. And I still have some unanswered questions for him.) Examine Motor scooter Leads to: \"A scooter, huh?\" Phoenix: A scooter, huh? Who'd leave it right in the middle of the park like this?

Trés Bien regular (subsequent times, before breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: Why are you a regular at a restaurant that you clearly hate, sir? Old Man: Take that, pigeons! See how you like these seeds! 3 PSYCHE-LOCKS Phoenix: (It's no good. I'm gonna have to break his Psyche-Lock. I just can't figure out what he would be hiding. I mean, I'm only asking him why he goes to a particular restaurant.) Trés Bien regular (after breaking Psyche-Locks) Phoenix: Um... Sir... Old Man: Yes, it's true! I was there for the young girl. Fine, so I'm a dirty, wicked, sinful old devil! Phoenix: No, no... I didn't mean it like that... Old Man: I even get one of those lousy cups of javaccino every time. For 8 dollars! All because of the serving girl! Punish me! Lock me up! Phoenix: Really, that's not what I'm here for. Old Man: You'll be the same! Another 20 years and you'll understand what it's like! You'll know how painful it is to be an old man like me! Phoenix: No, really. Listen, sir... Old Man: Stop calling me that! I have a name you know, boy! So show some respect, hmm!? I'm Victor Kudo.

Old Man: Wh-What do you mean!? Phoenix: I don't think you go to that restaurant for the food at all. Old Man: You insolent brat! How dare you accuse me! What proof have you got!?

I haven't done a jot of work since I was born. Other than feeding the pigeons. Phoenix: (What a load of crock!) Old Man: The taste's another story, but the price... It's nothing to me. Phoenix: So, you're saying that you go there because you've got money to burn? Old Man: Exactly! I have so much cash, I go for a swim in my money vault every day!

Une petite question. Phoenix: Oon put it keschon. Armstrong: Bravo, monsieur! Oh, you are a dream! Excellent! Phoenix: (We're definitely not on the same page here... let alone book...) Armstrong: Is z'at all...? Leads back to: \"Besides, z'is time, it was not la small trinket, oui? It was 500,000 dollars!\" Phoenix: This restaurant is deep in the red, isn't it? Armstrong: Ah! Phoenix: You have a loan... to the tune of half a million dollars! That lottery ticket would have wiped out your debts. Armstrong: Gnnngh... Phoenix: Well, Mr. Armstrong!? What do you have to say for yourself now!? Armstrong: Ah... Aaaaaaaah! 1 LOCK BROKEN Unlock Successful Jean's Loan Contract or Victor's Note Armstrong: Pardon, pardon. W'izout my reading glasses, I cannot see z'is. I do not read English well. Maya: He's not even looking at it. Phoenix: (We better find a way to make him look, then.) Maya Fey profile Armstrong: Mademoiselle Maya! 'Ow are you finding my restaurant? Maya: I think I've got the hang of it now... But I think it's time for me to... Armstrong: Oh lá lá, non! You are quitting already? It will be a new record for z'e shortest period of employment ever! Glen Elg profile Armstrong: Ah, la dead man. 'E was la first in my restaurant. Maya: No way! You mean, the first customer you ever had!? Armstrong: Non, non, non. It was z'e first time I've 'ad a dead man in my restaurant. Such a s'ame to lose a customer after only 'is first meal 'ere! Victor Kudo profile Armstrong: Ah, z'is old man. 'E is a regular 'ere. My specialty of cappuccino and cold water is one of 'is favorites. Phoenix: Was he here at the time of the incident? Armstrong: Oui. 'E was 'ere. I am sure of it. When la incident 'appened, z'e old man was 'ere. Maya: ...? Armstrong: I did not take it! La ticket for 'alf a million, I mean. Maya: But you just told us you did! You said you took a ticket! Armstrong: Mais non, ma fille! It was not... ???: That's enough. Maya: Huh? AAAAAAAAAH! Mr. Godot! Phoenix: What in the heck are you doing here!? Godot: Urgh! This is without doubt... the worst coffee I have ever tasted, Mr. Armstrong. Phoenix: (He came in here for coffee!? Does his craving for coffee know no bounds!?) Godot: Perhaps Mr. Armstrong stole one of the victim's tickets on the day in question. Armstrong: I am la air'ead, non? Just a pretty little girl who everyone is laughing at. Maya: But, in that case, Maggey shouldn't be the only one under suspicion... Godot: He had the wrong ticket. Phoenix: ...What? Godot: Mr. Armstrong made off with the winning ticket's pretty neighbor. Maya: So... the ticket he took was worthless? Godot: Not quite. He did win something. A dollar. Armstrong: You see! I am just a pretty face! W'izout my looks, I 'ave nothing! Phoenix: So... What happened to the winning ticket, then? The one he meant to steal. Godot: Indeed. What did happen to it? I don't like spoiling myself by watching trailers, so... ...we'll just wait and see how the movie turns out tomorrow, won't we? Maya: Nngh... Armstrong: Voilà! You two! Time to laugh at la pretty little air'ead! Phoenix: (Looks like I won't be needing this note anymore.) Victor's Note thrown into the trash. Phoenix: Looks like we've got a new mystery now. Namely, where did the winning ticket go? Maya: I've got a bad feeling about this. Phoenix: Well, anyway. We can't let Maggey suffer any longer for this. And certainly not again. To be continued. Nothing to examine during investigation Phoenix: No clues here. Exit Magatama session Phoenix: (I don't think I have enough evidence yet... I should investigate and gather some more clues before I try again...) Too many errors during Magatama session ...Mr. Nick... ...If you push yourself any more, your soul will shatter... ...Please calm down, collect your thoughts, and try again... Phoenix: (Nnrgh! I've made too many mistakes!)\n-- Left Hand or Right Hand --Kudo: The boy was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the green lens of his specs.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: So the victim was wearing an HMD. Kudo: HDTV, CD, DVD... What does it matter!? Phoenix: (It was none of them actually, but anyway...) And you're sure that he was wearing the earpiece on the same side? Kudo: No question! I could only see that side of his head from where I was sitting. Phoenix: (Yeah. That's pretty obvious if you look at the floor plans. From the opposite table, he'd only have a view of the side of the victim's head.)Present Victim's Prescription Bag or Glen Elg profile Phoenix: Leads to: \"I'm not sure what the relevance of this is, but...\"Kudo: He kept fiddling with it all the time.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: It seems you kept an eye on Mr. Glen Elg. Kudo: He was getting on my nerves! Rustling that newspaper and fiddling with his earpiece all the time! And then he went and made all that fuss dying from one sip of javaccino! I wanted to say to him, \"Calm down, you young brat!\" Just looking at him made me suddenly speed up my seed eating! I could've chocked! Phoenix: (So I take it the victim was a walking ball of nervous energy...)Kudo: He was fiddling with it just before he picked up the cup, too.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The earpiece you mentioned... Which hand did the victim touch it with? Kudo: ... You're one of those people! One of those people who uses his left hand to get things out of his right pocket. Or fastens his left cuff with his right hand? And when the tour guide says, \"On your right side, you'll see the famous blah-blah\"... ...you're the only one who deliberately looks left! Well? Aren't you? Phoenix: N-No! I didn't mean... Kudo: Obviously he used the hand on the same side of his body that the earpiece was in! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! Ow! (So, if he had the HMD on his left side, then it was his left hand, I guess...)Kudo: And then he used the same hand to pick up the cup. His left hand!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You seem very sure of yourself, Mr. Kudo. Kudo: That's because I know what I saw, no matter what tricks you try to play on me! Phoenix: (It looks like he really did see the guy picking the cup up with his left hand. This is a dead end!)Maya: Well, Nick? What do you think?Phoenix: I think the guy's telling the truth. But even so... Something's not quite right.Maya: Then chuck evidence at him until he breaks!Phoenix: (But if he's not lying, there wouldn't be any contradictions in his testimony, right?)Phoenix: I'm not sure what the relevance of this is, but... Mr. Kudo! There is something very strange about your observations of the victim.Kudo: What!?Phoenix: You say he was wearing the earpiece on the same side as the HMD.Kudo: No question! You can lock me up if I'm wrong! It was his left ear, without a doubt! I could only see that side of his head from where I was sitting.Phoenix: I don't think so.Kudo: Wh-What did you say!?Phoenix: You're no doubt unaware of this fact, Mr. Kudo. But the victim couldn't hear with his left ear! His eardrum was ruptured!Kudo: Eh?Phoenix: Traces of medication for his condition were found in his ear canal. That's right! It's impossible that the victim was wearing his earpiece in his left ear. Because he couldn't even hear in that ear!Kudo: ... Is that true, Captain?Godot: ...It is.Kudo: ...Pi... Pi-Pi-Pigeon! Hm-hm-hmm... Pretty pigeon! Hm-hm-hmm...Judge: Order! Order! Order!Phoenix: This witness's testimony is completely unreliable! He only saw the witness from behind. And he claims the victim was wearing an earpiece when we know his eardrum was ruptured! Well, Mr. Godot!?Godot: Aaaargh! A single drop of milk is all it takes to destroy the pure black magic in the cup! The old man... ...is my drop of milk!Kudo: Captain! Are you calling me a drip!?Judge: This is the victim's coffee cup in which the potassium cyanide was found. The mark on the rim clearly shows that the victim picked it up with his right hand!Kudo: I'll never back down! I know I'm right! The lad drank his javaccino with his left hand!Godot: Let me put you out of your misery... Clearly, the victim used both hands. He took a sip with the cup held in his right hand, and then switched to his left... That's what the old man saw!Phoenix:Phoenix: Impossible! The witness has already testified on numerous occasions... ...that the victim died immediately after taking just one sip of the coffee.Godot:Godot: Which hand the victim used to pick up his cup is irrelevant, Your Honor. The facts still stand! With one hand or the other, Mr. Elg drank the poisoned coffee... ...Like this!Phoenix:Phoenix: Sadly, Mr. Godot, that doesn't wash! The point of this testimony was to establish whether the witness's memory was credible. And the results are clear! The testimony given by this witness is useless!Godot: Puuuurgh!Judge: I believe it is time to conclude today's proceedings. I am satisfied that the witness is not deceiving the court. But to be frank, his testimony is a farce!Kudo: D-Did you have to be so frank!? Take that, you pompous old fogey!Judge: I'm sorry, Mr. Kudo. You can't reach me from there. I'm ordering the defense and the prosecution to investigate this case further. That is all for now. This court is adjourned!???:Kudo: WAAAAIT! If we stop now, where does that leave me?Judge: Leave you, Mr. Kudo?Kudo: Thanks to that blue-suited young upstart over there... ...I'm just a bumbling old man who can't even dot his t's or cross his i's now!Phoenix: (How is your bad memory my fault!?)Judge: I'm sorry, Mr. Kudo, but there's nothing I can do.Kudo: I've kept my mouth shut until now... ...but there's something else the court should know!Godot: What!?Phoenix: There's more?Kudo: To be perfectly honest, it might not be anything. But I want another chance! I want another crack at you, you young shark!Phoenix: M-Me? (He's looking at me like I'm some sort of evil Shogun...)Kudo: Well, everyone? What do you say to one final showdown? The final chapter in this eccentric old man's scrapbook!Godot: Sorry, gramps... I've already had my 17th cup of coffee.Kudo: What have you got to lose, Captain? I'll give you all the javaccino you want if you come to my house after the trial. (Changed from [I'll give you all the coffee you want if you come to my house after the trial.] in the original release) I may be 68 years old, but Victor Kudo is still a man!Judge: That's enough, witness. I believe it will be quicker for the court to just hear your testimony.Kudo: You bet! Much, much quicker!Maya: I can't believe this is happening...Kudo: Ha ha ha! You better get ready, youngster!Phoenix: I get the picture! Just quit throwing those seeds at me, would you!? (He's gotta be using some sort of infinite ammo code with that box of seeds...)Witness Testimony-- The Final Showdown --Kudo: First of all, I want to stress that this might be nothing. I'm not too sure of myself. The young boy slumped over the table as soon as he took one sip of his javaccino... Well, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over. It broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked! Well!? How about that? Turned things upside-down, hmm?Judge: ... Um... Is that all?Kudo: Yes, that's all. I remember it perfectly. Eh!? You're doubting me again? You're doubting a poor, defenseless old man!?Judge: N-No. We are not doubting you, Mr. Kudo.Maya: Don't you get the feeling there's a question hanging on everyone's lips, Nick?Phoenix: Yeah. \"So what?\" probably! That's all I can think of, and I have to cross-examine this guy!Kudo: You're a birdbrain, that's why that's all you can think of!Judge: Very well... Mr. Wright. Your final cross-examination, please.Cross ExaminationCross Examination-- The Final Showdown --Kudo: First of all, I want to stress that this might be nothing. I'm not too sure of myself.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Um... The court generally prefers if witnesses are sure of themselves, Mr. Kudo. Kudo: Noisy brat! I'm warning you, I'm more savage than a macho man right now! You won't beat me with this testimony! This is the final battle! Phoenix: Ow! Oooow! (He's chucking those seeds harder than ever! I better be careful...) Maya: Come on, Nick! Nail him!Kudo: The young boy slumped over the table as soon as he took one sip of his javaccino...Press Phoenix: Phoenix: The court has already heard that testimony, Mr. Kudo... Kudo: I know that! I was just setting the mood. How else am I supposed to build up the suspense, hmm!? Phoenix: The suspense? Kudo: Isn't it enough? Should I work the audience a bit more? Judge: No, no! Please continue, Mr. Kudo. As quickly as possible! Kudo: Alright. Now where was I...? ...Ah yes. The young boy slumped over the table, and...Kudo: Well, the clumsy idiot upset the vase. He knocked it right over.Press Phoenix: Phoenix: A vase, you say? Kudo: Yes. There are vases on all the tables in that place. They're accidents waiting to happen! They're practically begging to be knocked over! Phoenix: (Well, he's right about there being vases. I do remember seeing them, too... There was a vase on the table when I ate munch there.) And you saw the moment when the victim actually knocked over the vase? Kudo: Well... it's hard to say... It's a bit unclear... How do you really define... Phoenix: OK, I get it. Kudo: I heard it break! And the sight of it is burned into my memory as clear as day!Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene.\"Kudo: It broke, and the strip of cloth covering the table got completely soaked!Press Phoenix: Phoenix: Soaked in water, you mean? Kudo: Yes. It splashed me on the knee as well. Phoenix: You said you were sitting at a table across the room from the victim, correct? And yet, the water still managed to splash onto you? Kudo: ... It was cold! I clearly remember it splashing me! Phoenix: (Could the water really make it all the way across to the other side of the room...?)Present Crime Photo Phoenix: Leads to: \"Mr. Kudo. This is a photograph of the crime scene.\"Kudo: Well!? How about that? Turned things upside-down, hmm?Press Phoenix: Phoenix: You mean, the vase on the victim's table falling upside-down and breaking? Kudo: The vase turned upside-down, and my testimony's turning this case upside-down... It's a joke! I just wanted everyone to hear it! What do you think, Captain!? Godot: ...I'm impressed. By your ability to waste time. Phoenix: (Godot hasn't raised any objections for a while now...) Kudo: So, you young show-off! With that scrap of information, I'm throwing down the gauntlet! If I lose this one, I'll take it like a man and admit defeat!Phoenix: He's really giving you the evil eye, Maya.Maya: It's you he's looking at, Nick, not me! It's like he's saying, \"I triple dog dare you to find a contradiction, young'un!\"Phoenix: I guess I'll just have to rise to the challenge then...\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Maya Fey\nDescription: My assistant and a disciple in the Kurain Tradition of spirit channeling.\nCharacter 1\nName: Mia Fey\nDescription: Maya's older sister and my eternal mentor in life and law.

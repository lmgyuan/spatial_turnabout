'I wonder exactly how many mysteries are out there, hidden within this bed of fog,' he said. Indeed, a most bizarre incident born of a curious advertisement... a hell-hound's mad gallop through the shadows of a serial murder, an executed man's graveyard resurrection in the dead of night... and a commonplace killing in a small, forgotten room at the edge of town... There is, naturally, always another side to every case of which most remain ignorant. 'And it is that \"other side\" which compels me to the scene of the crime, Wilson. So, quickly now. Take your hat and let's be on our way, my dear fellow. For our adventure is not over yet. Come! The game is afoot!' Eight days after that earth-shattering trial and Kazuma regaining his memory... ...we were in the foyer of one of London's most luxurious hotels, the Great Waterloo Hotel. 1st November, 10:24 a.m. Great Waterloo Hotel Foyer Ryunosuke: Professor Mikotoba is due to arrive at any moment. Susato: Yes! I'm so glad we got here in time! ......... Ryunosuke: (Susato-san hasn't been the same since what happened. Not that I'm surprised.) Susato: The truth about Kazuma-sama's father... Ryunosuke: ...! Susato: Do you suppose my father knew? Ryunosuke: That he was actually the mass murderer, the Professor, you mean? (I knew that's what she was thinking about.) There's a good chance, I'd say. I mean... ...they did come here to London together sixteen years ago, didn't they? Susato: Yes, that's true... Ryunosuke: ......... Come to think of it, didn't you say... ...that Professor Mikotoba knew about Kazuma going missing in Hong Kong as well? Susato: That's right. But for some reason, he wasn't at liberty to talk to me about it. Ryunosuke: (That probably means he knows, then... ...about Kazuma showing up here in London with amnesia, and that he's regained his memory now.) Susato: ......... ???: Ah, there she is! Susato: Oh... Father! Mikotoba: Hello, Susato! How are you? Susato: I'm very well, thank you. We're delighted you've arrived safe and sound! Mikotoba: Hello, Mr Naruhodo. Very kind of you to take the trouble to meet us here. Ryunosuke: Oh no, not at all. It's my pleasure. ???: We've heard all about your extraordinary exploits here in London, you know. The news has crossed the seas. Ryunosuke: It, it has? ???: I always look forward to reading the monthly reports that arrive with the steamships from Britain. Ryunosuke: Oh...I, I see. Well...thank you very much! (Who is this man? And why do I feel as though I've seen him before?) ???: Hm... I take it from your expression that you can't quite place me. Mikotoba: In that case...how about a little reminder, Seishiro? A firm tap should do it. ???: Yes... Ryunosuke: (A, a firm tap? What?) ???: Here we go, then... I hereby pronounce the defendant, Ryunosuke Naruhodo... ...GUILTY! Ryunosuke: Ah... OOOOOOH! Y-You're... Judge: The court will now hear the trial of Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Y... Your... ...Your Excellency! Susato: Hello, Judge Jigoku, how are you? It's been a long time. Jigoku: Hah hah hah hah hah! Good, you've remembered now! That really did the trick! Guilty! Hah hah hah hah hah! Ryunosuke: (Only I was declared not guilty, wasn't I? And there was no laughing at the time...) Jigoku: So, London again after all this time... Hard to believe it's been ten years. To be honest, I never thought I'd be back. Mikotoba: Neither did I. I didn't imagine Japan would ever be invited to an international symposium like this. Though, really, I doubt anyone did, to be honest. It's all thanks to you, isn't it, Seishiro? Jigoku: What are you talking about, Yujin? Hah hah hah hah hah! Ryunosuke: (Of course, Judge Jigoku... He must complete the set. He's the other man, who sixteen years ago... ...came to London with Kazuma's father and Professor Mikotoba. He's the third visiting scholar.) Mikotoba: Well, all those passport checks and luggage searches at the border took rather a lot of time. I must say, I'm very envious of your ministerial status. You didn't have to go through any of that, did you? Jigoku: Ah, I knew you were jealous! Hah hah hah hah hah! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Ministerial status? Mikotoba: Yes, didn't you know? Seishiro here is also Japan's Minister of Foreign Affairs. It was his personal insistence that allowed you to take Kazuma's place here on this study tour. Jigoku: Guilty as charged! Hah hah hah hah hah! Ryunosuke: Oh. Well, thank you very much. (He's really every bit as important as he looks.) Mikotoba: Ah yes now, Naruhodo... I received a telegram from Lord Stronghart yesterday. Ryunosuke: Oh, you did? Mikotoba: It appears that...some things came to light in a trial you were involved with eight days ago. About what happened ten years ago. That...tragedy. Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: Yes. Could you tell us any more about it? After clearing all Converse options: Mikotoba: Well, if you'll excuse us now... Jigoku: Yes, I'd like to get this trunk up to my room as soon as possible. Ryunosuke: Oh, I...I'm so sorry! I shouldn't have held you up here for so long. Susato: I'll call for the porter, then. Just wait here! Ryunosuke: (Susato-san's gone off at a run!) Mikotoba: I'd like to stay and talk more, but I do have various preparations to make for tomorrow. Ryunosuke: Yes, of course! It must be a big responsibility representing our entire country. I wish you the best of luck! Mikotoba: ......... Naruhodo... ...I hope you'll keep an eye on Susato for me. Keep looking after her as you obviously have been. Ryunosuke: Oh no! I, I mean, if anyone's looking after anyone, it's her looking after me! Mikotoba: Well I do appreciate you being there for her. After all... ...I've been a miserable father to her. I've thoroughly let her down. Ryunosuke: Sorry? What do you mean? Mikotoba: ......... Well, it was sixteen years ago that I started my long study tour here in Britain, as you know. The very year Susato was born. Ryunosuke: ...Yes, I heard. Mikotoba: The birth of my daughter was the most joyous event of my life, but... Well, sadly it was accompanied by the most tragic event of my life, too. Ryunosuke: (Oh...yes... Susato-san hinted at something like that...) Susato: It was a rather turbulent time at home... Mikotoba: ...Anyway, I won't bore you with the details. The point is, I became rather less dependable than befits a grown man. And it was then that Seishiro offered me the opportunity to study here in Great Britain. Jigoku: I was too worried about you to leave you behind. So perhaps I was a little heavy-handed when it came to persuading you to accompany me to London. Mikotoba: So...that's what happened in a nutshell. And that's also the reason why I now feel compelled to give my daughter as many opportunities as I dare. Though the world does not readily afford young women such things, I must say. Ryunosuke: I...completely understand, Professor. Mikotoba: ......... Ah, one other thing, Naruhodo... If I may be so bold, I have a favour to ask you. Ryunosuke: Oh, really? Of course! What can I do for you? Mikotoba: Well, the thing is, I- Susato: I'm so sorry that took so long! Ryunosuke: Miss Susato! Susato: Now then...allow us to take your bags! Porter: Allow me to take your bags! Mikotoba: One moment, if you please, porter. Porter: Of...of course, sir! Mikotoba: That machine around your neck... It's a camera, I believe? Porter: Quite right, sir! Just five shillings for a lovely photograph to commemorate a wonderful stay at the hotel, sir! Mikotoba: Well, I think given the occasion, we could justify the expense. Porter: ......... Ah! Yes, yes of course! Susato: ...I'd like to thank you for coming with me, Mr Naruhodo. It's really made Father very happy, I think. Ryunosuke: Oh, well, I'm pleased, then. (But we were interrupted before. Professor Mikotoba was about to ask me something.) Susato: Shall we return to Baker Street, then? I expect Iris will have some delicious tea waiting for us! Ryunosuke: Yes, let's go. (I'm getting more and more anxious about Kazuma, though. Perhaps I'll try to meet with Lord Stronghart later and ask after him...) 1st November British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Van Zieks: Here's the final draft of the opening address for tomorrow's proceedings. I've supplemented your original with the figures you asked for from the Yard. Stronghart: I see. Excellent work. Thank you. Van Zieks: ...You're welcome, My Lord. Ryunosuke: (What's Lord van Zieks doing here...?) Susato: My, there seems to be an awful lot of tension in the air, wouldn't you say? Ryunosuke: (This place is stifling enough as it is. We really don't need any more tension.) Stronghart: My apologies. I didn't notice you come in. Your small stature and dark dress make you all but invisible to me. Ryunosuke: Oh! No no! It's entirely my fault for wearing black, I'm sure. Susato: From now on, you must dress in white from head to toe whenever you come here! Stronghart: Now then, Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: Y-Yes, My Lord! I'm right here! Stronghart: ......... Ryunosuke: ......... (Ugh... Kill me now...) Stronghart: Is something wrong? Perhaps it's a little too hot in here for you. Ryunosuke: Oh, no, not at all! I mean, I've never experienced a room at such a perfect temperature! Stronghart: If you're sure. The beads of sweat carving their way down your face seem to suggest otherwise. Ryunosuke: (Because of the daggers you're staring at me with, mainly.) Stronghart: As you're no doubt aware, my International Forensic Science Symposium begins tomorrow. In fact, your father arrived in London earlier today, I hear, madam. Susato: Oh! Yes, that's right, My Lord. He's extremely honoured to have been invited. Stronghart: I'll leave the remaining preparations for the meeting room in your capable hands then, Lord van Zieks. Van Zieks: I will attend at once. Susato: He gave you a very cold stare as he left, didn't he? Ryunosuke: I know. But I haven't done anything...have I? Stronghart: These past few days, my feet have barely touched the ground, I must say. My dedicated right hand of many years was recently put out of action in spectacular fashion. Ryunosuke: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. ...Is your left hand still of service? Susato: Mr Naruhodo! He's talking about Dr Sithe! Ryunosuke: Ah! (Of course...) I'm, I'm terribly sorry about that. I was just, um... Stronghart: Fear not. You've done nothing wrong. Dr Sithe's own wrongdoing precipitated the situation. You needn't concern yourself with it any further. Ryunosuke: (That would be a lot easier to do if it weren't for the piercing stare you're giving me...) Stronghart: Lord van Zieks is doing an admirable job of holding the fort. Though disturbingly, his apprentice has been missing since yesterday. Ryunosuke: O-Oh... (Missing...?) Susato: What's become of Kazuma-sama now...? 1st November Sholmes's Suite ???: Uèèèèèèèèèèèèè uèèèèèèèèèèèèèèè! Ryunosuke: W-What was that?! Susato: A, a man screaming! In a most unflattering way! Ryunosuke: Do you think... Could it have been Mr Sholmes? Susato: Oh my! I do hope not... ???: Uèèèèèèèèèèèè! I don't-a do it any more! ???: Mon ami, mon ami... Stop zis disgraceful display, uh? Ryunosuke: Who, who are these people? (Look at their hair! It's bright red...) Susato: I think...they must be clients of Mr Sholmes. Gina: Right, you two. Yer comin' wiv me now. Down to the clink. ???: No! Not in prison! It is dark and damp and I don't-a like it! ???: Bof! Ze darkness, it is my friend. I am not scared! ???: Uèèè uèèèèèèèèèèèè! But you are always scared of the dark! ???: Shut your mouth, you idiot! I will sit quietly in ze dark and plan our next daring 'eist! ???: Uèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèè! I don't-a like this! I don't-a like it! Gina: Well tough! We'll finish this down the Yard! Now get movin'! Iris: By then, Ginny! Have fun! Gina: Oh yeah, thanks, Iris! And thanks...ya great detective! Susato: Heehee! Gina makes a fine detective herself, doesn't she? Iris: Oh, Susie! And Runo! Ryunosuke: Hello, Iris. We're home! Iris: Well? Did you find your daddy? Susato: Yes! We arrived at the hotel just before he and his friend. Iris: Oh! Well that's great news. I hope I'll get to see my daddy again soon... Susato: Ah...yes...of course... Ryunosuke: (Dr John H. Wilson...) ???: So, Iris! All that remains now is that greatest of problems known to man! Sholmes: But before we concern ourselves with that, I believe some tea is in order, don't you, my dear fellows? Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: ......... Sholmes: Is something wrong, Mr Naruhodo? Do I have a crumb or suchlike on my face? Ryunosuke: Uh... (Not so much on your face... ...as on your head, I'd say.) Iris: Come along then, everyone. I've brewed a lovely special blend. Time for tea! Susato: Whatever is going on here today? Sholmes: In that case, let us sit and drink now. For I am in fact expecting a guest later today. After clearing Converse options with Herlock Sholmes and clearing all Converse options in British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office: *Ding-aling-aling* Sholmes: Aha! Here is my guest now. My latest client! With money to spend! Iris: Ooh, I do hope it's an exciting case, Hurley! Sholmes: Remember, Iris, we are at present gripped by the greatest problem known to man. I must be willing to accept any case, no matter how unstimulating. Save locating a runaway, of course. Ryunosuke: ...Don't spare anyone's feelings, will you? Iris: Oh dear... I'm afraid that Hurley can lack a little tact, especially just before the rent is due. *Thwack!* ???: Mr Sholmes! Mr Herlock Sholmes! Please... Oh, please... ...please find my husband! He's run away! Sholmes: To upset me? ???: I beg your pardon? Sholmes: Never mind. A personal matter. My apologies. What exactly are you trying to say, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: ...I didn't say a word. Sholmes: Come, my dear madam, be seated. Iris, some tea, if you please? Iris: Of course! Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: What's the matter, Miss Susato? Susato: Oh, it's...it's just that gentlewoman... I feel sure I've seen her somewhere before. Very recently. Ryunosuke: (...! Yes, now you come to mention it...) Evie: As I explained earlier, my name is Evie Vigil. I implore you to take the case, sir! Money is no object. Simply name your figure! Sholmes: Money and wealth are of little consequence to me, madam. Being offered a case to solve is reward enough. Evie: Oh, Mr Sholmes! You are the picture of benevolence! Sholmes: I will of course make a mental note of your offer, however. For...contingent reasons. I trust you will remember your words also. Evie: Um...if I might enquire, sir... ...this gentleman and lady would be...? Ryunosuke: Oh! Um...me? Evie: What I am about to tell you, I should like to communicate in the strictest confidence, you understand. Sholmes: Ah, these are my friends. I assure you, you may say before this pair anything which you may say to me. Evie: Ah...I see... Sholmes: I can vouch for the gentleman personally. After all... ...he's hard of hearing. Ryunosuke: (...Why did I ever get my hopes up?) After clearing all Converse options: Sholmes: Thank you for everything you have shared with us, Mrs Vigil. I believe I have all the information I need to begin my investigation. Evie: Oh, please report to me soon with good news, sir! Sholmes: Fear not, madam. In a day or two, I shall be contacting you with a heartening report, I'm quite sure. Evie: So soon? Oh, how splendid, Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: Good news should be delivered early, I always say. If you would be so kind as to leave the photograph of your husband in my possession...? The photograph of Mr Vigil has been entered into the Court Record. Sholmes: Thank you. Now, allow me to show you the door. Evie: I can't thank you enough, Mr Sholmes. You've been simply marvellous! Iris: You know, I think it every time, Hurley... ...but how do you come out with such nonsense? Good news in a day or two? Are you sure? Sholmes: I can't be sure, of course. But then I didn't swear on it. I merely gave the good woman some hope. I hope to be able to give her good news, one might say. After all, the rent must be paid by the end of day tomorrow. If by that time I've successfully located Mr Vigil, we shall be mutually relieved. Wouldn't you agree, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: ...Don't look at me with those pleading eyes. Sholmes: Well, my dear fellow? Did you hear the details of the case? Ryunosuke: Yes...my hearing is surprisingly good, actually. Sholmes: Excellent! And what did you make of it? Ryunosuke: Well, I was surprised to learn where her husband worked. At Barclay Prison, I mean... Sholmes: Ah, so you noted that? Susato: Of course. Especially with the mention of Lowgate Cemetery... Drebber: Lowgate Cemetery as at the rear of Barclay Prison. So it was renowned among us students at the university for being haunted by the ghosts of condemned convicts. Susato: Barclay Prison is where that notorious man was incarcerated! Ryunosuke: The Professor... Sholmes: And now a warder from the prison has mysteriously disappeared, it would seem. Ryunosuke: It's all very peculiar... Sholmes: Indeed. But nothing you can't handle, I'm quite certain, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: Run along to the prison and see what you can glean, would you? It's the prison governor you want. No doubt the man is equally worried. Ryunosuke: But...aren't you going to go yourself? Sholmes: Surely you needn't ask. I can't possibly be seen out with this hair! Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: ...But didn't you go to Lime Street with that hair? Sholmes: That was a quite different matter. So, I leave it in your capable hands. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm rather busy. Ryunosuke: (Of course you are...) 1st November, 10:24 a.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy Barclay Prison is on the outskirts of London, backing onto a lonely burial ground. Its four high outer walls loomed quietly before us in the fog. Having requested a meeting, we were shown to the governor's office in the watchtower. 1st November Barclay Prison, Governor's Office ???: This place is full of hardened criminals. I cannae remember the last time a civilian was doon here. And you dinnae want to talk to an inmate, but to me? Caidin: D'you ken who I am? I'm the governor, Barry Caidin......... hm? Ryunosuke: Oh...yes...it's a pleasure. I'm Ryunosuke Naruhodo, defence lawyer. Caidin: And an Easterner, I see. Does that mean... Ryunosuke: Yes, I'm a visiting student of law from the Empire of Japan. Caidin: Japan?! Did ye say Japan? Ryunosuke: Um...yes? Caidin: Well there's no any of your kind in here, laddie! Maybe you should try the prison next door, eh? Susato: I didn't notice another prison next door, sir... Ryunosuke: Anyway, we came to ask you some questions about- Caidin: I dinnae like to be so direct, but... ...I've no intention of speaking wi' the likes o' you suspicious-looking Easterners. Now get oot of my hair. Ryunosuke: (So as soon as he finds out that we're from Japan, he reacts like this... That surely means...) Susato: I think...it's because of the Professor case. Ryunosuke: You think so too? (Ten years ago... ...Genshin Asogi - also known as the Professor - was incarcerated at this prison.) And then, after his execution, he apparently re-merged from his grave in the cemetery behind the prison. Caidin: I, I might 'ave known! You're sniffing around aboot that case, aren't ya? You're agents, eh? Part of the Professor's great web, no doubt. Ryunosuke: No! Not at all! We're just- Caidin: Get gone wi' ya! Before I punch yer lights oot! Ryunosuke: We're going, we're going! (Clearly the ghost of that killer still haunts this place... We're not going to get anywhere here. Unless we can somehow prove to this man that there's nothing suspicious about us...) Susato: Governor Caidin... Ryunosuke: What are you thinking, Miss Susato? Susato: I feel sure that name came up in conversation recently somewhere. I was wondering if whoever mentioned him might have some ideas to help us. Ryunosuke: (Come to think of it, I have the same feeling...) Great Waterloo Hotel Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Barclay Prison, Governor's Office Ryunosuke: If you'd just cast your eyes over this, Governor Caidin... Caidin: What's this then? You cannae pull the wool over my eyes, you good-fer-nothin' Japanese student! ......... Mikotoba? That, that young jock from the forensics laboratory? That Mikotoba? Ryunosuke: Yes! Exactly! Him! Susato: Oh dear, perhaps I should have said something sooner... I'm Yujin Mikotoba's daughter, Susato. Caidin: Jings! You're the young man's daughter? And ya did'nae think to mention that afore? Susato: I, I do apologise... Caidin: Aye, well, ye'd best take a seat then. Can I offer you a cup of tea, perhaps? And dinnae forget to try one of these wee handcuff biscuits! Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: Your father's influence is nothing short of amazing... Susato: I'm bitterly regretting not announcing who I was from the outset now. Caidin: So then...what can I do for you, hen? Susato: Well...we're currently investigating a case. Ryunosuke: It's one of your warders, you see. He's gone missing. Caidin: Missing? Susato: That's right. It's surely been reported to you as well, being the prison governor. Caidin: ......... I have'nae heard nothing of the sort. There's no missing persons in my prison! Susato: Oh! Ryunosuke: (But...how can that be?) Susato: It's Mr Daley Vigil, your chief warder... Caidin: Eh? Vigil? Ryunosuke: That's right. His wife came to us and asked us to investigate his disappearance. (Let's skip the part about him only going missing yesterday for now...) Caidin: ......... Ryunosuke: (Clearly that means something to him...) Susato: Would you be so kind as to tell us what you know, sir? Caidin: Aye... Aye, of course. After clearing all Converse options: Caidin: Well... ...I cannae tell you anything else. Susato: Thank you so much for your time, Governor. Caidin: Oh, one moment afore you're away, hen... I'm sure I have it here somewhere... Ah, found it. Here, take this as a wee souvenir of your visit to the prison. Susato: What is it? Caidin: That's Vigil's dismissal notice. It's ten years old now of course. Susato: Oh my! Are you sure? Caidin: Aye, it's no trouble at all. It's no the original, mind. Vigil's dismissal notice has been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: Thank you very much, Governor Caidin! Caidin: Well in return... ...do me a favour and never come back here. That case is closed. Susato: Well, I think we ought to return to Baker Street for the time being. Ryunosuke: Yes, I agree. We need to report back to Mr Sholmes with what we've found out about Mr Vigil. (What will he tell Mrs Vigil, I wonder?) 1st November Sholmes's Suite Ryunosuke: We're back! ???: Hello, you two! Iris: I thought you'd be back before long, so I baked some scones for us all. Ryunosuke: Ah! So that's what the delicious smell is. Sholmes: Greetings, my dear fellows! You've returned a good deal sooner than I was anticipating. Ryunosuke: Um...hello, Mr Sholmes. ......... Susato: Hello, Mr...Sholmes... ......... Sholmes: Say nothing. Your thoughts are written all over your faces in any case. It turns out that it may have been advisable to test my hair colour restoration tonic before application. Susato: Oh my... Sholmes: Pray, tell me. What of our warder friend? Have you garnered some new information? Ryunosuke: Oh, um...yes. Something very surprising, in fact. Though it's not a patch on your hair, to be honest. Susato: It most certainly isn't. But still, we discovered that- ???: SHOOOOOOOOOLMES!!! Gina: Drop everyfin', Sholmes! This is more important! Ryunosuke: Gina? Gina: I, I can't Adam an' Eve it... *Sniff, sniff...* Susato: What's happened? Sholmes: Clearly a very grave matter indeed. For Miss Lestrade made no mention of my hair whatsoever. Gina: It's...it's the boss... Ryunosuke: What do you mean? (Inspector Gregson?) Gina: The boss is... He's... He's dead. Ryunosuke: What...? Gina: They, they just found 'is body. Shot...wiv a pistol... Ryunosuke: WHAAAAAAAAAT?! Susato: But...but... Inspector Gregson?! Ryunosuke: (He was...murdered?!) Iris: No... Not Gregsy... Sholmes: Come in, my dear girl. Tell us the whole story. Gina: *Sniff, sniff...* After clearing all Converse options: Sholmes: ......... Thank you for informing us, Miss Lestrade. This really is most terrible news. I'm dreadfully sorry... Gina: Wot are you sayin' sorry for? You didn't do nuffin'! Sholmes: ......... Gina: Well...anyway... ...I'm takin' a cab over to the scene right now. Please come an' all! As soon as ya can! You've gotta 'elp! Sholmes: It's a detective's lot to appear wherever some sinister plot has unfolded. Little wonder we all look haggard. Sometimes these things are almost too much for the nerves. Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes... Sholmes: What use is there in being a great detective if I fail to see something like this coming, hm?! How could I let this happen to Gregson?! To Gregson... Susato: ......... Sholmes: Mr Naruhodo, I shall leave at once to begin my investigations. Ryunosuke: Of course, yes. We will, too. Sholmes: It would be helpful... ...if you could talk to Mr Reaper and see what you can glean. I'm sure you were intending to do so anyway. Until later, then! Ryunosuke: (Inspector Gregson, dead... And Lord van Zieks arrested...) Iris: Runo! Susie! I've called you a hansom. It's waiting outside. Ryunosuke: Thanks, Iris. Shall we, Miss Susato? Susato: Yes! Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy 1st November Room on Fresno Street Ryunosuke: (This really is an out-of-the-way part of London. I doubt many people find their way down this back street. So this dust-ridden rented old room is where it happened then...) Susato: So this is...where poor Inspector Gregson lost his life. Ryunosuke: Yes... And the police are already hard at work investigating, it seems. (I don't see Mr Sholmes anywhere, though... Perhaps his investigations have taken him elsewhere.) Gina: Oi! Wot d'ya think yer doin' there?! Every one o' them drawers 'as gotta be taken right out so you can look underneath an' all! I want the space above this ceilin' checked, and don't forget to look inside the chimney stack, too! Blimey! Ain't you lot never gone over an 'ouse lookin' for dough when the owners are out o' town? Ryunosuke: (Gina's obviously got some unique investigative techniques she wants everyone to adopt...) Gina: Oh, so you've turned up at last. Mind you, I ain't been 'ere long meself. Ryunosuke: Hello again, Gina. Gina: Sholmes 'as only just left. Yer lucky ya missed that. 'E went prancin' around in 'ere, pointin' at stuff an' flickin' that 'at of 'is an' then just scarpered. Susato: Oh! He's finished investigating already, you mean? Gina: Yeah... 'E didn't stop to say nuffin' to no one. Not even me. Ryunosuke: Gina! Would you mind if we investigated, too? Gina: ......... Listen, 'Oddo... ...yer a lawyer, right? Ryunosuke: Um...yes. Why? Gina: Well, yer not thinkin' of...tryin' to 'elp that Reaper bloke, are ya? Ryunosuke: Oh! (Poor Gina... She's never going to forget, is she? That trial will haunt her forever.) Susato: Gina, if you don't mind me saying... If Lord van Zieks really is responsible for this crime... ...he will be duly and fairly judged in court. Gina: ......... I suppose yer right, yeah. Go on then, 'Oddo! Get investigatin'! I wanna know the truth about wot really 'appened 'ere! Ryunosuke: Thank you, Gina! 1st November Local Prison, Cell 1 Ryunosuke: (There he is. Lord van Zieks behind bars...) Susato: So it's true. He really was arrested... Ryunosuke: (He's sitting with his back to the wall, reading something. I don't think he's noticed us.) Erm...Lord van Zieks! Van Zieks: ...Fancy meeting you here. The last place on Earth I'd like to be, with the last person on earth I'd like to see. Ryunosuke: ...I couldn't very well not come. We heard what happened. That you... That Inspector Gregson was... Van Zieks: ......... Go home. This has nothing to do with you. Ryunosuke: But... Susato: Forgive me, Lord van Zieks, but I must disagree. Van Zieks: ......... Susato: Inspector Gregson was very helpful to us on a number of occasions. We're indebted to him. At the very least we owe it to him to find out the truth about his death. You must help us with our investigations, please! Van Zieks: ......... There's really nothing I can tell you. Ryunosuke: What were you just reading at the back of the cell there? Was it something related to the case? Van Zieks: ...This? The Yard isn't quite so cavalier with its information as to share case details with a suspect. This is...a letter from an old acquaintance. Susato: Oh. Who might that be? Van Zieks: Someone you know, as it happens. Albert Harebrayne. Ryunosuke: (Of course, yes. I keep forgetting they went to the same university.) Van Zieks: And I would like to read my correspondence in peace. So let's get this over with, shall we? What is it you want to know? Ryunosuke: (Strange... I mean, let's face it, Lord van Zieks never minces his words... ...but they seem to have less bite than usual somehow.) After clearing all Converse options: Van Zieks: ......... So. It appears our conversation has run dry. Ryunosuke: There was a two-second silence, that's all. Van Zieks: Well in any event, if you'll excuse me now. ...I wouldn't like to detain you. Ryunosuke: I was wondering, Lord van Zieks... If you'd like... ...I'd be happy to advocate for you. Van Zieks: ...! ...You trust me, do you? Ryunosuke: Yes. I've heard you speak many times in court. I've seen how you treat people. So I'm quite sure that you would never have taken another's life. ...It's just, my feelings can't be used as evidence in a court of law, sadly. Van Zieks: ......... It's a very gracious offer. However... ...I trust no one. Ryunosuke: What? Van Zieks: Not the police, not the judiciary...and not you Nipponese. Ryunosuke: But please... Van Zieks: I have no intention of engaging your services. Ryunosuke: ......... (The chasm between us is just too wide and too deep, it seems...) Van Zieks: ...I'd appreciate it if you don't visit again. Then neither of us will waste any more time. Ryunosuke: (Perhaps we need to dig a little deeper... ...and find out more about Lord van Zieks and what happened to Inspector Gregson.) After clearing all Converse options at Local Prison, Cell 1 and clearing all Converse options and examining portrait or desk, board, gun, red wig, chalk outline, candles, and figurine in Room on Fresno Street: 1st November, 10:24 a.m. British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Stronghart: ...You've made good time. ???: I took an express train back to London. Ryunosuke: I can hear Lord Stronghart. Can you? Susato: Yes, it sounds as though he's talking to someone. Stronghart: Is everything in place? ???: I had a private compartment on the train so I could check all the paperwork. Ryunosuke: I-It's... Susato: Kazuma-sama! Stronghart: Ah, your timing is impeccable! Ryunosuke: It, it is? Stronghart: No doubt you have heard the sickening news? About the Reaper's latest devilry. Ryunosuke: ...Yes. Susato: I'm sure you don't believe it of course, though, Lord Stronghart. That Lord van Zieks could have done such a thing to Inspector Gregson. Stronghart: ......... I believe only in the facts. And the facts in this case point to one thing: The unavoidable accusal of Lord van Zieks for this crime. We must bring charges against the Reaper for taking the life of our legendary detective. Susato: Oh no, surely not! Stronghart: It's a truly regrettable situation. Tomorrow the forensic science symposium finally begins. At the very least, though, we can show the world our justice system's swift and equitable processes. Ryunosuke: So does that mean...the trial is tomorrow? Stronghart: Precisely. In fact, this is a fine opportunity for introductions. Ryunosuke: Kazuma... Kazuma: ......... Stronghart: Ah, but of course! You're already acquainted, aren't you? Mr Asogi here will be present at tomorrow's proceedings... ...leading the prosecution. Ryunosuke: Wait... WHAAAAAAT?! (Kazuma...?) Stronghart: As I'm sure you're aware, he's a very capable practitioner of law. Susato: Kazuma-sama...a prosecutor...? After clearing all Converse options and examining Kazuma Asogi: Ryunosuke: (It doesn't look like we're going to glean much more here.) Well...thank you very much, Lord Stronghart. Stronghart: Remember, tomorrow's trial will go down in our empire's history. There's much you could learn...from the public gallery. Ryunosuke: ...Sorry to have taken up so much of your time. We'll see ourselves out. Kazuma: Kazuma: Before you go, Ryunosuke... Ryunosuke: Oh...what is it, Kazuma? Kazuma: I just wanted...to thank you. Susato: Kazuma-sama... What...? Kazuma: You took my determination to heart and brought it with you over the ocean in my stead. And you carried out my role to perfection. Susato: You always were intent on studying British law in order to change our own justice system. It was your dream, and Mr Naruhodo didn't want that to die with you! Kazuma: Yes. But I had another purpose for coming here. Susato: Oh! Kazuma: ......... I actually have a favour to ask. Ryunosuke: W-Which is...? Kazuma: This trial I'll be prosecuting tomorrow... I'd like you to be there to see how it ends. Right in front of me...as the defence counsel! Ryunosuke: ...! (Why? What's this all about?) Kazuma: I know you have what it takes. Ryunosuke: But...Lord van Zieks would never put his fate in my hands. Kazuma: On the contrary. He recognises your talent. Ryunosuke: He does? Kazuma: ...It's not easy to see behind the facade sometimes. Here, have a look at this... Ryunosuke: That's... Susato: That's Lord van Zieks and Inspector Gregson! Ryunosuke: (In a photograph that must have been taken some time ago by the look of it. And who's the third person?) Kazuma: It was displayed very prominently in the detective's office. Ryunosuke: In Gregson's office, you mean? Kazuma: Yes. What I'm trying to say is, if you really think you can trust the Reaper... ...you might find that some straight talking makes him take a different view. Take it. Gregson's photograph has been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: I don't understand. Why are you giving me this? Kazuma: Just hurry, Ryunosuke! Visiting hours at the prison are almost over. Ryunosuke: (What are you doing, Kazuma...?) 1st November Local Prison, Cell 1 Ryunosuke: Lord van Zieks is still reading that letter. Susato: We've been gone quite some time, though... Ryunosuke: Either he's an incredibly slow reader...or it's an incredibly long letter... I might even be able to read English faster than he can. Van Zieks: I was intending to ignore you entirely... ...but I can't turn a deaf ear to such an insulting Nipponese. Ryunosuke: Oh! Um...sorry. I didn't think you'd hear that. Van Zieks: I had the case notes brought to me in secret. I was reading them to pass the time. Susato: Yes, we heard that your trial is set for tomorrow. Van Zieks: Which is none of your business. Ryunosuke: So...have you found a lawyer? Van Zieks: How many times must I reiterate the same thing: this is nothing to do with you. Ryunosuke: (In other words, no.) Susato: We were just talking to Lord Stronghart and...the prosecutor for your trial has been decided. Van Zieks: I'd expect nothing less. Though I have no idea who it is. Ryunosuke: It's...going to be Kazuma Asogi. Van Zieks: ...! Asogi?! Ryunosuke: (That made the colour drain from his face...) Van Zieks: Haah, well then... ...it seems I'm going to have to engage in conversation with you again after all. After clearing all Converse options and presenting Gregson's Photograph: Van Zieks: ......... Mister...Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: Oh! (That's the first time he's ever used my actual name.) Van Zieks: I've lost all confidence in my country's justice system. I don't trust the police, the judiciary or lawyers. But there's still one thing I'm willing to believe in. Ryunosuke: What's that? Van Zieks: That which you see in the eyes of another across the courtroom: a simple determination to know the truth. Ryunosuke: L-Lord van Zieks... Van Zieks: From the very first time we clashed in the Bailey almost a year ago now... ...I couldn't deny it, even though I dearly wished I could. 'Here is a loathsome Nipponese...who has absolute integrity as a lawyer.' Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: There are only two other men I've known with that same look in their eyes: My brother, Klint. ...And Genshin Asogi. Ryunosuke: (The man he idolised and the man who betrayed his trust in the most hideous way...) Van Zieks: ......... When you showed me that photograph just now, it reminded me... Ryunosuke: You mean, this photograph? Van Zieks: Back then I was able to laugh. I was free of the shackles of mistrust that plague me now. I looked to the future with hope. Since then I've protected myself against betrayal by refusing to trust anyone. But at times the mire into which I've sunk makes it almost impossible to breathe. Ryunosuke: I'm...so sorry... Van Zieks: ......... So Mr Naruhodo... ...I want to believe in that look in your eyes. I need to believe in it. ...In tomorrow's trial...will you advocate for me? Ryunosuke: ......... Of course I will. It would be an honour. Susato: I'm so pleased, Mr Naruhodo. Van Zieks: Then my life is in your hands. Ryunosuke: (For Lord van Zieks... ...that must have been an incredibly hard thing to ask. Which is why I simply cannot let the man down. Tomorrow...in the Old Bailey...against my old friend, Kazuma!) To be continued...\nVan Zieks: I was investigating Gregson, and my inquiries had led me to that address.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You were investigating the inspector? What on earth for? Van Zieks: ......... I'm not at liberty to say. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Van Zieks: I'd identified a distinct possibility that Gregson was involved in a case I was investigating. Regrettably, though...he was killed before I could secure the proof I needed. Judge: Is the court to understand then, that on the day in question you followed the victim to the scene? Van Zieks: ...No. I was privy to his movements in advance. Ryunosuke: How? Van Zieks: I stole into his office in the Yard and consulted his diary. The address on Fresno Street was noted in the 5 p.m. entry. Kazuma: You illegally entered the man's office? In Japan that alone would constitute a very serious offence. Judge: As it does in Great Britain, I assure you. Is that not the case, Lord van Zieks? Van Zieks: ...I was aware of the possible consequences. Kazuma: So, in summary, you were investigating the victim... ...and yet you refuse to tell the court why. Van Zieks: ......... Kazuma: I didn't realise British prosecutors enjoyed such freedom to choose what to divulge under oath. Ryunosuke: Ugh... (Why did I ever think I could defend this man?)Van Zieks: When I first entered the room that day, it was dark inside and I saw no one.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Had you ever been to the address before? Van Zieks: No, never. I only learnt of the place as a result of my investigations into Gregson's activities. There was no light inside when I entered, so it was all but impossible to make out anything. Ryunosuke: But at 5 p.m. the sun would only just have gone down. It would still have been reasonably light outside. Van Zieks: The room has a window, but it was boarded shut. Very little light found its way into the room from outside, so it was extremely murky inside. I wouldn't have noticed if the victim was already lying on the floor. Kazuma: There was no artificial light in the room, you say? You're quite sure? Van Zieks: I'm quite sure that the part of the room where the body was found was very dark. I have a feeling there was a small oil lamp burning on the desk, though I couldn't say for certain. Susato: Look, Mr Naruhodo... There is a small desk in the room just here. Ryunosuke: Yes, I remember. And there was an oil lamp on it. As well as the framed photograph. Van Zieks: When I entered the room, I closed the door behind me and started towards the desk to investigate. Ryunosuke: And what did you find? Van Zieks: Nothing. I never actually reached the desk.Van Zieks: A moment later, I heard the gunshot. I spun around, and saw the revolver on the floor.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So...who fired the gun? Van Zieks: I have no idea. I didn't see anybody else in the room. Ryunosuke: But you say it was very dark in there? Van Zieks: Yes, that's right. All I can tell you is, I didn't sense another's presence. Ryunosuke: Aha! Then could it be... ...that the gunshot actually originated from somewhere outside the room?! Van Zieks: No, that's out of the question. Ryunosuke: Oh. Van Zieks: Without doubt, the sound emanated from inside the room. I could smell the gunpowder. Ryunosuke: (Ugh, this is going from bad to worse...) Kazuma: And you say that's the point at which you noticed the revolver on the floor? Van Zieks: Correct. And I foolishly picked it up. That was carelessness on my part. Judge: Presumably, then, the gunshot you heard came from the firearm that you somewhat hastily took in your hands. Van Zieks: In point of fact, My Lord...I believe it did not. Ryunosuke: What? Van Zieks: The barrel of the revolver I picked up was cold, and there was no smell of spent powder. Ryunosuke: But, but then...where on earth is the gun that WAS fired? Van Zieks: Whilst I would like to oblige you with an answer... ...I'm afraid I can't. I, too, would dearly like to know that. Ryunosuke: Uuuuuugh...Van Zieks: Just as I picked the firearm up to examine it, the door flew open and I heard a man scream.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: A man, you say? One of the witnesses, I presume? Kazuma: That's right. One of the street merchants working on Fresno Street. Judge: Who are these merchants? Kazuma: A number of them had set up their stalls directly beneath the boarded window of the crime scene. A match-seller, a newsmonger and a pedlar. They've all given statements saying they heard the gunshot. And without thought of danger, they ran inside to see what had happened. Susato: Yes...Gina told us about that yesterday, didn't she? Kazuma: They burst through the door with some force, it would seem. Van Zieks: They did. And almost gave me a heart attack in the process. Ryunosuke: (But you're supposed to be the Reaper...) Van Zieks: The first man to come in immediately noticed the revolver in my hand and fled. Kazuma: A policeman patrolling on Fresno Street heard the commotion... ...and was able to arrest the accused shortly after the incident occurred. Van Zieks: Anyway, the man's scream drew my attention in that direction.Van Zieks: It was only then that the body of Inspector Gregson appeared before me.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Um...what do you mean by that? In what way did the body 'appear'? Van Zieks: I honestly can't explain it. But it's the truth. As far as I was concerned, the body hadn't been there until that point, and then suddenly...there it was. Ryunosuke: Did you perhaps hear the sound of the victim falling to the ground just beforehand? Van Zieks: ......... At that moment, what I heard... ...was the sound of the door flying open and the scream of the man who came inside first. Nothing more. Ryunosuke: I see... Van Zieks: After the man fled, I examined the body. I was stunned to find that it was Gregson. Judge: Hmmm... Most curious circumstances indeed. Van Zieks: How the inspector was killed, or how his body seemed to appear out of nowhere... ...I have no idea.Ryunosuke: (So...that's Lord van Zieks's account.)Susato: Do you have any thoughts, Mr Naruhodo?Ryunosuke: Yes...mainly that it really doesn't ring true in all sorts of ways. Who fired the gun if there was nobody else there? And how did the corpse just appear in front of him?Susato: So...you think that Lord van Zieks is lying?Ryunosuke: No, I don't think that. I mean, if he was going to lie... ...I would expect him to have come up with a more credible story, wouldn't you?Susato: Yes, I completely agree. I think he genuinely doesn't know what really happened himself. So we must do what we can to fill in the gaps.Ryunosuke: Yes, first and foremost, we need more information!After pressing all statements:Kazuma:Kazuma: Surely the court has heard enough!Ryunosuke: ...!Kazuma: My Lord, the cross-examination has clearly revealed... ...that the accused, Barok van Zieks...is lying on multiple fronts!Ryunosuke: Wha... What is THAT supposed to mean?!Judge: ...Good gracious, Counsel!The defendant is lying, you say?Kazuma: In his testimony just now... ...he claims that he failed to notice the victim's body because the room was dark.Van Zieks: That's correct.Kazuma: No...that's impossible. As proven by this candelabrum.Ryunosuke: How does that prove anything?Kazuma: If you examine the tip of the long candle, you can see it has been blown off by a powerful impact.Judge: One would assume that the projectile from the firearm passed through the victim and struck the candle.Kazuma: The problem comes when you consider the other two candles, which are clearly of a different length.Judge: Yes, I can see that only the candle that appears to have been struck by the bullet is long.Kazuma: We could reasonably expect someone to have lit all three candles together. Which begs the question of why only one has ended up longer than the others.Ryunosuke: That...must be because that particular candle was extinguished when the others were still burning... ...Ah!Kazuma: That's right. When the candle was hit by the bullet, it obviously went out. But the other two candles would still have been burning. So the fact is... ...the victim's body would have been illuminated by the light still thrown by the candelabrum! And the accused's claim that he couldn't see the body... clearly contradicts those facts!Van Zieks: ...!Kazuma: And now to the next lie.Ryunosuke: There's more?!Kazuma: The accused also claims never to have visited the scene of the crime before.Van Zieks: That's the truth.Kazuma: In that almost empty room, the police discovered something very unusual. A board covered from top to bottom in police documents and newspaper cuttings.Susato: Yes, that's right. We saw it, too.Kazuma: It goes without saying that the contents of the police documents cannot be divulged. However... ...they included a number of reports from various historical cases. The oldest of which...was from ten years ago.Ryunosuke: (Ten years ago? This is starting to sound familiar...)Kazuma: And there is a common thread linking all of the documents on that board.Judge: Indeed? What is this common thread, Counsel?Kazuma: They all relate to cases prosecuted in court by Barok van Zieks.Ryunosuke: All of them?Kazuma: And furthermore...all those cases are ones in which the defendant was acquitted.Judge: Good Lord!Kazuma: Interestingly, none of those defendants are alive today. Because all of them have been sent to their graves...by the Reaper.Ryunosuke: Ah!Susato: Oh no...Kazuma: In short! That dingy little room... ...is the Reaper's secret hideout...and his base of operations!Ryunosuke: The, the Reaper's hideout?!Kazuma: And yet the Reaper would claim never to have been to his own secret hideout? No one would believe that. No, the truth is...we've been looking at this backwards.Judge: Backwards? Explain, Counsel!Kazuma: Inspector Gregson was investigating the identity of the Reaper. When he discovered the location of the man's secret hideout...he was killed. As I'm sure everyone can imagine...by the Reaper's hand!Ryunosuke: Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAT?!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! Very well. I hereby state the current opinion of the court. Barok van Zieks is an outstanding prosecutor who has rendered great service to his country. However, it is with deep regret that I must concur with Prosecutor Asogi's contention... ...that the defendant's testimony exhibits a number of stark inconsistencies with the known facts.Van Zieks: All I have done is state the truth as I know it.Ryunosuke: (Kazuma's done a brilliant job as ever. He's drawing on his experience as a defence attorney to build his prosecution case...and it's formidable.)Judge: Counsel... ...you will submit the board that you just showed the court as evidence. I believe it to be fundamental in establishing the facts surrounding the Reaper's existence.Kazuma: Thank you, My Lord.The noticeboard has been entered into the Court Record.Kazuma: And now, the prosecution would like to call new witnesses to the stand. Witnesses who saw events unfold on the day in question.Examine evidence Noticeboard Front of board Susato: There are details of a whole raft of cases dating back years on here, aren't there? Ryunosuke: This paper from ten years ago is browning with age, look. Susato: Out of interest, the most recent thing appears to be this newspaper cutting here. Ryunosuke: Oh. It's the same Red-Headed League advertisement that Mr Sholmes had picked out. Susato: And do you remember? There was a red hairpiece at the scene, too. Ryunosuke: (Was Inspector Gregson an exponent of the Red-Headed League, then?) Bloody handprint on back Susato: ......... Oh. What's this...? Mr Naruhodo! Look! Ryunosuke: Oh yes. It's a smudge of some kind. In fact... ...it looks just like a handprint. Susato: And the colour... That's blood, isn't it? Oh dear... How disturbing... The details of the noticeboard have been updated in the Court Record. Bloody handprint on back (subsequent times) Susato: ......... Oh. What's this...? Mr Naruhodo! Look! Ryunosuke: Oh yes. It's a smudge of some kind. In fact... ...it looks just like a handprint. Susato: And the colour... That's blood, isn't it? Oh dear... How disturbing...Susato: They were mentioned in the previous testimony too, if you remember.Ryunosuke: Yes. The street sellers who heard the gunshot and went running into the room.Judge: Very well, lead the witnesses in! The defendant may step down from the witness stand.Van Zieks: Certainly, My Lord.Kazuma: So...witnesses. State your names and occupations for the court.???: Names?! We don't use names. Far too fancy for the likes of uz.???: We're just free an' easy. Sell what we like, live where we wanna live...???: I g-give them all a vacant stare as they w-walk down Fresno, and spin a few w-words into a verse for them.Judge: Ah... Would I be right in assuming that all three of you make your living by selling wares on the street?Gossip: Hehe, everyone calls me Gossip. I sell jaunty little titbits to passers-by, you know.Ryunosuke: Jaunty little titbits?Gossip: Got an absolute smasher for you, sir. Right up your ginnel, it is! Sixpence is the price, and not a penny less!Ryunosuke: ......... Wait! You're, you're actually trying to sell it to me now?Gossip: Oh, c'mon sir! Don't tell me you're not interested!Kazuma: Try the man.Susato: Give him the money and see what it is!Judge: Pay the man, Counsel.Ryunosuke: Alright, alright, sixpence it is.Gossip: You won't regret it, sir! Now, got your listenin' ears on? Just between uz...a young couple on Sleight Street have just had twins!Ryunosuke: .........Gossip: .........Ryunosuke: .........  Um...is that it?Gossip: No, that's not it. It's gossip, in't it? It wants to spread. But that bit's up to you and your mouth, of course. I've got more, you know. Want another juicy one? Sixpence a piece, it is. If you're curious...Ryunosuke: (I am curious, yes. About what's going on just under that fat bottom lip of yours. Namely that unusual bruise or whatever it is that's poking out from under your collar...)Kazuma: What about the next witness, then? What name do you go by and what do you sell?Venus: Me? I'm Venus. That's what everyone calls me. Funny, innit? I sell these lovely little fireworks to all the local school kids. Sixpence a pop! What d'you say?Ryunosuke: You weren't exaggerating with 'little'. Do they actually sell?Venus: Oh yeah. The second years can't get enough of my Venus firecrackers. 'Specially when I tell 'em that if they get a hundred they could blow up the school!Judge: Not the most savoury of ideas, young lady.Venus: What d'you say then, eh? Wanna part with sixpence for a pop?Ryunosuke: Wait, what?! You, you want me to buy one?Venus: Tell you what, I'll let you in on a little secret: If you get a hundred of 'em, you could blow up the whole courtroom!Kazuma: Try the woman.Susato: Give her the money and see if she's right!Judge: Pay the woman, Counsel.Ryunosuke: Alright, alright, I'll buy one.Venus: Lovely stuff! Right then...this is something a bit extra, just for you: The Venus Special! Only six 'undred pence!Ryunosuke: S-Six hundred!Venus: It's a hundred of my regular fireworks. Nothing 'little' about that, is there?Ryunosuke: (And there'd be nothing little about the punishment if I blew up the Old Bailey, either.)The Venus firecracker has been entered into the Court Record.Kazuma: And the last witness... What name do you go by and what do you sell?Examine evidence Venus Firecracker Fuse Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: Have you had an idea, Mr Naruhodo? You're staring at the end of the string of fireworks. Ryunosuke: Sorry. It's just that it's the 'Venus Special'. I was wondering what six hundred pence worth of fireworks would sound like. Susato: ......... Shall we find out? Ryunosuke: What? B-But...she said it could blow up the courtroom! ...*BANG!* Ryunosuke: ......... A-Alright, that was a fairly sizeable bang. Susato: My ears are still ringing, Mr Naruhodo. It sounded almost exactly like... The details of the Venus firecracker have been updated in the Court Record. Fuse (subsequent times) Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: Have you had an idea, Mr Naruhodo? You're staring at the end of the string of fireworks. Ryunosuke: Sorry. It's just that it's the 'Venus Special'. I was wondering what six hundred pence worth of fireworks would sound like. Susato: ......... Shall we find out? Ryunosuke: What? B-But...she said it could blow up the courtroom! ...*BANG!* Ryunosuke: ......... A-Alright, that was a fairly sizeable bang. Susato: My ears are still ringing, Mr Naruhodo. It sounded almost exactly like...???: I'm a th-thinker me. Think all sorts of thoughts. I think, therefore I am. I am, therefore I think...I think. Because I stand there on the street, w-watchin' the w-world go on about me, they call me 'The Observator'.Gossip: Get out if it, old man! Everyone calls you Sandwich and you know it.Kazuma: So...you don't actually sell anything?Sandwich: A p-p-problem shared is a problem halved, as they say. I give advice, I do. And think w-what it means. I d-don't actually sell anything, no...come to think of it.Kazuma: Pity.Ryunosuke: (No more purchases today...please.)Judge: Well, we have quite a cast here, it seems.Kazuma: They conduct their business on Fresno Street from morning until night, My Lord. And always in the same place: directly adjacent to the crime scene.Judge: I see. And thus they heard the gunshot, I suppose.Kazuma: Not only that, but they very bravely ran inside to see what was going on and witnessed the crime.Gossip: Well I'll be beggared, I thought! ...Just between uz.Venus: Venus de Milo, what am I to do? What a terrible thing I saw!Sandwich: W-What I think is...if all w-what we see is light and shadow, p-playing with our eyes...is any of it real?Judge: Very well. The court will hear the formal testimony of these three witnesses now. You will describe in detail what you witnessed and heard at the time of the incident.Witness Testimony - The Witnesses' Account -Gossip: We saw the whole thing from start to finish, we did. Everything from the moment they went in the building.Venus: It was less than a minute after the Reaper had gone inside that we all 'eard a big bang.Sandwich: Seems to m-me that quick-to-talk is quick-to-walk. Gossip couldn't wait to go and see what had happened.Gossip: I ran into the room and there he woz. The Reaper, gun in hand, standin' over the dead body!Venus: I was scared 'alf to death, me. So I ran off to find a copper.Ryunosuke: If these witnesses were there the whole day and saw everything... ...who did they see going inside the building?Kazuma: Only the victim, Inspector Gregson, and the accused, Barok van Zieks.Gossip: I've seen pictures of that Reaper in the paper. I know what he looks like. And just between uz...folk love stories like this. I've made meself a tidy sum already.Ryunosuke: But wait! The room was just one of several flats in the building. Someone from another flat could have done it!Kazuma: All those flats on Fresno Street are unoccupied.Gossip: 'Course they are. They're small, damp, dirty and expensive to boot.Kazuma: The room in which the inspector was found is the only property in the building that's currently leased.Susato: And we know the leaseholder's name, don't we. It's...Hugh Boone.Judge: Hmmm... The testimony the court has just heard would appear to leave little room for doubt. It's becoming increasingly difficult to see how anyone other than the defendant could have committed the crime.Ryunosuke: No!Kazuma: Thank you for your candour, My Lord.Judge: Counsel for the Defence, you may proceed to cross-examine the witnesses.Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord!

'I wonder exactly how many mysteries are out there, hidden within this bed of fog,' he said. Indeed, a most bizarre incident born of a curious advertisement... a hell-hound's mad gallop through the shadows of a serial murder, an executed man's graveyard resurrection in the dead of night... and a commonplace killing in a small, forgotten room at the edge of town... There is, naturally, always another side to every case of which most remain ignorant. 'And it is that \"other side\" which compels me to the scene of the crime, Wilson. So, quickly now. Take your hat and let's be on our way, my dear fellow. For our adventure is not over yet. Come! The game is afoot!' Eight days after that earth-shattering trial and Kazuma regaining his memory... ...we were in the foyer of one of London's most luxurious hotels, the Great Waterloo Hotel. 1st November, 10:24 a.m. Great Waterloo Hotel Foyer Ryunosuke: Professor Mikotoba is due to arrive at any moment. Susato: Yes! I'm so glad we got here in time! ......... Ryunosuke: (Susato-san hasn't been the same since what happened. Not that I'm surprised.) Susato: The truth about Kazuma-sama's father... Ryunosuke: ...! Susato: Do you suppose my father knew? Ryunosuke: That he was actually the mass murderer, the Professor, you mean? (I knew that's what she was thinking about.) There's a good chance, I'd say. I mean... ...they did come here to London together sixteen years ago, didn't they? Susato: Yes, that's true... Ryunosuke: ......... Come to think of it, didn't you say... ...that Professor Mikotoba knew about Kazuma going missing in Hong Kong as well? Susato: That's right. But for some reason, he wasn't at liberty to talk to me about it. Ryunosuke: (That probably means he knows, then... ...about Kazuma showing up here in London with amnesia, and that he's regained his memory now.) Susato: ......... ???: Ah, there she is! Susato: Oh... Father! Mikotoba: Hello, Susato! How are you? Susato: I'm very well, thank you. We're delighted you've arrived safe and sound! Mikotoba: Hello, Mr Naruhodo. Very kind of you to take the trouble to meet us here. Ryunosuke: Oh no, not at all. It's my pleasure. ???: We've heard all about your extraordinary exploits here in London, you know. The news has crossed the seas. Ryunosuke: It, it has? ???: I always look forward to reading the monthly reports that arrive with the steamships from Britain. Ryunosuke: Oh...I, I see. Well...thank you very much! (Who is this man? And why do I feel as though I've seen him before?) ???: Hm... I take it from your expression that you can't quite place me. Mikotoba: In that case...how about a little reminder, Seishiro? A firm tap should do it. ???: Yes... Ryunosuke: (A, a firm tap? What?) ???: Here we go, then... I hereby pronounce the defendant, Ryunosuke Naruhodo... ...GUILTY! Ryunosuke: Ah... OOOOOOH! Y-You're... Judge: The court will now hear the trial of Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Y... Your... ...Your Excellency! Susato: Hello, Judge Jigoku, how are you? It's been a long time. Jigoku: Hah hah hah hah hah! Good, you've remembered now! That really did the trick! Guilty! Hah hah hah hah hah! Ryunosuke: (Only I was declared not guilty, wasn't I? And there was no laughing at the time...) Jigoku: So, London again after all this time... Hard to believe it's been ten years. To be honest, I never thought I'd be back. Mikotoba: Neither did I. I didn't imagine Japan would ever be invited to an international symposium like this. Though, really, I doubt anyone did, to be honest. It's all thanks to you, isn't it, Seishiro? Jigoku: What are you talking about, Yujin? Hah hah hah hah hah! Ryunosuke: (Of course, Judge Jigoku... He must complete the set. He's the other man, who sixteen years ago... ...came to London with Kazuma's father and Professor Mikotoba. He's the third visiting scholar.) Mikotoba: Well, all those passport checks and luggage searches at the border took rather a lot of time. I must say, I'm very envious of your ministerial status. You didn't have to go through any of that, did you? Jigoku: Ah, I knew you were jealous! Hah hah hah hah hah! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Ministerial status? Mikotoba: Yes, didn't you know? Seishiro here is also Japan's Minister of Foreign Affairs. It was his personal insistence that allowed you to take Kazuma's place here on this study tour. Jigoku: Guilty as charged! Hah hah hah hah hah! Ryunosuke: Oh. Well, thank you very much. (He's really every bit as important as he looks.) Mikotoba: Ah yes now, Naruhodo... I received a telegram from Lord Stronghart yesterday. Ryunosuke: Oh, you did? Mikotoba: It appears that...some things came to light in a trial you were involved with eight days ago. About what happened ten years ago. That...tragedy. Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: Yes. Could you tell us any more about it? After clearing all Converse options: Mikotoba: Well, if you'll excuse us now... Jigoku: Yes, I'd like to get this trunk up to my room as soon as possible. Ryunosuke: Oh, I...I'm so sorry! I shouldn't have held you up here for so long. Susato: I'll call for the porter, then. Just wait here! Ryunosuke: (Susato-san's gone off at a run!) Mikotoba: I'd like to stay and talk more, but I do have various preparations to make for tomorrow. Ryunosuke: Yes, of course! It must be a big responsibility representing our entire country. I wish you the best of luck! Mikotoba: ......... Naruhodo... ...I hope you'll keep an eye on Susato for me. Keep looking after her as you obviously have been. Ryunosuke: Oh no! I, I mean, if anyone's looking after anyone, it's her looking after me! Mikotoba: Well I do appreciate you being there for her. After all... ...I've been a miserable father to her. I've thoroughly let her down. Ryunosuke: Sorry? What do you mean? Mikotoba: ......... Well, it was sixteen years ago that I started my long study tour here in Britain, as you know. The very year Susato was born. Ryunosuke: ...Yes, I heard. Mikotoba: The birth of my daughter was the most joyous event of my life, but... Well, sadly it was accompanied by the most tragic event of my life, too. Ryunosuke: (Oh...yes... Susato-san hinted at something like that...) Susato: It was a rather turbulent time at home... Mikotoba: ...Anyway, I won't bore you with the details. The point is, I became rather less dependable than befits a grown man. And it was then that Seishiro offered me the opportunity to study here in Great Britain. Jigoku: I was too worried about you to leave you behind. So perhaps I was a little heavy-handed when it came to persuading you to accompany me to London. Mikotoba: So...that's what happened in a nutshell. And that's also the reason why I now feel compelled to give my daughter as many opportunities as I dare. Though the world does not readily afford young women such things, I must say. Ryunosuke: I...completely understand, Professor. Mikotoba: ......... Ah, one other thing, Naruhodo... If I may be so bold, I have a favour to ask you. Ryunosuke: Oh, really? Of course! What can I do for you? Mikotoba: Well, the thing is, I- Susato: I'm so sorry that took so long! Ryunosuke: Miss Susato! Susato: Now then...allow us to take your bags! Porter: Allow me to take your bags! Mikotoba: One moment, if you please, porter. Porter: Of...of course, sir! Mikotoba: That machine around your neck... It's a camera, I believe? Porter: Quite right, sir! Just five shillings for a lovely photograph to commemorate a wonderful stay at the hotel, sir! Mikotoba: Well, I think given the occasion, we could justify the expense. Porter: ......... Ah! Yes, yes of course! Susato: ...I'd like to thank you for coming with me, Mr Naruhodo. It's really made Father very happy, I think. Ryunosuke: Oh, well, I'm pleased, then. (But we were interrupted before. Professor Mikotoba was about to ask me something.) Susato: Shall we return to Baker Street, then? I expect Iris will have some delicious tea waiting for us! Ryunosuke: Yes, let's go. (I'm getting more and more anxious about Kazuma, though. Perhaps I'll try to meet with Lord Stronghart later and ask after him...) 1st November British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Van Zieks: Here's the final draft of the opening address for tomorrow's proceedings. I've supplemented your original with the figures you asked for from the Yard. Stronghart: I see. Excellent work. Thank you. Van Zieks: ...You're welcome, My Lord. Ryunosuke: (What's Lord van Zieks doing here...?) Susato: My, there seems to be an awful lot of tension in the air, wouldn't you say? Ryunosuke: (This place is stifling enough as it is. We really don't need any more tension.) Stronghart: My apologies. I didn't notice you come in. Your small stature and dark dress make you all but invisible to me. Ryunosuke: Oh! No no! It's entirely my fault for wearing black, I'm sure. Susato: From now on, you must dress in white from head to toe whenever you come here! Stronghart: Now then, Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: Y-Yes, My Lord! I'm right here! Stronghart: ......... Ryunosuke: ......... (Ugh... Kill me now...) Stronghart: Is something wrong? Perhaps it's a little too hot in here for you. Ryunosuke: Oh, no, not at all! I mean, I've never experienced a room at such a perfect temperature! Stronghart: If you're sure. The beads of sweat carving their way down your face seem to suggest otherwise. Ryunosuke: (Because of the daggers you're staring at me with, mainly.) Stronghart: As you're no doubt aware, my International Forensic Science Symposium begins tomorrow. In fact, your father arrived in London earlier today, I hear, madam. Susato: Oh! Yes, that's right, My Lord. He's extremely honoured to have been invited. Stronghart: I'll leave the remaining preparations for the meeting room in your capable hands then, Lord van Zieks. Van Zieks: I will attend at once. Susato: He gave you a very cold stare as he left, didn't he? Ryunosuke: I know. But I haven't done anything...have I? Stronghart: These past few days, my feet have barely touched the ground, I must say. My dedicated right hand of many years was recently put out of action in spectacular fashion. Ryunosuke: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. ...Is your left hand still of service? Susato: Mr Naruhodo! He's talking about Dr Sithe! Ryunosuke: Ah! (Of course...) I'm, I'm terribly sorry about that. I was just, um... Stronghart: Fear not. You've done nothing wrong. Dr Sithe's own wrongdoing precipitated the situation. You needn't concern yourself with it any further. Ryunosuke: (That would be a lot easier to do if it weren't for the piercing stare you're giving me...) Stronghart: Lord van Zieks is doing an admirable job of holding the fort. Though disturbingly, his apprentice has been missing since yesterday. Ryunosuke: O-Oh... (Missing...?) Susato: What's become of Kazuma-sama now...? 1st November Sholmes's Suite ???: Uèèèèèèèèèèèèè uèèèèèèèèèèèèèèè! Ryunosuke: W-What was that?! Susato: A, a man screaming! In a most unflattering way! Ryunosuke: Do you think... Could it have been Mr Sholmes? Susato: Oh my! I do hope not... ???: Uèèèèèèèèèèèè! I don't-a do it any more! ???: Mon ami, mon ami... Stop zis disgraceful display, uh? Ryunosuke: Who, who are these people? (Look at their hair! It's bright red...) Susato: I think...they must be clients of Mr Sholmes. Gina: Right, you two. Yer comin' wiv me now. Down to the clink. ???: No! Not in prison! It is dark and damp and I don't-a like it! ???: Bof! Ze darkness, it is my friend. I am not scared! ???: Uèèè uèèèèèèèèèèèè! But you are always scared of the dark! ???: Shut your mouth, you idiot! I will sit quietly in ze dark and plan our next daring 'eist! ???: Uèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèè! I don't-a like this! I don't-a like it! Gina: Well tough! We'll finish this down the Yard! Now get movin'! Iris: By then, Ginny! Have fun! Gina: Oh yeah, thanks, Iris! And thanks...ya great detective! Susato: Heehee! Gina makes a fine detective herself, doesn't she? Iris: Oh, Susie! And Runo! Ryunosuke: Hello, Iris. We're home! Iris: Well? Did you find your daddy? Susato: Yes! We arrived at the hotel just before he and his friend. Iris: Oh! Well that's great news. I hope I'll get to see my daddy again soon... Susato: Ah...yes...of course... Ryunosuke: (Dr John H. Wilson...) ???: So, Iris! All that remains now is that greatest of problems known to man! Sholmes: But before we concern ourselves with that, I believe some tea is in order, don't you, my dear fellows? Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: ......... Sholmes: Is something wrong, Mr Naruhodo? Do I have a crumb or suchlike on my face? Ryunosuke: Uh... (Not so much on your face... ...as on your head, I'd say.) Iris: Come along then, everyone. I've brewed a lovely special blend. Time for tea! Susato: Whatever is going on here today? Sholmes: In that case, let us sit and drink now. For I am in fact expecting a guest later today. After clearing Converse options with Herlock Sholmes and clearing all Converse options in British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office: *Ding-aling-aling* Sholmes: Aha! Here is my guest now. My latest client! With money to spend! Iris: Ooh, I do hope it's an exciting case, Hurley! Sholmes: Remember, Iris, we are at present gripped by the greatest problem known to man. I must be willing to accept any case, no matter how unstimulating. Save locating a runaway, of course. Ryunosuke: ...Don't spare anyone's feelings, will you? Iris: Oh dear... I'm afraid that Hurley can lack a little tact, especially just before the rent is due. *Thwack!* ???: Mr Sholmes! Mr Herlock Sholmes! Please... Oh, please... ...please find my husband! He's run away! Sholmes: To upset me? ???: I beg your pardon? Sholmes: Never mind. A personal matter. My apologies. What exactly are you trying to say, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: ...I didn't say a word. Sholmes: Come, my dear madam, be seated. Iris, some tea, if you please? Iris: Of course! Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: What's the matter, Miss Susato? Susato: Oh, it's...it's just that gentlewoman... I feel sure I've seen her somewhere before. Very recently. Ryunosuke: (...! Yes, now you come to mention it...) Evie: As I explained earlier, my name is Evie Vigil. I implore you to take the case, sir! Money is no object. Simply name your figure! Sholmes: Money and wealth are of little consequence to me, madam. Being offered a case to solve is reward enough. Evie: Oh, Mr Sholmes! You are the picture of benevolence! Sholmes: I will of course make a mental note of your offer, however. For...contingent reasons. I trust you will remember your words also. Evie: Um...if I might enquire, sir... ...this gentleman and lady would be...? Ryunosuke: Oh! Um...me? Evie: What I am about to tell you, I should like to communicate in the strictest confidence, you understand. Sholmes: Ah, these are my friends. I assure you, you may say before this pair anything which you may say to me. Evie: Ah...I see... Sholmes: I can vouch for the gentleman personally. After all... ...he's hard of hearing. Ryunosuke: (...Why did I ever get my hopes up?) After clearing all Converse options: Sholmes: Thank you for everything you have shared with us, Mrs Vigil. I believe I have all the information I need to begin my investigation. Evie: Oh, please report to me soon with good news, sir! Sholmes: Fear not, madam. In a day or two, I shall be contacting you with a heartening report, I'm quite sure. Evie: So soon? Oh, how splendid, Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: Good news should be delivered early, I always say. If you would be so kind as to leave the photograph of your husband in my possession...? The photograph of Mr Vigil has been entered into the Court Record. Sholmes: Thank you. Now, allow me to show you the door. Evie: I can't thank you enough, Mr Sholmes. You've been simply marvellous! Iris: You know, I think it every time, Hurley... ...but how do you come out with such nonsense? Good news in a day or two? Are you sure? Sholmes: I can't be sure, of course. But then I didn't swear on it. I merely gave the good woman some hope. I hope to be able to give her good news, one might say. After all, the rent must be paid by the end of day tomorrow. If by that time I've successfully located Mr Vigil, we shall be mutually relieved. Wouldn't you agree, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: ...Don't look at me with those pleading eyes. Sholmes: Well, my dear fellow? Did you hear the details of the case? Ryunosuke: Yes...my hearing is surprisingly good, actually. Sholmes: Excellent! And what did you make of it? Ryunosuke: Well, I was surprised to learn where her husband worked. At Barclay Prison, I mean... Sholmes: Ah, so you noted that? Susato: Of course. Especially with the mention of Lowgate Cemetery... Drebber: Lowgate Cemetery as at the rear of Barclay Prison. So it was renowned among us students at the university for being haunted by the ghosts of condemned convicts. Susato: Barclay Prison is where that notorious man was incarcerated! Ryunosuke: The Professor... Sholmes: And now a warder from the prison has mysteriously disappeared, it would seem. Ryunosuke: It's all very peculiar... Sholmes: Indeed. But nothing you can't handle, I'm quite certain, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: Run along to the prison and see what you can glean, would you? It's the prison governor you want. No doubt the man is equally worried. Ryunosuke: But...aren't you going to go yourself? Sholmes: Surely you needn't ask. I can't possibly be seen out with this hair! Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: ...But didn't you go to Lime Street with that hair? Sholmes: That was a quite different matter. So, I leave it in your capable hands. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm rather busy. Ryunosuke: (Of course you are...) 1st November, 10:24 a.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy Barclay Prison is on the outskirts of London, backing onto a lonely burial ground. Its four high outer walls loomed quietly before us in the fog. Having requested a meeting, we were shown to the governor's office in the watchtower. 1st November Barclay Prison, Governor's Office ???: This place is full of hardened criminals. I cannae remember the last time a civilian was doon here. And you dinnae want to talk to an inmate, but to me? Caidin: D'you ken who I am? I'm the governor, Barry Caidin......... hm? Ryunosuke: Oh...yes...it's a pleasure. I'm Ryunosuke Naruhodo, defence lawyer. Caidin: And an Easterner, I see. Does that mean... Ryunosuke: Yes, I'm a visiting student of law from the Empire of Japan. Caidin: Japan?! Did ye say Japan? Ryunosuke: Um...yes? Caidin: Well there's no any of your kind in here, laddie! Maybe you should try the prison next door, eh? Susato: I didn't notice another prison next door, sir... Ryunosuke: Anyway, we came to ask you some questions about- Caidin: I dinnae like to be so direct, but... ...I've no intention of speaking wi' the likes o' you suspicious-looking Easterners. Now get oot of my hair. Ryunosuke: (So as soon as he finds out that we're from Japan, he reacts like this... That surely means...) Susato: I think...it's because of the Professor case. Ryunosuke: You think so too? (Ten years ago... ...Genshin Asogi - also known as the Professor - was incarcerated at this prison.) And then, after his execution, he apparently re-merged from his grave in the cemetery behind the prison. Caidin: I, I might 'ave known! You're sniffing around aboot that case, aren't ya? You're agents, eh? Part of the Professor's great web, no doubt. Ryunosuke: No! Not at all! We're just- Caidin: Get gone wi' ya! Before I punch yer lights oot! Ryunosuke: We're going, we're going! (Clearly the ghost of that killer still haunts this place... We're not going to get anywhere here. Unless we can somehow prove to this man that there's nothing suspicious about us...) Susato: Governor Caidin... Ryunosuke: What are you thinking, Miss Susato? Susato: I feel sure that name came up in conversation recently somewhere. I was wondering if whoever mentioned him might have some ideas to help us. Ryunosuke: (Come to think of it, I have the same feeling...) Great Waterloo Hotel Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Barclay Prison, Governor's Office Ryunosuke: If you'd just cast your eyes over this, Governor Caidin... Caidin: What's this then? You cannae pull the wool over my eyes, you good-fer-nothin' Japanese student! ......... Mikotoba? That, that young jock from the forensics laboratory? That Mikotoba? Ryunosuke: Yes! Exactly! Him! Susato: Oh dear, perhaps I should have said something sooner... I'm Yujin Mikotoba's daughter, Susato. Caidin: Jings! You're the young man's daughter? And ya did'nae think to mention that afore? Susato: I, I do apologise... Caidin: Aye, well, ye'd best take a seat then. Can I offer you a cup of tea, perhaps? And dinnae forget to try one of these wee handcuff biscuits! Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: Your father's influence is nothing short of amazing... Susato: I'm bitterly regretting not announcing who I was from the outset now. Caidin: So then...what can I do for you, hen? Susato: Well...we're currently investigating a case. Ryunosuke: It's one of your warders, you see. He's gone missing. Caidin: Missing? Susato: That's right. It's surely been reported to you as well, being the prison governor. Caidin: ......... I have'nae heard nothing of the sort. There's no missing persons in my prison! Susato: Oh! Ryunosuke: (But...how can that be?) Susato: It's Mr Daley Vigil, your chief warder... Caidin: Eh? Vigil? Ryunosuke: That's right. His wife came to us and asked us to investigate his disappearance. (Let's skip the part about him only going missing yesterday for now...) Caidin: ......... Ryunosuke: (Clearly that means something to him...) Susato: Would you be so kind as to tell us what you know, sir? Caidin: Aye... Aye, of course. After clearing all Converse options: Caidin: Well... ...I cannae tell you anything else. Susato: Thank you so much for your time, Governor. Caidin: Oh, one moment afore you're away, hen... I'm sure I have it here somewhere... Ah, found it. Here, take this as a wee souvenir of your visit to the prison. Susato: What is it? Caidin: That's Vigil's dismissal notice. It's ten years old now of course. Susato: Oh my! Are you sure? Caidin: Aye, it's no trouble at all. It's no the original, mind. Vigil's dismissal notice has been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: Thank you very much, Governor Caidin! Caidin: Well in return... ...do me a favour and never come back here. That case is closed. Susato: Well, I think we ought to return to Baker Street for the time being. Ryunosuke: Yes, I agree. We need to report back to Mr Sholmes with what we've found out about Mr Vigil. (What will he tell Mrs Vigil, I wonder?) 1st November Sholmes's Suite Ryunosuke: We're back! ???: Hello, you two! Iris: I thought you'd be back before long, so I baked some scones for us all. Ryunosuke: Ah! So that's what the delicious smell is. Sholmes: Greetings, my dear fellows! You've returned a good deal sooner than I was anticipating. Ryunosuke: Um...hello, Mr Sholmes. ......... Susato: Hello, Mr...Sholmes... ......... Sholmes: Say nothing. Your thoughts are written all over your faces in any case. It turns out that it may have been advisable to test my hair colour restoration tonic before application. Susato: Oh my... Sholmes: Pray, tell me. What of our warder friend? Have you garnered some new information? Ryunosuke: Oh, um...yes. Something very surprising, in fact. Though it's not a patch on your hair, to be honest. Susato: It most certainly isn't. But still, we discovered that- ???: SHOOOOOOOOOLMES!!! Gina: Drop everyfin', Sholmes! This is more important! Ryunosuke: Gina? Gina: I, I can't Adam an' Eve it... *Sniff, sniff...* Susato: What's happened? Sholmes: Clearly a very grave matter indeed. For Miss Lestrade made no mention of my hair whatsoever. Gina: It's...it's the boss... Ryunosuke: What do you mean? (Inspector Gregson?) Gina: The boss is... He's... He's dead. Ryunosuke: What...? Gina: They, they just found 'is body. Shot...wiv a pistol... Ryunosuke: WHAAAAAAAAAT?! Susato: But...but... Inspector Gregson?! Ryunosuke: (He was...murdered?!) Iris: No... Not Gregsy... Sholmes: Come in, my dear girl. Tell us the whole story. Gina: *Sniff, sniff...* After clearing all Converse options: Sholmes: ......... Thank you for informing us, Miss Lestrade. This really is most terrible news. I'm dreadfully sorry... Gina: Wot are you sayin' sorry for? You didn't do nuffin'! Sholmes: ......... Gina: Well...anyway... ...I'm takin' a cab over to the scene right now. Please come an' all! As soon as ya can! You've gotta 'elp! Sholmes: It's a detective's lot to appear wherever some sinister plot has unfolded. Little wonder we all look haggard. Sometimes these things are almost too much for the nerves. Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes... Sholmes: What use is there in being a great detective if I fail to see something like this coming, hm?! How could I let this happen to Gregson?! To Gregson... Susato: ......... Sholmes: Mr Naruhodo, I shall leave at once to begin my investigations. Ryunosuke: Of course, yes. We will, too. Sholmes: It would be helpful... ...if you could talk to Mr Reaper and see what you can glean. I'm sure you were intending to do so anyway. Until later, then! Ryunosuke: (Inspector Gregson, dead... And Lord van Zieks arrested...) Iris: Runo! Susie! I've called you a hansom. It's waiting outside. Ryunosuke: Thanks, Iris. Shall we, Miss Susato? Susato: Yes! Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy 1st November Room on Fresno Street Ryunosuke: (This really is an out-of-the-way part of London. I doubt many people find their way down this back street. So this dust-ridden rented old room is where it happened then...) Susato: So this is...where poor Inspector Gregson lost his life. Ryunosuke: Yes... And the police are already hard at work investigating, it seems. (I don't see Mr Sholmes anywhere, though... Perhaps his investigations have taken him elsewhere.) Gina: Oi! Wot d'ya think yer doin' there?! Every one o' them drawers 'as gotta be taken right out so you can look underneath an' all! I want the space above this ceilin' checked, and don't forget to look inside the chimney stack, too! Blimey! Ain't you lot never gone over an 'ouse lookin' for dough when the owners are out o' town? Ryunosuke: (Gina's obviously got some unique investigative techniques she wants everyone to adopt...) Gina: Oh, so you've turned up at last. Mind you, I ain't been 'ere long meself. Ryunosuke: Hello again, Gina. Gina: Sholmes 'as only just left. Yer lucky ya missed that. 'E went prancin' around in 'ere, pointin' at stuff an' flickin' that 'at of 'is an' then just scarpered. Susato: Oh! He's finished investigating already, you mean? Gina: Yeah... 'E didn't stop to say nuffin' to no one. Not even me. Ryunosuke: Gina! Would you mind if we investigated, too? Gina: ......... Listen, 'Oddo... ...yer a lawyer, right? Ryunosuke: Um...yes. Why? Gina: Well, yer not thinkin' of...tryin' to 'elp that Reaper bloke, are ya? Ryunosuke: Oh! (Poor Gina... She's never going to forget, is she? That trial will haunt her forever.) Susato: Gina, if you don't mind me saying... If Lord van Zieks really is responsible for this crime... ...he will be duly and fairly judged in court. Gina: ......... I suppose yer right, yeah. Go on then, 'Oddo! Get investigatin'! I wanna know the truth about wot really 'appened 'ere! Ryunosuke: Thank you, Gina! 1st November Local Prison, Cell 1 Ryunosuke: (There he is. Lord van Zieks behind bars...) Susato: So it's true. He really was arrested... Ryunosuke: (He's sitting with his back to the wall, reading something. I don't think he's noticed us.) Erm...Lord van Zieks! Van Zieks: ...Fancy meeting you here. The last place on Earth I'd like to be, with the last person on earth I'd like to see. Ryunosuke: ...I couldn't very well not come. We heard what happened. That you... That Inspector Gregson was... Van Zieks: ......... Go home. This has nothing to do with you. Ryunosuke: But... Susato: Forgive me, Lord van Zieks, but I must disagree. Van Zieks: ......... Susato: Inspector Gregson was very helpful to us on a number of occasions. We're indebted to him. At the very least we owe it to him to find out the truth about his death. You must help us with our investigations, please! Van Zieks: ......... There's really nothing I can tell you. Ryunosuke: What were you just reading at the back of the cell there? Was it something related to the case? Van Zieks: ...This? The Yard isn't quite so cavalier with its information as to share case details with a suspect. This is...a letter from an old acquaintance. Susato: Oh. Who might that be? Van Zieks: Someone you know, as it happens. Albert Harebrayne. Ryunosuke: (Of course, yes. I keep forgetting they went to the same university.) Van Zieks: And I would like to read my correspondence in peace. So let's get this over with, shall we? What is it you want to know? Ryunosuke: (Strange... I mean, let's face it, Lord van Zieks never minces his words... ...but they seem to have less bite than usual somehow.) After clearing all Converse options: Van Zieks: ......... So. It appears our conversation has run dry. Ryunosuke: There was a two-second silence, that's all. Van Zieks: Well in any event, if you'll excuse me now. ...I wouldn't like to detain you. Ryunosuke: I was wondering, Lord van Zieks... If you'd like... ...I'd be happy to advocate for you. Van Zieks: ...! ...You trust me, do you? Ryunosuke: Yes. I've heard you speak many times in court. I've seen how you treat people. So I'm quite sure that you would never have taken another's life. ...It's just, my feelings can't be used as evidence in a court of law, sadly. Van Zieks: ......... It's a very gracious offer. However... ...I trust no one. Ryunosuke: What? Van Zieks: Not the police, not the judiciary...and not you Nipponese. Ryunosuke: But please... Van Zieks: I have no intention of engaging your services. Ryunosuke: ......... (The chasm between us is just too wide and too deep, it seems...) Van Zieks: ...I'd appreciate it if you don't visit again. Then neither of us will waste any more time. Ryunosuke: (Perhaps we need to dig a little deeper... ...and find out more about Lord van Zieks and what happened to Inspector Gregson.) After clearing all Converse options at Local Prison, Cell 1 and clearing all Converse options and examining portrait or desk, board, gun, red wig, chalk outline, candles, and figurine in Room on Fresno Street: 1st November, 10:24 a.m. British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Stronghart: ...You've made good time. ???: I took an express train back to London. Ryunosuke: I can hear Lord Stronghart. Can you? Susato: Yes, it sounds as though he's talking to someone. Stronghart: Is everything in place? ???: I had a private compartment on the train so I could check all the paperwork. Ryunosuke: I-It's... Susato: Kazuma-sama! Stronghart: Ah, your timing is impeccable! Ryunosuke: It, it is? Stronghart: No doubt you have heard the sickening news? About the Reaper's latest devilry. Ryunosuke: ...Yes. Susato: I'm sure you don't believe it of course, though, Lord Stronghart. That Lord van Zieks could have done such a thing to Inspector Gregson. Stronghart: ......... I believe only in the facts. And the facts in this case point to one thing: The unavoidable accusal of Lord van Zieks for this crime. We must bring charges against the Reaper for taking the life of our legendary detective. Susato: Oh no, surely not! Stronghart: It's a truly regrettable situation. Tomorrow the forensic science symposium finally begins. At the very least, though, we can show the world our justice system's swift and equitable processes. Ryunosuke: So does that mean...the trial is tomorrow? Stronghart: Precisely. In fact, this is a fine opportunity for introductions. Ryunosuke: Kazuma... Kazuma: ......... Stronghart: Ah, but of course! You're already acquainted, aren't you? Mr Asogi here will be present at tomorrow's proceedings... ...leading the prosecution. Ryunosuke: Wait... WHAAAAAAT?! (Kazuma...?) Stronghart: As I'm sure you're aware, he's a very capable practitioner of law. Susato: Kazuma-sama...a prosecutor...? After clearing all Converse options and examining Kazuma Asogi: Ryunosuke: (It doesn't look like we're going to glean much more here.) Well...thank you very much, Lord Stronghart. Stronghart: Remember, tomorrow's trial will go down in our empire's history. There's much you could learn...from the public gallery. Ryunosuke: ...Sorry to have taken up so much of your time. We'll see ourselves out. Kazuma: Kazuma: Before you go, Ryunosuke... Ryunosuke: Oh...what is it, Kazuma? Kazuma: I just wanted...to thank you. Susato: Kazuma-sama... What...? Kazuma: You took my determination to heart and brought it with you over the ocean in my stead. And you carried out my role to perfection. Susato: You always were intent on studying British law in order to change our own justice system. It was your dream, and Mr Naruhodo didn't want that to die with you! Kazuma: Yes. But I had another purpose for coming here. Susato: Oh! Kazuma: ......... I actually have a favour to ask. Ryunosuke: W-Which is...? Kazuma: This trial I'll be prosecuting tomorrow... I'd like you to be there to see how it ends. Right in front of me...as the defence counsel! Ryunosuke: ...! (Why? What's this all about?) Kazuma: I know you have what it takes. Ryunosuke: But...Lord van Zieks would never put his fate in my hands. Kazuma: On the contrary. He recognises your talent. Ryunosuke: He does? Kazuma: ...It's not easy to see behind the facade sometimes. Here, have a look at this... Ryunosuke: That's... Susato: That's Lord van Zieks and Inspector Gregson! Ryunosuke: (In a photograph that must have been taken some time ago by the look of it. And who's the third person?) Kazuma: It was displayed very prominently in the detective's office. Ryunosuke: In Gregson's office, you mean? Kazuma: Yes. What I'm trying to say is, if you really think you can trust the Reaper... ...you might find that some straight talking makes him take a different view. Take it. Gregson's photograph has been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: I don't understand. Why are you giving me this? Kazuma: Just hurry, Ryunosuke! Visiting hours at the prison are almost over. Ryunosuke: (What are you doing, Kazuma...?) 1st November Local Prison, Cell 1 Ryunosuke: Lord van Zieks is still reading that letter. Susato: We've been gone quite some time, though... Ryunosuke: Either he's an incredibly slow reader...or it's an incredibly long letter... I might even be able to read English faster than he can. Van Zieks: I was intending to ignore you entirely... ...but I can't turn a deaf ear to such an insulting Nipponese. Ryunosuke: Oh! Um...sorry. I didn't think you'd hear that. Van Zieks: I had the case notes brought to me in secret. I was reading them to pass the time. Susato: Yes, we heard that your trial is set for tomorrow. Van Zieks: Which is none of your business. Ryunosuke: So...have you found a lawyer? Van Zieks: How many times must I reiterate the same thing: this is nothing to do with you. Ryunosuke: (In other words, no.) Susato: We were just talking to Lord Stronghart and...the prosecutor for your trial has been decided. Van Zieks: I'd expect nothing less. Though I have no idea who it is. Ryunosuke: It's...going to be Kazuma Asogi. Van Zieks: ...! Asogi?! Ryunosuke: (That made the colour drain from his face...) Van Zieks: Haah, well then... ...it seems I'm going to have to engage in conversation with you again after all. After clearing all Converse options and presenting Gregson's Photograph: Van Zieks: ......... Mister...Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: Oh! (That's the first time he's ever used my actual name.) Van Zieks: I've lost all confidence in my country's justice system. I don't trust the police, the judiciary or lawyers. But there's still one thing I'm willing to believe in. Ryunosuke: What's that? Van Zieks: That which you see in the eyes of another across the courtroom: a simple determination to know the truth. Ryunosuke: L-Lord van Zieks... Van Zieks: From the very first time we clashed in the Bailey almost a year ago now... ...I couldn't deny it, even though I dearly wished I could. 'Here is a loathsome Nipponese...who has absolute integrity as a lawyer.' Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: There are only two other men I've known with that same look in their eyes: My brother, Klint. ...And Genshin Asogi. Ryunosuke: (The man he idolised and the man who betrayed his trust in the most hideous way...) Van Zieks: ......... When you showed me that photograph just now, it reminded me... Ryunosuke: You mean, this photograph? Van Zieks: Back then I was able to laugh. I was free of the shackles of mistrust that plague me now. I looked to the future with hope. Since then I've protected myself against betrayal by refusing to trust anyone. But at times the mire into which I've sunk makes it almost impossible to breathe. Ryunosuke: I'm...so sorry... Van Zieks: ......... So Mr Naruhodo... ...I want to believe in that look in your eyes. I need to believe in it. ...In tomorrow's trial...will you advocate for me? Ryunosuke: ......... Of course I will. It would be an honour. Susato: I'm so pleased, Mr Naruhodo. Van Zieks: Then my life is in your hands. Ryunosuke: (For Lord van Zieks... ...that must have been an incredibly hard thing to ask. Which is why I simply cannot let the man down. Tomorrow...in the Old Bailey...against my old friend, Kazuma!) To be continued...\nVan Zieks: I was investigating Gregson, and my inquiries had led me to that address.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You were investigating the inspector? What on earth for? Van Zieks: ......... I'm not at liberty to say. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Van Zieks: I'd identified a distinct possibility that Gregson was involved in a case I was investigating. Regrettably, though...he was killed before I could secure the proof I needed. Judge: Is the court to understand then, that on the day in question you followed the victim to the scene? Van Zieks: ...No. I was privy to his movements in advance. Ryunosuke: How? Van Zieks: I stole into his office in the Yard and consulted his diary. The address on Fresno Street was noted in the 5 p.m. entry. Kazuma: You illegally entered the man's office? In Japan that alone would constitute a very serious offence. Judge: As it does in Great Britain, I assure you. Is that not the case, Lord van Zieks? Van Zieks: ...I was aware of the possible consequences. Kazuma: So, in summary, you were investigating the victim... ...and yet you refuse to tell the court why. Van Zieks: ......... Kazuma: I didn't realise British prosecutors enjoyed such freedom to choose what to divulge under oath. Ryunosuke: Ugh... (Why did I ever think I could defend this man?)Van Zieks: When I first entered the room that day, it was dark inside and I saw no one.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Had you ever been to the address before? Van Zieks: No, never. I only learnt of the place as a result of my investigations into Gregson's activities. There was no light inside when I entered, so it was all but impossible to make out anything. Ryunosuke: But at 5 p.m. the sun would only just have gone down. It would still have been reasonably light outside. Van Zieks: The room has a window, but it was boarded shut. Very little light found its way into the room from outside, so it was extremely murky inside. I wouldn't have noticed if the victim was already lying on the floor. Kazuma: There was no artificial light in the room, you say? You're quite sure? Van Zieks: I'm quite sure that the part of the room where the body was found was very dark. I have a feeling there was a small oil lamp burning on the desk, though I couldn't say for certain. Susato: Look, Mr Naruhodo... There is a small desk in the room just here. Ryunosuke: Yes, I remember. And there was an oil lamp on it. As well as the framed photograph. Van Zieks: When I entered the room, I closed the door behind me and started towards the desk to investigate. Ryunosuke: And what did you find? Van Zieks: Nothing. I never actually reached the desk.Van Zieks: A moment later, I heard the gunshot. I spun around, and saw the revolver on the floor.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So...who fired the gun? Van Zieks: I have no idea. I didn't see anybody else in the room. Ryunosuke: But you say it was very dark in there? Van Zieks: Yes, that's right. All I can tell you is, I didn't sense another's presence. Ryunosuke: Aha! Then could it be... ...that the gunshot actually originated from somewhere outside the room?! Van Zieks: No, that's out of the question. Ryunosuke: Oh. Van Zieks: Without doubt, the sound emanated from inside the room. I could smell the gunpowder. Ryunosuke: (Ugh, this is going from bad to worse...) Kazuma: And you say that's the point at which you noticed the revolver on the floor? Van Zieks: Correct. And I foolishly picked it up. That was carelessness on my part. Judge: Presumably, then, the gunshot you heard came from the firearm that you somewhat hastily took in your hands. Van Zieks: In point of fact, My Lord...I believe it did not. Ryunosuke: What? Van Zieks: The barrel of the revolver I picked up was cold, and there was no smell of spent powder. Ryunosuke: But, but then...where on earth is the gun that WAS fired? Van Zieks: Whilst I would like to oblige you with an answer... ...I'm afraid I can't. I, too, would dearly like to know that. Ryunosuke: Uuuuuugh...Van Zieks: Just as I picked the firearm up to examine it, the door flew open and I heard a man scream.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: A man, you say? One of the witnesses, I presume? Kazuma: That's right. One of the street merchants working on Fresno Street. Judge: Who are these merchants? Kazuma: A number of them had set up their stalls directly beneath the boarded window of the crime scene. A match-seller, a newsmonger and a pedlar. They've all given statements saying they heard the gunshot. And without thought of danger, they ran inside to see what had happened. Susato: Yes...Gina told us about that yesterday, didn't she? Kazuma: They burst through the door with some force, it would seem. Van Zieks: They did. And almost gave me a heart attack in the process. Ryunosuke: (But you're supposed to be the Reaper...) Van Zieks: The first man to come in immediately noticed the revolver in my hand and fled. Kazuma: A policeman patrolling on Fresno Street heard the commotion... ...and was able to arrest the accused shortly after the incident occurred. Van Zieks: Anyway, the man's scream drew my attention in that direction.Van Zieks: It was only then that the body of Inspector Gregson appeared before me.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Um...what do you mean by that? In what way did the body 'appear'? Van Zieks: I honestly can't explain it. But it's the truth. As far as I was concerned, the body hadn't been there until that point, and then suddenly...there it was. Ryunosuke: Did you perhaps hear the sound of the victim falling to the ground just beforehand? Van Zieks: ......... At that moment, what I heard... ...was the sound of the door flying open and the scream of the man who came inside first. Nothing more. Ryunosuke: I see... Van Zieks: After the man fled, I examined the body. I was stunned to find that it was Gregson. Judge: Hmmm... Most curious circumstances indeed. Van Zieks: How the inspector was killed, or how his body seemed to appear out of nowhere... ...I have no idea.Ryunosuke: (So...that's Lord van Zieks's account.)Susato: Do you have any thoughts, Mr Naruhodo?Ryunosuke: Yes...mainly that it really doesn't ring true in all sorts of ways. Who fired the gun if there was nobody else there? And how did the corpse just appear in front of him?Susato: So...you think that Lord van Zieks is lying?Ryunosuke: No, I don't think that. I mean, if he was going to lie... ...I would expect him to have come up with a more credible story, wouldn't you?Susato: Yes, I completely agree. I think he genuinely doesn't know what really happened himself. So we must do what we can to fill in the gaps.Ryunosuke: Yes, first and foremost, we need more information!After pressing all statements:Kazuma:Kazuma: Surely the court has heard enough!Ryunosuke: ...!Kazuma: My Lord, the cross-examination has clearly revealed... ...that the accused, Barok van Zieks...is lying on multiple fronts!Ryunosuke: Wha... What is THAT supposed to mean?!Judge: ...Good gracious, Counsel!The defendant is lying, you say?Kazuma: In his testimony just now... ...he claims that he failed to notice the victim's body because the room was dark.Van Zieks: That's correct.Kazuma: No...that's impossible. As proven by this candelabrum.Ryunosuke: How does that prove anything?Kazuma: If you examine the tip of the long candle, you can see it has been blown off by a powerful impact.Judge: One would assume that the projectile from the firearm passed through the victim and struck the candle.Kazuma: The problem comes when you consider the other two candles, which are clearly of a different length.Judge: Yes, I can see that only the candle that appears to have been struck by the bullet is long.Kazuma: We could reasonably expect someone to have lit all three candles together. Which begs the question of why only one has ended up longer than the others.Ryunosuke: That...must be because that particular candle was extinguished when the others were still burning... ...Ah!Kazuma: That's right. When the candle was hit by the bullet, it obviously went out. But the other two candles would still have been burning. So the fact is... ...the victim's body would have been illuminated by the light still thrown by the candelabrum! And the accused's claim that he couldn't see the body... clearly contradicts those facts!Van Zieks: ...!Kazuma: And now to the next lie.Ryunosuke: There's more?!Kazuma: The accused also claims never to have visited the scene of the crime before.Van Zieks: That's the truth.Kazuma: In that almost empty room, the police discovered something very unusual. A board covered from top to bottom in police documents and newspaper cuttings.Susato: Yes, that's right. We saw it, too.Kazuma: It goes without saying that the contents of the police documents cannot be divulged. However... ...they included a number of reports from various historical cases. The oldest of which...was from ten years ago.Ryunosuke: (Ten years ago? This is starting to sound familiar...)Kazuma: And there is a common thread linking all of the documents on that board.Judge: Indeed? What is this common thread, Counsel?Kazuma: They all relate to cases prosecuted in court by Barok van Zieks.Ryunosuke: All of them?Kazuma: And furthermore...all those cases are ones in which the defendant was acquitted.Judge: Good Lord!Kazuma: Interestingly, none of those defendants are alive today. Because all of them have been sent to their graves...by the Reaper.Ryunosuke: Ah!Susato: Oh no...Kazuma: In short! That dingy little room... ...is the Reaper's secret hideout...and his base of operations!Ryunosuke: The, the Reaper's hideout?!Kazuma: And yet the Reaper would claim never to have been to his own secret hideout? No one would believe that. No, the truth is...we've been looking at this backwards.Judge: Backwards? Explain, Counsel!Kazuma: Inspector Gregson was investigating the identity of the Reaper. When he discovered the location of the man's secret hideout...he was killed. As I'm sure everyone can imagine...by the Reaper's hand!Ryunosuke: Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAT?!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! Very well. I hereby state the current opinion of the court. Barok van Zieks is an outstanding prosecutor who has rendered great service to his country. However, it is with deep regret that I must concur with Prosecutor Asogi's contention... ...that the defendant's testimony exhibits a number of stark inconsistencies with the known facts.Van Zieks: All I have done is state the truth as I know it.Ryunosuke: (Kazuma's done a brilliant job as ever. He's drawing on his experience as a defence attorney to build his prosecution case...and it's formidable.)Judge: Counsel... ...you will submit the board that you just showed the court as evidence. I believe it to be fundamental in establishing the facts surrounding the Reaper's existence.Kazuma: Thank you, My Lord.The noticeboard has been entered into the Court Record.Kazuma: And now, the prosecution would like to call new witnesses to the stand. Witnesses who saw events unfold on the day in question.Examine evidence Noticeboard Front of board Susato: There are details of a whole raft of cases dating back years on here, aren't there? Ryunosuke: This paper from ten years ago is browning with age, look. Susato: Out of interest, the most recent thing appears to be this newspaper cutting here. Ryunosuke: Oh. It's the same Red-Headed League advertisement that Mr Sholmes had picked out. Susato: And do you remember? There was a red hairpiece at the scene, too. Ryunosuke: (Was Inspector Gregson an exponent of the Red-Headed League, then?) Bloody handprint on back Susato: ......... Oh. What's this...? Mr Naruhodo! Look! Ryunosuke: Oh yes. It's a smudge of some kind. In fact... ...it looks just like a handprint. Susato: And the colour... That's blood, isn't it? Oh dear... How disturbing... The details of the noticeboard have been updated in the Court Record. Bloody handprint on back (subsequent times) Susato: ......... Oh. What's this...? Mr Naruhodo! Look! Ryunosuke: Oh yes. It's a smudge of some kind. In fact... ...it looks just like a handprint. Susato: And the colour... That's blood, isn't it? Oh dear... How disturbing...Susato: They were mentioned in the previous testimony too, if you remember.Ryunosuke: Yes. The street sellers who heard the gunshot and went running into the room.Judge: Very well, lead the witnesses in! The defendant may step down from the witness stand.Van Zieks: Certainly, My Lord.Kazuma: So...witnesses. State your names and occupations for the court.???: Names?! We don't use names. Far too fancy for the likes of uz.???: We're just free an' easy. Sell what we like, live where we wanna live...???: I g-give them all a vacant stare as they w-walk down Fresno, and spin a few w-words into a verse for them.Judge: Ah... Would I be right in assuming that all three of you make your living by selling wares on the street?Gossip: Hehe, everyone calls me Gossip. I sell jaunty little titbits to passers-by, you know.Ryunosuke: Jaunty little titbits?Gossip: Got an absolute smasher for you, sir. Right up your ginnel, it is! Sixpence is the price, and not a penny less!Ryunosuke: ......... Wait! You're, you're actually trying to sell it to me now?Gossip: Oh, c'mon sir! Don't tell me you're not interested!Kazuma: Try the man.Susato: Give him the money and see what it is!Judge: Pay the man, Counsel.Ryunosuke: Alright, alright, sixpence it is.Gossip: You won't regret it, sir! Now, got your listenin' ears on? Just between uz...a young couple on Sleight Street have just had twins!Ryunosuke: .........Gossip: .........Ryunosuke: .........  Um...is that it?Gossip: No, that's not it. It's gossip, in't it? It wants to spread. But that bit's up to you and your mouth, of course. I've got more, you know. Want another juicy one? Sixpence a piece, it is. If you're curious...Ryunosuke: (I am curious, yes. About what's going on just under that fat bottom lip of yours. Namely that unusual bruise or whatever it is that's poking out from under your collar...)Kazuma: What about the next witness, then? What name do you go by and what do you sell?Venus: Me? I'm Venus. That's what everyone calls me. Funny, innit? I sell these lovely little fireworks to all the local school kids. Sixpence a pop! What d'you say?Ryunosuke: You weren't exaggerating with 'little'. Do they actually sell?Venus: Oh yeah. The second years can't get enough of my Venus firecrackers. 'Specially when I tell 'em that if they get a hundred they could blow up the school!Judge: Not the most savoury of ideas, young lady.Venus: What d'you say then, eh? Wanna part with sixpence for a pop?Ryunosuke: Wait, what?! You, you want me to buy one?Venus: Tell you what, I'll let you in on a little secret: If you get a hundred of 'em, you could blow up the whole courtroom!Kazuma: Try the woman.Susato: Give her the money and see if she's right!Judge: Pay the woman, Counsel.Ryunosuke: Alright, alright, I'll buy one.Venus: Lovely stuff! Right then...this is something a bit extra, just for you: The Venus Special! Only six 'undred pence!Ryunosuke: S-Six hundred!Venus: It's a hundred of my regular fireworks. Nothing 'little' about that, is there?Ryunosuke: (And there'd be nothing little about the punishment if I blew up the Old Bailey, either.)The Venus firecracker has been entered into the Court Record.Kazuma: And the last witness... What name do you go by and what do you sell?Examine evidence Venus Firecracker Fuse Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: Have you had an idea, Mr Naruhodo? You're staring at the end of the string of fireworks. Ryunosuke: Sorry. It's just that it's the 'Venus Special'. I was wondering what six hundred pence worth of fireworks would sound like. Susato: ......... Shall we find out? Ryunosuke: What? B-But...she said it could blow up the courtroom! ...*BANG!* Ryunosuke: ......... A-Alright, that was a fairly sizeable bang. Susato: My ears are still ringing, Mr Naruhodo. It sounded almost exactly like... The details of the Venus firecracker have been updated in the Court Record. Fuse (subsequent times) Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: Have you had an idea, Mr Naruhodo? You're staring at the end of the string of fireworks. Ryunosuke: Sorry.

B-But...she said it could blow up the courtroom! ...*BANG!* Ryunosuke: ......... A-Alright, that was a fairly sizeable bang. Susato: My ears are still ringing, Mr Naruhodo. It sounded almost exactly like...???: I'm a th-thinker me. Think all sorts of thoughts. I think, therefore I am. I am, therefore I think...I think. Because I stand there on the street, w-watchin' the w-world go on about me, they call me 'The Observator'.Gossip: Get out if it, old man! Everyone calls you Sandwich and you know it.Kazuma: So...you don't actually sell anything?Sandwich: A p-p-problem shared is a problem halved, as they say. I give advice, I do. And think w-what it means. I d-don't actually sell anything, no...come to think of it.Kazuma: Pity.Ryunosuke: (No more purchases today...please.)Judge: Well, we have quite a cast here, it seems.Kazuma: They conduct their business on Fresno Street from morning until night, My Lord. And always in the same place: directly adjacent to the crime scene.Judge: I see. And thus they heard the gunshot, I suppose.Kazuma: Not only that, but they very bravely ran inside to see what was going on and witnessed the crime.Gossip: Well I'll be beggared, I thought! ...Just between uz.Venus: Venus de Milo, what am I to do? What a terrible thing I saw!Sandwich: W-What I think is...if all w-what we see is light and shadow, p-playing with our eyes...is any of it real?Judge: Very well. The court will hear the formal testimony of these three witnesses now. You will describe in detail what you witnessed and heard at the time of the incident.Witness Testimony - The Witnesses' Account -Gossip: We saw the whole thing from start to finish, we did. Everything from the moment they went in the building.Venus: It was less than a minute after the Reaper had gone inside that we all 'eard a big bang.Sandwich: Seems to m-me that quick-to-talk is quick-to-walk. Gossip couldn't wait to go and see what had happened.Gossip: I ran into the room and there he woz. The Reaper, gun in hand, standin' over the dead body!Venus: I was scared 'alf to death, me. So I ran off to find a copper.Ryunosuke: If these witnesses were there the whole day and saw everything... ...who did they see going inside the building?Kazuma: Only the victim, Inspector Gregson, and the accused, Barok van Zieks.Gossip: I've seen pictures of that Reaper in the paper. I know what he looks like. And just between uz...folk love stories like this. I've made meself a tidy sum already.Ryunosuke: But wait! The room was just one of several flats in the building. Someone from another flat could have done it!Kazuma: All those flats on Fresno Street are unoccupied.Gossip: 'Course they are. They're small, damp, dirty and expensive to boot.Kazuma: The room in which the inspector was found is the only property in the building that's currently leased.Susato: And we know the leaseholder's name, don't we. It's...Hugh Boone.Judge: Hmmm... The testimony the court has just heard would appear to leave little room for doubt. It's becoming increasingly difficult to see how anyone other than the defendant could have committed the crime.Ryunosuke: No!Kazuma: Thank you for your candour, My Lord.Judge: Counsel for the Defence, you may proceed to cross-examine the witnesses.Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord! (In a closed court like this without a jury, the judge is the only person whose opinion matters. I have to break down this testimony. Somehow!)Cross-Examination - The Witnesses' Account -Gossip: We saw the whole thing from start to finish, we did. Everything from the moment they went in the building.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: When you say 'they', who do you mean exactly? Inspector Gregson and the defendant, Lord van Zieks? Gossip: I suppose so. The likes of uz don't know the names of the high and mighty. But I'll tell you one thing...it was the old Reaper that went in last, that's for sure and certain. Ryunosuke: Just behind Inspector Gregson? Did they arrive at the same time as each other? Gossip: No no, not at all! The first fella must have gone inside a good fifteen minutes before we heard that gunshot. Ryunosuke: The victim arrived fifteen minutes before?! Are you sure about that? Gossip: Am I sure? Am I sure?! Doz it seem likely that I'd have forgotten a fella with bright red hair like that, doz it? Venus: Yeah, 'is hair really were red, weren't it? Redder than my flamin' fireworks, even. Sandwich: That, that fiery red mop's still b-burnt on the inside of my eyelids, it is. Ryunosuke: Wait a minute! You're saying the man was a red-head? Gossip: Weren't you listenin', chum? Aye, he woz a red-head. And he had a big trunk with him, as well. Susato: But Inspector Gregson's hair isn't red. Not by any stretch of the imagination! Ryunosuke: It seems likely that the person you saw wasn't in fact Inspector Gregson at all, but some other third party. Kazuma: No. I hate to break it to you, but the witnesses are correct. Ryunosuke: What?! Kazuma: Just have a look at this photograph of the victim taken at the scene. Ryunosuke: Y-Yes, that's... (That's Inspector Gregson alright.) Susato: And...a red hairpiece. Ryunosuke: Ah! Susato: Of course! We saw one on the floor when we investigated the scene, didn't we? Ryunosuke: I still refuse to believe Inspector Gregson wore a hairpiece, though... (So then why on earth would he have been wearing something like that?) Judge: Hm...the colour does seem to suit the man, one might say... The photograph will be submitted as evidence, please, Counsel. The photograph of the victim has been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: And what became of the trunk that the red-headed victim was supposedly carrying? Kazuma: ...I was informed that no trunk was found at the scene. Ryunosuke: (So it just disappeared?) Gossip: What, do you expect uz to have been watchin' the buildin' every second, do you? Venus: We definitely saw 'im in the dock goin' in, though. No question about that!Press (subsequent times) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: When you say 'they', who do you mean exactly? Inspector Gregson and the defendant, Lord van Zieks? Gossip: I suppose so. The likes of uz don't know the names of the high and mighty. But I'll tell you one thing...it was the old Reaper that went in last, that's for sure and certain.

Venus: We definitely saw 'im in the dock goin' in, though. No question about that!Venus: It was less than a minute after the Reaper had gone inside that we all 'eard a big bang.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: By which presumably you mean the gunshot? Venus: I sell these little things, don't I? How would I know what a gunshot sounds like? But I've always thought it probably sounds a bit like this... doesn't it? Ryunosuke: And you say that you heard the noise almost as soon as you saw the defendant here enter the building? Venus: That's right. It was almost straight away. 'Bang!' it went. Just like that. Gossip: Well he's the Reaper, in't he? It's what the French call a fait accompli. When the Reaper's around, people are goin' in the ground! I mean, that's what he doz, in't it? Ryunosuke: I think we get the message. Kazuma: The Reaper couldn't allow the inspector to live after he'd discovered his secret hideout. There can be no clearer motive for the crime. Judge: Hmmm...yes... It's certainly an eminently credible motive. Ryunosuke: (Great.) Kazuma: And at that point, you ran inside. Is that correct?Sandwich: Seems to m-me that quick-to-talk is quick-to-walk. Gossip couldn't wait to go and see what had happened.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So, when Gossip ran to see what had happened, did you go, too? Sandwich: W-Well me... I'm a b-bit hampered, see. All the signs are that, that I c-can't move very well. Kazuma: You were a way behind, presumably. With that sandwich board around your neck and that big sign in your hand. Ryunosuke: ...What a great burden you bear. Pardon me for asking, Mr, erm...Sandwich, but... ...is it possible you and I have met before? Sandwich: ...! I-I'm not anybody, me. The signs are w-what make me who I am right now. I sign, therefore I am. Ryunosuke: So...you weren't employed as an omnibus driver just under a year ago then? Sandwich: ......... Susato: I might be mistaken, but I believe his trembling has intensified, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Yes, I agree. He's clearly been through a lot. Sandwich: 'Turn down King Henry Street and the Black Widowers Arms is just there.' Susato: Oh dear. You've made him hide behind his sign. Ryunosuke: (Life is full of surprises...)Gossip: I ran into the room and there he woz. The Reaper, gun in hand, standin' over the dead body!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So then you were the first person to arrive on the scene. Is that right? Gossip: That I woz! Kicked the door open like a professional, I did! And yelled out, 'What's goin' off 'ere?!' Susato: Lord van Zieks claims all he heard was a man's scream, though. Ryunosuke: And was it dark inside the room? Gossip: No, not dark at all! There were candles burnin' on the wall. Ryunosuke: Really?! Gossip: And there was a fella collapsed on the floor. Just between uz...it's the first thing I noticed when I got inside. Ryunosuke: Ah. I, I see... (Even though Lord van Zieks claims not to have seen any such lights on the wall...) Gossip: The next thing I noticed was someone standin' right beside the body. Kazuma: The accused, Barok van Zieks... Gossip: That's right! The pale-faced Reaper himself! I woz a little shocked, I won't deny it. But I'm no lily-livered coward. I stood my ground and gave that Reaper a cold, hard stare myself! Pursue \"Sandwich\" (after pressing first statement) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Do you have something to add, Mr Sandwich?! Sandwich: ......... There's, there's really n-n-nothing to me. Empty in the head, I am. Just two slices with no middle. S-So I don't know what you could w-w-want with me. Ryunosuke: I think that maybe you just remembered something? Having heard Mr Gossip's last statement, I mean. Sandwich: W-What I think is...we're all nothings really. We try to d-dress ourselves up as something else, but at the end of the day, w-we're all just street sellers. Gossip: That's enough out of you, Sandwich. Keep your trap shut now. Unless you want uz to make you into a real sandwich! Sandwich: W-When he saw the Reaper, he f-f-fell clean over on his backside! Ryunosuke: ...That's it? Gossip: Oh, you rotten beggar! I told you to keep that a secret! Sandwich: He screamed, he did. Screamed and s-scrambled off on all fours. ...That's all I w-w-wanted to say. Ryunosuke: Mr Gossip! Is this true? Gossip: The floor was dead slippery, that's why. Planted my hand in a filthy pool of blood, didn't I? Yuck! Ryunosuke: Wha...?! (A pool of blood?) Gossip: But listen here! Even when I woz sprawled on the floor... ...I still kept giving that Reaper a cold, hard stare! And don't you forget it! Ryunosuke: Let's just go back a little. Did you say you got blood on your hand? Gossip: I, I did, aye. Happens to the best of uz at times, dozn't it? So I was scared! So I slipped over! ...We can keep it just between uz, can't we? Ryunosuke: No, Mr Gossip! I'm going to have to ask you to add that information to your formal testimony. Gossip: Oh... If I must. Judge: The witness will amend his testimony to include the aforementioned details at once. Kazuma: ......... Changes statement from \"I ran into the room and there he woz. The Reaper, gun in hand, standin' over the dead body!\" to \"I slipped over and got blood on my hand, so I quickly wiped it off on the floor.\" Ryunosuke: And was there anyone else in the room at the time? Gossip: No, of course not. Not at first. But then this old stiff came waddlin' along behind me, of course. Only him, mind. Sandwich: I, I can't handle stairs so well, as you can imagine. Especially on the w-w-way up. Ryunosuke: And you couldn't have just failed to see someone? Gossip: It was a bit dingy in there, I grant you. But there were the candles on the wall. And the lamp on the table. Sandwich: There was n-nowhere anyone c-could have been hiding. You m-mark my eyes! Ryunosuke: (Ugh...)Gossip: I slipped over and got blood on my hand, so I quickly wiped it off on the floor.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You wiped your hand on the floor? Gossip: Well...who wants blood on his hand, eh? Horrible stuff. And they might have thought I'd done it. Hmph! No ta! Ryunosuke: And you didn't think that might be a problem? Gossip: Doz it really matter if I left a few grubby handprints on the floor? They'll get cleaned up in the end, won't they? Don't make such a fuss, that's the message from all of uz! Kazuma: ......... Judge: Is something wrong, Counsel? Kazuma: No, My Lord. I didn't remember anything in the report about a bloody handprint on the floor, that's all. Gossip: D-Don't come at me with all that! You can't intimidate me! I know what I did! I wiped it off! On the floor! The blood! Ryunosuke: ......... (I wonder... Could that be what happened...?) Susato: Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: I don't have all the answers yet... ...but I think we may have just uncovered a vital clue!Present Noticeboard (after examining bloody handprint on back) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"So you wiped off the blood from your hand on the floor of the room...\"Venus: I was scared 'alf to death, me. So I ran off to find a copper.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So you didn't run into the room with your friends? Venus: ......... I'm not that sort of girl. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Venus: I'm a timid little thing, me. I was too scared to go in there. Ryunosuke: Ah, right... I see. Venus: Old Lippy and the 'Wich ran in there, an' then I 'eard a sort of old lady scream. Gossip: Well that wozn't me, I swear. If I were a gentleman, I'd stake my honour on it. Venus: I wondered what on earth was goin' on. Ryunosuke: Which is when you went to find a policeman? Venus: And I ran into a copper as soon as I turned the corner. So I brought him straight back to the place. ...Didn't I do well, eh? Gossip: Just between uz...that copper's eyes nearly popped out of his head when he saw the Reaper. Sandwich: I've n-n-never felt more uncomfortable in, in all my life. Judge: And the defendant was arrested on the spot, I believe. Kazuma: Considering the catalogue of killings the Reaper had carried out... ...it was a particularly inauspicious end.Ryunosuke: (...If I can't find any holes in this testimony...)Susato: I'm afraid the judge will give a ruling of guilty, Mr Naruhodo.Ryunosuke: (The truth is, though, their combined testimony is fairly damning.)Susato: Unfortunately, there don't seem to be any obvious problems with their statements, do there?Ryunosuke: Still...if Lord van Zieks really is innocent, then I'm almost certain... ...that we'll find something in there that doesn't quite add up.Susato: You don't think... ...that one of these three could be the true culprit, do you?Ryunosuke: I don't know. But what I do know... ...is that there's more to this case that has yet to be brought to light!Ryunosuke: So you wiped off the blood from your hand on the floor of the room... Are you quite sure about that?Gossip: Well, well what else d'you expect me to have done, eh? Doz it really matter?Kazuma:Kazuma: The police found no such handprint on the floor during their investigations. What exactly is the defence asserting?!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: If you listen, you'll find out...Prosecutor Asogi.Kazuma: ...!Ryunosuke: Certainly, there was no bloody handprint found...on the floor.Kazuma: What are you trying to say?Ryunosuke: There was a handprint in blood left very clearly at the scene... ...on the back of this noticeboard.Gossip: Ah...ah...AAAAAAAAAAAAH!Judge: Ah yes, indeed. Indisputably a handprint in the distinctive colour of blood.Gossip: Aye, you're dead right! That's my right hand! I'd know it anywhere!Kazuma:Kazuma: The witness very definitely testified that he wiped his hand on the floor. Any handprints on the back of the board are irrelevant!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: Not if the board itself had fallen over onto the floor. In that case, it's quite possible for the witness's handprint to have ended up there.Kazuma: ...Just look at the floor plan of the room. The noticeboard was in the opposite corner of the room to the victim, and in an upright position. Even if it had somehow been toppled and was lying on the floor at the time... ...it would have been a considerable distance from the body.Gossip: I fell over when I came across the body. So I woz basically right next to the corpse. Not on the other side of the room!Kazuma: In other words, the defence's assertion is contradictory!Ryunosuke: Yes...it is.Kazuma: ...!Ryunosuke: There's a very definite contradiction here...for which there must be a reason.Judge: I take it that you've formulated a proper hypothesis, Counsel? Regarding this apparent discrepancy between the witness's account and the handprint found at the scene.Ryunosuke: I have, My Lord. This discrepancy between the witness's account and the location of the handprint is explained by...Another handprint Ryunosuke: If Mr Gossip ended up with blood on his hand and wiped it off on the floor as he says... ...it must have left behind a mark somewhere. Just as a mark has been left behind on the back of the noticeboard. Kazuma: Kazuma: The prosecution has already established that the handprint on the board is irrelevant. Ryunosuke: Exactly! Which means there must be another handprint somewhere! Kazuma: No! The police report made no mention of a handprint anywhere on the floor! And I understand that you've examined the scene in person, too. If you'd come across something the police had missed... how do you explain the cold sweat? Judge: Quite. The defence counsel's cold sweat is a sure indication that a penalty is due. Ryunosuke: That sweat was just from the warm-up. Kazuma: What? Ryunosuke: There should be a bloody handprint on the floor. So where did it go...? I'm ready to give the proper explanation to the court now, My Lord! Leads back to: \"I take it that you've formulated a proper hypothesis, Counsel?\"The board moving Leads to: \"The real contradiction here is the handprint itself, not where it was found.\"False testimony Ryunosuke: The witness claims to have wiped his bloody hand on the floor, yet no sign of that remains at the scene. The simplest explanation is that the witness is lying. Kazuma: Kazuma: Just because it's the simplest explanation doesn't make it the correct one...Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Ah. Kazuma: Positing perjury simply because it suits you... You bring shame on your Japanese heritage! Ryunosuke: AAAAAAAAARGH! Judge: I would ask you not to oversimplify matters again, Counsel. Kazuma: I don't remember fostering that kind of simplistic thinking in you. Ryunosuke: ...Since when were you my father? Anyway, I was always taught to consider all possibilities. Kazuma: Then show me. Ryunosuke: There should be a bloody handprint on the floor. So where did it go...? I'm ready to give the proper explanation to the court now, My Lord! Leads back to: \"I take it that you've formulated a proper hypothesis, Counsel?\"Ryunosuke: The real contradiction here is the handprint itself, not where it was found. As the court can see...it's upside down.Judge: Good gracious! So it is! If the witness had put his hand against the board, the fingers should be pointing upwards.Kazuma: What, what does that tell us?Ryunosuke: It tells one simple fact! When this handprint was made... ...the board must have been lying on the floor as I previously suggested. Which means that after the incident...it must have been moved!Kazuma: What?!Kazuma:Kazuma: You're claiming that somebody moved the noticeboard after the shooting? Then tell the court who!Ryunosuke: I, I don't know that yet! But the point is... ...when you consider all the testimony we've heard so far, we can now be very clear on one point!Judge: And that would be...?Ryunosuke: The position of the noticeboard at the time of the incident, My Lord.Judge: So, Counsel, I must ask you to clarify your assertion for the court. At the time of the incident, where do you maintain the noticeboard was situated?Present area between doorway and victim Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"This is the only possible location!\"Present anywhere else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: It was right here, My Lord! Judge: Goodness! Hm, no...I'm afraid I don't quite see your logic. Kazuma: I'm disappointed, Ryunosuke. In Japan, we're taught to have patience and respect for our elders. So until His Lordship sees your logic, you will know your place and not move from that spot! Ryunosuke: UAAAAAAGH! Susato: How brilliant of Kazuma-sama! That almost sounded unreasonable at first, but he was just thinking of you. Ryunosuke: Unreasonable? Try unfathomable. Anyway, I think I have the answer now. I know my place! ...Or rather, I know the board's place! Leads back to: \"So, Counsel, I must ask you to clarify your assertion for the court.\"Ryunosuke: This is the only possible location!Judge: Immediately adjacent to the doorway...?Ryunosuke: If the court would think back to the testimony given by the defendant earlier... ...he said that when he entered the room it was dark, and he couldn't see the body.Gossip: By 'eck!Ryunosuke: If the noticeboard had been here, the body would have been completely hidden from view. And the light from the candles would have been blocked, making the room appear darker.Kazuma:Kazuma: But the accused also claims that the victim's body simply 'appeared' before him.Susato: That's true. Or, in his precise words...Van Zieks: Just as I picked the firearm up to examine it, the door flew open and I heard a man scream. It was only then that the body of Inspector Gregson appeared before me.Gossip: I don't know about callin' it a 'scream', but he woz talkin' about me and no mistake. Cos it woz me that kicked the door open.Ryunosuke: If you look again at the floor plan... ...consider what would happen if the door to the room was thrown open with force.Kazuma: That, that can't...Ryunosuke: The door struck the noticeboard, knocking it over, and making the victim's body visible.Judge: Good gracious!Ryunosuke: My client has told nothing but the truth! He has simply described what he saw.Kazuma: Argh!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Counsel, how has this not come to light before now?Ryunosuke: After the incident, somebody must have righted the board and moved it... ...into the position where the police, myself and my colleague saw it when investigating the room.Judge: Witness! What have you to say for yourself?Gossip: Whaaaaaat? Me, My Lord?Ryunosuke: You and your fellows were there at the scene before anybody else. It goes without saying that you must know something about the position of the noticeboard!Judge: The witnesses in the stand will testify again. You will each explain exactly what you did upon arriving at the scene of the crime!Gossip: Eh, stop lookin' over your glasses at me! I get the message.Witness Testimony - The Mystery of the Moving Board -Gossip: I don't know anythin' about that there noticeboard! I just wiped my hand on it, that's all.Venus: Well don't look at me. I 'aven't got a clue about it. I was doin' business with some second years at the time.Sandwich: I, I don't know anything about anything. I'm j-just a bystander, me. J-Just a sign at the crossroads of life.Gossip: It woz that Reaper, I bet. He's got a face that screams 'board'.Sandwich: I c-can't see how this changes anything anyway. The detective still died w-when we heard the gunshot.Judge: Hmmm... So none of you can elaborate further...Kazuma: Shaken by the crime they witnessed, and with only the light of a few candles and an oil lamp by which to see... ...we can't expect these witnesses to be able to give a more precise account of what happened.Venus: That's right, yeah. It don't pay to expect too much.Sandwich: It's m-man's endless quest for knowledge that's d-d-destroying the world. That's w-what I think.Ryunosuke: ...Do you? Really.Kazuma: In any case, as the testimony shows... ...even if the noticeboard was moved by somebody following the incident, it makes no difference. When the gunshot rang out, the accused was the only person at the scene.Ryunosuke: ...!Kazuma: In short, the only person who could possibly have committed this crime...is Barok van Zieks! None of this wrangling over the board changes that simple fact.Judge: Quite so, quite so. Does the defence still wish to cross-examine the witnesses despite the circumstances?Ryunosuke: Most certainly, My Lord.Judge: Very well.

You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "cot": "Looking through the testimonies and evidence, let's focus on Testimony 3: \n\nTestimony 3: \"I, I don't know anything about anything. I'm j-just a bystander, me. J-Just a sign at the crossroads of life.\" (Person: Sandwich)\n\nThis is an unambiguous denial of entering the crime scene or having any relevant involvement or observation.\n\nFrom the previous context in the story and the cross-examination, especially during the discussion after pressing statements, there is a point where Venus says: \"Maybe I did sneak along behind Gossip and 'ave a little peek into the room where it all 'appened.\" But this is Venus, not Sandwich.\n\nHowever, earlier evidence and the investigation repeatedly hinted that Sandwich/Sandwich-man was indeed present in the room—they discuss how he was a \"way behind\" due to his sign, but he went in. In cross-examination, Gossip also states: \"But then this old stiff came waddlin' along behind me, of course. Only him, mind.\"\n\nSo they're all present at the scene, and evidence—the Crime Scene Floor Plan (Evidence 12)—directly contradicts Sandwich's claim of being \"just a bystander\" rather than present in the room.\n\nBut is this a strong contradiction, or is there a more direct, indisputable conflict?\n\nLet me consider another point: does any physical evidence directly contradict a claim of not entering the room? Yes!\n\nEvidence 13: Noticeboard — which has a bloody handprint on the back, acknowledged to be left by Gossip as he fell. However, the story indicates that only Gossip and Sandwich were in the room, Venus was not at first; but then Venus testifies she may have peeked in.\n\nSandwich's claim is of being \"just a bystander,\" but in reality, in all the events, he was inside the room, which is shown by all the evidence and the witness accounts.\n\nBut does any piece of evidence physically tie Sandwich to the scene to contradict him? Not directly—unless we use the Crime Scene Floor Plan. But that's more an implication.\n\nHowever, Sandwich (Testimony 3) says, \"I, I don't know anything about anything. I'm j-just a bystander, me. J-Just a sign at the crossroads of life.\" But the Crime Scene Floor Plan (Evidence 12) indicates he was at the scene and is even listed in the investigation. This is the contradiction.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n",

'I wonder exactly how many mysteries are out there, hidden within this bed of fog,' he said. Indeed, a most bizarre incident born of a curious advertisement... a hell-hound's mad gallop through the shadows of a serial murder, an executed man's graveyard resurrection in the dead of night... and a commonplace killing in a small, forgotten room at the edge of town... There is, naturally, always another side to every case of which most remain ignorant. 'And it is that \"other side\" which compels me to the scene of the crime, Wilson. So, quickly now. Take your hat and let's be on our way, my dear fellow. For our adventure is not over yet. Come! The game is afoot!' Eight days after that earth-shattering trial and Kazuma regaining his memory... ...we were in the foyer of one of London's most luxurious hotels, the Great Waterloo Hotel. 1st November, 10:24 a.m. Great Waterloo Hotel Foyer Ryunosuke: Professor Mikotoba is due to arrive at any moment. Susato: Yes! I'm so glad we got here in time! ......... Ryunosuke: (Susato-san hasn't been the same since what happened. Not that I'm surprised.) Susato: The truth about Kazuma-sama's father... Ryunosuke: ...! Susato: Do you suppose my father knew? Ryunosuke: That he was actually the mass murderer, the Professor, you mean? (I knew that's what she was thinking about.) There's a good chance, I'd say. I mean... ...they did come here to London together sixteen years ago, didn't they? Susato: Yes, that's true... Ryunosuke: ......... Come to think of it, didn't you say... ...that Professor Mikotoba knew about Kazuma going missing in Hong Kong as well? Susato: That's right. But for some reason, he wasn't at liberty to talk to me about it. Ryunosuke: (That probably means he knows, then... ...about Kazuma showing up here in London with amnesia, and that he's regained his memory now.) Susato: ......... ???: Ah, there she is! Susato: Oh... Father! Mikotoba: Hello, Susato! How are you? Susato: I'm very well, thank you. We're delighted you've arrived safe and sound! Mikotoba: Hello, Mr Naruhodo. Very kind of you to take the trouble to meet us here. Ryunosuke: Oh no, not at all. It's my pleasure. ???: We've heard all about your extraordinary exploits here in London, you know. The news has crossed the seas. Ryunosuke: It, it has? ???: I always look forward to reading the monthly reports that arrive with the steamships from Britain. Ryunosuke: Oh...I, I see. Well...thank you very much! (Who is this man? And why do I feel as though I've seen him before?) ???: Hm... I take it from your expression that you can't quite place me. Mikotoba: In that case...how about a little reminder, Seishiro? A firm tap should do it. ???: Yes... Ryunosuke: (A, a firm tap? What?) ???: Here we go, then... I hereby pronounce the defendant, Ryunosuke Naruhodo... ...GUILTY! Ryunosuke: Ah... OOOOOOH! Y-You're... Judge: The court will now hear the trial of Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Y... Your... ...Your Excellency! Susato: Hello, Judge Jigoku, how are you? It's been a long time. Jigoku: Hah hah hah hah hah! Good, you've remembered now! That really did the trick! Guilty! Hah hah hah hah hah! Ryunosuke: (Only I was declared not guilty, wasn't I? And there was no laughing at the time...) Jigoku: So, London again after all this time... Hard to believe it's been ten years. To be honest, I never thought I'd be back. Mikotoba: Neither did I. I didn't imagine Japan would ever be invited to an international symposium like this. Though, really, I doubt anyone did, to be honest. It's all thanks to you, isn't it, Seishiro? Jigoku: What are you talking about, Yujin? Hah hah hah hah hah! Ryunosuke: (Of course, Judge Jigoku... He must complete the set. He's the other man, who sixteen years ago... ...came to London with Kazuma's father and Professor Mikotoba. He's the third visiting scholar.) Mikotoba: Well, all those passport checks and luggage searches at the border took rather a lot of time. I must say, I'm very envious of your ministerial status. You didn't have to go through any of that, did you? Jigoku: Ah, I knew you were jealous! Hah hah hah hah hah! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Ministerial status? Mikotoba: Yes, didn't you know? Seishiro here is also Japan's Minister of Foreign Affairs. It was his personal insistence that allowed you to take Kazuma's place here on this study tour. Jigoku: Guilty as charged! Hah hah hah hah hah! Ryunosuke: Oh. Well, thank you very much. (He's really every bit as important as he looks.) Mikotoba: Ah yes now, Naruhodo... I received a telegram from Lord Stronghart yesterday. Ryunosuke: Oh, you did? Mikotoba: It appears that...some things came to light in a trial you were involved with eight days ago. About what happened ten years ago. That...tragedy. Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: Yes. Could you tell us any more about it? After clearing all Converse options: Mikotoba: Well, if you'll excuse us now... Jigoku: Yes, I'd like to get this trunk up to my room as soon as possible. Ryunosuke: Oh, I...I'm so sorry! I shouldn't have held you up here for so long. Susato: I'll call for the porter, then. Just wait here! Ryunosuke: (Susato-san's gone off at a run!) Mikotoba: I'd like to stay and talk more, but I do have various preparations to make for tomorrow. Ryunosuke: Yes, of course! It must be a big responsibility representing our entire country. I wish you the best of luck! Mikotoba: ......... Naruhodo... ...I hope you'll keep an eye on Susato for me. Keep looking after her as you obviously have been. Ryunosuke: Oh no! I, I mean, if anyone's looking after anyone, it's her looking after me! Mikotoba: Well I do appreciate you being there for her. After all... ...I've been a miserable father to her. I've thoroughly let her down. Ryunosuke: Sorry? What do you mean? Mikotoba: ......... Well, it was sixteen years ago that I started my long study tour here in Britain, as you know. The very year Susato was born. Ryunosuke: ...Yes, I heard. Mikotoba: The birth of my daughter was the most joyous event of my life, but... Well, sadly it was accompanied by the most tragic event of my life, too. Ryunosuke: (Oh...yes... Susato-san hinted at something like that...) Susato: It was a rather turbulent time at home... Mikotoba: ...Anyway, I won't bore you with the details. The point is, I became rather less dependable than befits a grown man. And it was then that Seishiro offered me the opportunity to study here in Great Britain. Jigoku: I was too worried about you to leave you behind. So perhaps I was a little heavy-handed when it came to persuading you to accompany me to London. Mikotoba: So...that's what happened in a nutshell. And that's also the reason why I now feel compelled to give my daughter as many opportunities as I dare. Though the world does not readily afford young women such things, I must say. Ryunosuke: I...completely understand, Professor. Mikotoba: ......... Ah, one other thing, Naruhodo... If I may be so bold, I have a favour to ask you. Ryunosuke: Oh, really? Of course! What can I do for you? Mikotoba: Well, the thing is, I- Susato: I'm so sorry that took so long! Ryunosuke: Miss Susato! Susato: Now then...allow us to take your bags! Porter: Allow me to take your bags! Mikotoba: One moment, if you please, porter. Porter: Of...of course, sir! Mikotoba: That machine around your neck... It's a camera, I believe? Porter: Quite right, sir! Just five shillings for a lovely photograph to commemorate a wonderful stay at the hotel, sir! Mikotoba: Well, I think given the occasion, we could justify the expense. Porter: ......... Ah! Yes, yes of course! Susato: ...I'd like to thank you for coming with me, Mr Naruhodo. It's really made Father very happy, I think. Ryunosuke: Oh, well, I'm pleased, then. (But we were interrupted before. Professor Mikotoba was about to ask me something.) Susato: Shall we return to Baker Street, then? I expect Iris will have some delicious tea waiting for us! Ryunosuke: Yes, let's go. (I'm getting more and more anxious about Kazuma, though. Perhaps I'll try to meet with Lord Stronghart later and ask after him...) 1st November British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Van Zieks: Here's the final draft of the opening address for tomorrow's proceedings. I've supplemented your original with the figures you asked for from the Yard. Stronghart: I see. Excellent work. Thank you. Van Zieks: ...You're welcome, My Lord. Ryunosuke: (What's Lord van Zieks doing here...?) Susato: My, there seems to be an awful lot of tension in the air, wouldn't you say? Ryunosuke: (This place is stifling enough as it is. We really don't need any more tension.) Stronghart: My apologies. I didn't notice you come in. Your small stature and dark dress make you all but invisible to me. Ryunosuke: Oh! No no! It's entirely my fault for wearing black, I'm sure. Susato: From now on, you must dress in white from head to toe whenever you come here! Stronghart: Now then, Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: Y-Yes, My Lord! I'm right here! Stronghart: ......... Ryunosuke: ......... (Ugh... Kill me now...) Stronghart: Is something wrong? Perhaps it's a little too hot in here for you. Ryunosuke: Oh, no, not at all! I mean, I've never experienced a room at such a perfect temperature! Stronghart: If you're sure. The beads of sweat carving their way down your face seem to suggest otherwise. Ryunosuke: (Because of the daggers you're staring at me with, mainly.) Stronghart: As you're no doubt aware, my International Forensic Science Symposium begins tomorrow. In fact, your father arrived in London earlier today, I hear, madam. Susato: Oh! Yes, that's right, My Lord. He's extremely honoured to have been invited. Stronghart: I'll leave the remaining preparations for the meeting room in your capable hands then, Lord van Zieks. Van Zieks: I will attend at once. Susato: He gave you a very cold stare as he left, didn't he? Ryunosuke: I know. But I haven't done anything...have I? Stronghart: These past few days, my feet have barely touched the ground, I must say. My dedicated right hand of many years was recently put out of action in spectacular fashion. Ryunosuke: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. ...Is your left hand still of service? Susato: Mr Naruhodo! He's talking about Dr Sithe! Ryunosuke: Ah! (Of course...) I'm, I'm terribly sorry about that. I was just, um... Stronghart: Fear not. You've done nothing wrong. Dr Sithe's own wrongdoing precipitated the situation. You needn't concern yourself with it any further. Ryunosuke: (That would be a lot easier to do if it weren't for the piercing stare you're giving me...) Stronghart: Lord van Zieks is doing an admirable job of holding the fort. Though disturbingly, his apprentice has been missing since yesterday. Ryunosuke: O-Oh... (Missing...?) Susato: What's become of Kazuma-sama now...? 1st November Sholmes's Suite ???: Uèèèèèèèèèèèèè uèèèèèèèèèèèèèèè! Ryunosuke: W-What was that?! Susato: A, a man screaming! In a most unflattering way! Ryunosuke: Do you think... Could it have been Mr Sholmes? Susato: Oh my! I do hope not... ???: Uèèèèèèèèèèèè! I don't-a do it any more! ???: Mon ami, mon ami... Stop zis disgraceful display, uh? Ryunosuke: Who, who are these people? (Look at their hair! It's bright red...) Susato: I think...they must be clients of Mr Sholmes. Gina: Right, you two. Yer comin' wiv me now. Down to the clink. ???: No! Not in prison! It is dark and damp and I don't-a like it! ???: Bof! Ze darkness, it is my friend. I am not scared! ???: Uèèè uèèèèèèèèèèèè! But you are always scared of the dark! ???: Shut your mouth, you idiot! I will sit quietly in ze dark and plan our next daring 'eist! ???: Uèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèè! I don't-a like this! I don't-a like it! Gina: Well tough! We'll finish this down the Yard! Now get movin'! Iris: By then, Ginny! Have fun! Gina: Oh yeah, thanks, Iris! And thanks...ya great detective! Susato: Heehee! Gina makes a fine detective herself, doesn't she? Iris: Oh, Susie! And Runo! Ryunosuke: Hello, Iris. We're home! Iris: Well? Did you find your daddy? Susato: Yes! We arrived at the hotel just before he and his friend. Iris: Oh! Well that's great news. I hope I'll get to see my daddy again soon... Susato: Ah...yes...of course... Ryunosuke: (Dr John H. Wilson...) ???: So, Iris! All that remains now is that greatest of problems known to man! Sholmes: But before we concern ourselves with that, I believe some tea is in order, don't you, my dear fellows? Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: ......... Sholmes: Is something wrong, Mr Naruhodo? Do I have a crumb or suchlike on my face? Ryunosuke: Uh... (Not so much on your face... ...as on your head, I'd say.) Iris: Come along then, everyone. I've brewed a lovely special blend. Time for tea! Susato: Whatever is going on here today? Sholmes: In that case, let us sit and drink now. For I am in fact expecting a guest later today. After clearing Converse options with Herlock Sholmes and clearing all Converse options in British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office: *Ding-aling-aling* Sholmes: Aha! Here is my guest now. My latest client! With money to spend! Iris: Ooh, I do hope it's an exciting case, Hurley! Sholmes: Remember, Iris, we are at present gripped by the greatest problem known to man. I must be willing to accept any case, no matter how unstimulating. Save locating a runaway, of course. Ryunosuke: ...Don't spare anyone's feelings, will you? Iris: Oh dear... I'm afraid that Hurley can lack a little tact, especially just before the rent is due. *Thwack!* ???: Mr Sholmes! Mr Herlock Sholmes! Please... Oh, please... ...please find my husband! He's run away! Sholmes: To upset me? ???: I beg your pardon? Sholmes: Never mind. A personal matter. My apologies. What exactly are you trying to say, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: ...I didn't say a word. Sholmes: Come, my dear madam, be seated. Iris, some tea, if you please? Iris: Of course! Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: What's the matter, Miss Susato? Susato: Oh, it's...it's just that gentlewoman... I feel sure I've seen her somewhere before. Very recently. Ryunosuke: (...! Yes, now you come to mention it...) Evie: As I explained earlier, my name is Evie Vigil. I implore you to take the case, sir! Money is no object. Simply name your figure! Sholmes: Money and wealth are of little consequence to me, madam. Being offered a case to solve is reward enough. Evie: Oh, Mr Sholmes! You are the picture of benevolence! Sholmes: I will of course make a mental note of your offer, however. For...contingent reasons. I trust you will remember your words also. Evie: Um...if I might enquire, sir... ...this gentleman and lady would be...? Ryunosuke: Oh! Um...me? Evie: What I am about to tell you, I should like to communicate in the strictest confidence, you understand. Sholmes: Ah, these are my friends. I assure you, you may say before this pair anything which you may say to me. Evie: Ah...I see... Sholmes: I can vouch for the gentleman personally. After all... ...he's hard of hearing. Ryunosuke: (...Why did I ever get my hopes up?) After clearing all Converse options: Sholmes: Thank you for everything you have shared with us, Mrs Vigil. I believe I have all the information I need to begin my investigation. Evie: Oh, please report to me soon with good news, sir! Sholmes: Fear not, madam. In a day or two, I shall be contacting you with a heartening report, I'm quite sure. Evie: So soon? Oh, how splendid, Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: Good news should be delivered early, I always say. If you would be so kind as to leave the photograph of your husband in my possession...? The photograph of Mr Vigil has been entered into the Court Record. Sholmes: Thank you. Now, allow me to show you the door. Evie: I can't thank you enough, Mr Sholmes. You've been simply marvellous! Iris: You know, I think it every time, Hurley... ...but how do you come out with such nonsense? Good news in a day or two? Are you sure? Sholmes: I can't be sure, of course. But then I didn't swear on it. I merely gave the good woman some hope. I hope to be able to give her good news, one might say. After all, the rent must be paid by the end of day tomorrow. If by that time I've successfully located Mr Vigil, we shall be mutually relieved. Wouldn't you agree, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: ...Don't look at me with those pleading eyes. Sholmes: Well, my dear fellow? Did you hear the details of the case? Ryunosuke: Yes...my hearing is surprisingly good, actually. Sholmes: Excellent! And what did you make of it? Ryunosuke: Well, I was surprised to learn where her husband worked. At Barclay Prison, I mean... Sholmes: Ah, so you noted that? Susato: Of course. Especially with the mention of Lowgate Cemetery... Drebber: Lowgate Cemetery as at the rear of Barclay Prison. So it was renowned among us students at the university for being haunted by the ghosts of condemned convicts. Susato: Barclay Prison is where that notorious man was incarcerated! Ryunosuke: The Professor... Sholmes: And now a warder from the prison has mysteriously disappeared, it would seem. Ryunosuke: It's all very peculiar... Sholmes: Indeed. But nothing you can't handle, I'm quite certain, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: Run along to the prison and see what you can glean, would you? It's the prison governor you want. No doubt the man is equally worried. Ryunosuke: But...aren't you going to go yourself? Sholmes: Surely you needn't ask. I can't possibly be seen out with this hair! Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: ...But didn't you go to Lime Street with that hair? Sholmes: That was a quite different matter. So, I leave it in your capable hands. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm rather busy. Ryunosuke: (Of course you are...) 1st November, 10:24 a.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy Barclay Prison is on the outskirts of London, backing onto a lonely burial ground. Its four high outer walls loomed quietly before us in the fog. Having requested a meeting, we were shown to the governor's office in the watchtower. 1st November Barclay Prison, Governor's Office ???: This place is full of hardened criminals. I cannae remember the last time a civilian was doon here. And you dinnae want to talk to an inmate, but to me? Caidin: D'you ken who I am? I'm the governor, Barry Caidin......... hm? Ryunosuke: Oh...yes...it's a pleasure. I'm Ryunosuke Naruhodo, defence lawyer. Caidin: And an Easterner, I see. Does that mean... Ryunosuke: Yes, I'm a visiting student of law from the Empire of Japan. Caidin: Japan?! Did ye say Japan? Ryunosuke: Um...yes? Caidin: Well there's no any of your kind in here, laddie! Maybe you should try the prison next door, eh? Susato: I didn't notice another prison next door, sir... Ryunosuke: Anyway, we came to ask you some questions about- Caidin: I dinnae like to be so direct, but... ...I've no intention of speaking wi' the likes o' you suspicious-looking Easterners. Now get oot of my hair. Ryunosuke: (So as soon as he finds out that we're from Japan, he reacts like this... That surely means...) Susato: I think...it's because of the Professor case. Ryunosuke: You think so too? (Ten years ago... ...Genshin Asogi - also known as the Professor - was incarcerated at this prison.) And then, after his execution, he apparently re-merged from his grave in the cemetery behind the prison. Caidin: I, I might 'ave known! You're sniffing around aboot that case, aren't ya? You're agents, eh? Part of the Professor's great web, no doubt. Ryunosuke: No! Not at all! We're just- Caidin: Get gone wi' ya! Before I punch yer lights oot! Ryunosuke: We're going, we're going! (Clearly the ghost of that killer still haunts this place... We're not going to get anywhere here. Unless we can somehow prove to this man that there's nothing suspicious about us...) Susato: Governor Caidin... Ryunosuke: What are you thinking, Miss Susato? Susato: I feel sure that name came up in conversation recently somewhere. I was wondering if whoever mentioned him might have some ideas to help us. Ryunosuke: (Come to think of it, I have the same feeling...) Great Waterloo Hotel Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Barclay Prison, Governor's Office Ryunosuke: If you'd just cast your eyes over this, Governor Caidin... Caidin: What's this then? You cannae pull the wool over my eyes, you good-fer-nothin' Japanese student! ......... Mikotoba? That, that young jock from the forensics laboratory? That Mikotoba? Ryunosuke: Yes! Exactly! Him! Susato: Oh dear, perhaps I should have said something sooner... I'm Yujin Mikotoba's daughter, Susato. Caidin: Jings! You're the young man's daughter? And ya did'nae think to mention that afore? Susato: I, I do apologise... Caidin: Aye, well, ye'd best take a seat then. Can I offer you a cup of tea, perhaps? And dinnae forget to try one of these wee handcuff biscuits! Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: Your father's influence is nothing short of amazing... Susato: I'm bitterly regretting not announcing who I was from the outset now. Caidin: So then...what can I do for you, hen? Susato: Well...we're currently investigating a case. Ryunosuke: It's one of your warders, you see. He's gone missing. Caidin: Missing? Susato: That's right. It's surely been reported to you as well, being the prison governor. Caidin: ......... I have'nae heard nothing of the sort. There's no missing persons in my prison! Susato: Oh! Ryunosuke: (But...how can that be?) Susato: It's Mr Daley Vigil, your chief warder... Caidin: Eh? Vigil? Ryunosuke: That's right. His wife came to us and asked us to investigate his disappearance. (Let's skip the part about him only going missing yesterday for now...) Caidin: ......... Ryunosuke: (Clearly that means something to him...) Susato: Would you be so kind as to tell us what you know, sir? Caidin: Aye... Aye, of course. After clearing all Converse options: Caidin: Well... ...I cannae tell you anything else. Susato: Thank you so much for your time, Governor. Caidin: Oh, one moment afore you're away, hen... I'm sure I have it here somewhere... Ah, found it. Here, take this as a wee souvenir of your visit to the prison. Susato: What is it? Caidin: That's Vigil's dismissal notice. It's ten years old now of course. Susato: Oh my! Are you sure? Caidin: Aye, it's no trouble at all. It's no the original, mind. Vigil's dismissal notice has been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: Thank you very much, Governor Caidin! Caidin: Well in return... ...do me a favour and never come back here. That case is closed. Susato: Well, I think we ought to return to Baker Street for the time being. Ryunosuke: Yes, I agree. We need to report back to Mr Sholmes with what we've found out about Mr Vigil. (What will he tell Mrs Vigil, I wonder?) 1st November Sholmes's Suite Ryunosuke: We're back! ???: Hello, you two! Iris: I thought you'd be back before long, so I baked some scones for us all. Ryunosuke: Ah! So that's what the delicious smell is. Sholmes: Greetings, my dear fellows! You've returned a good deal sooner than I was anticipating. Ryunosuke: Um...hello, Mr Sholmes. ......... Susato: Hello, Mr...Sholmes... ......... Sholmes: Say nothing. Your thoughts are written all over your faces in any case. It turns out that it may have been advisable to test my hair colour restoration tonic before application. Susato: Oh my... Sholmes: Pray, tell me. What of our warder friend? Have you garnered some new information? Ryunosuke: Oh, um...yes. Something very surprising, in fact. Though it's not a patch on your hair, to be honest. Susato: It most certainly isn't. But still, we discovered that- ???: SHOOOOOOOOOLMES!!! Gina: Drop everyfin', Sholmes! This is more important! Ryunosuke: Gina? Gina: I, I can't Adam an' Eve it... *Sniff, sniff...* Susato: What's happened? Sholmes: Clearly a very grave matter indeed. For Miss Lestrade made no mention of my hair whatsoever. Gina: It's...it's the boss... Ryunosuke: What do you mean? (Inspector Gregson?) Gina: The boss is... He's... He's dead. Ryunosuke: What...? Gina: They, they just found 'is body. Shot...wiv a pistol... Ryunosuke: WHAAAAAAAAAT?! Susato: But...but... Inspector Gregson?! Ryunosuke: (He was...murdered?!) Iris: No... Not Gregsy... Sholmes: Come in, my dear girl. Tell us the whole story. Gina: *Sniff, sniff...* After clearing all Converse options: Sholmes: ......... Thank you for informing us, Miss Lestrade. This really is most terrible news. I'm dreadfully sorry... Gina: Wot are you sayin' sorry for? You didn't do nuffin'! Sholmes: ......... Gina: Well...anyway... ...I'm takin' a cab over to the scene right now. Please come an' all! As soon as ya can! You've gotta 'elp! Sholmes: It's a detective's lot to appear wherever some sinister plot has unfolded. Little wonder we all look haggard. Sometimes these things are almost too much for the nerves. Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes... Sholmes: What use is there in being a great detective if I fail to see something like this coming, hm?! How could I let this happen to Gregson?! To Gregson... Susato: ......... Sholmes: Mr Naruhodo, I shall leave at once to begin my investigations. Ryunosuke: Of course, yes. We will, too. Sholmes: It would be helpful... ...if you could talk to Mr Reaper and see what you can glean. I'm sure you were intending to do so anyway. Until later, then! Ryunosuke: (Inspector Gregson, dead... And Lord van Zieks arrested...) Iris: Runo! Susie! I've called you a hansom. It's waiting outside. Ryunosuke: Thanks, Iris. Shall we, Miss Susato? Susato: Yes! Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy 1st November Room on Fresno Street Ryunosuke: (This really is an out-of-the-way part of London. I doubt many people find their way down this back street. So this dust-ridden rented old room is where it happened then...) Susato: So this is...where poor Inspector Gregson lost his life. Ryunosuke: Yes... And the police are already hard at work investigating, it seems. (I don't see Mr Sholmes anywhere, though... Perhaps his investigations have taken him elsewhere.) Gina: Oi! Wot d'ya think yer doin' there?! Every one o' them drawers 'as gotta be taken right out so you can look underneath an' all! I want the space above this ceilin' checked, and don't forget to look inside the chimney stack, too! Blimey! Ain't you lot never gone over an 'ouse lookin' for dough when the owners are out o' town? Ryunosuke: (Gina's obviously got some unique investigative techniques she wants everyone to adopt...) Gina: Oh, so you've turned up at last. Mind you, I ain't been 'ere long meself. Ryunosuke: Hello again, Gina. Gina: Sholmes 'as only just left. Yer lucky ya missed that. 'E went prancin' around in 'ere, pointin' at stuff an' flickin' that 'at of 'is an' then just scarpered. Susato: Oh! He's finished investigating already, you mean? Gina: Yeah... 'E didn't stop to say nuffin' to no one. Not even me. Ryunosuke: Gina! Would you mind if we investigated, too? Gina: ......... Listen, 'Oddo... ...yer a lawyer, right? Ryunosuke: Um...yes. Why? Gina: Well, yer not thinkin' of...tryin' to 'elp that Reaper bloke, are ya? Ryunosuke: Oh! (Poor Gina... She's never going to forget, is she? That trial will haunt her forever.) Susato: Gina, if you don't mind me saying... If Lord van Zieks really is responsible for this crime... ...he will be duly and fairly judged in court. Gina: ......... I suppose yer right, yeah. Go on then, 'Oddo! Get investigatin'! I wanna know the truth about wot really 'appened 'ere! Ryunosuke: Thank you, Gina! 1st November Local Prison, Cell 1 Ryunosuke: (There he is. Lord van Zieks behind bars...) Susato: So it's true. He really was arrested... Ryunosuke: (He's sitting with his back to the wall, reading something. I don't think he's noticed us.) Erm...Lord van Zieks! Van Zieks: ...Fancy meeting you here. The last place on Earth I'd like to be, with the last person on earth I'd like to see. Ryunosuke: ...I couldn't very well not come. We heard what happened. That you... That Inspector Gregson was... Van Zieks: ......... Go home. This has nothing to do with you. Ryunosuke: But... Susato: Forgive me, Lord van Zieks, but I must disagree. Van Zieks: ......... Susato: Inspector Gregson was very helpful to us on a number of occasions. We're indebted to him. At the very least we owe it to him to find out the truth about his death. You must help us with our investigations, please! Van Zieks: ......... There's really nothing I can tell you. Ryunosuke: What were you just reading at the back of the cell there? Was it something related to the case? Van Zieks: ...This? The Yard isn't quite so cavalier with its information as to share case details with a suspect. This is...a letter from an old acquaintance. Susato: Oh. Who might that be? Van Zieks: Someone you know, as it happens. Albert Harebrayne. Ryunosuke: (Of course, yes. I keep forgetting they went to the same university.) Van Zieks: And I would like to read my correspondence in peace. So let's get this over with, shall we? What is it you want to know? Ryunosuke: (Strange... I mean, let's face it, Lord van Zieks never minces his words... ...but they seem to have less bite than usual somehow.) After clearing all Converse options: Van Zieks: ......... So. It appears our conversation has run dry. Ryunosuke: There was a two-second silence, that's all. Van Zieks: Well in any event, if you'll excuse me now. ...I wouldn't like to detain you. Ryunosuke: I was wondering, Lord van Zieks... If you'd like... ...I'd be happy to advocate for you. Van Zieks: ...! ...You trust me, do you? Ryunosuke: Yes. I've heard you speak many times in court. I've seen how you treat people. So I'm quite sure that you would never have taken another's life. ...It's just, my feelings can't be used as evidence in a court of law, sadly. Van Zieks: ......... It's a very gracious offer. However... ...I trust no one. Ryunosuke: What? Van Zieks: Not the police, not the judiciary...and not you Nipponese. Ryunosuke: But please... Van Zieks: I have no intention of engaging your services. Ryunosuke: ......... (The chasm between us is just too wide and too deep, it seems...) Van Zieks: ...I'd appreciate it if you don't visit again. Then neither of us will waste any more time. Ryunosuke: (Perhaps we need to dig a little deeper... ...and find out more about Lord van Zieks and what happened to Inspector Gregson.) After clearing all Converse options at Local Prison, Cell 1 and clearing all Converse options and examining portrait or desk, board, gun, red wig, chalk outline, candles, and figurine in Room on Fresno Street: 1st November, 10:24 a.m. British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Stronghart: ...You've made good time. ???: I took an express train back to London. Ryunosuke: I can hear Lord Stronghart. Can you? Susato: Yes, it sounds as though he's talking to someone. Stronghart: Is everything in place? ???: I had a private compartment on the train so I could check all the paperwork. Ryunosuke: I-It's... Susato: Kazuma-sama! Stronghart: Ah, your timing is impeccable! Ryunosuke: It, it is? Stronghart: No doubt you have heard the sickening news? About the Reaper's latest devilry. Ryunosuke: ...Yes. Susato: I'm sure you don't believe it of course, though, Lord Stronghart. That Lord van Zieks could have done such a thing to Inspector Gregson. Stronghart: ......... I believe only in the facts. And the facts in this case point to one thing: The unavoidable accusal of Lord van Zieks for this crime. We must bring charges against the Reaper for taking the life of our legendary detective. Susato: Oh no, surely not! Stronghart: It's a truly regrettable situation. Tomorrow the forensic science symposium finally begins. At the very least, though, we can show the world our justice system's swift and equitable processes. Ryunosuke: So does that mean...the trial is tomorrow? Stronghart: Precisely. In fact, this is a fine opportunity for introductions. Ryunosuke: Kazuma... Kazuma: ......... Stronghart: Ah, but of course! You're already acquainted, aren't you? Mr Asogi here will be present at tomorrow's proceedings... ...leading the prosecution. Ryunosuke: Wait... WHAAAAAAT?! (Kazuma...?) Stronghart: As I'm sure you're aware, he's a very capable practitioner of law. Susato: Kazuma-sama...a prosecutor...? After clearing all Converse options and examining Kazuma Asogi: Ryunosuke: (It doesn't look like we're going to glean much more here.) Well...thank you very much, Lord Stronghart. Stronghart: Remember, tomorrow's trial will go down in our empire's history. There's much you could learn...from the public gallery. Ryunosuke: ...Sorry to have taken up so much of your time. We'll see ourselves out. Kazuma: Kazuma: Before you go, Ryunosuke... Ryunosuke: Oh...what is it, Kazuma? Kazuma: I just wanted...to thank you. Susato: Kazuma-sama... What...? Kazuma: You took my determination to heart and brought it with you over the ocean in my stead. And you carried out my role to perfection. Susato: You always were intent on studying British law in order to change our own justice system. It was your dream, and Mr Naruhodo didn't want that to die with you! Kazuma: Yes. But I had another purpose for coming here. Susato: Oh! Kazuma: ......... I actually have a favour to ask. Ryunosuke: W-Which is...? Kazuma: This trial I'll be prosecuting tomorrow... I'd like you to be there to see how it ends. Right in front of me...as the defence counsel! Ryunosuke: ...! (Why? What's this all about?) Kazuma: I know you have what it takes. Ryunosuke: But...Lord van Zieks would never put his fate in my hands. Kazuma: On the contrary. He recognises your talent. Ryunosuke: He does? Kazuma: ...It's not easy to see behind the facade sometimes. Here, have a look at this... Ryunosuke: That's... Susato: That's Lord van Zieks and Inspector Gregson! Ryunosuke: (In a photograph that must have been taken some time ago by the look of it. And who's the third person?) Kazuma: It was displayed very prominently in the detective's office. Ryunosuke: In Gregson's office, you mean? Kazuma: Yes. What I'm trying to say is, if you really think you can trust the Reaper... ...you might find that some straight talking makes him take a different view. Take it. Gregson's photograph has been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: I don't understand. Why are you giving me this? Kazuma: Just hurry, Ryunosuke! Visiting hours at the prison are almost over. Ryunosuke: (What are you doing, Kazuma...?) 1st November Local Prison, Cell 1 Ryunosuke: Lord van Zieks is still reading that letter. Susato: We've been gone quite some time, though... Ryunosuke: Either he's an incredibly slow reader...or it's an incredibly long letter... I might even be able to read English faster than he can. Van Zieks: I was intending to ignore you entirely... ...but I can't turn a deaf ear to such an insulting Nipponese. Ryunosuke: Oh! Um...sorry. I didn't think you'd hear that. Van Zieks: I had the case notes brought to me in secret. I was reading them to pass the time. Susato: Yes, we heard that your trial is set for tomorrow. Van Zieks: Which is none of your business. Ryunosuke: So...have you found a lawyer? Van Zieks: How many times must I reiterate the same thing: this is nothing to do with you. Ryunosuke: (In other words, no.) Susato: We were just talking to Lord Stronghart and...the prosecutor for your trial has been decided. Van Zieks: I'd expect nothing less. Though I have no idea who it is. Ryunosuke: It's...going to be Kazuma Asogi. Van Zieks: ...! Asogi?! Ryunosuke: (That made the colour drain from his face...) Van Zieks: Haah, well then... ...it seems I'm going to have to engage in conversation with you again after all. After clearing all Converse options and presenting Gregson's Photograph: Van Zieks: ......... Mister...Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: Oh! (That's the first time he's ever used my actual name.) Van Zieks: I've lost all confidence in my country's justice system. I don't trust the police, the judiciary or lawyers. But there's still one thing I'm willing to believe in. Ryunosuke: What's that? Van Zieks: That which you see in the eyes of another across the courtroom: a simple determination to know the truth. Ryunosuke: L-Lord van Zieks... Van Zieks: From the very first time we clashed in the Bailey almost a year ago now... ...I couldn't deny it, even though I dearly wished I could. 'Here is a loathsome Nipponese...who has absolute integrity as a lawyer.' Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: There are only two other men I've known with that same look in their eyes: My brother, Klint. ...And Genshin Asogi. Ryunosuke: (The man he idolised and the man who betrayed his trust in the most hideous way...) Van Zieks: ......... When you showed me that photograph just now, it reminded me... Ryunosuke: You mean, this photograph? Van Zieks: Back then I was able to laugh. I was free of the shackles of mistrust that plague me now. I looked to the future with hope. Since then I've protected myself against betrayal by refusing to trust anyone. But at times the mire into which I've sunk makes it almost impossible to breathe. Ryunosuke: I'm...so sorry... Van Zieks: ......... So Mr Naruhodo... ...I want to believe in that look in your eyes. I need to believe in it. ...In tomorrow's trial...will you advocate for me? Ryunosuke: ......... Of course I will. It would be an honour. Susato: I'm so pleased, Mr Naruhodo. Van Zieks: Then my life is in your hands. Ryunosuke: (For Lord van Zieks... ...that must have been an incredibly hard thing to ask. Which is why I simply cannot let the man down. Tomorrow...in the Old Bailey...against my old friend, Kazuma!) To be continued...\nVan Zieks: I was investigating Gregson, and my inquiries had led me to that address.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You were investigating the inspector? What on earth for? Van Zieks: ......... I'm not at liberty to say. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Van Zieks: I'd identified a distinct possibility that Gregson was involved in a case I was investigating. Regrettably, though...he was killed before I could secure the proof I needed. Judge: Is the court to understand then, that on the day in question you followed the victim to the scene? Van Zieks: ...No. I was privy to his movements in advance. Ryunosuke: How? Van Zieks: I stole into his office in the Yard and consulted his diary. The address on Fresno Street was noted in the 5 p.m. entry. Kazuma: You illegally entered the man's office? In Japan that alone would constitute a very serious offence. Judge: As it does in Great Britain, I assure you. Is that not the case, Lord van Zieks? Van Zieks: ...I was aware of the possible consequences. Kazuma: So, in summary, you were investigating the victim... ...and yet you refuse to tell the court why. Van Zieks: ......... Kazuma: I didn't realise British prosecutors enjoyed such freedom to choose what to divulge under oath. Ryunosuke: Ugh... (Why did I ever think I could defend this man?)Van Zieks: When I first entered the room that day, it was dark inside and I saw no one.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Had you ever been to the address before? Van Zieks: No, never. I only learnt of the place as a result of my investigations into Gregson's activities. There was no light inside when I entered, so it was all but impossible to make out anything. Ryunosuke: But at 5 p.m. the sun would only just have gone down. It would still have been reasonably light outside. Van Zieks: The room has a window, but it was boarded shut. Very little light found its way into the room from outside, so it was extremely murky inside. I wouldn't have noticed if the victim was already lying on the floor. Kazuma: There was no artificial light in the room, you say? You're quite sure? Van Zieks: I'm quite sure that the part of the room where the body was found was very dark. I have a feeling there was a small oil lamp burning on the desk, though I couldn't say for certain. Susato: Look, Mr Naruhodo... There is a small desk in the room just here. Ryunosuke: Yes, I remember. And there was an oil lamp on it. As well as the framed photograph. Van Zieks: When I entered the room, I closed the door behind me and started towards the desk to investigate. Ryunosuke: And what did you find? Van Zieks: Nothing. I never actually reached the desk.Van Zieks: A moment later, I heard the gunshot. I spun around, and saw the revolver on the floor.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So...who fired the gun? Van Zieks: I have no idea. I didn't see anybody else in the room. Ryunosuke: But you say it was very dark in there? Van Zieks: Yes, that's right. All I can tell you is, I didn't sense another's presence. Ryunosuke: Aha! Then could it be... ...that the gunshot actually originated from somewhere outside the room?! Van Zieks: No, that's out of the question. Ryunosuke: Oh. Van Zieks: Without doubt, the sound emanated from inside the room. I could smell the gunpowder. Ryunosuke: (Ugh, this is going from bad to worse...) Kazuma: And you say that's the point at which you noticed the revolver on the floor? Van Zieks: Correct. And I foolishly picked it up. That was carelessness on my part. Judge: Presumably, then, the gunshot you heard came from the firearm that you somewhat hastily took in your hands. Van Zieks: In point of fact, My Lord...I believe it did not. Ryunosuke: What? Van Zieks: The barrel of the revolver I picked up was cold, and there was no smell of spent powder. Ryunosuke: But, but then...where on earth is the gun that WAS fired? Van Zieks: Whilst I would like to oblige you with an answer... ...I'm afraid I can't. I, too, would dearly like to know that. Ryunosuke: Uuuuuugh...Van Zieks: Just as I picked the firearm up to examine it, the door flew open and I heard a man scream.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: A man, you say? One of the witnesses, I presume? Kazuma: That's right. One of the street merchants working on Fresno Street. Judge: Who are these merchants? Kazuma: A number of them had set up their stalls directly beneath the boarded window of the crime scene. A match-seller, a newsmonger and a pedlar. They've all given statements saying they heard the gunshot. And without thought of danger, they ran inside to see what had happened. Susato: Yes...Gina told us about that yesterday, didn't she? Kazuma: They burst through the door with some force, it would seem. Van Zieks: They did. And almost gave me a heart attack in the process. Ryunosuke: (But you're supposed to be the Reaper...) Van Zieks: The first man to come in immediately noticed the revolver in my hand and fled. Kazuma: A policeman patrolling on Fresno Street heard the commotion... ...and was able to arrest the accused shortly after the incident occurred. Van Zieks: Anyway, the man's scream drew my attention in that direction.Van Zieks: It was only then that the body of Inspector Gregson appeared before me.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Um...what do you mean by that? In what way did the body 'appear'? Van Zieks: I honestly can't explain it. But it's the truth. As far as I was concerned, the body hadn't been there until that point, and then suddenly...there it was. Ryunosuke: Did you perhaps hear the sound of the victim falling to the ground just beforehand? Van Zieks: ......... At that moment, what I heard... ...was the sound of the door flying open and the scream of the man who came inside first. Nothing more. Ryunosuke: I see... Van Zieks: After the man fled, I examined the body. I was stunned to find that it was Gregson. Judge: Hmmm... Most curious circumstances indeed. Van Zieks: How the inspector was killed, or how his body seemed to appear out of nowhere... ...I have no idea.Ryunosuke: (So...that's Lord van Zieks's account.)Susato: Do you have any thoughts, Mr Naruhodo?Ryunosuke: Yes...mainly that it really doesn't ring true in all sorts of ways. Who fired the gun if there was nobody else there? And how did the corpse just appear in front of him?Susato: So...you think that Lord van Zieks is lying?Ryunosuke: No, I don't think that. I mean, if he was going to lie... ...I would expect him to have come up with a more credible story, wouldn't you?Susato: Yes, I completely agree. I think he genuinely doesn't know what really happened himself. So we must do what we can to fill in the gaps.Ryunosuke: Yes, first and foremost, we need more information!After pressing all statements:Kazuma:Kazuma: Surely the court has heard enough!Ryunosuke: ...!Kazuma: My Lord, the cross-examination has clearly revealed... ...that the accused, Barok van Zieks...is lying on multiple fronts!Ryunosuke: Wha... What is THAT supposed to mean?!Judge: ...Good gracious, Counsel!The defendant is lying, you say?Kazuma: In his testimony just now... ...he claims that he failed to notice the victim's body because the room was dark.Van Zieks: That's correct.Kazuma: No...that's impossible. As proven by this candelabrum.Ryunosuke: How does that prove anything?Kazuma: If you examine the tip of the long candle, you can see it has been blown off by a powerful impact.Judge: One would assume that the projectile from the firearm passed through the victim and struck the candle.Kazuma: The problem comes when you consider the other two candles, which are clearly of a different length.Judge: Yes, I can see that only the candle that appears to have been struck by the bullet is long.Kazuma: We could reasonably expect someone to have lit all three candles together. Which begs the question of why only one has ended up longer than the others.Ryunosuke: That...must be because that particular candle was extinguished when the others were still burning... ...Ah!Kazuma: That's right. When the candle was hit by the bullet, it obviously went out. But the other two candles would still have been burning. So the fact is... ...the victim's body would have been illuminated by the light still thrown by the candelabrum! And the accused's claim that he couldn't see the body... clearly contradicts those facts!Van Zieks: ...!Kazuma: And now to the next lie.Ryunosuke: There's more?!Kazuma: The accused also claims never to have visited the scene of the crime before.Van Zieks: That's the truth.Kazuma: In that almost empty room, the police discovered something very unusual. A board covered from top to bottom in police documents and newspaper cuttings.Susato: Yes, that's right. We saw it, too.Kazuma: It goes without saying that the contents of the police documents cannot be divulged. However... ...they included a number of reports from various historical cases. The oldest of which...was from ten years ago.Ryunosuke: (Ten years ago? This is starting to sound familiar...)Kazuma: And there is a common thread linking all of the documents on that board.Judge: Indeed? What is this common thread, Counsel?Kazuma: They all relate to cases prosecuted in court by Barok van Zieks.Ryunosuke: All of them?Kazuma: And furthermore...all those cases are ones in which the defendant was acquitted.Judge: Good Lord!Kazuma: Interestingly, none of those defendants are alive today. Because all of them have been sent to their graves...by the Reaper.Ryunosuke: Ah!Susato: Oh no...Kazuma: In short! That dingy little room... ...is the Reaper's secret hideout...and his base of operations!Ryunosuke: The, the Reaper's hideout?!Kazuma: And yet the Reaper would claim never to have been to his own secret hideout? No one would believe that. No, the truth is...we've been looking at this backwards.Judge: Backwards? Explain, Counsel!Kazuma: Inspector Gregson was investigating the identity of the Reaper. When he discovered the location of the man's secret hideout...he was killed. As I'm sure everyone can imagine...by the Reaper's hand!Ryunosuke: Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAT?!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! Very well. I hereby state the current opinion of the court. Barok van Zieks is an outstanding prosecutor who has rendered great service to his country. However, it is with deep regret that I must concur with Prosecutor Asogi's contention... ...that the defendant's testimony exhibits a number of stark inconsistencies with the known facts.Van Zieks: All I have done is state the truth as I know it.Ryunosuke: (Kazuma's done a brilliant job as ever. He's drawing on his experience as a defence attorney to build his prosecution case...and it's formidable.)Judge: Counsel... ...you will submit the board that you just showed the court as evidence. I believe it to be fundamental in establishing the facts surrounding the Reaper's existence.Kazuma: Thank you, My Lord.The noticeboard has been entered into the Court Record.Kazuma: And now, the prosecution would like to call new witnesses to the stand. Witnesses who saw events unfold on the day in question.Examine evidence Noticeboard Front of board Susato: There are details of a whole raft of cases dating back years on here, aren't there? Ryunosuke: This paper from ten years ago is browning with age, look. Susato: Out of interest, the most recent thing appears to be this newspaper cutting here. Ryunosuke: Oh. It's the same Red-Headed League advertisement that Mr Sholmes had picked out. Susato: And do you remember? There was a red hairpiece at the scene, too. Ryunosuke: (Was Inspector Gregson an exponent of the Red-Headed League, then?) Bloody handprint on back Susato: ......... Oh. What's this...? Mr Naruhodo! Look! Ryunosuke: Oh yes. It's a smudge of some kind. In fact... ...it looks just like a handprint. Susato: And the colour... That's blood, isn't it? Oh dear... How disturbing... The details of the noticeboard have been updated in the Court Record. Bloody handprint on back (subsequent times) Susato: ......... Oh. What's this...? Mr Naruhodo! Look! Ryunosuke: Oh yes. It's a smudge of some kind. In fact... ...it looks just like a handprint. Susato: And the colour... That's blood, isn't it? Oh dear... How disturbing...Susato: They were mentioned in the previous testimony too, if you remember.Ryunosuke: Yes. The street sellers who heard the gunshot and went running into the room.Judge: Very well, lead the witnesses in! The defendant may step down from the witness stand.Van Zieks: Certainly, My Lord.Kazuma: So...witnesses. State your names and occupations for the court.???: Names?! We don't use names. Far too fancy for the likes of uz.???: We're just free an' easy. Sell what we like, live where we wanna live...???: I g-give them all a vacant stare as they w-walk down Fresno, and spin a few w-words into a verse for them.Judge: Ah... Would I be right in assuming that all three of you make your living by selling wares on the street?Gossip: Hehe, everyone calls me Gossip. I sell jaunty little titbits to passers-by, you know.Ryunosuke: Jaunty little titbits?Gossip: Got an absolute smasher for you, sir. Right up your ginnel, it is! Sixpence is the price, and not a penny less!Ryunosuke: ......... Wait! You're, you're actually trying to sell it to me now?Gossip: Oh, c'mon sir! Don't tell me you're not interested!Kazuma: Try the man.Susato: Give him the money and see what it is!Judge: Pay the man, Counsel.Ryunosuke: Alright, alright, sixpence it is.Gossip: You won't regret it, sir! Now, got your listenin' ears on? Just between uz...a young couple on Sleight Street have just had twins!Ryunosuke: .........Gossip: .........Ryunosuke: .........  Um...is that it?Gossip: No, that's not it. It's gossip, in't it? It wants to spread. But that bit's up to you and your mouth, of course. I've got more, you know. Want another juicy one? Sixpence a piece, it is. If you're curious...Ryunosuke: (I am curious, yes. About what's going on just under that fat bottom lip of yours. Namely that unusual bruise or whatever it is that's poking out from under your collar...)Kazuma: What about the next witness, then? What name do you go by and what do you sell?Venus: Me? I'm Venus. That's what everyone calls me. Funny, innit? I sell these lovely little fireworks to all the local school kids. Sixpence a pop! What d'you say?Ryunosuke: You weren't exaggerating with 'little'. Do they actually sell?Venus: Oh yeah. The second years can't get enough of my Venus firecrackers. 'Specially when I tell 'em that if they get a hundred they could blow up the school!Judge: Not the most savoury of ideas, young lady.Venus: What d'you say then, eh? Wanna part with sixpence for a pop?Ryunosuke: Wait, what?! You, you want me to buy one?Venus: Tell you what, I'll let you in on a little secret: If you get a hundred of 'em, you could blow up the whole courtroom!Kazuma: Try the woman.Susato: Give her the money and see if she's right!Judge: Pay the woman, Counsel.Ryunosuke: Alright, alright, I'll buy one.Venus: Lovely stuff! Right then...this is something a bit extra, just for you: The Venus Special! Only six 'undred pence!Ryunosuke: S-Six hundred!Venus: It's a hundred of my regular fireworks. Nothing 'little' about that, is there?Ryunosuke: (And there'd be nothing little about the punishment if I blew up the Old Bailey, either.)The Venus firecracker has been entered into the Court Record.Kazuma: And the last witness... What name do you go by and what do you sell?Examine evidence Venus Firecracker Fuse Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: Have you had an idea, Mr Naruhodo? You're staring at the end of the string of fireworks. Ryunosuke: Sorry. It's just that it's the 'Venus Special'. I was wondering what six hundred pence worth of fireworks would sound like. Susato: ......... Shall we find out? Ryunosuke: What? B-But...she said it could blow up the courtroom! ...*BANG!* Ryunosuke: ......... A-Alright, that was a fairly sizeable bang. Susato: My ears are still ringing, Mr Naruhodo. It sounded almost exactly like... The details of the Venus firecracker have been updated in the Court Record. Fuse (subsequent times) Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: Have you had an idea, Mr Naruhodo? You're staring at the end of the string of fireworks. Ryunosuke: Sorry. It's just that it's the 'Venus Special'. I was wondering what six hundred pence worth of fireworks would sound like. Susato: ......... Shall we find out? Ryunosuke: What? B-But...she said it could blow up the courtroom! ...*BANG!* Ryunosuke: ......... A-Alright, that was a fairly sizeable bang. Susato: My ears are still ringing, Mr Naruhodo. It sounded almost exactly like...???: I'm a th-thinker me. Think all sorts of thoughts. I think, therefore I am. I am, therefore I think...I think. Because I stand there on the street, w-watchin' the w-world go on about me, they call me 'The Observator'.Gossip: Get out if it, old man! Everyone calls you Sandwich and you know it.Kazuma: So...you don't actually sell anything?Sandwich: A p-p-problem shared is a problem halved, as they say. I give advice, I do. And think w-what it means. I d-don't actually sell anything, no...come to think of it.Kazuma: Pity.Ryunosuke: (No more purchases today...please.)Judge: Well, we have quite a cast here, it seems.Kazuma: They conduct their business on Fresno Street from morning until night, My Lord. And always in the same place: directly adjacent to the crime scene.Judge: I see. And thus they heard the gunshot, I suppose.Kazuma: Not only that, but they very bravely ran inside to see what was going on and witnessed the crime.Gossip: Well I'll be beggared, I thought! ...Just between uz.Venus: Venus de Milo, what am I to do? What a terrible thing I saw!Sandwich: W-What I think is...if all w-what we see is light and shadow, p-playing with our eyes...is any of it real?Judge: Very well. The court will hear the formal testimony of these three witnesses now. You will describe in detail what you witnessed and heard at the time of the incident.Witness Testimony - The Witnesses' Account -Gossip: We saw the whole thing from start to finish, we did. Everything from the moment they went in the building.Venus: It was less than a minute after the Reaper had gone inside that we all 'eard a big bang.Sandwich: Seems to m-me that quick-to-talk is quick-to-walk. Gossip couldn't wait to go and see what had happened.Gossip: I ran into the room and there he woz. The Reaper, gun in hand, standin' over the dead body!Venus: I was scared 'alf to death, me. So I ran off to find a copper.Ryunosuke: If these witnesses were there the whole day and saw everything... ...who did they see going inside the building?Kazuma: Only the victim, Inspector Gregson, and the accused, Barok van Zieks.Gossip: I've seen pictures of that Reaper in the paper. I know what he looks like. And just between uz...folk love stories like this. I've made meself a tidy sum already.Ryunosuke: But wait! The room was just one of several flats in the building. Someone from another flat could have done it!Kazuma: All those flats on Fresno Street are unoccupied.Gossip: 'Course they are. They're small, damp, dirty and expensive to boot.Kazuma: The room in which the inspector was found is the only property in the building that's currently leased.Susato: And we know the leaseholder's name, don't we. It's...Hugh Boone.Judge: Hmmm... The testimony the court has just heard would appear to leave little room for doubt. It's becoming increasingly difficult to see how anyone other than the defendant could have committed the crime.Ryunosuke: No!Kazuma: Thank you for your candour, My Lord.Judge: Counsel for the Defence, you may proceed to cross-examine the witnesses.Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord! (In a closed court like this without a jury, the judge is the only person whose opinion matters. I have to break down this testimony. Somehow!)Cross-Examination - The Witnesses' Account -Gossip: We saw the whole thing from start to finish, we did. Everything from the moment they went in the building.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: When you say 'they', who do you mean exactly? Inspector Gregson and the defendant, Lord van Zieks? Gossip: I suppose so. The likes of uz don't know the names of the high and mighty. But I'll tell you one thing...it was the old Reaper that went in last, that's for sure and certain. Ryunosuke: Just behind Inspector Gregson? Did they arrive at the same time as each other? Gossip: No no, not at all! The first fella must have gone inside a good fifteen minutes before we heard that gunshot. Ryunosuke: The victim arrived fifteen minutes before?! Are you sure about that? Gossip: Am I sure? Am I sure?! Doz it seem likely that I'd have forgotten a fella with bright red hair like that, doz it? Venus: Yeah, 'is hair really were red, weren't it? Redder than my flamin' fireworks, even. Sandwich: That, that fiery red mop's still b-burnt on the inside of my eyelids, it is. Ryunosuke: Wait a minute! You're saying the man was a red-head? Gossip: Weren't you listenin', chum? Aye, he woz a red-head. And he had a big trunk with him, as well. Susato: But Inspector Gregson's hair isn't red. Not by any stretch of the imagination! Ryunosuke: It seems likely that the person you saw wasn't in fact Inspector Gregson at all, but some other third party. Kazuma: No. I hate to break it to you, but the witnesses are correct. Ryunosuke: What?! Kazuma: Just have a look at this photograph of the victim taken at the scene. Ryunosuke: Y-Yes, that's... (That's Inspector Gregson alright.) Susato: And...a red hairpiece. Ryunosuke: Ah! Susato: Of course! We saw one on the floor when we investigated the scene, didn't we? Ryunosuke: I still refuse to believe Inspector Gregson wore a hairpiece, though... (So then why on earth would he have been wearing something like that?) Judge: Hm...the colour does seem to suit the man, one might say... The photograph will be submitted as evidence, please, Counsel. The photograph of the victim has been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: And what became of the trunk that the red-headed victim was supposedly carrying? Kazuma: ...I was informed that no trunk was found at the scene. Ryunosuke: (So it just disappeared?) Gossip: What, do you expect uz to have been watchin' the buildin' every second, do you? Venus: We definitely saw 'im in the dock goin' in, though. No question about that!Press (subsequent times) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: When you say 'they', who do you mean exactly? Inspector Gregson and the defendant, Lord van Zieks? Gossip: I suppose so. The likes of uz don't know the names of the high and mighty. But I'll tell you one thing...it was the old Reaper that went in last, that's for sure and certain. Ryunosuke: Just behind Inspector Gregson? Did they arrive at the same time as each other? Gossip: No no, not at all!

Venus: We definitely saw 'im in the dock goin' in, though. No question about that!Venus: It was less than a minute after the Reaper had gone inside that we all 'eard a big bang.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: By which presumably you mean the gunshot? Venus: I sell these little things, don't I? How would I know what a gunshot sounds like? But I've always thought it probably sounds a bit like this... doesn't it? Ryunosuke: And you say that you heard the noise almost as soon as you saw the defendant here enter the building? Venus: That's right. It was almost straight away. 'Bang!' it went. Just like that. Gossip: Well he's the Reaper, in't he? It's what the French call a fait accompli. When the Reaper's around, people are goin' in the ground! I mean, that's what he doz, in't it? Ryunosuke: I think we get the message. Kazuma: The Reaper couldn't allow the inspector to live after he'd discovered his secret hideout. There can be no clearer motive for the crime. Judge: Hmmm...yes... It's certainly an eminently credible motive. Ryunosuke: (Great.) Kazuma: And at that point, you ran inside. Is that correct?Sandwich: Seems to m-me that quick-to-talk is quick-to-walk. Gossip couldn't wait to go and see what had happened.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So, when Gossip ran to see what had happened, did you go, too? Sandwich: W-Well me... I'm a b-bit hampered, see. All the signs are that, that I c-can't move very well. Kazuma: You were a way behind, presumably. With that sandwich board around your neck and that big sign in your hand. Ryunosuke: ...What a great burden you bear. Pardon me for asking, Mr, erm...Sandwich, but... ...is it possible you and I have met before? Sandwich: ...! I-I'm not anybody, me. The signs are w-what make me who I am right now. I sign, therefore I am. Ryunosuke: So...you weren't employed as an omnibus driver just under a year ago then? Sandwich: ......... Susato: I might be mistaken, but I believe his trembling has intensified, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Yes, I agree. He's clearly been through a lot. Sandwich: 'Turn down King Henry Street and the Black Widowers Arms is just there.' Susato: Oh dear. You've made him hide behind his sign. Ryunosuke: (Life is full of surprises...)Gossip: I ran into the room and there he woz. The Reaper, gun in hand, standin' over the dead body!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So then you were the first person to arrive on the scene. Is that right? Gossip: That I woz! Kicked the door open like a professional, I did! And yelled out, 'What's goin' off 'ere?!' Susato: Lord van Zieks claims all he heard was a man's scream, though. Ryunosuke: And was it dark inside the room? Gossip: No, not dark at all! There were candles burnin' on the wall. Ryunosuke: Really?! Gossip: And there was a fella collapsed on the floor. Just between uz...it's the first thing I noticed when I got inside. Ryunosuke: Ah. I, I see... (Even though Lord van Zieks claims not to have seen any such lights on the wall...) Gossip: The next thing I noticed was someone standin' right beside the body. Kazuma: The accused, Barok van Zieks... Gossip: That's right! The pale-faced Reaper himself! I woz a little shocked, I won't deny it. But I'm no lily-livered coward. I stood my ground and gave that Reaper a cold, hard stare myself! Pursue \"Sandwich\" (after pressing first statement) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Do you have something to add, Mr Sandwich?! Sandwich: ......... There's, there's really n-n-nothing to me. Empty in the head, I am. Just two slices with no middle. S-So I don't know what you could w-w-want with me. Ryunosuke: I think that maybe you just remembered something? Having heard Mr Gossip's last statement, I mean. Sandwich: W-What I think is...we're all nothings really. We try to d-dress ourselves up as something else, but at the end of the day, w-we're all just street sellers. Gossip: That's enough out of you, Sandwich. Keep your trap shut now. Unless you want uz to make you into a real sandwich! Sandwich: W-When he saw the Reaper, he f-f-fell clean over on his backside! Ryunosuke: ...That's it? Gossip: Oh, you rotten beggar! I told you to keep that a secret! Sandwich: He screamed, he did. Screamed and s-scrambled off on all fours. ...That's all I w-w-wanted to say. Ryunosuke: Mr Gossip! Is this true? Gossip: The floor was dead slippery, that's why. Planted my hand in a filthy pool of blood, didn't I? Yuck! Ryunosuke: Wha...?! (A pool of blood?) Gossip: But listen here! Even when I woz sprawled on the floor... ...I still kept giving that Reaper a cold, hard stare! And don't you forget it! Ryunosuke: Let's just go back a little. Did you say you got blood on your hand? Gossip: I, I did, aye. Happens to the best of uz at times, dozn't it? So I was scared! So I slipped over! ...We can keep it just between uz, can't we? Ryunosuke: No, Mr Gossip! I'm going to have to ask you to add that information to your formal testimony. Gossip: Oh... If I must. Judge: The witness will amend his testimony to include the aforementioned details at once. Kazuma: ......... Changes statement from \"I ran into the room and there he woz. The Reaper, gun in hand, standin' over the dead body!\" to \"I slipped over and got blood on my hand, so I quickly wiped it off on the floor.\" Ryunosuke: And was there anyone else in the room at the time? Gossip: No, of course not. Not at first. But then this old stiff came waddlin' along behind me, of course. Only him, mind. Sandwich: I, I can't handle stairs so well, as you can imagine. Especially on the w-w-way up. Ryunosuke: And you couldn't have just failed to see someone? Gossip: It was a bit dingy in there, I grant you. But there were the candles on the wall. And the lamp on the table. Sandwich: There was n-nowhere anyone c-could have been hiding. You m-mark my eyes! Ryunosuke: (Ugh...)Gossip: I slipped over and got blood on my hand, so I quickly wiped it off on the floor.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You wiped your hand on the floor? Gossip: Well...who wants blood on his hand, eh? Horrible stuff. And they might have thought I'd done it. Hmph! No ta! Ryunosuke: And you didn't think that might be a problem? Gossip: Doz it really matter if I left a few grubby handprints on the floor? They'll get cleaned up in the end, won't they? Don't make such a fuss, that's the message from all of uz! Kazuma: ......... Judge: Is something wrong, Counsel? Kazuma: No, My Lord. I didn't remember anything in the report about a bloody handprint on the floor, that's all. Gossip: D-Don't come at me with all that! You can't intimidate me! I know what I did! I wiped it off! On the floor! The blood! Ryunosuke: ......... (I wonder... Could that be what happened...?) Susato: Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: I don't have all the answers yet... ...but I think we may have just uncovered a vital clue!Present Noticeboard (after examining bloody handprint on back) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"So you wiped off the blood from your hand on the floor of the room...\"Venus: I was scared 'alf to death, me. So I ran off to find a copper.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So you didn't run into the room with your friends? Venus: ......... I'm not that sort of girl. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Venus: I'm a timid little thing, me. I was too scared to go in there. Ryunosuke: Ah, right... I see. Venus: Old Lippy and the 'Wich ran in there, an' then I 'eard a sort of old lady scream. Gossip: Well that wozn't me, I swear. If I were a gentleman, I'd stake my honour on it. Venus: I wondered what on earth was goin' on. Ryunosuke: Which is when you went to find a policeman? Venus: And I ran into a copper as soon as I turned the corner. So I brought him straight back to the place. ...Didn't I do well, eh? Gossip: Just between uz...that copper's eyes nearly popped out of his head when he saw the Reaper. Sandwich: I've n-n-never felt more uncomfortable in, in all my life. Judge: And the defendant was arrested on the spot, I believe. Kazuma: Considering the catalogue of killings the Reaper had carried out... ...it was a particularly inauspicious end.Ryunosuke: (...If I can't find any holes in this testimony...)Susato: I'm afraid the judge will give a ruling of guilty, Mr Naruhodo.Ryunosuke: (The truth is, though, their combined testimony is fairly damning.)Susato: Unfortunately, there don't seem to be any obvious problems with their statements, do there?Ryunosuke: Still...if Lord van Zieks really is innocent, then I'm almost certain... ...that we'll find something in there that doesn't quite add up.Susato: You don't think... ...that one of these three could be the true culprit, do you?Ryunosuke: I don't know. But what I do know... ...is that there's more to this case that has yet to be brought to light!Ryunosuke: So you wiped off the blood from your hand on the floor of the room... Are you quite sure about that?Gossip: Well, well what else d'you expect me to have done, eh? Doz it really matter?Kazuma:Kazuma: The police found no such handprint on the floor during their investigations. What exactly is the defence asserting?!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: If you listen, you'll find out...Prosecutor Asogi.Kazuma: ...!Ryunosuke: Certainly, there was no bloody handprint found...on the floor.Kazuma: What are you trying to say?Ryunosuke: There was a handprint in blood left very clearly at the scene... ...on the back of this noticeboard.Gossip: Ah...ah...AAAAAAAAAAAAH!Judge: Ah yes, indeed. Indisputably a handprint in the distinctive colour of blood.Gossip: Aye, you're dead right! That's my right hand! I'd know it anywhere!Kazuma:Kazuma: The witness very definitely testified that he wiped his hand on the floor. Any handprints on the back of the board are irrelevant!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: Not if the board itself had fallen over onto the floor. In that case, it's quite possible for the witness's handprint to have ended up there.Kazuma: ...Just look at the floor plan of the room. The noticeboard was in the opposite corner of the room to the victim, and in an upright position. Even if it had somehow been toppled and was lying on the floor at the time... ...it would have been a considerable distance from the body.Gossip: I fell over when I came across the body. So I woz basically right next to the corpse. Not on the other side of the room!Kazuma: In other words, the defence's assertion is contradictory!Ryunosuke: Yes...it is.Kazuma: ...!Ryunosuke: There's a very definite contradiction here...for which there must be a reason.Judge: I take it that you've formulated a proper hypothesis, Counsel? Regarding this apparent discrepancy between the witness's account and the handprint found at the scene.Ryunosuke: I have, My Lord. This discrepancy between the witness's account and the location of the handprint is explained by...Another handprint Ryunosuke: If Mr Gossip ended up with blood on his hand and wiped it off on the floor as he says... ...it must have left behind a mark somewhere. Just as a mark has been left behind on the back of the noticeboard. Kazuma: Kazuma: The prosecution has already established that the handprint on the board is irrelevant. Ryunosuke: Exactly! Which means there must be another handprint somewhere! Kazuma: No! The police report made no mention of a handprint anywhere on the floor! And I understand that you've examined the scene in person, too. If you'd come across something the police had missed... how do you explain the cold sweat? Judge: Quite. The defence counsel's cold sweat is a sure indication that a penalty is due. Ryunosuke: That sweat was just from the warm-up. Kazuma: What? Ryunosuke: There should be a bloody handprint on the floor. So where did it go...? I'm ready to give the proper explanation to the court now, My Lord! Leads back to: \"I take it that you've formulated a proper hypothesis, Counsel?\"The board moving Leads to: \"The real contradiction here is the handprint itself, not where it was found.\"False testimony Ryunosuke: The witness claims to have wiped his bloody hand on the floor, yet no sign of that remains at the scene. The simplest explanation is that the witness is lying. Kazuma: Kazuma: Just because it's the simplest explanation doesn't make it the correct one...Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Ah. Kazuma: Positing perjury simply because it suits you... You bring shame on your Japanese heritage! Ryunosuke: AAAAAAAAARGH! Judge: I would ask you not to oversimplify matters again, Counsel. Kazuma: I don't remember fostering that kind of simplistic thinking in you. Ryunosuke: ...Since when were you my father? Anyway, I was always taught to consider all possibilities. Kazuma: Then show me. Ryunosuke: There should be a bloody handprint on the floor. So where did it go...? I'm ready to give the proper explanation to the court now, My Lord! Leads back to: \"I take it that you've formulated a proper hypothesis, Counsel?\"Ryunosuke: The real contradiction here is the handprint itself, not where it was found. As the court can see...it's upside down.Judge: Good gracious! So it is! If the witness had put his hand against the board, the fingers should be pointing upwards.Kazuma: What, what does that tell us?Ryunosuke: It tells one simple fact! When this handprint was made... ...the board must have been lying on the floor as I previously suggested. Which means that after the incident...it must have been moved!Kazuma: What?!Kazuma:Kazuma: You're claiming that somebody moved the noticeboard after the shooting? Then tell the court who!Ryunosuke: I, I don't know that yet! But the point is... ...when you consider all the testimony we've heard so far, we can now be very clear on one point!Judge: And that would be...?Ryunosuke: The position of the noticeboard at the time of the incident, My Lord.Judge: So, Counsel, I must ask you to clarify your assertion for the court. At the time of the incident, where do you maintain the noticeboard was situated?Present area between doorway and victim Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"This is the only possible location!\"Present anywhere else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: It was right here, My Lord! Judge: Goodness! Hm, no...I'm afraid I don't quite see your logic. Kazuma: I'm disappointed, Ryunosuke. In Japan, we're taught to have patience and respect for our elders. So until His Lordship sees your logic, you will know your place and not move from that spot! Ryunosuke: UAAAAAAGH! Susato: How brilliant of Kazuma-sama! That almost sounded unreasonable at first, but he was just thinking of you. Ryunosuke: Unreasonable? Try unfathomable. Anyway, I think I have the answer now. I know my place! ...Or rather, I know the board's place! Leads back to: \"So, Counsel, I must ask you to clarify your assertion for the court.\"Ryunosuke: This is the only possible location!Judge: Immediately adjacent to the doorway...?Ryunosuke: If the court would think back to the testimony given by the defendant earlier... ...he said that when he entered the room it was dark, and he couldn't see the body.Gossip: By 'eck!Ryunosuke: If the noticeboard had been here, the body would have been completely hidden from view. And the light from the candles would have been blocked, making the room appear darker.Kazuma:Kazuma: But the accused also claims that the victim's body simply 'appeared' before him.Susato: That's true. Or, in his precise words...Van Zieks: Just as I picked the firearm up to examine it, the door flew open and I heard a man scream. It was only then that the body of Inspector Gregson appeared before me.Gossip: I don't know about callin' it a 'scream', but he woz talkin' about me and no mistake. Cos it woz me that kicked the door open.Ryunosuke: If you look again at the floor plan... ...consider what would happen if the door to the room was thrown open with force.Kazuma: That, that can't...Ryunosuke: The door struck the noticeboard, knocking it over, and making the victim's body visible.Judge: Good gracious!Ryunosuke: My client has told nothing but the truth! He has simply described what he saw.Kazuma: Argh!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Counsel, how has this not come to light before now?Ryunosuke: After the incident, somebody must have righted the board and moved it... ...into the position where the police, myself and my colleague saw it when investigating the room.Judge: Witness! What have you to say for yourself?Gossip: Whaaaaaat? Me, My Lord?Ryunosuke: You and your fellows were there at the scene before anybody else. It goes without saying that you must know something about the position of the noticeboard!Judge: The witnesses in the stand will testify again. You will each explain exactly what you did upon arriving at the scene of the crime!Gossip: Eh, stop lookin' over your glasses at me! I get the message.Witness Testimony - The Mystery of the Moving Board -Gossip: I don't know anythin' about that there noticeboard! I just wiped my hand on it, that's all.Venus: Well don't look at me. I 'aven't got a clue about it. I was doin' business with some second years at the time.Sandwich: I, I don't know anything about anything. I'm j-just a bystander, me. J-Just a sign at the crossroads of life.Gossip: It woz that Reaper, I bet. He's got a face that screams 'board'.Sandwich: I c-can't see how this changes anything anyway. The detective still died w-when we heard the gunshot.Judge: Hmmm... So none of you can elaborate further...Kazuma: Shaken by the crime they witnessed, and with only the light of a few candles and an oil lamp by which to see... ...we can't expect these witnesses to be able to give a more precise account of what happened.Venus: That's right, yeah. It don't pay to expect too much.Sandwich: It's m-man's endless quest for knowledge that's d-d-destroying the world. That's w-what I think.Ryunosuke: ...Do you? Really.Kazuma: In any case, as the testimony shows... ...even if the noticeboard was moved by somebody following the incident, it makes no difference. When the gunshot rang out, the accused was the only person at the scene.Ryunosuke: ...!Kazuma: In short, the only person who could possibly have committed this crime...is Barok van Zieks! None of this wrangling over the board changes that simple fact.Judge: Quite so, quite so. Does the defence still wish to cross-examine the witnesses despite the circumstances?Ryunosuke: Most certainly, My Lord.Judge: Very well. Then you may proceed, Counsel.Cross-Examination - The Mystery of the Moving Board -Gossip: I don't know anythin' about that there noticeboard! I just wiped my hand on it, that's all.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So you admit that it was the board you wiped your bloody hand on? Gossip: Admit it? What's to admit? It's there plain as day for all to see: a smashing print of my right hand! Ryunosuke: Perhaps you wanted to hide that handprint... ...so you righted the noticeboard and pushed it into the corner, did you? Gossip: No no! Imagine the weight of that great lump! Do I look like a powerful and well-nurtured man? Ryunosuke: Well did you see anybody else moving the board? Gossip: I've got nerves of steel, I can tell you, but even I have my limits. There woz a body on the floor in front of me, and the grim Reaper himself standin' over it. And there woz precious little light inside, either. My bottom lip was all aquiver. Kazuma: In other words...this witness is unable to give definite testimony on that point. Judge: Hm, yes...so it would seem.Venus: Well don't look at me. I 'aven't got a clue about it. I was doin' business with some second years at the time.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: When you say you were doing business with them, you mean you were selling them fireworks? Venus: Yeah, what else? There's the Priory School just round the corner, see. Those cheeky little so-and-sos 'ave got a plan to blow their school to kingdom come. Ryunosuke: Haah... Venus: So I've been tellin' on them. Lettin' their teachers know what they're up to. Ryunosuke: Oh...you have? Venus: Yeah, wouldn't want anyone to get 'urt. So I let the school know the kids are playin' with dodgy toys. Then - praise the Lord - the teachers take all the fireworks off 'em. And then - praise the Lord again - the kids all come back to me to buy more. Everyone's 'appy, see? Ryunosuke: ...What a racket. Venus: 'Course. And sometimes the teachers give me a little bonus to thank me for lettin' 'em know. It's a busy old life, sellin' explosives. Judge: Venus is a guileful goddess indeed... Venus: Well, tellin' bare-faced lies is kind of my thing, really. I'm ever so good at it. Pursue \"Sandwich\" Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Something wrong, Mr Sandwich? Sandwich: If, if I said it was, could we just l-leave it at that? Would that be the end of it? Ryunosuke: Um...no. Did Miss Venus's statement just now bring something to mind, perhaps? Sandwich: ......... Philosophical thoughts. Deep, philosophical thoughts. Ryunosuke: Hm? Sandwich: L-Let's say there was a great liar. And that g-great liar said, without batting an eye... 'Tellin' bare-faced lies is kind of my thing. I'm ever so good at it.' W-Would those words of hers be a lie, too? Or the truth? In which case...she's n-not a liar. Ooh, it's a h-hellish paradox, that one. Don't you think? Ryunosuke: ......... I'm not entirely sure, to be honest. But...it seems to me you're suggesting Miss Venus has been lying...are you? Sandwich: .................. Venus: What are you on about, old man? Tryin' to cause trouble, are you? Keep on like that... ...and I'll wrap your whole body in firecrackers and set 'em off. That'll give you somethin' to tremble about! Judge: You have a startlingly disturbing mind behind that sweet and innocent face, young lady. Ryunosuke: So Miss Venus HAS lied in her testimony! Is that what you're saying, Mr Sandwich? Sandwich: ......... Well...if it m-means I'll be burnin' in hellfire for the r-rest of my days...so be it. Yes, that's what I'm saying. Kazuma: Can you elaborate, please, sir? Sandwich: ......... Old b-blabbermouth here headed for the r-room where the g-gunshot seemed to come from... ...but there w-w-was someone else who crept up the stairs b-behind him, too. That's right! That rotten liar over there! Venus: Heh heh... Ryunosuke: ......... Kazuma: ......... Judge: Do you mean to say... ...that you did in fact betake yourself to the scene of the crime after all? Venus: ......... What did I tell you, eh? I said I was good at tellin' bare-faced lies, didn't I? Ryunosuke: (Yes, you mentioned it...) Susato: Well... ...that revelation rocked the whole courtroom, didn't it? Ryunosuke: Who knew firecrackers packed such a punch? Judge: So you did indeed visit the scene of the crime, did you, young lady? Good grief! Venus: Well, now you come to mention it... ...I suppose perhaps I do clearly remember climbin' the stairs to the room, yeah. Ryunosuke: Either you clearly remember it or you don't. Judge: Well...I shall consider a fitting punishment for this perjurious act later. For the time being, you will immediately amend your testimony to reflect the truth! Venus: Oh yes, My Lord. Of course! Changes statement from \"Well don't look at me. I 'aven't got a clue about it. I was doin' business with some second years at the time.\" to \"Maybe I did sneak along behind Gossip and 'ave a little peek into the room where it all 'appened.\" Ryunosuke: (Ugh...scary.) Kazuma: ...The important point is, you didn't go inside the room where the inspector was killed, isn't that right? Venus: Definitely not. Wouldn't 'ave dreamed of it, would I?Venus: Maybe I did sneak along behind Gossip and 'ave a little peek into the room where it all 'appened.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You make a habit of lying, do you, Miss Venus? Venus: Well...I s'pose so. ...I don't really know, to be fair. If you want my advice, though, I'd take everythin' I say with a big pinch of salt. Ryunosuke: Alright, but you did in fact go to the room where the victim was killed on the day in question, didn't you? Venus: Oh, please! As if I would! I can't think of anythin' more terrifyin'! Kazuma: The truth, please. Venus: Well alright, just a bit then. I mean, a girl my age is curious about stuff, ya know! Ryunosuke: Did you touch anything at the scene? Venus: Oh, please! As if I would! I mean, there was a dead body on the floor! Kazuma: The truth, please. Venus: Well alright, just a bit then. I 'ad a look to see if there was anythin' I could sell. So I did give the place a once-over. But it was nothin' to write 'ome about. Ryunosuke: Right. Now, I hesitate to ask, but... ...you didn't move the noticeboard by any chance, did you? Venus: Oh, please! As if I would touch anythin' like that! Just a few bits of loose change is all I 'ad! Kazuma: The truth, please. Venus: Well alright then. I thought there might be somethin' worth 'avin' underneath it. So I blasted the flippin' thing- Sorry, flipped the blasted thing. Ryunosuke: ...! Kazuma: ...! Judge: ...! Kazuma: You're, you're telling us... ...that you DID move that board?! Venus: I think that did slip out, didn't it? Gossip: Wha...? You daft barmpot! Sandwich: I, I don't believe it... The girl doesn't think. Ryunosuke: So! Did you find anything then? Something that you might have taken, perhaps? To sell? Venus: Oh, please! I should be so lucky! In my imagination- Kazuma: The TRUTH now! Venus: ...I might 'ave found this old pocket watch under the noticeboard, I s'pose. But a bit o' junk like this can't be worth much, if you ask- ???: AAAAAAAAAH! Gina: So it was you, was it? You're the one wot took it! Ryunosuke: G-Gina?! Judge: Young lady! May I remind you where you are?! Gina: That watch... That watch there... That was a present to Inspector Gregson from the Yard for a big case 'e solved ten years ago! Susato: The Professor case, no doubt. Gina: The boss used to wind it up every evenin' wivout fail when 'e was waitin' for 'is grub to come at the pub. Ryunosuke: ...I see. Gina: I swiped it off 'im once an' blimey was 'e upset! 'E gave me a right earful. Said 'e 'adn't missed a day in the last ten years, polishin' it an' windin' it. It meant the world to 'im, that watch did. Ryunosuke: (Possibly not the best thing to go diving for, then...) Venus: It's not all that, though. I took it to Jabez's that night to ask 'ow much it was worth. But the old dealer wouldn't touch it. Wouldn't give me a penny for it. Said it wasn't workin'. Knocked about and worthless he called it. Gina: Agh! I knew I should've lifted it! Kazuma: That watch must be submitted as evidence at once! Venus: Oh, please! Just, just so long as you promise to give it back when we're done! Gina: Not a chance! I'll swipe it from ya if you try to get your grubby mitts on it again! Judge: That's enough. Hand the watch to the bailiff forthwith! Ryunosuke: (Now now, children, watch your manners...) Judge: ......... Good Lord! The glass appears to be broken. Kazuma: More than likely, it shattered when the inspector was shot. Venus: It doesn't tick any more, either. Which is why Jabez didn't want it. What a waste, eh? Judge: Yes, indeed. It appears to have stopped at the hour of five. Ryunosuke: (Exactly when the gunshot was heard, then...) Susato: Which supports the prosecution's claim, of course... Gregson's pocket watch has been entered into the Court Record. Judge: Well, it would appear that the mystery of the moving noticeboard has been solved at least. Kazuma: And as predicted, it had very little bearing on the case. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Judge: Now then, continue with your cross-examination, please, Counsel.Press (subsequent times) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You...certainly know how to lie... Venus: Oh, it was nothin' really. Just a little porky. Ryunosuke: With not-so-little implications... Venus: Did you know? Everythin' in the world apart from the truth is a big fat lie! ...If you believe that, of course. Ryunosuke: ...I'm lost. Judge: As am I. This desecration of the truth is really rather disturbing. I think perhaps we should move on to the next witness, hm?Examine evidence Gregson's Pocket Watch Cracked glass Ryunosuke: The glass over the face really is badly cracked, look. Susato: What a shame when the inspector clearly looked after it so carefully. Ryunosuke: I imagine Mr Sholmes could repair it, don't you? Susato: Yes, I should think so. Ryunosuke: (He's very adept at things like this. A useful man to have around, in fact.) Susato: But kindly remember that he's a great detective, Mr Naruhodo! Not an odd-job man. Stub on top Ryunosuke: There's a tiny little stub sticking out from this small hole here, look. Susato: I suppose there must have been a little knob or something on that for setting the time. Ryunosuke: In that case, seeing as we know the inspector took such good care of this watch... ...it probably broke when the incident occurred, didn't it? Susato: Yes! Of course! Ryunosuke: Which could mean that there's a small part of the watch still at the scene, maybe... Keyhole at bottom Ryunosuke: Ah... There's a tiny little keyhole here. Can you see? Susato: Oh yes. That's probably for the winder used to wind up the mechanism. Ryunosuke: It looks a little unusual, don't you think? Susato: Yes, you'd need just the right key to wind it, I imagine. Ryunosuke: ......... (Why do I feel as though I've seen something...? Something a bit like a key that's about the right size to fit in this hole...) Susato: It would be wonderful if we had the key... Let's check carefully over what we've already found. Keyhole at bottom (after examining key on Policeman Figurine) Ryunosuke: So this is where the little policeman figurine's key goes in to wind the watch. Winding it up every single day for ten years without fail... Susato: Yes, it was obviously a thing of great importance to the inspector. Ryunosuke: (Or a reminder of the past, lest he forget...) Policeman Figurine Head of figurine, then key (after examining keyhole on Gregson's Pocket Watch) Ryunosuke: Miss Susato! Do you think perhaps this key... ...could be the key for Inspector Gregson's watch? Susato: Oh! Yes, it could be! Let's try it at once! There's not a moment to lose! Ryunosuke: (I knew it! A perfect fit!) Susato: And look! The inspector's watch has started going again! Ryunosuke: Ah, so it has obviously just not been wound up, that's all. Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: What is it, Miss Susato? Susato: Well...if the watch isn't actually broken after all... ...I have a feeling it could have profound implications! ......... Ryunosuke: (She's deep in thought now. Perhaps I'd better start thinking deeply, too...) The details of Gregson's pocket watch have been updated in the Court Record. Key (subsequent times) Ryunosuke: So this is the little key used to wind the inspector's pocket watch. Susato: It was a mystery at first. Why it should be a policeman, I mean. But it's because it was a gift from Scotland Yard, in recognition of Inspector Gregson's hard work. Ryunosuke: ...If its head did fall off from overuse, it might seem a little inappropriate, don't you think? Susato: That's...the British sense of humour for you, I think. Head of figurine (after examining key) Susato: The helmet of this charming policeman appears to be a little worse for wear. Ryunosuke: I'm not convinced about the 'charming' part, but yes, you're right... ...the head part looks like it's been fairly heavily manhandled. Which stands to reason, really, doesn't it? I mean, it gets turned around and around every day. Susato: ...I hope it doesn't fall off in the end.Sandwich: I, I don't know anything about anything. I'm j-just a bystander, me. J-Just a sign at the crossroads of life.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But...you did go to see what had happened in the room, didn't you? Sandwich: Fresno Street is my whole w-w-world. It's all I know. And I know all of it. I have to make it my b-business to know, if I want to h-hold my sign up high. Kazuma: So you did go to see what had happened. Sandwich: It's not the d-destination that's important...it's h-how you get there, isn't it? Ryunosuke: Did you notice the noticeboard in the room? Sandwich: ...If you think about it, we're b-both the same species, aren't we? Both different members of the sign family. So if I'd spotted it, I m-might have tried to t-trip it up out of a sense of rivalry, I admit. Ryunosuke: (Someone really needs to tell you that you're Homo sapiens not Homo signiens...) Kazuma: Does that mean that you didn't notice the board? Sandwich: I, I can only r-r-repeat what I said before: I, I don't know anything about anything. I'm j-just a bystander, me. J-Just a sign at the crossroads of life. Judge: ...In which case, just who was responsible for moving the noticeboard?Gossip: It woz that Reaper, I bet. He's got a face that screams 'board'.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What exactly do you mean by that? Gossip: Oh, come on now, don't tell uz you've not noticed. He looks like he hates everythin' in the world, that fella. But not noticeboards. They're the one thing he likes. You can see it in his eyes. Ryunosuke: ...I can't say I'd ever noticed. Gossip: I'll tell you one thing for free, though: I never took my eyes off that man on the floor. Or off the Reaper. Not for a second. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Gossip: Well, I was that scared, I couldn't. You never know what a fiend like that might do if you look away, do you? Ryunosuke: ......... If you didn't take your eyes off the defendant... ...you should be able to confirm categorically whether or not he was the one who moved the noticeboard. Gossip: ......... Aye, that I can. The Reaper did nothin' of the sort. I can swear to that! I couldn't have missed it if he'd heaved the thing upright again and dragged it into the corner! Ryunosuke: Right...glad we've cleared that up. Kazuma: What happened to the face that screams 'board'? Ryunosuke: (I feel your pain, Kazuma.)Sandwich: I c-can't see how this changes anything anyway. The detective still died w-when we heard the gunshot.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: ...It was five o'clock in the afternoon that you all heard the loud bang, wasn't it? Sandwich: Maybe the n-noticeboard fell over, or maybe it d-didn't. Maybe I fell over, or m-m-maybe I didn't... But the Reaper's f-fate is sealed either way, because of that gunshot w-we all heard. So your fate's sealed, too. Ryunosuke: My fate?! Kazuma: That's right. The defence is fated to lose. And the prosecution to win. Ryunosuke: (In other words, it all hinges on that single gunshot. So if I could just find some problem with that part of their story...) Susato: It may be possible to change all our fates! Sandwich: Of course...n-none of that changes the fact that I heard what I heard...does it?Present Gregson's Pocket Watch (after examining keyhole on Gregson's Pocket Watch, then examining key on Policeman Figurine) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"I'm afraid that's not necessarily the case.\"Ryunosuke: (Not much to go on...)Susato: As you've pointed out, Mr Naruhodo... ...there's no question that the noticeboard was moved. So somebody must have done it.Ryunosuke: But it did happen after the event, so... ...maybe Kazuma is right and it's not relevant to the case.Susato: But it seems to have been deliberately positioned so as to hide the body from view. So I feel sure that there's some deeper significance to all of this.Ryunosuke: Yes, I know what you mean.Susato: I've no doubt there are more clues to be uncovered. You're on the right track, I can feel it. So follow your instincts!Ryunosuke: ...Alright, then.Ryunosuke: I'm afraid that's not necessarily the case.Sandwich: Oh...Ryunosuke: At the scene, we found this key to the winder of the inspector's pocket watch.Kazuma: A key...?Ryunosuke: And having wound the pocket watch, we discovered that it in fact still works. You see, the watch didn't stop because it was broken at all. And that fact... ...completely undermines one of the most fundamental premises on which this entire case has been built!Kazuma: What?!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! B-But Counsel... ...the watch was stopped at almost exactly five o'clock.Venus: Yeah, which is just when we 'eard that gunshot.Gossip: It is. Exactly the hour.Ryunosuke: The time that was showing on the watch tells us nothing other than when it wound down. It's merely a coincidence that it happened to be at five o'clock.Kazuma:Kazuma: Even if that's true... ...the three witnesses here all heard the gunshot at five o'clock. So that's obviously when this crime was committed!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: No, that doesn't hold!Kazuma: Why not?Ryunosuke: Recall what Inspector Lestrade said only moments ago:Gina: The boss used to wind it up every evenin' wivout fail when 'e was waitin' for 'is grub to come at the pub. Said 'e 'adn't missed a day in the last ten years, polishin' it an' windin' it. It meant the world to 'im, that watch did.Ryunosuke: The victim was in the habit of winding his watch once a day...in the evening. We can reasonably assume, therefore, that he wound the timepiece on the evening before he died as well.Judge: Yes, that would be entirely reasonable.Ryunosuke: But if that's the case... ...you wouldn't expect the watch to have completely wound down by five o'clock the following day.Gossip: Oh! Aye...Venus: Well 'ow do you explain it then?!Ryunosuke: In summary, the evening before the day of the incident, when the gunshot rang out in that room... ...the inspector was already unable to wind his watch.Kazuma: You, you can't mean...Ryunosuke: What would stop a man winding his watch if he's been in the habit of winding it every single evening for ten years? The obvious answer...is that he was already dead!Judge: Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! Counsel, that is a most extraordinary claim!Kazuma:Kazuma: Extraordinary isn't the word! It's absurd! You claim he was already dead the night before? Do you really think that Scotland Yard's coroner would have overlooked something like that?!Ryunosuke: Ah! W-Well, um...Susato: On that subject, there is something rather surprising... There's actually an omission in the coroner's report. The time of death is not noted.Ryunosuke: Ah! That's, that's right!Gossip: Wait a minute! You're forgetting that my legs went from under me when I kicked the door in.Ryunosuke: What do you mean?Gossip: Like I said, I planted my hand in a dirty great puddle of blood.Kazuma: Yes. So the victim's blood hadn't dried. It was fresh.Gossip: He catches on fast, dozn't he?Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: But that blood could be explained in any number of ways! It could have been put there afterwards. Some fresh blood could have been poured over the victim's body after he-Kazuma:Kazuma: Does my learned friend think that fresh blood is available on every street corner?Ryunosuke: Ah!Susato: Well, it needn't necessarily have been human blood, of course.Kazuma: ...!Susato: We've been told previously that Scotland Yard has no way to identify blood as human.Judge: The problem is currently being researched. At present, you are correct. It is beyond our abilities.Ryunosuke: So then...a chicken's blood could have been used, for example.Susato: It's certainly a possibility that it wasn't the inspector's blood at all.Kazuma:Kazuma: But the gunshot was heard at five o'clock that afternoon. That's beyond question!Ryunosuke: Is it, though?Kazuma: What?!Ryunosuke: Given that the time of death of the victim has already been called into question... ...it isn't beyond the realms of possibility that what these witnesses heard wasn't a gunshot at all.Venus: Oh, please! What are you tryin' to say?Gossip: Uz lot know what we heard! And it woz a loud bang that came from that there room!Sandwich: Now y-you listen to me! A street seller's ears are his l-l-livelihood.Ryunosuke: I don't doubt your ears, sir. But all you can state with certainty is that you heard a noise.Gossip: Eh?Judge: Explain yourself then, Counsel.Ryunosuke: A noise that sounds like a gunshot could have been made with...Present Venus Firecracker (after examining fuse) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Something like this. The culprit could have set off one of these to fake a gunshot.\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Well, the culprit could have used something like this, for example. Judge: Oh really? A demonstration is in order then, I feel. Ryunosuke: Wha...? Kazuma: Yes, please, show the court how you could use that to create a noise like a gunshot. Judge: ...We're waiting, Counsel. Ryunosuke: ......... I may have been mistaken. Kazuma: It looks like you've been making a lot of noise yourself... Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Ah! (Ugh...Kazuma's got a devastating way with words in English, too.) Susato: I realise it may be difficult to retract what you said and present some different evidence, but perhaps... Ryunosuke: (Yes, I was thinking the same thing myself.) That's because I'm convinced there is some evidence that could produce a similar noise! Leads back to: \"Explain yourself then, Counsel.\"Ryunosuke: Something like this. The culprit could have set off one of these to fake a gunshot.Judge: Good gracious! The very fireworks that are sold by the witness?Venus: ...Now 'old on a minute! Are you sayin' I did it?! My pretty little firecrackers only make a little pop anyway. See?Ryunosuke: Not a hundred of them together. The Venus Special that you sell for six hundred pennies sounds like this:...*BANG!*Ryunosuke: As the court can now attest...it sounds very much like a gunshot in fact.Venus: Agh agh agh agh agh!Kazuma: You're trying to suggest that somebody set one of those fireworks off at the scene?Ryunosuke: I'm suggesting that somebody knew the defendant was in the room at five that day... ...and sought to implicate him by creating a sound like a gunshot for these pedlars on Fresno Street to hear!Kazuma:Kazuma: But even the accused himself has testified that he saw no one else in the room at the time. Whether it was a gun or a firecracker, the only person present to cause that bang was Barok van Zieks!Venus: One whiff of a match and my firecrackers go pop. See? It's why people like 'em.Judge: I fear for your fingers, young lady.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: Recently during my time here in Britain, I've learnt of a very useful invention indeed. Something called a, um...a time bomb.Judge: Good heavens! A bomb?!Ryunosuke: Yes, a device that allows you to blow up whatever you like, whenever you like.Susato: Mr Naruhodo. I worry that your unfortunate phrasing there...may lead to yet another international incident.Ryunosuke: Ah! No no no! Wait! ...It's, it's the 'whenever you like' part that's important.Kazuma: A timed device?Ryunosuke: Yes! Exactly! A timed device! Something of that nature could have been planted at the scene. A device that was able to produce the sound of a gunshot long after the culprit had left.Judge: Your extravagant claim will have to be substantiated with evidence, Counsel. What proof do you have to suggest in any way that a timed device was employed to create the gunshot sound?Present Candelabrum Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"As the court has already discussed, the tip of one of the candles in this candelabrum has been blown off.\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Judge: You're suggesting this could have been used as some sort of 'time delay' device? Ryunosuke: I...did think so, My Lord. But it's becoming increasingly clear... ...that we've all been very misguided here. Kazuma: Kazuma: Yes, by you. Ryunosuke: Wha...? Judge: No, Counsel, the time has come for a penalty. Without delay. Ryunosuke: (Ugh...no time to clear the area before the blast...) Leads back to: \"Your extravagant claim will have to be substantiated with evidence, Counsel.\"Ryunosuke: As the court has already discussed, the tip of one of the candles in this candelabrum has been blown off.Judge: Indeed. Because it was struck by the bullet, which presumably passed through the victim.Ryunosuke: I don't think that's possible, My Lord.Kazuma: Not possible? Why?Ryunosuke: Because of the scorching. There are gunpowder scorch marks clearly visible on the broken candle.Judge: There are? ...Goodness, yes! But is it not the case... ...that there was also scorching on the victim around the bullet entry wound?Ryunosuke: That's right, there was. But as we heard earlier... ...scorching like that only occurs when the target is at very close range - a matter of centimetres from the gun.Judge: Ah!Ryunosuke: Which means that the scorching on the candle can't possibly be the result of a gunshot.Kazuma: You're suggesting it came from the fireworks?Gossip: How can that be, eh?Ryunosuke: The fact that there's such visible scorching on the candle... ...suggests that the fireworks must have been right next to it when they exploded. Or to put it another way...the candle and firecrackers were joined together.The culprit somehow attached the firecrackers at a point partway down the candle. After the killer had left the scene... ...the candle slowly burnt down along with the other two... ...until eventually it ignited the fuse of the firecrackers generating a loud......*BANG!*.........Ryunosuke: And that is how these three witnesses came to believe they'd heard a gunshot at five o'clock.Judge: ......... Well...what a plot... And this implies that the victim could have died earlier than we've been led to believe. The previous day, even.Gossip: Now...now...now just hold your horses! All uz lot here saw the victim goin' into the building, remember?Sandwich: I, I couldn't forget that flame-coloured hair even if I w-wanted to.Ryunosuke: The person you saw entering the building wasn't the victim at all. ...Consider this.Gossip: Ah!Ryunosuke: Obviously anybody can wear a wig. So the person that these witnesses saw entering the building fifteen minutes before the incident occurred... ...could easily have been someone else entirely wearing the red hairpiece.Judge: Someone else?! Do, do you mean to say...?Ryunosuke: It was the same person who contrived the firecracker trick. In other words...Inspector Gregson's killer!???:Pfft...Examine evidence Candelabrum Scorch marks Ryunosuke: So the candle was used as a sort of timer device to set off the firecrackers... That's a really ingenious idea...though obviously it's a shame it was used for such a wicked purpose. Susato: I wonder if there aren't some more positive uses for a timer device such as that... Ah, I have the perfect application! It would be a wonderful way of waking you in the mornings, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: ...I think I'd prefer that you continue to wake me in person, if it's all the same to you.Kazuma: Ha ha ha ha ha ha hah! Oh, very impressive, Ryunosuke Naruhodo.Ryunosuke: K-Kazuma?!Kazuma: I'm really quite amazed you've come this far. But after all, wasn't I the one who told you... ...that you had all the makings of a great defence lawyer?Ryunosuke: ...!Kazuma: I also noted the lack of a time of death in this report. A stark omission. But as far as I'm concerned...this whole country's justice system leaves a lot to be desired!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! Prosecutor Asogi! What do you mean by that statement?Kazuma: I hear that many of the leading members of Britain's judiciary are present to observe this trial today. So we cannot allow even the slightest doubt to be overlooked.Judge: ...!Kazuma: The defence's assertion about the time of death based on the victim's stopped watch is just conjecture. But...while the possibility exists that my learned friend may be correct...we have a duty to explore it.Judge: Hmmm... Well, certainly...I would agree with you.Kazuma: And what immediately comes to mind is of course... ...what was Inspector Gregson doing and where did he go on the day before the incident?Ryunosuke: Do you know?Kazuma: The inspector always carried out his investigative work alone. His movements were treated as confidential within Scotland Yard.Judge: Even within the Yard?Kazuma: However, considering the evidence we've been presented with so far... ...I'd say it's fairly apparent what case the man was pursuing. Wouldn't you, my learned friend?Susato: I do have a feeling about what case he might have been investigating.Ryunosuke: Yes, I agree. Surely... My Lord! The defence believes it can explain to the court... ...the case that was being investigated by Inspector Gregson at the time of his death!Judge: Very well, Counsel. Present your argument to the court. What evidence is suggestive of the case being investigated by the inspector on the day prior to the incident?Present Red-Headed League Article or Red Hairpiece Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"I believe this red hairpiece points to the answer.\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Judge: Hm... I can't say that I find your answer suggestive of anything in particular. Other than perhaps that it is utterly wrong. That much you have clarified most expertly. Ryunosuke: Wha...? Kazuma: Congratulations, Ryunosuke Naruhodo. You deserve a reward for that expert display! Ryunosuke: AAAAAARGH! (Did, did you just draw Karuma on me, my friend?) Susato: I think, Mr Naruhodo, that there's one particular piece of evidence... ...that really does stand out in showing what case Inspector Gregson was investigating. Ryunosuke: My Lord! I have the answer now! Leads back to: \"Very well, Counsel.\"Ryunosuke: I believe this red hairpiece points to the answer.Kazuma: ...!Ryunosuke: We might assume it was part of a disguise used to carry out an undercover investigation.Judge: Surely not! Such a brightly coloured hairpiece would only serve to make the inspector more noticeable.Ryunosuke: Yes, that's quite true. It would definitely have made him stand out in a crowd. Except, that is...in a crowd of gentlemen from the Red-Headed League.Judge: The, the Red-Headed League?Kazuma: So...you'd already worked it out.Judge: What on earth is this all about? Is there such an extraordinary league of gentlemen?Kazuma: The Red-Headed League is currently under investigation for a grand deception.Judge: A deception of what nature, Counsel?Kazuma: They've been targeting red-headed men across all of London and tricking them out of small sums of money. Two men were arrested for the misdemeanour only yesterday, in fact.Ryunosuke: My Lord! The defence calls for those two men to be summoned at once!Judge: T-Two red-heads?!Ryunosuke: Inspector Gregson clearly infiltrated the Red-Headed League using this hairpiece. So it's very likely that he had direct contact with these criminals. And it's quite possible that such contact led to...more serious events.Kazuma: .........Judge: I concur that we cannot in good conscience leave this new avenue unexplored.Susato: Well done, Mr Naruhodo!Ryunosuke: Well...it's another possible line of enquiry for us at least.Judge: The prosecution will make immediate arrangements for the charged men to appear. Bring these two Red-Headed League conspirators before me, Prosecutor Asogi!Kazuma: At once, My Lord.Judge: Very good. We will have a thirty-minute recess. Court is adjourned!To be continued...2nd November, 12:33 p.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' AntechamberGina: Oh, there you are, 'Oddo!Sholmes: What kept you, my dear fellow?Ryunosuke: Hello, Mr Sholmes. Gina.Gina: You sure about wot you said in there? That the boss...you know...actually died the day before? It's pretty 'ard to swallow.Susato: Yes, I was shocked by the revelation too, Gina.Sholmes: As was I! Possibly more shocked than both of you!Ryunosuke: ...It's not a competition, Mr Sholmes. (But I was more shocked than all of you put together.)Sholmes: This is the autopsy report in question, is it?Ryunosuke: Yes. It's strange that there's no time of death noted. I suppose there's a simple explanation. Or perhaps...it was a deliberate omission.Susato: Oh dear... If it was deliberate... ...it puts me in mind of the last case we worked on...and Dr Sithe.Ryunosuke: I know. Anyway, it seems that on the day before Lord van Zieks discovered his body... ...Inspector Gregson was investigating the Red-Headed League. So perhaps something happened with them. Come to think of it... ...you had trouble with those league men too, didn't you, Mr Sholmes? You were taken in by their trick.Sholmes: No no no! Naturally, I wasn't 'taken in' as you put it. My sleuth-hound interest was merely piqued slightly by the rare scent of a weekly four-pound income.Ryunosuke: ...And that scent masked the underlying scent of deception, I suppose.Susato: The two criminals in question are the pair we saw being arrested yesterday, aren't they? In Mr Sholmes's suite, I mean.Gina: That's right, Sooze! An' it was me wot took 'em in! Thanks to a tip-off by a good, law-abidin' citizen.Sholmes: Indeed. Yours truly.Ryunosuke: (So it's going to be that pair in the witness stand next, is it?) Something doesn't quite make sense to me, though. The day before Inspector Gregson was found, you hadn't had trouble with the Red-Headed League yet, had you? Why would the inspector have been investigating them?Sholmes: Well, the likely explanation would be... ...that Gregson's own sleuth-hound interest was piqued by the rare scent of a weekly four-pound income.Gina: Don't tar 'im wiv the same brush as you, Sholmes!Ryunosuke: Yes, well... Then there's the whole issue of Inspector Gregson being investigated by Lord van Zieks for some reason.Susato: The Reaper...the Red-Headed League... Inspector Gregson...Lord van Zieks...Ryunosuke: ...And Kazuma.Susato: ...!Ryunosuke: I feel as though he knew we'd arrive at this point somehow.Susato: Gosh! I, I think you're right...Ryunosuke: (What's he really trying to achieve here today?)Sholmes: All the answers will soon be revealed. ...Observe the time, my dear fellow. This recess will be over very shortly.Ryunosuke: Yes, you're right. (Kazuma was determined that he should be the one to prosecute this trial. And he was determined that I should take the defence. Just what is it that he's hoping to make me see, I wonder? I get the feeling we're a long way from the end of this trial yet...) Are you ready then, Miss Susato?Susato: Yes!2nd November, 1:00 p.m. The Old Bailey CourtroomJudge: In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session again. We resume the closed court hearing of Barok van Zieks, here present, who stands accused of murder. Now then, Prosecutor Asogi...Kazuma: My Lord?Judge: Have you summoned the witnesses as requested?Kazuma: Yes. The two members of the Red-Headed League who planned and carried out the deception. They arrived not long ago from the local prison by police carriage.Judge: Very good. Bailiff, usher the two men into the courtroom!Kazuma: These two men are currently being held by the police on suspicion of attempted extortion. You may omit your occupations. But please state your names now for the court.De Rousseau: I am Fabien de Rousseau. A descendant of ze great de Rousseau family from Nice, en France.De Rossi: And my-a name is Peppino de Rossi! I am the third son of the great familia de Rossi - the landowners from Napoli!Kazuma: The two men first became acquainted at a boarding school for European nobility.De Rousseau: Zose who graduate from Temsik are ze future leaders of Europe. ...But! Do you 'ave any idea 'ow boring it is to be born wiz noble blood? ...Alors! I make it my mission to get ze better of ze world by employing ze little grey cells of my brain. Zat is all I am trying to do, uh.Ryunosuke: So...that's the only reason for this whole grand deception you've been carrying out?De Rousseau: ...Oui. You could say zat.De Rossi: Not bad, ay? He has the grand ideals, but the petty plans! This strange combination is-a the charm of the Hairlarious Brothers! Si, capo?De Rousseau: ......... Listen to me, Peppino. I 'ave two sings to say to you:De Rossi: Eh? Che? Are you about to tell me one of your grandi anecdotes? Evviva!De Rousseau: Firstly, I want you to stop calling me zis 'capo'. And secondly... ..we are not ze 'Airlarious Brothers. Zis is serious business.De Rossi: Che bello! There it is! The capo's trump-a card: the furrowed brow! It is deep, uh, capo? The furrow, and the meaning of your words!Judge: The court has been led to believe that under the banner of the 'Red-Headed League'... ...you have conspired to swindle money from unsuspecting members of the public. Is this true?De Rousseau: Oui. C'est ça.Judge: And what exactly was the nature of this deception by which you planned to defraud?De Rousseau: ...Alors, I will explain it.De Rossi: No, capo! Leave it to-a me! As you see, we both have the vivid red hair, no? At school, we were teased for this without pity. The capo here, he was many times behind the schoolhouse, crying like the Trevi Fountain. 'Uèèè! Zose dogs! One day ze world will respect us red-'eads!' Every night, he would bury his-a head in his-a pillow and weep for the injustice.De Rousseau: C'est bien, Peppino! Enough! I will explain ze rest. Ze first step was ze newspaper advertisement. About one week before ze plan was put into operation, we listed ze same notice in every paper in London.Ryunosuke: Yes, we saw that notice. It was this one, I believe. Entitled 'To the Red-Headed League'.De Rousseau: Oui. C'est ça. I am honoured zat you 'ave seen it.Ryunosuke: It states that the only condition for joining the league is having flame-coloured hair. And that if you satisfy the interview panel and are admitted into the league... ...you could receive a weekly income of four pounds.Kazuma: On the date specified, red-headed hopefuls gathered in droves at a park specified in the advertisement. And from each person present, this pair took an application fee of five shillings.De Rousseau: And wiz ze money, to France! It was a plan most elegant, non?Kazuma: No, it was most dishonourable. But to be frank, I'm stunned anybody was foolish enough to be taken in by such an obvious trick.Susato: The park was described by one witness as 'choked with red-headed folk, like a coster's orange barrow'.Kazuma: And the day on which all these men gathered to apply was the day before the victim was discovered. Crucially, these two men spoke face to face with every single person present that day.De Rousseau: Oui. I 'ave seen more red-'eaded people in one day zan I will see in ze rest of my life.De Rossi: Si, si. And-a now, every time I see the capo's hair, I feel sick to my stomach!De Rousseau: Anyway, why 'ave we been summoned 'ere today?Ryunosuke: Sorry?De Rousseau: Ze date for our trial was not until tomorrow, I was told.Kazuma: Naturally, neither of these men have been told any details about this trial. They've only been shown this photograph.Judge: Very good. So, Mr de Rousseau and Mr de Rossi, you will now give your formal testimony for the court... ...on the subject of the gentleman pictured in this photograph.De Rousseau: Of course. We are always ready to 'elp wiz ze law.Witness Testimony - The Man in the Photograph -De Rousseau: We 'ad more zan one thousand red-'eaded people assemble in ze park on Lime Street zat day.De Rossi: But I don't recall the man in this-a photograph. Ay, capo?De Rousseau: Non, I don't remember 'im. Obviously 'e is dead now. But I assure you, 'e was not in ze park.De Rossi: Allora! This victim is-a nothing to do with us!De Rousseau: You 'ave a lot to answer for, Peppino. It is your fault zat we got caught in ze first place.Kazuma: You've given sworn testimony that this man in the photograph was not present. Can you be certain?De Rousseau: Oui, oui. I am quite certain. We did not interview zis man.De Rossi: Nobody looking like-a this came to the park. This, I can promise!Judge: It must be noted that you have been arrested for a grand deception, however. Accordingly, this court has little confidence in your assurances.De Rossi: ...!  ...Uffa! With this attitude, we get-a nowhere, uh?Ryunosuke: (He's really-a sulking now...)Kazuma: This confidential document was obtained directly from Scotland Yard. It records an entry from the inspector's private diary dated the day before the incident. It reads, 'Lime Street, Red-Headed League, Undercover.'De Rossi: Ah! I have the answer! Maybe there was another, similar event in the park on the day in question, ay?De Rousseau: Zat is ridiculous.Ryunosuke: (There's no question that Inspector Gregson was investigating the Red-Headed League. Which means it's quite possible that's when he was killed!)Judge: Very well. The defence may proceed with the cross-examination now.Ryunosuke: Ah.

Thus, the testimony that \"This victim is-a nothing to do with us!\" is contradicted, since the evidence shows that Mr Vigil was at the park in question and has a connection to their operation.\n",

'I wonder exactly how many mysteries are out there, hidden within this bed of fog,' he said. Indeed, a most bizarre incident born of a curious advertisement... a hell-hound's mad gallop through the shadows of a serial murder, an executed man's graveyard resurrection in the dead of night... and a commonplace killing in a small, forgotten room at the edge of town... There is, naturally, always another side to every case of which most remain ignorant. 'And it is that \"other side\" which compels me to the scene of the crime, Wilson. So, quickly now. Take your hat and let's be on our way, my dear fellow. For our adventure is not over yet. Come! The game is afoot!' Eight days after that earth-shattering trial and Kazuma regaining his memory... ...we were in the foyer of one of London's most luxurious hotels, the Great Waterloo Hotel. 1st November, 10:24 a.m. Great Waterloo Hotel Foyer Ryunosuke: Professor Mikotoba is due to arrive at any moment. Susato: Yes! I'm so glad we got here in time! ......... Ryunosuke: (Susato-san hasn't been the same since what happened. Not that I'm surprised.) Susato: The truth about Kazuma-sama's father... Ryunosuke: ...! Susato: Do you suppose my father knew? Ryunosuke: That he was actually the mass murderer, the Professor, you mean? (I knew that's what she was thinking about.) There's a good chance, I'd say. I mean... ...they did come here to London together sixteen years ago, didn't they? Susato: Yes, that's true... Ryunosuke: ......... Come to think of it, didn't you say... ...that Professor Mikotoba knew about Kazuma going missing in Hong Kong as well? Susato: That's right. But for some reason, he wasn't at liberty to talk to me about it. Ryunosuke: (That probably means he knows, then... ...about Kazuma showing up here in London with amnesia, and that he's regained his memory now.) Susato: ......... ???: Ah, there she is! Susato: Oh... Father! Mikotoba: Hello, Susato! How are you? Susato: I'm very well, thank you. We're delighted you've arrived safe and sound! Mikotoba: Hello, Mr Naruhodo. Very kind of you to take the trouble to meet us here. Ryunosuke: Oh no, not at all. It's my pleasure. ???: We've heard all about your extraordinary exploits here in London, you know. The news has crossed the seas. Ryunosuke: It, it has? ???: I always look forward to reading the monthly reports that arrive with the steamships from Britain. Ryunosuke: Oh...I, I see. Well...thank you very much! (Who is this man? And why do I feel as though I've seen him before?) ???: Hm... I take it from your expression that you can't quite place me. Mikotoba: In that case...how about a little reminder, Seishiro? A firm tap should do it. ???: Yes... Ryunosuke: (A, a firm tap? What?) ???: Here we go, then... I hereby pronounce the defendant, Ryunosuke Naruhodo... ...GUILTY! Ryunosuke: Ah... OOOOOOH! Y-You're... Judge: The court will now hear the trial of Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Y... Your... ...Your Excellency! Susato: Hello, Judge Jigoku, how are you? It's been a long time. Jigoku: Hah hah hah hah hah! Good, you've remembered now! That really did the trick! Guilty! Hah hah hah hah hah! Ryunosuke: (Only I was declared not guilty, wasn't I? And there was no laughing at the time...) Jigoku: So, London again after all this time... Hard to believe it's been ten years. To be honest, I never thought I'd be back. Mikotoba: Neither did I. I didn't imagine Japan would ever be invited to an international symposium like this. Though, really, I doubt anyone did, to be honest. It's all thanks to you, isn't it, Seishiro? Jigoku: What are you talking about, Yujin? Hah hah hah hah hah! Ryunosuke: (Of course, Judge Jigoku... He must complete the set. He's the other man, who sixteen years ago... ...came to London with Kazuma's father and Professor Mikotoba. He's the third visiting scholar.) Mikotoba: Well, all those passport checks and luggage searches at the border took rather a lot of time. I must say, I'm very envious of your ministerial status. You didn't have to go through any of that, did you? Jigoku: Ah, I knew you were jealous! Hah hah hah hah hah! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Ministerial status? Mikotoba: Yes, didn't you know? Seishiro here is also Japan's Minister of Foreign Affairs. It was his personal insistence that allowed you to take Kazuma's place here on this study tour. Jigoku: Guilty as charged! Hah hah hah hah hah! Ryunosuke: Oh. Well, thank you very much. (He's really every bit as important as he looks.) Mikotoba: Ah yes now, Naruhodo... I received a telegram from Lord Stronghart yesterday. Ryunosuke: Oh, you did? Mikotoba: It appears that...some things came to light in a trial you were involved with eight days ago. About what happened ten years ago. That...tragedy. Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: Yes. Could you tell us any more about it? After clearing all Converse options: Mikotoba: Well, if you'll excuse us now... Jigoku: Yes, I'd like to get this trunk up to my room as soon as possible. Ryunosuke: Oh, I...I'm so sorry! I shouldn't have held you up here for so long. Susato: I'll call for the porter, then. Just wait here! Ryunosuke: (Susato-san's gone off at a run!) Mikotoba: I'd like to stay and talk more, but I do have various preparations to make for tomorrow. Ryunosuke: Yes, of course! It must be a big responsibility representing our entire country. I wish you the best of luck! Mikotoba: ......... Naruhodo... ...I hope you'll keep an eye on Susato for me. Keep looking after her as you obviously have been. Ryunosuke: Oh no! I, I mean, if anyone's looking after anyone, it's her looking after me! Mikotoba: Well I do appreciate you being there for her. After all... ...I've been a miserable father to her. I've thoroughly let her down. Ryunosuke: Sorry? What do you mean? Mikotoba: ......... Well, it was sixteen years ago that I started my long study tour here in Britain, as you know. The very year Susato was born. Ryunosuke: ...Yes, I heard. Mikotoba: The birth of my daughter was the most joyous event of my life, but... Well, sadly it was accompanied by the most tragic event of my life, too. Ryunosuke: (Oh...yes... Susato-san hinted at something like that...) Susato: It was a rather turbulent time at home... Mikotoba: ...Anyway, I won't bore you with the details. The point is, I became rather less dependable than befits a grown man. And it was then that Seishiro offered me the opportunity to study here in Great Britain. Jigoku: I was too worried about you to leave you behind. So perhaps I was a little heavy-handed when it came to persuading you to accompany me to London. Mikotoba: So...that's what happened in a nutshell. And that's also the reason why I now feel compelled to give my daughter as many opportunities as I dare. Though the world does not readily afford young women such things, I must say. Ryunosuke: I...completely understand, Professor. Mikotoba: ......... Ah, one other thing, Naruhodo... If I may be so bold, I have a favour to ask you. Ryunosuke: Oh, really? Of course! What can I do for you? Mikotoba: Well, the thing is, I- Susato: I'm so sorry that took so long! Ryunosuke: Miss Susato! Susato: Now then...allow us to take your bags! Porter: Allow me to take your bags! Mikotoba: One moment, if you please, porter. Porter: Of...of course, sir! Mikotoba: That machine around your neck... It's a camera, I believe? Porter: Quite right, sir! Just five shillings for a lovely photograph to commemorate a wonderful stay at the hotel, sir! Mikotoba: Well, I think given the occasion, we could justify the expense. Porter: ......... Ah! Yes, yes of course! Susato: ...I'd like to thank you for coming with me, Mr Naruhodo. It's really made Father very happy, I think. Ryunosuke: Oh, well, I'm pleased, then. (But we were interrupted before. Professor Mikotoba was about to ask me something.) Susato: Shall we return to Baker Street, then? I expect Iris will have some delicious tea waiting for us! Ryunosuke: Yes, let's go. (I'm getting more and more anxious about Kazuma, though. Perhaps I'll try to meet with Lord Stronghart later and ask after him...) 1st November British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Van Zieks: Here's the final draft of the opening address for tomorrow's proceedings. I've supplemented your original with the figures you asked for from the Yard. Stronghart: I see. Excellent work. Thank you. Van Zieks: ...You're welcome, My Lord. Ryunosuke: (What's Lord van Zieks doing here...?) Susato: My, there seems to be an awful lot of tension in the air, wouldn't you say? Ryunosuke: (This place is stifling enough as it is. We really don't need any more tension.) Stronghart: My apologies. I didn't notice you come in. Your small stature and dark dress make you all but invisible to me. Ryunosuke: Oh! No no! It's entirely my fault for wearing black, I'm sure. Susato: From now on, you must dress in white from head to toe whenever you come here! Stronghart: Now then, Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: Y-Yes, My Lord! I'm right here! Stronghart: ......... Ryunosuke: ......... (Ugh... Kill me now...) Stronghart: Is something wrong? Perhaps it's a little too hot in here for you. Ryunosuke: Oh, no, not at all! I mean, I've never experienced a room at such a perfect temperature! Stronghart: If you're sure. The beads of sweat carving their way down your face seem to suggest otherwise. Ryunosuke: (Because of the daggers you're staring at me with, mainly.) Stronghart: As you're no doubt aware, my International Forensic Science Symposium begins tomorrow. In fact, your father arrived in London earlier today, I hear, madam. Susato: Oh! Yes, that's right, My Lord. He's extremely honoured to have been invited. Stronghart: I'll leave the remaining preparations for the meeting room in your capable hands then, Lord van Zieks. Van Zieks: I will attend at once. Susato: He gave you a very cold stare as he left, didn't he? Ryunosuke: I know. But I haven't done anything...have I? Stronghart: These past few days, my feet have barely touched the ground, I must say. My dedicated right hand of many years was recently put out of action in spectacular fashion. Ryunosuke: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. ...Is your left hand still of service? Susato: Mr Naruhodo! He's talking about Dr Sithe! Ryunosuke: Ah! (Of course...) I'm, I'm terribly sorry about that. I was just, um... Stronghart: Fear not. You've done nothing wrong. Dr Sithe's own wrongdoing precipitated the situation. You needn't concern yourself with it any further. Ryunosuke: (That would be a lot easier to do if it weren't for the piercing stare you're giving me...) Stronghart: Lord van Zieks is doing an admirable job of holding the fort. Though disturbingly, his apprentice has been missing since yesterday. Ryunosuke: O-Oh... (Missing...?) Susato: What's become of Kazuma-sama now...? 1st November Sholmes's Suite ???: Uèèèèèèèèèèèèè uèèèèèèèèèèèèèèè! Ryunosuke: W-What was that?! Susato: A, a man screaming! In a most unflattering way! Ryunosuke: Do you think... Could it have been Mr Sholmes? Susato: Oh my! I do hope not... ???: Uèèèèèèèèèèèè! I don't-a do it any more! ???: Mon ami, mon ami... Stop zis disgraceful display, uh? Ryunosuke: Who, who are these people? (Look at their hair! It's bright red...) Susato: I think...they must be clients of Mr Sholmes. Gina: Right, you two. Yer comin' wiv me now. Down to the clink. ???: No! Not in prison! It is dark and damp and I don't-a like it! ???: Bof! Ze darkness, it is my friend. I am not scared! ???: Uèèè uèèèèèèèèèèèè! But you are always scared of the dark! ???: Shut your mouth, you idiot! I will sit quietly in ze dark and plan our next daring 'eist! ???: Uèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèè! I don't-a like this! I don't-a like it! Gina: Well tough! We'll finish this down the Yard! Now get movin'! Iris: By then, Ginny! Have fun! Gina: Oh yeah, thanks, Iris! And thanks...ya great detective! Susato: Heehee! Gina makes a fine detective herself, doesn't she? Iris: Oh, Susie! And Runo! Ryunosuke: Hello, Iris. We're home! Iris: Well? Did you find your daddy? Susato: Yes! We arrived at the hotel just before he and his friend. Iris: Oh! Well that's great news. I hope I'll get to see my daddy again soon... Susato: Ah...yes...of course... Ryunosuke: (Dr John H. Wilson...) ???: So, Iris! All that remains now is that greatest of problems known to man! Sholmes: But before we concern ourselves with that, I believe some tea is in order, don't you, my dear fellows? Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: ......... Sholmes: Is something wrong, Mr Naruhodo? Do I have a crumb or suchlike on my face? Ryunosuke: Uh... (Not so much on your face... ...as on your head, I'd say.) Iris: Come along then, everyone. I've brewed a lovely special blend. Time for tea! Susato: Whatever is going on here today? Sholmes: In that case, let us sit and drink now. For I am in fact expecting a guest later today. After clearing Converse options with Herlock Sholmes and clearing all Converse options in British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office: *Ding-aling-aling* Sholmes: Aha! Here is my guest now. My latest client! With money to spend! Iris: Ooh, I do hope it's an exciting case, Hurley! Sholmes: Remember, Iris, we are at present gripped by the greatest problem known to man. I must be willing to accept any case, no matter how unstimulating. Save locating a runaway, of course. Ryunosuke: ...Don't spare anyone's feelings, will you? Iris: Oh dear... I'm afraid that Hurley can lack a little tact, especially just before the rent is due. *Thwack!* ???: Mr Sholmes! Mr Herlock Sholmes! Please... Oh, please... ...please find my husband! He's run away! Sholmes: To upset me? ???: I beg your pardon? Sholmes: Never mind. A personal matter. My apologies. What exactly are you trying to say, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: ...I didn't say a word. Sholmes: Come, my dear madam, be seated. Iris, some tea, if you please? Iris: Of course! Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: What's the matter, Miss Susato? Susato: Oh, it's...it's just that gentlewoman... I feel sure I've seen her somewhere before. Very recently. Ryunosuke: (...! Yes, now you come to mention it...) Evie: As I explained earlier, my name is Evie Vigil. I implore you to take the case, sir! Money is no object. Simply name your figure! Sholmes: Money and wealth are of little consequence to me, madam. Being offered a case to solve is reward enough. Evie: Oh, Mr Sholmes! You are the picture of benevolence! Sholmes: I will of course make a mental note of your offer, however. For...contingent reasons. I trust you will remember your words also. Evie: Um...if I might enquire, sir... ...this gentleman and lady would be...? Ryunosuke: Oh! Um...me? Evie: What I am about to tell you, I should like to communicate in the strictest confidence, you understand. Sholmes: Ah, these are my friends. I assure you, you may say before this pair anything which you may say to me. Evie: Ah...I see... Sholmes: I can vouch for the gentleman personally. After all... ...he's hard of hearing. Ryunosuke: (...Why did I ever get my hopes up?) After clearing all Converse options: Sholmes: Thank you for everything you have shared with us, Mrs Vigil. I believe I have all the information I need to begin my investigation. Evie: Oh, please report to me soon with good news, sir! Sholmes: Fear not, madam. In a day or two, I shall be contacting you with a heartening report, I'm quite sure. Evie: So soon? Oh, how splendid, Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: Good news should be delivered early, I always say. If you would be so kind as to leave the photograph of your husband in my possession...? The photograph of Mr Vigil has been entered into the Court Record. Sholmes: Thank you. Now, allow me to show you the door. Evie: I can't thank you enough, Mr Sholmes. You've been simply marvellous! Iris: You know, I think it every time, Hurley... ...but how do you come out with such nonsense? Good news in a day or two? Are you sure? Sholmes: I can't be sure, of course. But then I didn't swear on it. I merely gave the good woman some hope. I hope to be able to give her good news, one might say. After all, the rent must be paid by the end of day tomorrow. If by that time I've successfully located Mr Vigil, we shall be mutually relieved. Wouldn't you agree, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: ...Don't look at me with those pleading eyes. Sholmes: Well, my dear fellow? Did you hear the details of the case? Ryunosuke: Yes...my hearing is surprisingly good, actually. Sholmes: Excellent! And what did you make of it? Ryunosuke: Well, I was surprised to learn where her husband worked. At Barclay Prison, I mean... Sholmes: Ah, so you noted that? Susato: Of course. Especially with the mention of Lowgate Cemetery... Drebber: Lowgate Cemetery as at the rear of Barclay Prison. So it was renowned among us students at the university for being haunted by the ghosts of condemned convicts. Susato: Barclay Prison is where that notorious man was incarcerated! Ryunosuke: The Professor... Sholmes: And now a warder from the prison has mysteriously disappeared, it would seem. Ryunosuke: It's all very peculiar... Sholmes: Indeed. But nothing you can't handle, I'm quite certain, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: Run along to the prison and see what you can glean, would you? It's the prison governor you want. No doubt the man is equally worried. Ryunosuke: But...aren't you going to go yourself? Sholmes: Surely you needn't ask. I can't possibly be seen out with this hair! Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: ...But didn't you go to Lime Street with that hair? Sholmes: That was a quite different matter. So, I leave it in your capable hands. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm rather busy. Ryunosuke: (Of course you are...) 1st November, 10:24 a.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy Barclay Prison is on the outskirts of London, backing onto a lonely burial ground. Its four high outer walls loomed quietly before us in the fog. Having requested a meeting, we were shown to the governor's office in the watchtower. 1st November Barclay Prison, Governor's Office ???: This place is full of hardened criminals. I cannae remember the last time a civilian was doon here. And you dinnae want to talk to an inmate, but to me? Caidin: D'you ken who I am? I'm the governor, Barry Caidin......... hm? Ryunosuke: Oh...yes...it's a pleasure. I'm Ryunosuke Naruhodo, defence lawyer. Caidin: And an Easterner, I see. Does that mean... Ryunosuke: Yes, I'm a visiting student of law from the Empire of Japan. Caidin: Japan?! Did ye say Japan? Ryunosuke: Um...yes? Caidin: Well there's no any of your kind in here, laddie! Maybe you should try the prison next door, eh? Susato: I didn't notice another prison next door, sir... Ryunosuke: Anyway, we came to ask you some questions about- Caidin: I dinnae like to be so direct, but... ...I've no intention of speaking wi' the likes o' you suspicious-looking Easterners. Now get oot of my hair. Ryunosuke: (So as soon as he finds out that we're from Japan, he reacts like this... That surely means...) Susato: I think...it's because of the Professor case. Ryunosuke: You think so too? (Ten years ago... ...Genshin Asogi - also known as the Professor - was incarcerated at this prison.) And then, after his execution, he apparently re-merged from his grave in the cemetery behind the prison. Caidin: I, I might 'ave known! You're sniffing around aboot that case, aren't ya? You're agents, eh? Part of the Professor's great web, no doubt. Ryunosuke: No! Not at all! We're just- Caidin: Get gone wi' ya! Before I punch yer lights oot! Ryunosuke: We're going, we're going! (Clearly the ghost of that killer still haunts this place... We're not going to get anywhere here. Unless we can somehow prove to this man that there's nothing suspicious about us...) Susato: Governor Caidin... Ryunosuke: What are you thinking, Miss Susato? Susato: I feel sure that name came up in conversation recently somewhere. I was wondering if whoever mentioned him might have some ideas to help us. Ryunosuke: (Come to think of it, I have the same feeling...) Great Waterloo Hotel Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Barclay Prison, Governor's Office Ryunosuke: If you'd just cast your eyes over this, Governor Caidin... Caidin: What's this then? You cannae pull the wool over my eyes, you good-fer-nothin' Japanese student! ......... Mikotoba? That, that young jock from the forensics laboratory? That Mikotoba? Ryunosuke: Yes! Exactly! Him! Susato: Oh dear, perhaps I should have said something sooner... I'm Yujin Mikotoba's daughter, Susato. Caidin: Jings! You're the young man's daughter? And ya did'nae think to mention that afore? Susato: I, I do apologise... Caidin: Aye, well, ye'd best take a seat then. Can I offer you a cup of tea, perhaps? And dinnae forget to try one of these wee handcuff biscuits! Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: Your father's influence is nothing short of amazing... Susato: I'm bitterly regretting not announcing who I was from the outset now. Caidin: So then...what can I do for you, hen? Susato: Well...we're currently investigating a case. Ryunosuke: It's one of your warders, you see. He's gone missing. Caidin: Missing? Susato: That's right. It's surely been reported to you as well, being the prison governor. Caidin: ......... I have'nae heard nothing of the sort. There's no missing persons in my prison! Susato: Oh! Ryunosuke: (But...how can that be?) Susato: It's Mr Daley Vigil, your chief warder... Caidin: Eh? Vigil? Ryunosuke: That's right. His wife came to us and asked us to investigate his disappearance. (Let's skip the part about him only going missing yesterday for now...) Caidin: ......... Ryunosuke: (Clearly that means something to him...) Susato: Would you be so kind as to tell us what you know, sir? Caidin: Aye... Aye, of course. After clearing all Converse options: Caidin: Well... ...I cannae tell you anything else. Susato: Thank you so much for your time, Governor. Caidin: Oh, one moment afore you're away, hen... I'm sure I have it here somewhere... Ah, found it. Here, take this as a wee souvenir of your visit to the prison. Susato: What is it? Caidin: That's Vigil's dismissal notice. It's ten years old now of course. Susato: Oh my! Are you sure? Caidin: Aye, it's no trouble at all. It's no the original, mind. Vigil's dismissal notice has been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: Thank you very much, Governor Caidin! Caidin: Well in return... ...do me a favour and never come back here. That case is closed. Susato: Well, I think we ought to return to Baker Street for the time being. Ryunosuke: Yes, I agree. We need to report back to Mr Sholmes with what we've found out about Mr Vigil. (What will he tell Mrs Vigil, I wonder?) 1st November Sholmes's Suite Ryunosuke: We're back! ???: Hello, you two! Iris: I thought you'd be back before long, so I baked some scones for us all. Ryunosuke: Ah! So that's what the delicious smell is. Sholmes: Greetings, my dear fellows! You've returned a good deal sooner than I was anticipating. Ryunosuke: Um...hello, Mr Sholmes. ......... Susato: Hello, Mr...Sholmes... ......... Sholmes: Say nothing. Your thoughts are written all over your faces in any case. It turns out that it may have been advisable to test my hair colour restoration tonic before application. Susato: Oh my... Sholmes: Pray, tell me. What of our warder friend? Have you garnered some new information? Ryunosuke: Oh, um...yes. Something very surprising, in fact. Though it's not a patch on your hair, to be honest. Susato: It most certainly isn't. But still, we discovered that- ???: SHOOOOOOOOOLMES!!! Gina: Drop everyfin', Sholmes! This is more important! Ryunosuke: Gina? Gina: I, I can't Adam an' Eve it... *Sniff, sniff...* Susato: What's happened? Sholmes: Clearly a very grave matter indeed. For Miss Lestrade made no mention of my hair whatsoever. Gina: It's...it's the boss... Ryunosuke: What do you mean? (Inspector Gregson?) Gina: The boss is... He's... He's dead. Ryunosuke: What...? Gina: They, they just found 'is body. Shot...wiv a pistol... Ryunosuke: WHAAAAAAAAAT?! Susato: But...but... Inspector Gregson?! Ryunosuke: (He was...murdered?!) Iris: No... Not Gregsy... Sholmes: Come in, my dear girl. Tell us the whole story. Gina: *Sniff, sniff...* After clearing all Converse options: Sholmes: ......... Thank you for informing us, Miss Lestrade. This really is most terrible news. I'm dreadfully sorry... Gina: Wot are you sayin' sorry for? You didn't do nuffin'! Sholmes: ......... Gina: Well...anyway... ...I'm takin' a cab over to the scene right now. Please come an' all! As soon as ya can! You've gotta 'elp! Sholmes: It's a detective's lot to appear wherever some sinister plot has unfolded. Little wonder we all look haggard. Sometimes these things are almost too much for the nerves. Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes... Sholmes: What use is there in being a great detective if I fail to see something like this coming, hm?! How could I let this happen to Gregson?! To Gregson... Susato: ......... Sholmes: Mr Naruhodo, I shall leave at once to begin my investigations. Ryunosuke: Of course, yes. We will, too. Sholmes: It would be helpful... ...if you could talk to Mr Reaper and see what you can glean. I'm sure you were intending to do so anyway. Until later, then! Ryunosuke: (Inspector Gregson, dead... And Lord van Zieks arrested...) Iris: Runo! Susie! I've called you a hansom. It's waiting outside. Ryunosuke: Thanks, Iris. Shall we, Miss Susato? Susato: Yes! Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy 1st November Room on Fresno Street Ryunosuke: (This really is an out-of-the-way part of London. I doubt many people find their way down this back street. So this dust-ridden rented old room is where it happened then...) Susato: So this is...where poor Inspector Gregson lost his life. Ryunosuke: Yes... And the police are already hard at work investigating, it seems. (I don't see Mr Sholmes anywhere, though... Perhaps his investigations have taken him elsewhere.) Gina: Oi! Wot d'ya think yer doin' there?! Every one o' them drawers 'as gotta be taken right out so you can look underneath an' all! I want the space above this ceilin' checked, and don't forget to look inside the chimney stack, too! Blimey! Ain't you lot never gone over an 'ouse lookin' for dough when the owners are out o' town?

Ryunosuke: Hello again, Gina. Gina: Sholmes 'as only just left. Yer lucky ya missed that. 'E went prancin' around in 'ere, pointin' at stuff an' flickin' that 'at of 'is an' then just scarpered. Susato: Oh! He's finished investigating already, you mean? Gina: Yeah... 'E didn't stop to say nuffin' to no one. Not even me. Ryunosuke: Gina! Would you mind if we investigated, too? Gina: ......... Listen, 'Oddo... ...yer a lawyer, right? Ryunosuke: Um...yes. Why? Gina: Well, yer not thinkin' of...tryin' to 'elp that Reaper bloke, are ya? Ryunosuke: Oh! (Poor Gina... She's never going to forget, is she? That trial will haunt her forever.) Susato: Gina, if you don't mind me saying... If Lord van Zieks really is responsible for this crime... ...he will be duly and fairly judged in court. Gina: ......... I suppose yer right, yeah. Go on then, 'Oddo! Get investigatin'! I wanna know the truth about wot really 'appened 'ere! Ryunosuke: Thank you, Gina! 1st November Local Prison, Cell 1 Ryunosuke: (There he is. Lord van Zieks behind bars...) Susato: So it's true. He really was arrested... Ryunosuke: (He's sitting with his back to the wall, reading something. I don't think he's noticed us.) Erm...Lord van Zieks! Van Zieks: ...Fancy meeting you here. The last place on Earth I'd like to be, with the last person on earth I'd like to see. Ryunosuke: ...I couldn't very well not come. We heard what happened. That you... That Inspector Gregson was... Van Zieks: ......... Go home. This has nothing to do with you. Ryunosuke: But... Susato: Forgive me, Lord van Zieks, but I must disagree. Van Zieks: ......... Susato: Inspector Gregson was very helpful to us on a number of occasions. We're indebted to him. At the very least we owe it to him to find out the truth about his death. You must help us with our investigations, please! Van Zieks: ......... There's really nothing I can tell you. Ryunosuke: What were you just reading at the back of the cell there? Was it something related to the case? Van Zieks: ...This? The Yard isn't quite so cavalier with its information as to share case details with a suspect. This is...a letter from an old acquaintance. Susato: Oh. Who might that be? Van Zieks: Someone you know, as it happens. Albert Harebrayne. Ryunosuke: (Of course, yes. I keep forgetting they went to the same university.) Van Zieks: And I would like to read my correspondence in peace. So let's get this over with, shall we? What is it you want to know? Ryunosuke: (Strange... I mean, let's face it, Lord van Zieks never minces his words... ...but they seem to have less bite than usual somehow.) After clearing all Converse options: Van Zieks: ......... So. It appears our conversation has run dry. Ryunosuke: There was a two-second silence, that's all. Van Zieks: Well in any event, if you'll excuse me now. ...I wouldn't like to detain you. Ryunosuke: I was wondering, Lord van Zieks... If you'd like... ...I'd be happy to advocate for you. Van Zieks: ...! ...You trust me, do you? Ryunosuke: Yes. I've heard you speak many times in court. I've seen how you treat people. So I'm quite sure that you would never have taken another's life. ...It's just, my feelings can't be used as evidence in a court of law, sadly. Van Zieks: ......... It's a very gracious offer. However... ...I trust no one. Ryunosuke: What? Van Zieks: Not the police, not the judiciary...and not you Nipponese. Ryunosuke: But please... Van Zieks: I have no intention of engaging your services. Ryunosuke: ......... (The chasm between us is just too wide and too deep, it seems...) Van Zieks: ...I'd appreciate it if you don't visit again. Then neither of us will waste any more time. Ryunosuke: (Perhaps we need to dig a little deeper... ...and find out more about Lord van Zieks and what happened to Inspector Gregson.) After clearing all Converse options at Local Prison, Cell 1 and clearing all Converse options and examining portrait or desk, board, gun, red wig, chalk outline, candles, and figurine in Room on Fresno Street: 1st November, 10:24 a.m. British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Stronghart: ...You've made good time. ???: I took an express train back to London. Ryunosuke: I can hear Lord Stronghart. Can you? Susato: Yes, it sounds as though he's talking to someone. Stronghart: Is everything in place? ???: I had a private compartment on the train so I could check all the paperwork. Ryunosuke: I-It's... Susato: Kazuma-sama! Stronghart: Ah, your timing is impeccable! Ryunosuke: It, it is? Stronghart: No doubt you have heard the sickening news? About the Reaper's latest devilry. Ryunosuke: ...Yes. Susato: I'm sure you don't believe it of course, though, Lord Stronghart. That Lord van Zieks could have done such a thing to Inspector Gregson. Stronghart: ......... I believe only in the facts. And the facts in this case point to one thing: The unavoidable accusal of Lord van Zieks for this crime. We must bring charges against the Reaper for taking the life of our legendary detective. Susato: Oh no, surely not! Stronghart: It's a truly regrettable situation. Tomorrow the forensic science symposium finally begins. At the very least, though, we can show the world our justice system's swift and equitable processes. Ryunosuke: So does that mean...the trial is tomorrow? Stronghart: Precisely. In fact, this is a fine opportunity for introductions. Ryunosuke: Kazuma... Kazuma: ......... Stronghart: Ah, but of course! You're already acquainted, aren't you? Mr Asogi here will be present at tomorrow's proceedings... ...leading the prosecution. Ryunosuke: Wait... WHAAAAAAT?! (Kazuma...?) Stronghart: As I'm sure you're aware, he's a very capable practitioner of law. Susato: Kazuma-sama...a prosecutor...? After clearing all Converse options and examining Kazuma Asogi: Ryunosuke: (It doesn't look like we're going to glean much more here.) Well...thank you very much, Lord Stronghart. Stronghart: Remember, tomorrow's trial will go down in our empire's history. There's much you could learn...from the public gallery. Ryunosuke: ...Sorry to have taken up so much of your time. We'll see ourselves out. Kazuma: Kazuma: Before you go, Ryunosuke... Ryunosuke: Oh...what is it, Kazuma? Kazuma: I just wanted...to thank you. Susato: Kazuma-sama... What...? Kazuma: You took my determination to heart and brought it with you over the ocean in my stead. And you carried out my role to perfection. Susato: You always were intent on studying British law in order to change our own justice system. It was your dream, and Mr Naruhodo didn't want that to die with you! Kazuma: Yes. But I had another purpose for coming here. Susato: Oh! Kazuma: ......... I actually have a favour to ask. Ryunosuke: W-Which is...? Kazuma: This trial I'll be prosecuting tomorrow... I'd like you to be there to see how it ends. Right in front of me...as the defence counsel! Ryunosuke: ...! (Why? What's this all about?) Kazuma: I know you have what it takes. Ryunosuke: But...Lord van Zieks would never put his fate in my hands. Kazuma: On the contrary. He recognises your talent. Ryunosuke: He does? Kazuma: ...It's not easy to see behind the facade sometimes. Here, have a look at this... Ryunosuke: That's... Susato: That's Lord van Zieks and Inspector Gregson! Ryunosuke: (In a photograph that must have been taken some time ago by the look of it. And who's the third person?) Kazuma: It was displayed very prominently in the detective's office. Ryunosuke: In Gregson's office, you mean? Kazuma: Yes. What I'm trying to say is, if you really think you can trust the Reaper... ...you might find that some straight talking makes him take a different view. Take it. Gregson's photograph has been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: I don't understand. Why are you giving me this? Kazuma: Just hurry, Ryunosuke! Visiting hours at the prison are almost over. Ryunosuke: (What are you doing, Kazuma...?) 1st November Local Prison, Cell 1 Ryunosuke: Lord van Zieks is still reading that letter. Susato: We've been gone quite some time, though... Ryunosuke: Either he's an incredibly slow reader...or it's an incredibly long letter... I might even be able to read English faster than he can. Van Zieks: I was intending to ignore you entirely... ...but I can't turn a deaf ear to such an insulting Nipponese. Ryunosuke: Oh! Um...sorry. I didn't think you'd hear that. Van Zieks: I had the case notes brought to me in secret. I was reading them to pass the time. Susato: Yes, we heard that your trial is set for tomorrow. Van Zieks: Which is none of your business. Ryunosuke: So...have you found a lawyer? Van Zieks: How many times must I reiterate the same thing: this is nothing to do with you. Ryunosuke: (In other words, no.) Susato: We were just talking to Lord Stronghart and...the prosecutor for your trial has been decided. Van Zieks: I'd expect nothing less. Though I have no idea who it is. Ryunosuke: It's...going to be Kazuma Asogi. Van Zieks: ...! Asogi?! Ryunosuke: (That made the colour drain from his face...) Van Zieks: Haah, well then... ...it seems I'm going to have to engage in conversation with you again after all. After clearing all Converse options and presenting Gregson's Photograph: Van Zieks: ......... Mister...Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: Oh! (That's the first time he's ever used my actual name.) Van Zieks: I've lost all confidence in my country's justice system. I don't trust the police, the judiciary or lawyers. But there's still one thing I'm willing to believe in. Ryunosuke: What's that? Van Zieks: That which you see in the eyes of another across the courtroom: a simple determination to know the truth. Ryunosuke: L-Lord van Zieks... Van Zieks: From the very first time we clashed in the Bailey almost a year ago now... ...I couldn't deny it, even though I dearly wished I could. 'Here is a loathsome Nipponese...who has absolute integrity as a lawyer.' Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: There are only two other men I've known with that same look in their eyes: My brother, Klint. ...And Genshin Asogi. Ryunosuke: (The man he idolised and the man who betrayed his trust in the most hideous way...) Van Zieks: ......... When you showed me that photograph just now, it reminded me... Ryunosuke: You mean, this photograph? Van Zieks: Back then I was able to laugh. I was free of the shackles of mistrust that plague me now. I looked to the future with hope. Since then I've protected myself against betrayal by refusing to trust anyone. But at times the mire into which I've sunk makes it almost impossible to breathe. Ryunosuke: I'm...so sorry... Van Zieks: ......... So Mr Naruhodo... ...I want to believe in that look in your eyes. I need to believe in it. ...In tomorrow's trial...will you advocate for me? Ryunosuke: ......... Of course I will. It would be an honour. Susato: I'm so pleased, Mr Naruhodo. Van Zieks: Then my life is in your hands. Ryunosuke: (For Lord van Zieks... ...that must have been an incredibly hard thing to ask. Which is why I simply cannot let the man down. Tomorrow...in the Old Bailey...against my old friend, Kazuma!) To be continued...\nVan Zieks: I was investigating Gregson, and my inquiries had led me to that address.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You were investigating the inspector? What on earth for? Van Zieks: ......... I'm not at liberty to say. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Van Zieks: I'd identified a distinct possibility that Gregson was involved in a case I was investigating. Regrettably, though...he was killed before I could secure the proof I needed. Judge: Is the court to understand then, that on the day in question you followed the victim to the scene? Van Zieks: ...No. I was privy to his movements in advance. Ryunosuke: How? Van Zieks: I stole into his office in the Yard and consulted his diary. The address on Fresno Street was noted in the 5 p.m. entry. Kazuma: You illegally entered the man's office? In Japan that alone would constitute a very serious offence. Judge: As it does in Great Britain, I assure you. Is that not the case, Lord van Zieks? Van Zieks: ...I was aware of the possible consequences. Kazuma: So, in summary, you were investigating the victim... ...and yet you refuse to tell the court why. Van Zieks: ......... Kazuma: I didn't realise British prosecutors enjoyed such freedom to choose what to divulge under oath. Ryunosuke: Ugh... (Why did I ever think I could defend this man?)Van Zieks: When I first entered the room that day, it was dark inside and I saw no one.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Had you ever been to the address before? Van Zieks: No, never. I only learnt of the place as a result of my investigations into Gregson's activities. There was no light inside when I entered, so it was all but impossible to make out anything. Ryunosuke: But at 5 p.m. the sun would only just have gone down. It would still have been reasonably light outside. Van Zieks: The room has a window, but it was boarded shut. Very little light found its way into the room from outside, so it was extremely murky inside. I wouldn't have noticed if the victim was already lying on the floor. Kazuma: There was no artificial light in the room, you say? You're quite sure? Van Zieks: I'm quite sure that the part of the room where the body was found was very dark. I have a feeling there was a small oil lamp burning on the desk, though I couldn't say for certain. Susato: Look, Mr Naruhodo... There is a small desk in the room just here. Ryunosuke: Yes, I remember. And there was an oil lamp on it. As well as the framed photograph. Van Zieks: When I entered the room, I closed the door behind me and started towards the desk to investigate. Ryunosuke: And what did you find? Van Zieks: Nothing. I never actually reached the desk.Van Zieks: A moment later, I heard the gunshot. I spun around, and saw the revolver on the floor.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So...who fired the gun? Van Zieks: I have no idea. I didn't see anybody else in the room. Ryunosuke: But you say it was very dark in there? Van Zieks: Yes, that's right. All I can tell you is, I didn't sense another's presence. Ryunosuke: Aha! Then could it be... ...that the gunshot actually originated from somewhere outside the room?! Van Zieks: No, that's out of the question. Ryunosuke: Oh. Van Zieks: Without doubt, the sound emanated from inside the room. I could smell the gunpowder. Ryunosuke: (Ugh, this is going from bad to worse...) Kazuma: And you say that's the point at which you noticed the revolver on the floor? Van Zieks: Correct. And I foolishly picked it up. That was carelessness on my part. Judge: Presumably, then, the gunshot you heard came from the firearm that you somewhat hastily took in your hands. Van Zieks: In point of fact, My Lord...I believe it did not. Ryunosuke: What? Van Zieks: The barrel of the revolver I picked up was cold, and there was no smell of spent powder. Ryunosuke: But, but then...where on earth is the gun that WAS fired? Van Zieks: Whilst I would like to oblige you with an answer... ...I'm afraid I can't. I, too, would dearly like to know that. Ryunosuke: Uuuuuugh...Van Zieks: Just as I picked the firearm up to examine it, the door flew open and I heard a man scream.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: A man, you say? One of the witnesses, I presume? Kazuma: That's right. One of the street merchants working on Fresno Street. Judge: Who are these merchants? Kazuma: A number of them had set up their stalls directly beneath the boarded window of the crime scene. A match-seller, a newsmonger and a pedlar. They've all given statements saying they heard the gunshot. And without thought of danger, they ran inside to see what had happened. Susato: Yes...Gina told us about that yesterday, didn't she? Kazuma: They burst through the door with some force, it would seem. Van Zieks: They did. And almost gave me a heart attack in the process. Ryunosuke: (But you're supposed to be the Reaper...) Van Zieks: The first man to come in immediately noticed the revolver in my hand and fled. Kazuma: A policeman patrolling on Fresno Street heard the commotion... ...and was able to arrest the accused shortly after the incident occurred. Van Zieks: Anyway, the man's scream drew my attention in that direction.Van Zieks: It was only then that the body of Inspector Gregson appeared before me.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Um...what do you mean by that? In what way did the body 'appear'? Van Zieks: I honestly can't explain it. But it's the truth. As far as I was concerned, the body hadn't been there until that point, and then suddenly...there it was. Ryunosuke: Did you perhaps hear the sound of the victim falling to the ground just beforehand? Van Zieks: ......... At that moment, what I heard... ...was the sound of the door flying open and the scream of the man who came inside first. Nothing more. Ryunosuke: I see... Van Zieks: After the man fled, I examined the body. I was stunned to find that it was Gregson. Judge: Hmmm... Most curious circumstances indeed. Van Zieks: How the inspector was killed, or how his body seemed to appear out of nowhere... ...I have no idea.Ryunosuke: (So...that's Lord van Zieks's account.)Susato: Do you have any thoughts, Mr Naruhodo?Ryunosuke: Yes...mainly that it really doesn't ring true in all sorts of ways. Who fired the gun if there was nobody else there? And how did the corpse just appear in front of him?Susato: So...you think that Lord van Zieks is lying?Ryunosuke: No, I don't think that. I mean, if he was going to lie... ...I would expect him to have come up with a more credible story, wouldn't you?Susato: Yes, I completely agree. I think he genuinely doesn't know what really happened himself. So we must do what we can to fill in the gaps.Ryunosuke: Yes, first and foremost, we need more information!After pressing all statements:Kazuma:Kazuma: Surely the court has heard enough!Ryunosuke: ...!Kazuma: My Lord, the cross-examination has clearly revealed... ...that the accused, Barok van Zieks...is lying on multiple fronts!Ryunosuke: Wha... What is THAT supposed to mean?!Judge: ...Good gracious, Counsel!The defendant is lying, you say?Kazuma: In his testimony just now... ...he claims that he failed to notice the victim's body because the room was dark.Van Zieks: That's correct.Kazuma: No...that's impossible. As proven by this candelabrum.Ryunosuke: How does that prove anything?Kazuma: If you examine the tip of the long candle, you can see it has been blown off by a powerful impact.Judge: One would assume that the projectile from the firearm passed through the victim and struck the candle.Kazuma: The problem comes when you consider the other two candles, which are clearly of a different length.Judge: Yes, I can see that only the candle that appears to have been struck by the bullet is long.Kazuma: We could reasonably expect someone to have lit all three candles together. Which begs the question of why only one has ended up longer than the others.Ryunosuke: That...must be because that particular candle was extinguished when the others were still burning... ...Ah!Kazuma: That's right. When the candle was hit by the bullet, it obviously went out. But the other two candles would still have been burning. So the fact is... ...the victim's body would have been illuminated by the light still thrown by the candelabrum! And the accused's claim that he couldn't see the body... clearly contradicts those facts!Van Zieks: ...!Kazuma: And now to the next lie.Ryunosuke: There's more?!Kazuma: The accused also claims never to have visited the scene of the crime before.Van Zieks: That's the truth.Kazuma: In that almost empty room, the police discovered something very unusual. A board covered from top to bottom in police documents and newspaper cuttings.Susato: Yes, that's right. We saw it, too.Kazuma: It goes without saying that the contents of the police documents cannot be divulged. However... ...they included a number of reports from various historical cases. The oldest of which...was from ten years ago.Ryunosuke: (Ten years ago? This is starting to sound familiar...)Kazuma: And there is a common thread linking all of the documents on that board.Judge: Indeed? What is this common thread, Counsel?Kazuma: They all relate to cases prosecuted in court by Barok van Zieks.Ryunosuke: All of them?Kazuma: And furthermore...all those cases are ones in which the defendant was acquitted.Judge: Good Lord!Kazuma: Interestingly, none of those defendants are alive today. Because all of them have been sent to their graves...by the Reaper.Ryunosuke: Ah!Susato: Oh no...Kazuma: In short! That dingy little room... ...is the Reaper's secret hideout...and his base of operations!Ryunosuke: The, the Reaper's hideout?!Kazuma: And yet the Reaper would claim never to have been to his own secret hideout? No one would believe that. No, the truth is...we've been looking at this backwards.Judge: Backwards? Explain, Counsel!Kazuma: Inspector Gregson was investigating the identity of the Reaper. When he discovered the location of the man's secret hideout...he was killed. As I'm sure everyone can imagine...by the Reaper's hand!Ryunosuke: Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAT?!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! Very well. I hereby state the current opinion of the court. Barok van Zieks is an outstanding prosecutor who has rendered great service to his country. However, it is with deep regret that I must concur with Prosecutor Asogi's contention... ...that the defendant's testimony exhibits a number of stark inconsistencies with the known facts.Van Zieks: All I have done is state the truth as I know it.Ryunosuke: (Kazuma's done a brilliant job as ever. He's drawing on his experience as a defence attorney to build his prosecution case...and it's formidable.)Judge: Counsel... ...you will submit the board that you just showed the court as evidence. I believe it to be fundamental in establishing the facts surrounding the Reaper's existence.Kazuma: Thank you, My Lord.The noticeboard has been entered into the Court Record.Kazuma: And now, the prosecution would like to call new witnesses to the stand. Witnesses who saw events unfold on the day in question.Examine evidence Noticeboard Front of board Susato: There are details of a whole raft of cases dating back years on here, aren't there? Ryunosuke: This paper from ten years ago is browning with age, look. Susato: Out of interest, the most recent thing appears to be this newspaper cutting here. Ryunosuke: Oh. It's the same Red-Headed League advertisement that Mr Sholmes had picked out. Susato: And do you remember? There was a red hairpiece at the scene, too. Ryunosuke: (Was Inspector Gregson an exponent of the Red-Headed League, then?) Bloody handprint on back Susato: ......... Oh. What's this...? Mr Naruhodo! Look! Ryunosuke: Oh yes. It's a smudge of some kind. In fact... ...it looks just like a handprint. Susato: And the colour... That's blood, isn't it? Oh dear... How disturbing... The details of the noticeboard have been updated in the Court Record. Bloody handprint on back (subsequent times) Susato: ......... Oh. What's this...? Mr Naruhodo! Look! Ryunosuke: Oh yes. It's a smudge of some kind. In fact... ...it looks just like a handprint. Susato: And the colour... That's blood, isn't it? Oh dear... How disturbing...Susato: They were mentioned in the previous testimony too, if you remember.Ryunosuke: Yes. The street sellers who heard the gunshot and went running into the room.Judge: Very well, lead the witnesses in! The defendant may step down from the witness stand.Van Zieks: Certainly, My Lord.Kazuma: So...witnesses. State your names and occupations for the court.???: Names?! We don't use names. Far too fancy for the likes of uz.???: We're just free an' easy. Sell what we like, live where we wanna live...???: I g-give them all a vacant stare as they w-walk down Fresno, and spin a few w-words into a verse for them.Judge: Ah... Would I be right in assuming that all three of you make your living by selling wares on the street?Gossip: Hehe, everyone calls me Gossip. I sell jaunty little titbits to passers-by, you know.Ryunosuke: Jaunty little titbits?Gossip: Got an absolute smasher for you, sir. Right up your ginnel, it is! Sixpence is the price, and not a penny less!Ryunosuke: ......... Wait! You're, you're actually trying to sell it to me now?Gossip: Oh, c'mon sir! Don't tell me you're not interested!Kazuma: Try the man.Susato: Give him the money and see what it is!Judge: Pay the man, Counsel.Ryunosuke: Alright, alright, sixpence it is.Gossip: You won't regret it, sir! Now, got your listenin' ears on? Just between uz...a young couple on Sleight Street have just had twins!Ryunosuke: .........Gossip: .........Ryunosuke: .........  Um...is that it?Gossip: No, that's not it. It's gossip, in't it? It wants to spread. But that bit's up to you and your mouth, of course. I've got more, you know. Want another juicy one? Sixpence a piece, it is. If you're curious...Ryunosuke: (I am curious, yes. About what's going on just under that fat bottom lip of yours. Namely that unusual bruise or whatever it is that's poking out from under your collar...)Kazuma: What about the next witness, then? What name do you go by and what do you sell?Venus: Me? I'm Venus. That's what everyone calls me. Funny, innit? I sell these lovely little fireworks to all the local school kids. Sixpence a pop! What d'you say?Ryunosuke: You weren't exaggerating with 'little'. Do they actually sell?Venus: Oh yeah. The second years can't get enough of my Venus firecrackers. 'Specially when I tell 'em that if they get a hundred they could blow up the school!Judge: Not the most savoury of ideas, young lady.Venus: What d'you say then, eh? Wanna part with sixpence for a pop?Ryunosuke: Wait, what?! You, you want me to buy one?Venus: Tell you what, I'll let you in on a little secret: If you get a hundred of 'em, you could blow up the whole courtroom!Kazuma: Try the woman.Susato: Give her the money and see if she's right!Judge: Pay the woman, Counsel.Ryunosuke: Alright, alright, I'll buy one.Venus: Lovely stuff! Right then...this is something a bit extra, just for you: The Venus Special! Only six 'undred pence!Ryunosuke: S-Six hundred!Venus: It's a hundred of my regular fireworks. Nothing 'little' about that, is there?Ryunosuke: (And there'd be nothing little about the punishment if I blew up the Old Bailey, either.)The Venus firecracker has been entered into the Court Record.Kazuma: And the last witness... What name do you go by and what do you sell?Examine evidence Venus Firecracker Fuse Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: Have you had an idea, Mr Naruhodo? You're staring at the end of the string of fireworks. Ryunosuke: Sorry. It's just that it's the 'Venus Special'. I was wondering what six hundred pence worth of fireworks would sound like. Susato: ......... Shall we find out? Ryunosuke: What? B-But...she said it could blow up the courtroom! ...*BANG!* Ryunosuke: ......... A-Alright, that was a fairly sizeable bang. Susato: My ears are still ringing, Mr Naruhodo. It sounded almost exactly like... The details of the Venus firecracker have been updated in the Court Record. Fuse (subsequent times) Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: Have you had an idea, Mr Naruhodo? You're staring at the end of the string of fireworks. Ryunosuke: Sorry. It's just that it's the 'Venus Special'. I was wondering what six hundred pence worth of fireworks would sound like. Susato: ......... Shall we find out? Ryunosuke: What? B-But...she said it could blow up the courtroom! ...*BANG!* Ryunosuke: ......... A-Alright, that was a fairly sizeable bang. Susato: My ears are still ringing, Mr Naruhodo. It sounded almost exactly like...???: I'm a th-thinker me. Think all sorts of thoughts. I think, therefore I am. I am, therefore I think...I think. Because I stand there on the street, w-watchin' the w-world go on about me, they call me 'The Observator'.Gossip: Get out if it, old man! Everyone calls you Sandwich and you know it.Kazuma: So...you don't actually sell anything?Sandwich: A p-p-problem shared is a problem halved, as they say. I give advice, I do. And think w-what it means. I d-don't actually sell anything, no...come to think of it.Kazuma: Pity.Ryunosuke: (No more purchases today...please.)Judge: Well, we have quite a cast here, it seems.Kazuma: They conduct their business on Fresno Street from morning until night, My Lord. And always in the same place: directly adjacent to the crime scene.Judge: I see. And thus they heard the gunshot, I suppose.Kazuma: Not only that, but they very bravely ran inside to see what was going on and witnessed the crime.Gossip: Well I'll be beggared, I thought! ...Just between uz.Venus: Venus de Milo, what am I to do? What a terrible thing I saw!Sandwich: W-What I think is...if all w-what we see is light and shadow, p-playing with our eyes...is any of it real?Judge: Very well. The court will hear the formal testimony of these three witnesses now. You will describe in detail what you witnessed and heard at the time of the incident.Witness Testimony - The Witnesses' Account -Gossip: We saw the whole thing from start to finish, we did. Everything from the moment they went in the building.Venus: It was less than a minute after the Reaper had gone inside that we all 'eard a big bang.Sandwich: Seems to m-me that quick-to-talk is quick-to-walk. Gossip couldn't wait to go and see what had happened.Gossip: I ran into the room and there he woz. The Reaper, gun in hand, standin' over the dead body!Venus: I was scared 'alf to death, me. So I ran off to find a copper.Ryunosuke: If these witnesses were there the whole day and saw everything... ...who did they see going inside the building?Kazuma: Only the victim, Inspector Gregson, and the accused, Barok van Zieks.Gossip: I've seen pictures of that Reaper in the paper. I know what he looks like. And just between uz...folk love stories like this. I've made meself a tidy sum already.Ryunosuke: But wait! The room was just one of several flats in the building. Someone from another flat could have done it!Kazuma: All those flats on Fresno Street are unoccupied.Gossip: 'Course they are. They're small, damp, dirty and expensive to boot.Kazuma: The room in which the inspector was found is the only property in the building that's currently leased.Susato: And we know the leaseholder's name, don't we. It's...Hugh Boone.Judge: Hmmm... The testimony the court has just heard would appear to leave little room for doubt. It's becoming increasingly difficult to see how anyone other than the defendant could have committed the crime.Ryunosuke: No!Kazuma: Thank you for your candour, My Lord.Judge: Counsel for the Defence, you may proceed to cross-examine the witnesses.Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord! (In a closed court like this without a jury, the judge is the only person whose opinion matters. I have to break down this testimony. Somehow!)Cross-Examination - The Witnesses' Account -Gossip: We saw the whole thing from start to finish, we did. Everything from the moment they went in the building.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: When you say 'they', who do you mean exactly? Inspector Gregson and the defendant, Lord van Zieks? Gossip: I suppose so. The likes of uz don't know the names of the high and mighty. But I'll tell you one thing...it was the old Reaper that went in last, that's for sure and certain. Ryunosuke: Just behind Inspector Gregson? Did they arrive at the same time as each other? Gossip: No no, not at all! The first fella must have gone inside a good fifteen minutes before we heard that gunshot. Ryunosuke: The victim arrived fifteen minutes before?! Are you sure about that? Gossip: Am I sure? Am I sure?! Doz it seem likely that I'd have forgotten a fella with bright red hair like that, doz it? Venus: Yeah, 'is hair really were red, weren't it? Redder than my flamin' fireworks, even. Sandwich: That, that fiery red mop's still b-burnt on the inside of my eyelids, it is. Ryunosuke: Wait a minute! You're saying the man was a red-head? Gossip: Weren't you listenin', chum? Aye, he woz a red-head. And he had a big trunk with him, as well. Susato: But Inspector Gregson's hair isn't red. Not by any stretch of the imagination! Ryunosuke: It seems likely that the person you saw wasn't in fact Inspector Gregson at all, but some other third party. Kazuma: No. I hate to break it to you, but the witnesses are correct. Ryunosuke: What?! Kazuma: Just have a look at this photograph of the victim taken at the scene. Ryunosuke: Y-Yes, that's... (That's Inspector Gregson alright.) Susato: And...a red hairpiece. Ryunosuke: Ah! Susato: Of course! We saw one on the floor when we investigated the scene, didn't we? Ryunosuke: I still refuse to believe Inspector Gregson wore a hairpiece, though... (So then why on earth would he have been wearing something like that?) Judge: Hm...the colour does seem to suit the man, one might say... The photograph will be submitted as evidence, please, Counsel. The photograph of the victim has been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: And what became of the trunk that the red-headed victim was supposedly carrying? Kazuma: ...I was informed that no trunk was found at the scene. Ryunosuke: (So it just disappeared?) Gossip: What, do you expect uz to have been watchin' the buildin' every second, do you? Venus: We definitely saw 'im in the dock goin' in, though. No question about that!Press (subsequent times) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: When you say 'they', who do you mean exactly? Inspector Gregson and the defendant, Lord van Zieks? Gossip: I suppose so.

Venus: We definitely saw 'im in the dock goin' in, though. No question about that!Venus: It was less than a minute after the Reaper had gone inside that we all 'eard a big bang.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: By which presumably you mean the gunshot? Venus: I sell these little things, don't I? How would I know what a gunshot sounds like? But I've always thought it probably sounds a bit like this... doesn't it? Ryunosuke: And you say that you heard the noise almost as soon as you saw the defendant here enter the building? Venus: That's right. It was almost straight away. 'Bang!' it went. Just like that. Gossip: Well he's the Reaper, in't he? It's what the French call a fait accompli. When the Reaper's around, people are goin' in the ground! I mean, that's what he doz, in't it? Ryunosuke: I think we get the message. Kazuma: The Reaper couldn't allow the inspector to live after he'd discovered his secret hideout. There can be no clearer motive for the crime. Judge: Hmmm...yes... It's certainly an eminently credible motive. Ryunosuke: (Great.) Kazuma: And at that point, you ran inside. Is that correct?Sandwich: Seems to m-me that quick-to-talk is quick-to-walk. Gossip couldn't wait to go and see what had happened.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So, when Gossip ran to see what had happened, did you go, too? Sandwich: W-Well me... I'm a b-bit hampered, see. All the signs are that, that I c-can't move very well. Kazuma: You were a way behind, presumably. With that sandwich board around your neck and that big sign in your hand. Ryunosuke: ...What a great burden you bear. Pardon me for asking, Mr, erm...Sandwich, but... ...is it possible you and I have met before? Sandwich: ...! I-I'm not anybody, me. The signs are w-what make me who I am right now. I sign, therefore I am. Ryunosuke: So...you weren't employed as an omnibus driver just under a year ago then? Sandwich: ......... Susato: I might be mistaken, but I believe his trembling has intensified, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Yes, I agree. He's clearly been through a lot. Sandwich: 'Turn down King Henry Street and the Black Widowers Arms is just there.' Susato: Oh dear. You've made him hide behind his sign. Ryunosuke: (Life is full of surprises...)Gossip: I ran into the room and there he woz. The Reaper, gun in hand, standin' over the dead body!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So then you were the first person to arrive on the scene. Is that right? Gossip: That I woz! Kicked the door open like a professional, I did! And yelled out, 'What's goin' off 'ere?!' Susato: Lord van Zieks claims all he heard was a man's scream, though. Ryunosuke: And was it dark inside the room? Gossip: No, not dark at all! There were candles burnin' on the wall. Ryunosuke: Really?! Gossip: And there was a fella collapsed on the floor. Just between uz...it's the first thing I noticed when I got inside. Ryunosuke: Ah. I, I see... (Even though Lord van Zieks claims not to have seen any such lights on the wall...) Gossip: The next thing I noticed was someone standin' right beside the body. Kazuma: The accused, Barok van Zieks... Gossip: That's right! The pale-faced Reaper himself! I woz a little shocked, I won't deny it. But I'm no lily-livered coward. I stood my ground and gave that Reaper a cold, hard stare myself! Pursue \"Sandwich\" (after pressing first statement) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Do you have something to add, Mr Sandwich?! Sandwich: ......... There's, there's really n-n-nothing to me. Empty in the head, I am. Just two slices with no middle. S-So I don't know what you could w-w-want with me. Ryunosuke: I think that maybe you just remembered something? Having heard Mr Gossip's last statement, I mean. Sandwich: W-What I think is...we're all nothings really. We try to d-dress ourselves up as something else, but at the end of the day, w-we're all just street sellers. Gossip: That's enough out of you, Sandwich. Keep your trap shut now. Unless you want uz to make you into a real sandwich! Sandwich: W-When he saw the Reaper, he f-f-fell clean over on his backside! Ryunosuke: ...That's it? Gossip: Oh, you rotten beggar! I told you to keep that a secret! Sandwich: He screamed, he did. Screamed and s-scrambled off on all fours. ...That's all I w-w-wanted to say. Ryunosuke: Mr Gossip! Is this true? Gossip: The floor was dead slippery, that's why. Planted my hand in a filthy pool of blood, didn't I? Yuck! Ryunosuke: Wha...?! (A pool of blood?) Gossip: But listen here! Even when I woz sprawled on the floor... ...I still kept giving that Reaper a cold, hard stare! And don't you forget it! Ryunosuke: Let's just go back a little. Did you say you got blood on your hand? Gossip: I, I did, aye. Happens to the best of uz at times, dozn't it? So I was scared! So I slipped over! ...We can keep it just between uz, can't we? Ryunosuke: No, Mr Gossip! I'm going to have to ask you to add that information to your formal testimony. Gossip: Oh... If I must. Judge: The witness will amend his testimony to include the aforementioned details at once. Kazuma: ......... Changes statement from \"I ran into the room and there he woz. The Reaper, gun in hand, standin' over the dead body!\" to \"I slipped over and got blood on my hand, so I quickly wiped it off on the floor.\" Ryunosuke: And was there anyone else in the room at the time? Gossip: No, of course not. Not at first. But then this old stiff came waddlin' along behind me, of course. Only him, mind. Sandwich: I, I can't handle stairs so well, as you can imagine. Especially on the w-w-way up. Ryunosuke: And you couldn't have just failed to see someone? Gossip: It was a bit dingy in there, I grant you. But there were the candles on the wall. And the lamp on the table. Sandwich: There was n-nowhere anyone c-could have been hiding. You m-mark my eyes! Ryunosuke: (Ugh...)Gossip: I slipped over and got blood on my hand, so I quickly wiped it off on the floor.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You wiped your hand on the floor? Gossip: Well...who wants blood on his hand, eh? Horrible stuff. And they might have thought I'd done it. Hmph! No ta! Ryunosuke: And you didn't think that might be a problem? Gossip: Doz it really matter if I left a few grubby handprints on the floor? They'll get cleaned up in the end, won't they? Don't make such a fuss, that's the message from all of uz! Kazuma: ......... Judge: Is something wrong, Counsel? Kazuma: No, My Lord. I didn't remember anything in the report about a bloody handprint on the floor, that's all. Gossip: D-Don't come at me with all that! You can't intimidate me! I know what I did! I wiped it off! On the floor! The blood! Ryunosuke: ......... (I wonder... Could that be what happened...?) Susato: Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: I don't have all the answers yet... ...but I think we may have just uncovered a vital clue!Present Noticeboard (after examining bloody handprint on back) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"So you wiped off the blood from your hand on the floor of the room...\"Venus: I was scared 'alf to death, me. So I ran off to find a copper.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So you didn't run into the room with your friends? Venus: ......... I'm not that sort of girl. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Venus: I'm a timid little thing, me. I was too scared to go in there. Ryunosuke: Ah, right... I see. Venus: Old Lippy and the 'Wich ran in there, an' then I 'eard a sort of old lady scream. Gossip: Well that wozn't me, I swear. If I were a gentleman, I'd stake my honour on it. Venus: I wondered what on earth was goin' on. Ryunosuke: Which is when you went to find a policeman? Venus: And I ran into a copper as soon as I turned the corner. So I brought him straight back to the place. ...Didn't I do well, eh? Gossip: Just between uz...that copper's eyes nearly popped out of his head when he saw the Reaper. Sandwich: I've n-n-never felt more uncomfortable in, in all my life. Judge: And the defendant was arrested on the spot, I believe. Kazuma: Considering the catalogue of killings the Reaper had carried out... ...it was a particularly inauspicious end.Ryunosuke: (...If I can't find any holes in this testimony...)Susato: I'm afraid the judge will give a ruling of guilty, Mr Naruhodo.Ryunosuke: (The truth is, though, their combined testimony is fairly damning.)Susato: Unfortunately, there don't seem to be any obvious problems with their statements, do there?Ryunosuke: Still...if Lord van Zieks really is innocent, then I'm almost certain... ...that we'll find something in there that doesn't quite add up.Susato: You don't think... ...that one of these three could be the true culprit, do you?Ryunosuke: I don't know. But what I do know... ...is that there's more to this case that has yet to be brought to light!Ryunosuke: So you wiped off the blood from your hand on the floor of the room... Are you quite sure about that?Gossip: Well, well what else d'you expect me to have done, eh? Doz it really matter?Kazuma:Kazuma: The police found no such handprint on the floor during their investigations. What exactly is the defence asserting?!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: If you listen, you'll find out...Prosecutor Asogi.Kazuma: ...!Ryunosuke: Certainly, there was no bloody handprint found...on the floor.Kazuma: What are you trying to say?Ryunosuke: There was a handprint in blood left very clearly at the scene... ...on the back of this noticeboard.Gossip: Ah...ah...AAAAAAAAAAAAH!Judge: Ah yes, indeed. Indisputably a handprint in the distinctive colour of blood.Gossip: Aye, you're dead right! That's my right hand! I'd know it anywhere!Kazuma:Kazuma: The witness very definitely testified that he wiped his hand on the floor. Any handprints on the back of the board are irrelevant!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: Not if the board itself had fallen over onto the floor. In that case, it's quite possible for the witness's handprint to have ended up there.Kazuma: ...Just look at the floor plan of the room. The noticeboard was in the opposite corner of the room to the victim, and in an upright position. Even if it had somehow been toppled and was lying on the floor at the time... ...it would have been a considerable distance from the body.Gossip: I fell over when I came across the body. So I woz basically right next to the corpse. Not on the other side of the room!Kazuma: In other words, the defence's assertion is contradictory!Ryunosuke: Yes...it is.Kazuma: ...!Ryunosuke: There's a very definite contradiction here...for which there must be a reason.Judge: I take it that you've formulated a proper hypothesis, Counsel? Regarding this apparent discrepancy between the witness's account and the handprint found at the scene.Ryunosuke: I have, My Lord. This discrepancy between the witness's account and the location of the handprint is explained by...Another handprint Ryunosuke: If Mr Gossip ended up with blood on his hand and wiped it off on the floor as he says... ...it must have left behind a mark somewhere. Just as a mark has been left behind on the back of the noticeboard. Kazuma: Kazuma: The prosecution has already established that the handprint on the board is irrelevant. Ryunosuke: Exactly! Which means there must be another handprint somewhere! Kazuma: No! The police report made no mention of a handprint anywhere on the floor! And I understand that you've examined the scene in person, too. If you'd come across something the police had missed... how do you explain the cold sweat? Judge: Quite. The defence counsel's cold sweat is a sure indication that a penalty is due. Ryunosuke: That sweat was just from the warm-up. Kazuma: What? Ryunosuke: There should be a bloody handprint on the floor. So where did it go...? I'm ready to give the proper explanation to the court now, My Lord! Leads back to: \"I take it that you've formulated a proper hypothesis, Counsel?\"The board moving Leads to: \"The real contradiction here is the handprint itself, not where it was found.\"False testimony Ryunosuke: The witness claims to have wiped his bloody hand on the floor, yet no sign of that remains at the scene. The simplest explanation is that the witness is lying. Kazuma: Kazuma: Just because it's the simplest explanation doesn't make it the correct one...Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Ah. Kazuma: Positing perjury simply because it suits you... You bring shame on your Japanese heritage! Ryunosuke: AAAAAAAAARGH! Judge: I would ask you not to oversimplify matters again, Counsel. Kazuma: I don't remember fostering that kind of simplistic thinking in you. Ryunosuke: ...Since when were you my father? Anyway, I was always taught to consider all possibilities. Kazuma: Then show me. Ryunosuke: There should be a bloody handprint on the floor. So where did it go...? I'm ready to give the proper explanation to the court now, My Lord! Leads back to: \"I take it that you've formulated a proper hypothesis, Counsel?\"Ryunosuke: The real contradiction here is the handprint itself, not where it was found. As the court can see...it's upside down.Judge: Good gracious! So it is! If the witness had put his hand against the board, the fingers should be pointing upwards.Kazuma: What, what does that tell us?Ryunosuke: It tells one simple fact! When this handprint was made... ...the board must have been lying on the floor as I previously suggested. Which means that after the incident...it must have been moved!Kazuma: What?!Kazuma:Kazuma: You're claiming that somebody moved the noticeboard after the shooting? Then tell the court who!Ryunosuke: I, I don't know that yet! But the point is... ...when you consider all the testimony we've heard so far, we can now be very clear on one point!Judge: And that would be...?Ryunosuke: The position of the noticeboard at the time of the incident, My Lord.Judge: So, Counsel, I must ask you to clarify your assertion for the court. At the time of the incident, where do you maintain the noticeboard was situated?Present area between doorway and victim Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"This is the only possible location!\"Present anywhere else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: It was right here, My Lord! Judge: Goodness! Hm, no...I'm afraid I don't quite see your logic. Kazuma: I'm disappointed, Ryunosuke. In Japan, we're taught to have patience and respect for our elders. So until His Lordship sees your logic, you will know your place and not move from that spot! Ryunosuke: UAAAAAAGH! Susato: How brilliant of Kazuma-sama! That almost sounded unreasonable at first, but he was just thinking of you. Ryunosuke: Unreasonable? Try unfathomable. Anyway, I think I have the answer now. I know my place! ...Or rather, I know the board's place! Leads back to: \"So, Counsel, I must ask you to clarify your assertion for the court.\"Ryunosuke: This is the only possible location!Judge: Immediately adjacent to the doorway...?Ryunosuke: If the court would think back to the testimony given by the defendant earlier... ...he said that when he entered the room it was dark, and he couldn't see the body.Gossip: By 'eck!Ryunosuke: If the noticeboard had been here, the body would have been completely hidden from view. And the light from the candles would have been blocked, making the room appear darker.Kazuma:Kazuma: But the accused also claims that the victim's body simply 'appeared' before him.Susato: That's true. Or, in his precise words...Van Zieks: Just as I picked the firearm up to examine it, the door flew open and I heard a man scream. It was only then that the body of Inspector Gregson appeared before me.Gossip: I don't know about callin' it a 'scream', but he woz talkin' about me and no mistake. Cos it woz me that kicked the door open.Ryunosuke: If you look again at the floor plan... ...consider what would happen if the door to the room was thrown open with force.Kazuma: That, that can't...Ryunosuke: The door struck the noticeboard, knocking it over, and making the victim's body visible.Judge: Good gracious!Ryunosuke: My client has told nothing but the truth! He has simply described what he saw.Kazuma: Argh!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Counsel, how has this not come to light before now?Ryunosuke: After the incident, somebody must have righted the board and moved it... ...into the position where the police, myself and my colleague saw it when investigating the room.Judge: Witness! What have you to say for yourself?Gossip: Whaaaaaat? Me, My Lord?Ryunosuke: You and your fellows were there at the scene before anybody else. It goes without saying that you must know something about the position of the noticeboard!Judge: The witnesses in the stand will testify again. You will each explain exactly what you did upon arriving at the scene of the crime!Gossip: Eh, stop lookin' over your glasses at me! I get the message.Witness Testimony - The Mystery of the Moving Board -Gossip: I don't know anythin' about that there noticeboard! I just wiped my hand on it, that's all.Venus: Well don't look at me. I 'aven't got a clue about it. I was doin' business with some second years at the time.Sandwich: I, I don't know anything about anything. I'm j-just a bystander, me. J-Just a sign at the crossroads of life.Gossip: It woz that Reaper, I bet. He's got a face that screams 'board'.Sandwich: I c-can't see how this changes anything anyway. The detective still died w-when we heard the gunshot.Judge: Hmmm... So none of you can elaborate further...Kazuma: Shaken by the crime they witnessed, and with only the light of a few candles and an oil lamp by which to see... ...we can't expect these witnesses to be able to give a more precise account of what happened.Venus: That's right, yeah. It don't pay to expect too much.Sandwich: It's m-man's endless quest for knowledge that's d-d-destroying the world. That's w-what I think.Ryunosuke: ...Do you? Really.Kazuma: In any case, as the testimony shows... ...even if the noticeboard was moved by somebody following the incident, it makes no difference. When the gunshot rang out, the accused was the only person at the scene.Ryunosuke: ...!Kazuma: In short, the only person who could possibly have committed this crime...is Barok van Zieks! None of this wrangling over the board changes that simple fact.Judge: Quite so, quite so. Does the defence still wish to cross-examine the witnesses despite the circumstances?Ryunosuke: Most certainly, My Lord.Judge: Very well. Then you may proceed, Counsel.Cross-Examination - The Mystery of the Moving Board -Gossip: I don't know anythin' about that there noticeboard! I just wiped my hand on it, that's all.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So you admit that it was the board you wiped your bloody hand on? Gossip: Admit it? What's to admit? It's there plain as day for all to see: a smashing print of my right hand! Ryunosuke: Perhaps you wanted to hide that handprint... ...so you righted the noticeboard and pushed it into the corner, did you? Gossip: No no! Imagine the weight of that great lump! Do I look like a powerful and well-nurtured man? Ryunosuke: Well did you see anybody else moving the board? Gossip: I've got nerves of steel, I can tell you, but even I have my limits. There woz a body on the floor in front of me, and the grim Reaper himself standin' over it. And there woz precious little light inside, either. My bottom lip was all aquiver. Kazuma: In other words...this witness is unable to give definite testimony on that point. Judge: Hm, yes...so it would seem.Venus: Well don't look at me. I 'aven't got a clue about it. I was doin' business with some second years at the time.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: When you say you were doing business with them, you mean you were selling them fireworks? Venus: Yeah, what else? There's the Priory School just round the corner, see. Those cheeky little so-and-sos 'ave got a plan to blow their school to kingdom come. Ryunosuke: Haah... Venus: So I've been tellin' on them. Lettin' their teachers know what they're up to. Ryunosuke: Oh...you have? Venus: Yeah, wouldn't want anyone to get 'urt. So I let the school know the kids are playin' with dodgy toys. Then - praise the Lord - the teachers take all the fireworks off 'em. And then - praise the Lord again - the kids all come back to me to buy more. Everyone's 'appy, see? Ryunosuke: ...What a racket. Venus: 'Course. And sometimes the teachers give me a little bonus to thank me for lettin' 'em know. It's a busy old life, sellin' explosives. Judge: Venus is a guileful goddess indeed... Venus: Well, tellin' bare-faced lies is kind of my thing, really. I'm ever so good at it. Pursue \"Sandwich\" Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Something wrong, Mr Sandwich? Sandwich: If, if I said it was, could we just l-leave it at that? Would that be the end of it? Ryunosuke: Um...no. Did Miss Venus's statement just now bring something to mind, perhaps? Sandwich: ......... Philosophical thoughts. Deep, philosophical thoughts. Ryunosuke: Hm? Sandwich: L-Let's say there was a great liar. And that g-great liar said, without batting an eye... 'Tellin' bare-faced lies is kind of my thing. I'm ever so good at it.' W-Would those words of hers be a lie, too? Or the truth? In which case...she's n-not a liar. Ooh, it's a h-hellish paradox, that one. Don't you think? Ryunosuke: ......... I'm not entirely sure, to be honest. But...it seems to me you're suggesting Miss Venus has been lying...are you? Sandwich: .................. Venus: What are you on about, old man? Tryin' to cause trouble, are you? Keep on like that... ...and I'll wrap your whole body in firecrackers and set 'em off. That'll give you somethin' to tremble about! Judge: You have a startlingly disturbing mind behind that sweet and innocent face, young lady. Ryunosuke: So Miss Venus HAS lied in her testimony! Is that what you're saying, Mr Sandwich? Sandwich: ......... Well...if it m-means I'll be burnin' in hellfire for the r-rest of my days...so be it. Yes, that's what I'm saying. Kazuma: Can you elaborate, please, sir? Sandwich: ......... Old b-blabbermouth here headed for the r-room where the g-gunshot seemed to come from... ...but there w-w-was someone else who crept up the stairs b-behind him, too. That's right! That rotten liar over there! Venus: Heh heh... Ryunosuke: ......... Kazuma: ......... Judge: Do you mean to say... ...that you did in fact betake yourself to the scene of the crime after all? Venus: ......... What did I tell you, eh? I said I was good at tellin' bare-faced lies, didn't I? Ryunosuke: (Yes, you mentioned it...) Susato: Well... ...that revelation rocked the whole courtroom, didn't it? Ryunosuke: Who knew firecrackers packed such a punch? Judge: So you did indeed visit the scene of the crime, did you, young lady? Good grief! Venus: Well, now you come to mention it... ...I suppose perhaps I do clearly remember climbin' the stairs to the room, yeah. Ryunosuke: Either you clearly remember it or you don't. Judge: Well...I shall consider a fitting punishment for this perjurious act later. For the time being, you will immediately amend your testimony to reflect the truth! Venus: Oh yes, My Lord. Of course! Changes statement from \"Well don't look at me. I 'aven't got a clue about it. I was doin' business with some second years at the time.\" to \"Maybe I did sneak along behind Gossip and 'ave a little peek into the room where it all 'appened.\" Ryunosuke: (Ugh...scary.) Kazuma: ...The important point is, you didn't go inside the room where the inspector was killed, isn't that right? Venus: Definitely not. Wouldn't 'ave dreamed of it, would I?Venus: Maybe I did sneak along behind Gossip and 'ave a little peek into the room where it all 'appened.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You make a habit of lying, do you, Miss Venus? Venus: Well...I s'pose so. ...I don't really know, to be fair. If you want my advice, though, I'd take everythin' I say with a big pinch of salt. Ryunosuke: Alright, but you did in fact go to the room where the victim was killed on the day in question, didn't you? Venus: Oh, please! As if I would! I can't think of anythin' more terrifyin'! Kazuma: The truth, please. Venus: Well alright, just a bit then. I mean, a girl my age is curious about stuff, ya know! Ryunosuke: Did you touch anything at the scene? Venus: Oh, please! As if I would! I mean, there was a dead body on the floor! Kazuma: The truth, please. Venus: Well alright, just a bit then. I 'ad a look to see if there was anythin' I could sell. So I did give the place a once-over. But it was nothin' to write 'ome about. Ryunosuke: Right. Now, I hesitate to ask, but... ...you didn't move the noticeboard by any chance, did you? Venus: Oh, please! As if I would touch anythin' like that! Just a few bits of loose change is all I 'ad! Kazuma: The truth, please. Venus: Well alright then. I thought there might be somethin' worth 'avin' underneath it. So I blasted the flippin' thing- Sorry, flipped the blasted thing. Ryunosuke: ...! Kazuma: ...! Judge: ...! Kazuma: You're, you're telling us... ...that you DID move that board?! Venus: I think that did slip out, didn't it? Gossip: Wha...? You daft barmpot! Sandwich: I, I don't believe it... The girl doesn't think. Ryunosuke: So! Did you find anything then? Something that you might have taken, perhaps? To sell? Venus: Oh, please! I should be so lucky! In my imagination- Kazuma: The TRUTH now! Venus: ...I might 'ave found this old pocket watch under the noticeboard, I s'pose. But a bit o' junk like this can't be worth much, if you ask- ???: AAAAAAAAAH! Gina: So it was you, was it? You're the one wot took it! Ryunosuke: G-Gina?! Judge: Young lady! May I remind you where you are?! Gina: That watch... That watch there... That was a present to Inspector Gregson from the Yard for a big case 'e solved ten years ago! Susato: The Professor case, no doubt. Gina: The boss used to wind it up every evenin' wivout fail when 'e was waitin' for 'is grub to come at the pub. Ryunosuke: ...I see. Gina: I swiped it off 'im once an' blimey was 'e upset! 'E gave me a right earful. Said 'e 'adn't missed a day in the last ten years, polishin' it an' windin' it. It meant the world to 'im, that watch did. Ryunosuke: (Possibly not the best thing to go diving for, then...) Venus: It's not all that, though. I took it to Jabez's that night to ask 'ow much it was worth. But the old dealer wouldn't touch it. Wouldn't give me a penny for it. Said it wasn't workin'. Knocked about and worthless he called it. Gina: Agh! I knew I should've lifted it! Kazuma: That watch must be submitted as evidence at once! Venus: Oh, please! Just, just so long as you promise to give it back when we're done! Gina: Not a chance! I'll swipe it from ya if you try to get your grubby mitts on it again! Judge: That's enough. Hand the watch to the bailiff forthwith! Ryunosuke: (Now now, children, watch your manners...) Judge: ......... Good Lord! The glass appears to be broken. Kazuma: More than likely, it shattered when the inspector was shot. Venus: It doesn't tick any more, either. Which is why Jabez didn't want it. What a waste, eh? Judge: Yes, indeed. It appears to have stopped at the hour of five. Ryunosuke: (Exactly when the gunshot was heard, then...) Susato: Which supports the prosecution's claim, of course... Gregson's pocket watch has been entered into the Court Record. Judge: Well, it would appear that the mystery of the moving noticeboard has been solved at least. Kazuma: And as predicted, it had very little bearing on the case. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Judge: Now then, continue with your cross-examination, please, Counsel.Press (subsequent times) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You...certainly know how to lie... Venus: Oh, it was nothin' really. Just a little porky. Ryunosuke: With not-so-little implications... Venus: Did you know? Everythin' in the world apart from the truth is a big fat lie! ...If you believe that, of course. Ryunosuke: ...I'm lost. Judge: As am I. This desecration of the truth is really rather disturbing. I think perhaps we should move on to the next witness, hm?Examine evidence Gregson's Pocket Watch Cracked glass Ryunosuke: The glass over the face really is badly cracked, look. Susato: What a shame when the inspector clearly looked after it so carefully. Ryunosuke: I imagine Mr Sholmes could repair it, don't you? Susato: Yes, I should think so. Ryunosuke: (He's very adept at things like this. A useful man to have around, in fact.) Susato: But kindly remember that he's a great detective, Mr Naruhodo! Not an odd-job man. Stub on top Ryunosuke: There's a tiny little stub sticking out from this small hole here, look. Susato: I suppose there must have been a little knob or something on that for setting the time. Ryunosuke: In that case, seeing as we know the inspector took such good care of this watch... ...it probably broke when the incident occurred, didn't it? Susato: Yes! Of course! Ryunosuke: Which could mean that there's a small part of the watch still at the scene, maybe... Keyhole at bottom Ryunosuke: Ah... There's a tiny little keyhole here. Can you see? Susato: Oh yes. That's probably for the winder used to wind up the mechanism. Ryunosuke: It looks a little unusual, don't you think? Susato: Yes, you'd need just the right key to wind it, I imagine. Ryunosuke: ......... (Why do I feel as though I've seen something...? Something a bit like a key that's about the right size to fit in this hole...) Susato: It would be wonderful if we had the key... Let's check carefully over what we've already found. Keyhole at bottom (after examining key on Policeman Figurine) Ryunosuke: So this is where the little policeman figurine's key goes in to wind the watch. Winding it up every single day for ten years without fail... Susato: Yes, it was obviously a thing of great importance to the inspector. Ryunosuke: (Or a reminder of the past, lest he forget...) Policeman Figurine Head of figurine, then key (after examining keyhole on Gregson's Pocket Watch) Ryunosuke: Miss Susato! Do you think perhaps this key... ...could be the key for Inspector Gregson's watch? Susato: Oh! Yes, it could be! Let's try it at once! There's not a moment to lose! Ryunosuke: (I knew it! A perfect fit!) Susato: And look! The inspector's watch has started going again! Ryunosuke: Ah, so it has obviously just not been wound up, that's all. Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: What is it, Miss Susato? Susato: Well...if the watch isn't actually broken after all... ...I have a feeling it could have profound implications! ......... Ryunosuke: (She's deep in thought now. Perhaps I'd better start thinking deeply, too...) The details of Gregson's pocket watch have been updated in the Court Record. Key (subsequent times) Ryunosuke: So this is the little key used to wind the inspector's pocket watch. Susato: It was a mystery at first. Why it should be a policeman, I mean. But it's because it was a gift from Scotland Yard, in recognition of Inspector Gregson's hard work. Ryunosuke: ...If its head did fall off from overuse, it might seem a little inappropriate, don't you think? Susato: That's...the British sense of humour for you, I think. Head of figurine (after examining key) Susato: The helmet of this charming policeman appears to be a little worse for wear. Ryunosuke: I'm not convinced about the 'charming' part, but yes, you're right... ...the head part looks like it's been fairly heavily manhandled. Which stands to reason, really, doesn't it? I mean, it gets turned around and around every day. Susato: ...I hope it doesn't fall off in the end.Sandwich: I, I don't know anything about anything. I'm j-just a bystander, me. J-Just a sign at the crossroads of life.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But...you did go to see what had happened in the room, didn't you? Sandwich: Fresno Street is my whole w-w-world. It's all I know. And I know all of it. I have to make it my b-business to know, if I want to h-hold my sign up high. Kazuma: So you did go to see what had happened. Sandwich: It's not the d-destination that's important...it's h-how you get there, isn't it? Ryunosuke: Did you notice the noticeboard in the room? Sandwich: ...If you think about it, we're b-both the same species, aren't we? Both different members of the sign family. So if I'd spotted it, I m-might have tried to t-trip it up out of a sense of rivalry, I admit. Ryunosuke: (Someone really needs to tell you that you're Homo sapiens not Homo signiens...) Kazuma: Does that mean that you didn't notice the board? Sandwich: I, I can only r-r-repeat what I said before: I, I don't know anything about anything. I'm j-just a bystander, me. J-Just a sign at the crossroads of life. Judge: ...In which case, just who was responsible for moving the noticeboard?Gossip: It woz that Reaper, I bet. He's got a face that screams 'board'.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What exactly do you mean by that? Gossip: Oh, come on now, don't tell uz you've not noticed. He looks like he hates everythin' in the world, that fella. But not noticeboards. They're the one thing he likes. You can see it in his eyes. Ryunosuke: ...I can't say I'd ever noticed. Gossip: I'll tell you one thing for free, though: I never took my eyes off that man on the floor. Or off the Reaper. Not for a second. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Gossip: Well, I was that scared, I couldn't. You never know what a fiend like that might do if you look away, do you? Ryunosuke: ......... If you didn't take your eyes off the defendant... ...you should be able to confirm categorically whether or not he was the one who moved the noticeboard. Gossip: ......... Aye, that I can. The Reaper did nothin' of the sort. I can swear to that! I couldn't have missed it if he'd heaved the thing upright again and dragged it into the corner! Ryunosuke: Right...glad we've cleared that up. Kazuma: What happened to the face that screams 'board'? Ryunosuke: (I feel your pain, Kazuma.)Sandwich: I c-can't see how this changes anything anyway. The detective still died w-when we heard the gunshot.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: ...It was five o'clock in the afternoon that you all heard the loud bang, wasn't it? Sandwich: Maybe the n-noticeboard fell over, or maybe it d-didn't. Maybe I fell over, or m-m-maybe I didn't... But the Reaper's f-fate is sealed either way, because of that gunshot w-we all heard. So your fate's sealed, too. Ryunosuke: My fate?! Kazuma: That's right. The defence is fated to lose. And the prosecution to win. Ryunosuke: (In other words, it all hinges on that single gunshot. So if I could just find some problem with that part of their story...) Susato: It may be possible to change all our fates! Sandwich: Of course...n-none of that changes the fact that I heard what I heard...does it?Present Gregson's Pocket Watch (after examining keyhole on Gregson's Pocket Watch, then examining key on Policeman Figurine) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"I'm afraid that's not necessarily the case.\"Ryunosuke: (Not much to go on...)Susato: As you've pointed out, Mr Naruhodo... ...there's no question that the noticeboard was moved. So somebody must have done it.Ryunosuke: But it did happen after the event, so... ...maybe Kazuma is right and it's not relevant to the case.Susato: But it seems to have been deliberately positioned so as to hide the body from view. So I feel sure that there's some deeper significance to all of this.Ryunosuke: Yes, I know what you mean.Susato: I've no doubt there are more clues to be uncovered. You're on the right track, I can feel it. So follow your instincts!Ryunosuke: ...Alright, then.Ryunosuke: I'm afraid that's not necessarily the case.Sandwich: Oh...Ryunosuke: At the scene, we found this key to the winder of the inspector's pocket watch.Kazuma: A key...?Ryunosuke: And having wound the pocket watch, we discovered that it in fact still works. You see, the watch didn't stop because it was broken at all. And that fact... ...completely undermines one of the most fundamental premises on which this entire case has been built!Kazuma: What?!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! B-But Counsel... ...the watch was stopped at almost exactly five o'clock.Venus: Yeah, which is just when we 'eard that gunshot.Gossip: It is. Exactly the hour.Ryunosuke: The time that was showing on the watch tells us nothing other than when it wound down. It's merely a coincidence that it happened to be at five o'clock.Kazuma:Kazuma: Even if that's true... ...the three witnesses here all heard the gunshot at five o'clock. So that's obviously when this crime was committed!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: No, that doesn't hold!Kazuma: Why not?Ryunosuke: Recall what Inspector Lestrade said only moments ago:Gina: The boss used to wind it up every evenin' wivout fail when 'e was waitin' for 'is grub to come at the pub. Said 'e 'adn't missed a day in the last ten years, polishin' it an' windin' it. It meant the world to 'im, that watch did.Ryunosuke: The victim was in the habit of winding his watch once a day...in the evening. We can reasonably assume, therefore, that he wound the timepiece on the evening before he died as well.Judge: Yes, that would be entirely reasonable.Ryunosuke: But if that's the case... ...you wouldn't expect the watch to have completely wound down by five o'clock the following day.Gossip: Oh! Aye...Venus: Well 'ow do you explain it then?!Ryunosuke: In summary, the evening before the day of the incident, when the gunshot rang out in that room... ...the inspector was already unable to wind his watch.Kazuma: You, you can't mean...Ryunosuke: What would stop a man winding his watch if he's been in the habit of winding it every single evening for ten years? The obvious answer...is that he was already dead!Judge: Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! Counsel, that is a most extraordinary claim!Kazuma:Kazuma: Extraordinary isn't the word! It's absurd! You claim he was already dead the night before? Do you really think that Scotland Yard's coroner would have overlooked something like that?!Ryunosuke: Ah! W-Well, um...Susato: On that subject, there is something rather surprising... There's actually an omission in the coroner's report. The time of death is not noted.Ryunosuke: Ah! That's, that's right!Gossip: Wait a minute! You're forgetting that my legs went from under me when I kicked the door in.Ryunosuke: What do you mean?Gossip: Like I said, I planted my hand in a dirty great puddle of blood.Kazuma: Yes. So the victim's blood hadn't dried. It was fresh.Gossip: He catches on fast, dozn't he?Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: But that blood could be explained in any number of ways! It could have been put there afterwards. Some fresh blood could have been poured over the victim's body after he-Kazuma:Kazuma: Does my learned friend think that fresh blood is available on every street corner?Ryunosuke: Ah!Susato: Well, it needn't necessarily have been human blood, of course.Kazuma: ...!Susato: We've been told previously that Scotland Yard has no way to identify blood as human.Judge: The problem is currently being researched. At present, you are correct. It is beyond our abilities.Ryunosuke: So then...a chicken's blood could have been used, for example.Susato: It's certainly a possibility that it wasn't the inspector's blood at all.Kazuma:Kazuma: But the gunshot was heard at five o'clock that afternoon. That's beyond question!Ryunosuke: Is it, though?Kazuma: What?!Ryunosuke: Given that the time of death of the victim has already been called into question... ...it isn't beyond the realms of possibility that what these witnesses heard wasn't a gunshot at all.Venus: Oh, please! What are you tryin' to say?Gossip: Uz lot know what we heard! And it woz a loud bang that came from that there room!Sandwich: Now y-you listen to me! A street seller's ears are his l-l-livelihood.Ryunosuke: I don't doubt your ears, sir. But all you can state with certainty is that you heard a noise.Gossip: Eh?Judge: Explain yourself then, Counsel.Ryunosuke: A noise that sounds like a gunshot could have been made with...Present Venus Firecracker (after examining fuse) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Something like this. The culprit could have set off one of these to fake a gunshot.\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Well, the culprit could have used something like this, for example. Judge: Oh really? A demonstration is in order then, I feel. Ryunosuke: Wha...? Kazuma: Yes, please, show the court how you could use that to create a noise like a gunshot. Judge: ...We're waiting, Counsel. Ryunosuke: ......... I may have been mistaken. Kazuma: It looks like you've been making a lot of noise yourself... Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Ah! (Ugh...Kazuma's got a devastating way with words in English, too.) Susato: I realise it may be difficult to retract what you said and present some different evidence, but perhaps... Ryunosuke: (Yes, I was thinking the same thing myself.) That's because I'm convinced there is some evidence that could produce a similar noise! Leads back to: \"Explain yourself then, Counsel.\"Ryunosuke: Something like this. The culprit could have set off one of these to fake a gunshot.Judge: Good gracious! The very fireworks that are sold by the witness?Venus: ...Now 'old on a minute! Are you sayin' I did it?! My pretty little firecrackers only make a little pop anyway. See?Ryunosuke: Not a hundred of them together. The Venus Special that you sell for six hundred pennies sounds like this:...*BANG!*Ryunosuke: As the court can now attest...it sounds very much like a gunshot in fact.Venus: Agh agh agh agh agh!Kazuma: You're trying to suggest that somebody set one of those fireworks off at the scene?Ryunosuke: I'm suggesting that somebody knew the defendant was in the room at five that day... ...and sought to implicate him by creating a sound like a gunshot for these pedlars on Fresno Street to hear!Kazuma:Kazuma: But even the accused himself has testified that he saw no one else in the room at the time. Whether it was a gun or a firecracker, the only person present to cause that bang was Barok van Zieks!Venus: One whiff of a match and my firecrackers go pop. See? It's why people like 'em.Judge: I fear for your fingers, young lady.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: Recently during my time here in Britain, I've learnt of a very useful invention indeed. Something called a, um...a time bomb.Judge: Good heavens! A bomb?!Ryunosuke: Yes, a device that allows you to blow up whatever you like, whenever you like.Susato: Mr Naruhodo. I worry that your unfortunate phrasing there...may lead to yet another international incident.Ryunosuke: Ah! No no no! Wait! ...It's, it's the 'whenever you like' part that's important.Kazuma: A timed device?Ryunosuke: Yes! Exactly! A timed device! Something of that nature could have been planted at the scene. A device that was able to produce the sound of a gunshot long after the culprit had left.Judge: Your extravagant claim will have to be substantiated with evidence, Counsel. What proof do you have to suggest in any way that a timed device was employed to create the gunshot sound?Present Candelabrum Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"As the court has already discussed, the tip of one of the candles in this candelabrum has been blown off.\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Judge: You're suggesting this could have been used as some sort of 'time delay' device? Ryunosuke: I...did think so, My Lord. But it's becoming increasingly clear... ...that we've all been very misguided here. Kazuma: Kazuma: Yes, by you. Ryunosuke: Wha...? Judge: No, Counsel, the time has come for a penalty. Without delay. Ryunosuke: (Ugh...no time to clear the area before the blast...) Leads back to: \"Your extravagant claim will have to be substantiated with evidence, Counsel.\"Ryunosuke: As the court has already discussed, the tip of one of the candles in this candelabrum has been blown off.Judge: Indeed. Because it was struck by the bullet, which presumably passed through the victim.Ryunosuke: I don't think that's possible, My Lord.Kazuma: Not possible? Why?Ryunosuke: Because of the scorching. There are gunpowder scorch marks clearly visible on the broken candle.Judge: There are? ...Goodness, yes! But is it not the case... ...that there was also scorching on the victim around the bullet entry wound?Ryunosuke: That's right, there was. But as we heard earlier... ...scorching like that only occurs when the target is at very close range - a matter of centimetres from the gun.Judge: Ah!Ryunosuke: Which means that the scorching on the candle can't possibly be the result of a gunshot.Kazuma: You're suggesting it came from the fireworks?Gossip: How can that be, eh?Ryunosuke: The fact that there's such visible scorching on the candle... ...suggests that the fireworks must have been right next to it when they exploded. Or to put it another way...the candle and firecrackers were joined together.The culprit somehow attached the firecrackers at a point partway down the candle. After the killer had left the scene... ...the candle slowly burnt down along with the other two... ...until eventually it ignited the fuse of the firecrackers generating a loud......*BANG!*.........Ryunosuke: And that is how these three witnesses came to believe they'd heard a gunshot at five o'clock.Judge: ......... Well...what a plot... And this implies that the victim could have died earlier than we've been led to believe. The previous day, even.Gossip: Now...now...now just hold your horses! All uz lot here saw the victim goin' into the building, remember?Sandwich: I, I couldn't forget that flame-coloured hair even if I w-wanted to.Ryunosuke: The person you saw entering the building wasn't the victim at all. ...Consider this.Gossip: Ah!Ryunosuke: Obviously anybody can wear a wig. So the person that these witnesses saw entering the building fifteen minutes before the incident occurred... ...could easily have been someone else entirely wearing the red hairpiece.Judge: Someone else?! Do, do you mean to say...?Ryunosuke: It was the same person who contrived the firecracker trick. In other words...Inspector Gregson's killer!???:Pfft...Examine evidence Candelabrum Scorch marks Ryunosuke: So the candle was used as a sort of timer device to set off the firecrackers... That's a really ingenious idea...though obviously it's a shame it was used for such a wicked purpose. Susato: I wonder if there aren't some more positive uses for a timer device such as that... Ah, I have the perfect application! It would be a wonderful way of waking you in the mornings, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: ...I think I'd prefer that you continue to wake me in person, if it's all the same to you.Kazuma: Ha ha ha ha ha ha hah! Oh, very impressive, Ryunosuke Naruhodo.Ryunosuke: K-Kazuma?!Kazuma: I'm really quite amazed you've come this far. But after all, wasn't I the one who told you... ...that you had all the makings of a great defence lawyer?Ryunosuke: ...!Kazuma: I also noted the lack of a time of death in this report. A stark omission. But as far as I'm concerned...this whole country's justice system leaves a lot to be desired!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! Prosecutor Asogi! What do you mean by that statement?Kazuma: I hear that many of the leading members of Britain's judiciary are present to observe this trial today. So we cannot allow even the slightest doubt to be overlooked.Judge: ...!Kazuma: The defence's assertion about the time of death based on the victim's stopped watch is just conjecture. But...while the possibility exists that my learned friend may be correct...we have a duty to explore it.Judge: Hmmm... Well, certainly...I would agree with you.Kazuma: And what immediately comes to mind is of course... ...what was Inspector Gregson doing and where did he go on the day before the incident?Ryunosuke: Do you know?Kazuma: The inspector always carried out his investigative work alone. His movements were treated as confidential within Scotland Yard.Judge: Even within the Yard?Kazuma: However, considering the evidence we've been presented with so far... ...I'd say it's fairly apparent what case the man was pursuing. Wouldn't you, my learned friend?Susato: I do have a feeling about what case he might have been investigating.Ryunosuke: Yes, I agree. Surely... My Lord! The defence believes it can explain to the court... ...the case that was being investigated by Inspector Gregson at the time of his death!Judge: Very well, Counsel. Present your argument to the court. What evidence is suggestive of the case being investigated by the inspector on the day prior to the incident?Present Red-Headed League Article or Red Hairpiece Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"I believe this red hairpiece points to the answer.\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Judge: Hm... I can't say that I find your answer suggestive of anything in particular. Other than perhaps that it is utterly wrong. That much you have clarified most expertly. Ryunosuke: Wha...? Kazuma: Congratulations, Ryunosuke Naruhodo. You deserve a reward for that expert display! Ryunosuke: AAAAAARGH! (Did, did you just draw Karuma on me, my friend?) Susato: I think, Mr Naruhodo, that there's one particular piece of evidence... ...that really does stand out in showing what case Inspector Gregson was investigating. Ryunosuke: My Lord! I have the answer now! Leads back to: \"Very well, Counsel.\"Ryunosuke: I believe this red hairpiece points to the answer.Kazuma: ...!Ryunosuke: We might assume it was part of a disguise used to carry out an undercover investigation.Judge: Surely not! Such a brightly coloured hairpiece would only serve to make the inspector more noticeable.Ryunosuke: Yes, that's quite true. It would definitely have made him stand out in a crowd. Except, that is...in a crowd of gentlemen from the Red-Headed League.Judge: The, the Red-Headed League?Kazuma: So...you'd already worked it out.Judge: What on earth is this all about? Is there such an extraordinary league of gentlemen?Kazuma: The Red-Headed League is currently under investigation for a grand deception.Judge: A deception of what nature, Counsel?Kazuma: They've been targeting red-headed men across all of London and tricking them out of small sums of money. Two men were arrested for the misdemeanour only yesterday, in fact.Ryunosuke: My Lord! The defence calls for those two men to be summoned at once!Judge: T-Two red-heads?!Ryunosuke: Inspector Gregson clearly infiltrated the Red-Headed League using this hairpiece. So it's very likely that he had direct contact with these criminals. And it's quite possible that such contact led to...more serious events.Kazuma: .........Judge: I concur that we cannot in good conscience leave this new avenue unexplored.Susato: Well done, Mr Naruhodo!Ryunosuke: Well...it's another possible line of enquiry for us at least.Judge: The prosecution will make immediate arrangements for the charged men to appear. Bring these two Red-Headed League conspirators before me, Prosecutor Asogi!Kazuma: At once, My Lord.Judge: Very good. We will have a thirty-minute recess. Court is adjourned!To be continued...2nd November, 12:33 p.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' AntechamberGina: Oh, there you are, 'Oddo!Sholmes: What kept you, my dear fellow?Ryunosuke: Hello, Mr Sholmes. Gina.Gina: You sure about wot you said in there? That the boss...you know...actually died the day before? It's pretty 'ard to swallow.Susato: Yes, I was shocked by the revelation too, Gina.Sholmes: As was I! Possibly more shocked than both of you!Ryunosuke: ...It's not a competition, Mr Sholmes. (But I was more shocked than all of you put together.)Sholmes: This is the autopsy report in question, is it?Ryunosuke: Yes. It's strange that there's no time of death noted. I suppose there's a simple explanation. Or perhaps...it was a deliberate omission.Susato: Oh dear... If it was deliberate... ...it puts me in mind of the last case we worked on...and Dr Sithe.Ryunosuke: I know. Anyway, it seems that on the day before Lord van Zieks discovered his body... ...Inspector Gregson was investigating the Red-Headed League. So perhaps something happened with them. Come to think of it... ...you had trouble with those league men too, didn't you, Mr Sholmes? You were taken in by their trick.Sholmes: No no no! Naturally, I wasn't 'taken in' as you put it. My sleuth-hound interest was merely piqued slightly by the rare scent of a weekly four-pound income.Ryunosuke: ...And that scent masked the underlying scent of deception, I suppose.Susato: The two criminals in question are the pair we saw being arrested yesterday, aren't they? In Mr Sholmes's suite, I mean.Gina: That's right, Sooze! An' it was me wot took 'em in! Thanks to a tip-off by a good, law-abidin' citizen.Sholmes: Indeed. Yours truly.Ryunosuke: (So it's going to be that pair in the witness stand next, is it?) Something doesn't quite make sense to me, though. The day before Inspector Gregson was found, you hadn't had trouble with the Red-Headed League yet, had you? Why would the inspector have been investigating them?Sholmes: Well, the likely explanation would be... ...that Gregson's own sleuth-hound interest was piqued by the rare scent of a weekly four-pound income.Gina: Don't tar 'im wiv the same brush as you, Sholmes!Ryunosuke: Yes, well... Then there's the whole issue of Inspector Gregson being investigated by Lord van Zieks for some reason.Susato: The Reaper...the Red-Headed League... Inspector Gregson...Lord van Zieks...Ryunosuke: ...And Kazuma.Susato: ...!Ryunosuke: I feel as though he knew we'd arrive at this point somehow.Susato: Gosh! I, I think you're right...Ryunosuke: (What's he really trying to achieve here today?)Sholmes: All the answers will soon be revealed. ...Observe the time, my dear fellow. This recess will be over very shortly.Ryunosuke: Yes, you're right. (Kazuma was determined that he should be the one to prosecute this trial. And he was determined that I should take the defence. Just what is it that he's hoping to make me see, I wonder? I get the feeling we're a long way from the end of this trial yet...) Are you ready then, Miss Susato?Susato: Yes!2nd November, 1:00 p.m. The Old Bailey CourtroomJudge: In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session again. We resume the closed court hearing of Barok van Zieks, here present, who stands accused of murder. Now then, Prosecutor Asogi...Kazuma: My Lord?Judge: Have you summoned the witnesses as requested?Kazuma: Yes. The two members of the Red-Headed League who planned and carried out the deception. They arrived not long ago from the local prison by police carriage.Judge: Very good. Bailiff, usher the two men into the courtroom!Kazuma: These two men are currently being held by the police on suspicion of attempted extortion. You may omit your occupations. But please state your names now for the court.De Rousseau: I am Fabien de Rousseau. A descendant of ze great de Rousseau family from Nice, en France.De Rossi: And my-a name is Peppino de Rossi! I am the third son of the great familia de Rossi - the landowners from Napoli!Kazuma: The two men first became acquainted at a boarding school for European nobility.De Rousseau: Zose who graduate from Temsik are ze future leaders of Europe. ...But! Do you 'ave any idea 'ow boring it is to be born wiz noble blood? ...Alors! I make it my mission to get ze better of ze world by employing ze little grey cells of my brain. Zat is all I am trying to do, uh.Ryunosuke: So...that's the only reason for this whole grand deception you've been carrying out?De Rousseau: ...Oui. You could say zat.De Rossi: Not bad, ay? He has the grand ideals, but the petty plans! This strange combination is-a the charm of the Hairlarious Brothers! Si, capo?De Rousseau: ......... Listen to me, Peppino. I 'ave two sings to say to you:De Rossi: Eh? Che? Are you about to tell me one of your grandi anecdotes? Evviva!De Rousseau: Firstly, I want you to stop calling me zis 'capo'. And secondly... ..we are not ze 'Airlarious Brothers. Zis is serious business.De Rossi: Che bello! There it is! The capo's trump-a card: the furrowed brow! It is deep, uh, capo? The furrow, and the meaning of your words!Judge: The court has been led to believe that under the banner of the 'Red-Headed League'... ...you have conspired to swindle money from unsuspecting members of the public. Is this true?De Rousseau: Oui. C'est ça.Judge: And what exactly was the nature of this deception by which you planned to defraud?De Rousseau: ...Alors, I will explain it.De Rossi: No, capo! Leave it to-a me! As you see, we both have the vivid red hair, no? At school, we were teased for this without pity. The capo here, he was many times behind the schoolhouse, crying like the Trevi Fountain. 'Uèèè! Zose dogs! One day ze world will respect us red-'eads!' Every night, he would bury his-a head in his-a pillow and weep for the injustice.De Rousseau: C'est bien, Peppino! Enough! I will explain ze rest. Ze first step was ze newspaper advertisement. About one week before ze plan was put into operation, we listed ze same notice in every paper in London.Ryunosuke: Yes, we saw that notice. It was this one, I believe. Entitled 'To the Red-Headed League'.De Rousseau: Oui. C'est ça. I am honoured zat you 'ave seen it.Ryunosuke: It states that the only condition for joining the league is having flame-coloured hair. And that if you satisfy the interview panel and are admitted into the league... ...you could receive a weekly income of four pounds.Kazuma: On the date specified, red-headed hopefuls gathered in droves at a park specified in the advertisement. And from each person present, this pair took an application fee of five shillings.De Rousseau: And wiz ze money, to France! It was a plan most elegant, non?Kazuma: No, it was most dishonourable. But to be frank, I'm stunned anybody was foolish enough to be taken in by such an obvious trick.Susato: The park was described by one witness as 'choked with red-headed folk, like a coster's orange barrow'.Kazuma: And the day on which all these men gathered to apply was the day before the victim was discovered. Crucially, these two men spoke face to face with every single person present that day.De Rousseau: Oui. I 'ave seen more red-'eaded people in one day zan I will see in ze rest of my life.De Rossi: Si, si. And-a now, every time I see the capo's hair, I feel sick to my stomach!De Rousseau: Anyway, why 'ave we been summoned 'ere today?Ryunosuke: Sorry?De Rousseau: Ze date for our trial was not until tomorrow, I was told.Kazuma: Naturally, neither of these men have been told any details about this trial. They've only been shown this photograph.Judge: Very good. So, Mr de Rousseau and Mr de Rossi, you will now give your formal testimony for the court... ...on the subject of the gentleman pictured in this photograph.De Rousseau: Of course. We are always ready to 'elp wiz ze law.Witness Testimony - The Man in the Photograph -De Rousseau: We 'ad more zan one thousand red-'eaded people assemble in ze park on Lime Street zat day.De Rossi: But I don't recall the man in this-a photograph. Ay, capo?De Rousseau: Non, I don't remember 'im. Obviously 'e is dead now. But I assure you, 'e was not in ze park.De Rossi: Allora! This victim is-a nothing to do with us!De Rousseau: You 'ave a lot to answer for, Peppino. It is your fault zat we got caught in ze first place.Kazuma: You've given sworn testimony that this man in the photograph was not present. Can you be certain?De Rousseau: Oui, oui. I am quite certain. We did not interview zis man.De Rossi: Nobody looking like-a this came to the park. This, I can promise!Judge: It must be noted that you have been arrested for a grand deception, however. Accordingly, this court has little confidence in your assurances.De Rossi: ...!  ...Uffa! With this attitude, we get-a nowhere, uh?Ryunosuke: (He's really-a sulking now...)Kazuma: This confidential document was obtained directly from Scotland Yard. It records an entry from the inspector's private diary dated the day before the incident. It reads, 'Lime Street, Red-Headed League, Undercover.'De Rossi: Ah! I have the answer! Maybe there was another, similar event in the park on the day in question, ay?De Rousseau: Zat is ridiculous.Ryunosuke: (There's no question that Inspector Gregson was investigating the Red-Headed League. Which means it's quite possible that's when he was killed!)Judge: Very well. The defence may proceed with the cross-examination now.Ryunosuke: Ah. Yes, My Lord!Cross-Examination - The Man in the Photograph -De Rousseau: We 'ad more zan one thousand red-'eaded people assemble in ze park on Lime Street zat day.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: A thousand people? That's a very big crowd. De Rousseau: It was quite a spectacle. Red-'eads 'ad come from all over ze capital. De Rossi: Si, the capo here, he has the magnetismo animale, ay? Nobody else could attract-a so many people. If I could be born again, I would be the capo! De Rousseau: All zose people wanted was ze money, Peppino. Ze four pounds per week. Judge: Are you suggesting that you spoke personally with all one thousand applicants? De Rousseau: Oui, oui, zat we did. Because every one of zem paid us five shillings. De Rossi: We take-a their names and we take-a their money! And we take-a their addresses as well. Then I tell them we take-a some days to let them know by-a post, e finito! Maybe...two minuti a person? We start early in the morning, and we stop late in the night. Ryunosuke: So...you earnt five thousand shillings in one day?! (That's a small fortune!) Kazuma: Who'd have thought there were a thousand such gullible red-heads in London to start with. Ryunosuke: (One of whom was a great detective with chemically altered hair...)De Rossi: But I don't recall the man in this-a photograph. Ay, capo?Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: He doesn't look at all familiar? De Rossi: No, I don't-a think so. And this is a wig, ay? He was trying to trick us! I do not like the people who are trying to trick the other people! Ryunosuke: ...Says the con artist. Kazuma: If between them they interviewed a thousand people with red hair... ...it would be unreasonable to expect them to remember every face. De Rossi: No no, signore. I may be small... ...but my memory is very large! I never forget a thing! In my opinion, I do not think this-a man was in the park. Ryunosuke: (But he's not going to give the court a definite, it seems.) De Rossi: Eh, capo? You didn't see a man like this, uh?De Rousseau: Non, I don't remember 'im. Obviously 'e is dead now. But I assure you, 'e was not in ze park.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But according to what you've said, you spoke with a thousand or more people that day. De Rousseau: Oui, zat's true. My eyes were burning by ze end of ze day. Ryunosuke: Surely then, you can't actually remember every single face. How are you so certain... ...that this particular man wasn't present? De Rossi: Normally, the red hair is very distinctive, ay? But not when you have one thousand red-heads crowding around. Then it is just an eyesore! But if there was some other information you could-a give us, maybe then we would recall. De Rousseau: Zat is not ze line, Peppino. Remember, we do not remember 'im. We are sure of zat fact, uh? If zere was a man wiz a red 'airpiece, but 'is moustache did not match ze colour... ...zen I do not sink I could 'ave forgotten 'im. Ryunosuke: (Kazuma said these two had only been shown that photograph and they'd been told nothing else at all. But what if I fed them just one other detail about the victim. For example...) His name Ryunosuke: I can certainly appreciate that just knowing the man had red hair wouldn't help you remember in this situation. But what if I told you that the man's name was Gregson? De Rousseau: Ze man in ze photograph is a Monsieur Gregson? Ryunosuke: Yes. De Rossi: Names, they are boring! I did not-a listen to any of them. Ryunosuke: ...Oh. De Rossi: It was not a real interview, uh? It was just for-a show. Why would I remember the names? De Rousseau: Zat's right. Zis changes nothing. Ze man in ze photograph was not zere. As we 'ave already said. Ryunosuke: I see... Judge: Hm... It seems there's little to be gained from pursuing this point further. De Rousseau: Tell zem again what you said before, Peppino. De Rossi: Si, capo, si! I say it again and again! Leads back to cross-examination His profession Ryunosuke: I can certainly appreciate that just knowing the man had red hair wouldn't help you remember in this situation. But what if I told you the man in the red hairpiece was actually a detective? De Rousseau: Ze man in ze photograph? A detective? Ryunosuke: Yes. Kazuma: It would appear he found your notice in the paper suspicious and decided to investigate incognito. De Rousseau: ......... ...Sorry, but zis changes nothing. No detective came to ze park. I am certain of zat. Pursue Peppino de Rossi (before Inspector's Identification is added to the Court Record) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Something to add, Mr de Rossi?! De Rossi: ......... Che? Si, I am always adding something! Parmesan, olive oil, pepper... Ryunosuke: What I mean is...did you not agree with your friend's last remark by any chance? De Rossi: Eh? What-a did he just-a say? About the detective? Ryunosuke: Yes, that. De Rousseau: Keep your mouth shut, Peppino! You 'ave said enough already. De Rossi: But-a why, capo? What is the problem? There was a man who said-a, 'I am an inspector from Scotland Yard.' Ryunosuke: What?! Kazuma: ...! Judge: Good Lord! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! Explain this volte-face in your testimony, witness! De Rossi: Is simple. A man who was at-a the park said to us that he was an inspect- De Rousseau: Zere was no such man. De Rossi: Ma dai! What are you saying, capo? Have you forgotten, ay? De Rousseau: I 'ave forgotten nothing. Nobody like zis came to ze park. De Rossi: Basta, capo, basta! You beat me at-a many things, but not two: the memory and the meals! Like I said, when is time to eat-a the pasta, no one is-a faster! De Rousseau: But you are inferior to me in every other way... so shut up! Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: ......... Kazuma: ......... De Rousseau: Uuurgh... Trop tard... Ze damage is done... Judge: Indeed it is, sir. De Rousseau: Oui, zere was a man who came to ze park and 'e said 'e was an inspector from Scotland Yard. 'Owever! 'E looked nothing like ze man in ze photograph. 'E was someone else! Ryunosuke: How can you be so sure? De Rousseau: Because! To start wiz, 'is face was completely different. De Rossi: Si...is true, is true. The man who came was-a younger. His-a face was clean-shaven. His-a eyes were sadder. His-a chin was thinner. Judge: No resemblance whatsoever, then! De Rousseau: Anyway, I was not going to be fooled. I took ze obvious precaution and said to 'im... ...'If you are really a detective, show us ze proof!' De Rossi: Si, si, the capo here, he doesn't take-a no nonsense, ay? De Rousseau: But 'e was well prepared. 'E said 'e 'ad identification. Ryunosuke: I-Identification? You mean, official police inspector's identification? Judge: That is most unconvincing. Ryunosuke: Sorry, My Lord? Judge: Counsel, no incognito inspector would offer his identification for inspection. It's quite out of the question. Kazuma: Definitely. Why would he expose his true identity? De Rousseau: Clearly ze papers were fake. De Rossi: Certo, capo! You are a genius! As we say in-a Italia, it takes a thief to recognise another, ay? Ryunosuke: And what happened after he announced that he was a detective? De Rousseau: 'E became very annoying. 'E said, 'You are under investigation.' So I took 'is papers from 'im and chased 'im out of ze park. De Rossi: It was fantastico! And look, here is-a the identification! Kazuma: So you stole it from the man? De Rossi: He had it-a coming! He made us very scared. But he was-a not who he said-a he was! Judge: Indeed, the person described does not appear to have behaved as a true inspector would. However, I believe it would be prudent for these identification papers to be entered into evidence. De Rossi: Hmph. But I-a like them! The inspector's identification has been entered into the Court Record. Judge: Now, let us return to the witnesses' testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Ryunosuke: I see... De Rousseau: In any case, if such a man 'ad come incognito... ...'e wouldn't 'ave just said, 'I am a detective,' would 'e? Ryunosuke: Well...no, I suppose not. Judge: Hm...sound logic, I must agree. Kazuma: ......... De Rousseau: Tell zem again what you said before, Peppino. De Rossi: Ay? Ah! Si, capo, si! Is-a best we move on! Leads back to cross-examination His fish and chips Ryunosuke: I can certainly appreciate that just knowing the man had red hair wouldn't help you remember in this situation. But what if I told you the man was always munching on a packet of fish and chips? Do you remember a man who was eating incessantly? De Rousseau: Not really. I was looking only at ze 'eads of ze applicants. I wouldn't 'ave noticed ze fish and chips any more zan ze caviar and smoked salmon. De Rossi: Or-a spaghetti! Me, I love the spaghetti! Ryunosuke: Really? I had no idea... De Rousseau: Tell zem again what you said before, Peppino. De Rossi: Si, capo, si! I say it again and again! Leads back to cross-examinationExamine evidence Inspector's Identification Latch on back Ryunosuke: Well, I suppose we should see what this inspector's identification looks like inside... Writing inside Ryunosuke: Yes, it definitely looks fake, doesn't it? Susato: Out of interest, what name is given? Ryunosuke: Probably just something plucked out of the air. It's...'Tobias Gregson'... Wait, what? Susato: ......... This Scotland Yard insignia... ...looks genuine to me. Ryunosuke: But how?! Susato: And the department and identification number details are all correct as well. Ryunosuke: (Since when have you known those?) Do, do you mean to say...? Susato: I know it seems incredible, but yes... ...I think this is a genuine identification book issued by Scotland Yard. Ryunosuke: But that's... That's unbelievable! (This is the real thing after all?!) The details of the inspector's identification have been updated in the Court Record. Writing inside (subsequent times) Ryunosuke: This Scotland Yard insignia looks genuine to me. Susato: And the department and identification number details are all correct as well. There's no doubt that this really is Inspector Gregson's identification.De Rossi: Allora! This victim is-a nothing to do with us!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But we only have your word for that. De Rossi: Si, but what else can we do, uh? Ryunosuke: (True...) De Rossi: Uffa! We are not having much-a fun these days! First we are arrested, then we are shown the horrible picture of a dead man... ...and now you question every single-a thing we say! WE are the victims here! Ay, capo? Ryunosuke: No, you were caught carrying out a plot to swindle hundreds of innocent people. De Rossi: ...! Hmph! You had to bring that up, ay? It's not fair! Ay, capo?Present Inspector's Identification (after examining writing inside) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"I wonder if I could ask you to examine this identification book very closely...\"De Rousseau: You 'ave a lot to answer for, Peppino. It is your fault zat we got caught in ze first place.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What do you mean by that? De Rossi: Cavolo! You promised not to say! Ay, capo? De Rousseau: After we 'ad taken all ze money zat day, we should 'ave left ze country. Zat was my plan. I left ze purchasing of ze tickets for ze ferry to Dunkerque to my companion 'ere. But 'e bought zem for ze wrong day. Ryunosuke: Oops. De Rossi: Si, but is an easy mistake-a to make-a, uh? The first, the thirty-first... De Rousseau: Bof! I 'ave no sympathy for you! We were an 'ole day late for ze boat because of your stupidity! And it's only because of zis, zat ze so-called 'great red-'eaded detective' caught us! De Rossi: Capo...you know what I think? This is the work of God! Is a holy punishment, ay? De Rousseau: Peppino, for ze last time... ...zis is not 'oly punishment. Zis is 'olly your fault! De Rossi: Ah! De Rousseau: Don't blame God for your unholy mistakes. You are makin' me sick wiz anger! De Rossi: Hmph. Maybe I make-a mistake-a. But when is time to eat-a the pasta, no one is-a faster! Ryunosuke: (And I've seen the evidence...)Ryunosuke: (They haven't told us much we didn't already know...)Susato: What do you think, Mr Naruhodo?Ryunosuke: Well, if it was in the inspector's diary, it seems likely that he must have gone to Lime Street that day. And yet these two both claim they didn't see him...Susato: I have to say... ...they don't appear to be telling lies.Ryunosuke: Well, they are experts in deception, don't forget. Sounding plausible is their specialty. They may be lying simply to avoid being implicated in this case as well.Susato: Surely if they were truly experts in deception, they wouldn't have been caught.Ryunosuke: (Well, yes, you do have a point there...) ...It seems to me like we need more information.Susato: Definitely!Ryunosuke: I wonder if I could ask you to examine this identification book very closely... ...Miss Lestrade?Kazuma: Why Miss Lestrade?Judge: What is your intention here, Counsel?Ryunosuke: Is this really a fake, or is it genuine? That's the question. ...Which we can't answer ourselves.Kazuma:Kazuma: Don't be ridiculous. No Scotland Yard detective would allow his - or her - identification to be stolen.???:Gina: That...that... That IS the boss's! ...No question about it.Kazuma: It can't be!Ryunosuke: As I suspected. The 'undercover detective' who attended the Red-Headed League's enrolment on the day in question... ...was the real Inspector Gregson carrying out an incognito investigation!De Rousseau: Zu... Zut aloooooors!Judge: O-Ordaaar! Ordaaar!Gina: But...if the boss 'ad 'is identification stolen... ...'e would've reported it straight away. I mean, 'e was always on at me about it. If ya lose summat, report it at once, 'e'd say.Ryunosuke: Could it be, then... ...that the inspector was physically unable to report it?De Rossi: Physically... Ay?! What are you-a saying?Kazuma: Unable to...? You're, you're not suggesting...?Ryunosuke: Yes! It's quite possible that he was killed before he had the chance to report his identification stolen!Kazuma: No!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!!Ryunosuke: The defence posits that the victim was killed the day before his body was discovered, at a different location. Do you two...have anything to say about that?!De Rossi: Uèèèèèèèèèèèè! I know-a nothing! Uèèèèèèèèè! I done-a nothing! Uèèèèèèèèè!De Rousseau: Pull yourself together, Peppino! Mon Dieu! You can behave a little more like a master criminal zan zat, non?De Rossi: Uèèèèèèèèè! Now I wish I had-a returned to Italia! Uèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèè!De Rousseau: S-Stop crying, Peppino, please! Otherwise I...I...Gina: Lumme! Stop yer whinin' an' start talkin'!Judge: Well...I believe the court will need to hear your story in considerably greater detail.De Rossi: I know-a nothing! Uèèèèèèèèè! I done-a nothing! Uèèèèèèèèè!Kazuma: But you will tell everything! ...Or face the worst possible outcome.De Rousseau: Ugh... Uuuuuugh...Judge: You will dry your eyes and testify again... ...about these identification papers, and the precise circumstances under which you came by them!De Rossi: Uèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèè!Ryunosuke: (For crying out loud...)Witness Testimony - The Detective and the Identification -De Rousseau: Ze, ze truth is, we took 'im prisoner and kept 'im for ze night at our secret 'ideout. Even though I didn't sink 'e was a real detective, I, I was too scared to let 'im go zat day, just in case.De Rossi: We took the man's identification from him and shut-a him in the room next to ours!De Rousseau: Zere might 'ave been a little tussle, but we did 'im no 'arm. And ze next mornin', we let 'im go.De Rossi: He spent-a the night in a nice room! It was-a nothing like prison really! Uèèèèèè!Judge: This, this is outrageous! You imprisoned the man?!De Rossi: But! No! Si! No! It, it was not-a like a prison! He was-a very comfortable and-a calm and-a happy! Ay, capo?De Rousseau: ......... It, it was never part of my plan! I swear it!De Rossi: Uffa! So...so you think it was-a my fault, ay? Just because I got the date of the ferry wrong... by one-a little-a day!De Rousseau: I do not sink it was your fault, Peppino. I know it!De Rossi: No no no no! Per favore, capo. Is not-a fair.Judge: You shall have plenty of time for squabbling back at the prison, gentlemen.De Rousseau: Uff! I don't believe zis... 'Ow could 'e 'ave been a real detective...?Judge: Counsel for the Defence, proceed with the cross-examination!Ryunosuke: (So on the day before the incident... ...Gregson spent the night confined in this pair's hideout...)Cross-Examination - The Detective and the Identification -\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Susato Mikotoba\nDescription: A judicial assistant sent to Britain on a study tour.

'I wonder exactly how many mysteries are out there, hidden within this bed of fog,' he said. Indeed, a most bizarre incident born of a curious advertisement... a hell-hound's mad gallop through the shadows of a serial murder, an executed man's graveyard resurrection in the dead of night... and a commonplace killing in a small, forgotten room at the edge of town... There is, naturally, always another side to every case of which most remain ignorant. 'And it is that \"other side\" which compels me to the scene of the crime, Wilson. So, quickly now. Take your hat and let's be on our way, my dear fellow. For our adventure is not over yet. Come! The game is afoot!' Eight days after that earth-shattering trial and Kazuma regaining his memory... ...we were in the foyer of one of London's most luxurious hotels, the Great Waterloo Hotel. 1st November, 10:24 a.m. Great Waterloo Hotel Foyer Ryunosuke: Professor Mikotoba is due to arrive at any moment. Susato: Yes! I'm so glad we got here in time! ......... Ryunosuke: (Susato-san hasn't been the same since what happened. Not that I'm surprised.) Susato: The truth about Kazuma-sama's father... Ryunosuke: ...! Susato: Do you suppose my father knew? Ryunosuke: That he was actually the mass murderer, the Professor, you mean? (I knew that's what she was thinking about.) There's a good chance, I'd say. I mean... ...they did come here to London together sixteen years ago, didn't they? Susato: Yes, that's true... Ryunosuke: ......... Come to think of it, didn't you say... ...that Professor Mikotoba knew about Kazuma going missing in Hong Kong as well? Susato: That's right. But for some reason, he wasn't at liberty to talk to me about it. Ryunosuke: (That probably means he knows, then... ...about Kazuma showing up here in London with amnesia, and that he's regained his memory now.) Susato: ......... ???: Ah, there she is! Susato: Oh... Father! Mikotoba: Hello, Susato! How are you? Susato: I'm very well, thank you. We're delighted you've arrived safe and sound! Mikotoba: Hello, Mr Naruhodo. Very kind of you to take the trouble to meet us here. Ryunosuke: Oh no, not at all. It's my pleasure. ???: We've heard all about your extraordinary exploits here in London, you know. The news has crossed the seas. Ryunosuke: It, it has? ???: I always look forward to reading the monthly reports that arrive with the steamships from Britain. Ryunosuke: Oh...I, I see. Well...thank you very much! (Who is this man? And why do I feel as though I've seen him before?) ???: Hm... I take it from your expression that you can't quite place me. Mikotoba: In that case...how about a little reminder, Seishiro? A firm tap should do it. ???: Yes... Ryunosuke: (A, a firm tap? What?) ???: Here we go, then... I hereby pronounce the defendant, Ryunosuke Naruhodo... ...GUILTY! Ryunosuke: Ah... OOOOOOH! Y-You're... Judge: The court will now hear the trial of Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Y... Your... ...Your Excellency! Susato: Hello, Judge Jigoku, how are you? It's been a long time. Jigoku: Hah hah hah hah hah! Good, you've remembered now! That really did the trick! Guilty! Hah hah hah hah hah! Ryunosuke: (Only I was declared not guilty, wasn't I? And there was no laughing at the time...) Jigoku: So, London again after all this time... Hard to believe it's been ten years. To be honest, I never thought I'd be back. Mikotoba: Neither did I. I didn't imagine Japan would ever be invited to an international symposium like this. Though, really, I doubt anyone did, to be honest. It's all thanks to you, isn't it, Seishiro? Jigoku: What are you talking about, Yujin? Hah hah hah hah hah! Ryunosuke: (Of course, Judge Jigoku... He must complete the set. He's the other man, who sixteen years ago... ...came to London with Kazuma's father and Professor Mikotoba. He's the third visiting scholar.) Mikotoba: Well, all those passport checks and luggage searches at the border took rather a lot of time. I must say, I'm very envious of your ministerial status. You didn't have to go through any of that, did you? Jigoku: Ah, I knew you were jealous! Hah hah hah hah hah! Ryunosuke: Sorry? Ministerial status? Mikotoba: Yes, didn't you know? Seishiro here is also Japan's Minister of Foreign Affairs. It was his personal insistence that allowed you to take Kazuma's place here on this study tour. Jigoku: Guilty as charged! Hah hah hah hah hah! Ryunosuke: Oh. Well, thank you very much. (He's really every bit as important as he looks.) Mikotoba: Ah yes now, Naruhodo... I received a telegram from Lord Stronghart yesterday. Ryunosuke: Oh, you did? Mikotoba: It appears that...some things came to light in a trial you were involved with eight days ago. About what happened ten years ago. That...tragedy. Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: Yes. Could you tell us any more about it? After clearing all Converse options: Mikotoba: Well, if you'll excuse us now... Jigoku: Yes, I'd like to get this trunk up to my room as soon as possible. Ryunosuke: Oh, I...I'm so sorry! I shouldn't have held you up here for so long. Susato: I'll call for the porter, then. Just wait here! Ryunosuke: (Susato-san's gone off at a run!) Mikotoba: I'd like to stay and talk more, but I do have various preparations to make for tomorrow. Ryunosuke: Yes, of course! It must be a big responsibility representing our entire country. I wish you the best of luck! Mikotoba: ......... Naruhodo... ...I hope you'll keep an eye on Susato for me. Keep looking after her as you obviously have been. Ryunosuke: Oh no! I, I mean, if anyone's looking after anyone, it's her looking after me! Mikotoba: Well I do appreciate you being there for her. After all... ...I've been a miserable father to her. I've thoroughly let her down. Ryunosuke: Sorry? What do you mean? Mikotoba: ......... Well, it was sixteen years ago that I started my long study tour here in Britain, as you know. The very year Susato was born. Ryunosuke: ...Yes, I heard. Mikotoba: The birth of my daughter was the most joyous event of my life, but... Well, sadly it was accompanied by the most tragic event of my life, too. Ryunosuke: (Oh...yes... Susato-san hinted at something like that...) Susato: It was a rather turbulent time at home... Mikotoba: ...Anyway, I won't bore you with the details. The point is, I became rather less dependable than befits a grown man. And it was then that Seishiro offered me the opportunity to study here in Great Britain. Jigoku: I was too worried about you to leave you behind. So perhaps I was a little heavy-handed when it came to persuading you to accompany me to London. Mikotoba: So...that's what happened in a nutshell. And that's also the reason why I now feel compelled to give my daughter as many opportunities as I dare. Though the world does not readily afford young women such things, I must say. Ryunosuke: I...completely understand, Professor. Mikotoba: ......... Ah, one other thing, Naruhodo... If I may be so bold, I have a favour to ask you. Ryunosuke: Oh, really? Of course! What can I do for you? Mikotoba: Well, the thing is, I- Susato: I'm so sorry that took so long! Ryunosuke: Miss Susato! Susato: Now then...allow us to take your bags! Porter: Allow me to take your bags! Mikotoba: One moment, if you please, porter. Porter: Of...of course, sir! Mikotoba: That machine around your neck... It's a camera, I believe? Porter: Quite right, sir! Just five shillings for a lovely photograph to commemorate a wonderful stay at the hotel, sir! Mikotoba: Well, I think given the occasion, we could justify the expense. Porter: ......... Ah! Yes, yes of course! Susato: ...I'd like to thank you for coming with me, Mr Naruhodo. It's really made Father very happy, I think. Ryunosuke: Oh, well, I'm pleased, then. (But we were interrupted before. Professor Mikotoba was about to ask me something.) Susato: Shall we return to Baker Street, then? I expect Iris will have some delicious tea waiting for us! Ryunosuke: Yes, let's go. (I'm getting more and more anxious about Kazuma, though. Perhaps I'll try to meet with Lord Stronghart later and ask after him...) 1st November British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Van Zieks: Here's the final draft of the opening address for tomorrow's proceedings. I've supplemented your original with the figures you asked for from the Yard. Stronghart: I see. Excellent work. Thank you. Van Zieks: ...You're welcome, My Lord. Ryunosuke: (What's Lord van Zieks doing here...?) Susato: My, there seems to be an awful lot of tension in the air, wouldn't you say? Ryunosuke: (This place is stifling enough as it is. We really don't need any more tension.) Stronghart: My apologies. I didn't notice you come in. Your small stature and dark dress make you all but invisible to me. Ryunosuke: Oh! No no! It's entirely my fault for wearing black, I'm sure. Susato: From now on, you must dress in white from head to toe whenever you come here! Stronghart: Now then, Mr Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: Y-Yes, My Lord! I'm right here! Stronghart: ......... Ryunosuke: ......... (Ugh... Kill me now...) Stronghart: Is something wrong? Perhaps it's a little too hot in here for you. Ryunosuke: Oh, no, not at all! I mean, I've never experienced a room at such a perfect temperature! Stronghart: If you're sure. The beads of sweat carving their way down your face seem to suggest otherwise. Ryunosuke: (Because of the daggers you're staring at me with, mainly.) Stronghart: As you're no doubt aware, my International Forensic Science Symposium begins tomorrow. In fact, your father arrived in London earlier today, I hear, madam. Susato: Oh! Yes, that's right, My Lord. He's extremely honoured to have been invited. Stronghart: I'll leave the remaining preparations for the meeting room in your capable hands then, Lord van Zieks. Van Zieks: I will attend at once. Susato: He gave you a very cold stare as he left, didn't he? Ryunosuke: I know. But I haven't done anything...have I? Stronghart: These past few days, my feet have barely touched the ground, I must say. My dedicated right hand of many years was recently put out of action in spectacular fashion. Ryunosuke: Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. ...Is your left hand still of service? Susato: Mr Naruhodo! He's talking about Dr Sithe! Ryunosuke: Ah! (Of course...) I'm, I'm terribly sorry about that. I was just, um... Stronghart: Fear not. You've done nothing wrong. Dr Sithe's own wrongdoing precipitated the situation. You needn't concern yourself with it any further. Ryunosuke: (That would be a lot easier to do if it weren't for the piercing stare you're giving me...) Stronghart: Lord van Zieks is doing an admirable job of holding the fort. Though disturbingly, his apprentice has been missing since yesterday. Ryunosuke: O-Oh... (Missing...?) Susato: What's become of Kazuma-sama now...? 1st November Sholmes's Suite ???: Uèèèèèèèèèèèèè uèèèèèèèèèèèèèèè! Ryunosuke: W-What was that?! Susato: A, a man screaming! In a most unflattering way! Ryunosuke: Do you think... Could it have been Mr Sholmes? Susato: Oh my! I do hope not... ???: Uèèèèèèèèèèèè! I don't-a do it any more! ???: Mon ami, mon ami... Stop zis disgraceful display, uh? Ryunosuke: Who, who are these people? (Look at their hair! It's bright red...) Susato: I think...they must be clients of Mr Sholmes. Gina: Right, you two. Yer comin' wiv me now. Down to the clink. ???: No! Not in prison! It is dark and damp and I don't-a like it! ???: Bof! Ze darkness, it is my friend. I am not scared! ???: Uèèè uèèèèèèèèèèèè! But you are always scared of the dark! ???: Shut your mouth, you idiot! I will sit quietly in ze dark and plan our next daring 'eist! ???: Uèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèè! I don't-a like this! I don't-a like it! Gina: Well tough! We'll finish this down the Yard! Now get movin'! Iris: By then, Ginny! Have fun! Gina: Oh yeah, thanks, Iris! And thanks...ya great detective! Susato: Heehee! Gina makes a fine detective herself, doesn't she? Iris: Oh, Susie! And Runo! Ryunosuke: Hello, Iris. We're home! Iris: Well? Did you find your daddy? Susato: Yes! We arrived at the hotel just before he and his friend. Iris: Oh! Well that's great news. I hope I'll get to see my daddy again soon... Susato: Ah...yes...of course... Ryunosuke: (Dr John H. Wilson...) ???: So, Iris! All that remains now is that greatest of problems known to man! Sholmes: But before we concern ourselves with that, I believe some tea is in order, don't you, my dear fellows? Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: ......... Sholmes: Is something wrong, Mr Naruhodo? Do I have a crumb or suchlike on my face? Ryunosuke: Uh... (Not so much on your face... ...as on your head, I'd say.) Iris: Come along then, everyone. I've brewed a lovely special blend. Time for tea! Susato: Whatever is going on here today? Sholmes: In that case, let us sit and drink now. For I am in fact expecting a guest later today. After clearing Converse options with Herlock Sholmes and clearing all Converse options in British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office: *Ding-aling-aling* Sholmes: Aha! Here is my guest now. My latest client! With money to spend! Iris: Ooh, I do hope it's an exciting case, Hurley! Sholmes: Remember, Iris, we are at present gripped by the greatest problem known to man. I must be willing to accept any case, no matter how unstimulating. Save locating a runaway, of course. Ryunosuke: ...Don't spare anyone's feelings, will you? Iris: Oh dear... I'm afraid that Hurley can lack a little tact, especially just before the rent is due. *Thwack!* ???: Mr Sholmes! Mr Herlock Sholmes! Please... Oh, please... ...please find my husband! He's run away! Sholmes: To upset me? ???: I beg your pardon? Sholmes: Never mind. A personal matter. My apologies. What exactly are you trying to say, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: ...I didn't say a word. Sholmes: Come, my dear madam, be seated. Iris, some tea, if you please? Iris: Of course! Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: What's the matter, Miss Susato? Susato: Oh, it's...it's just that gentlewoman... I feel sure I've seen her somewhere before. Very recently. Ryunosuke: (...! Yes, now you come to mention it...) Evie: As I explained earlier, my name is Evie Vigil. I implore you to take the case, sir! Money is no object. Simply name your figure! Sholmes: Money and wealth are of little consequence to me, madam. Being offered a case to solve is reward enough. Evie: Oh, Mr Sholmes! You are the picture of benevolence! Sholmes: I will of course make a mental note of your offer, however. For...contingent reasons. I trust you will remember your words also. Evie: Um...if I might enquire, sir... ...this gentleman and lady would be...? Ryunosuke: Oh! Um...me? Evie: What I am about to tell you, I should like to communicate in the strictest confidence, you understand. Sholmes: Ah, these are my friends. I assure you, you may say before this pair anything which you may say to me. Evie: Ah...I see... Sholmes: I can vouch for the gentleman personally. After all... ...he's hard of hearing. Ryunosuke: (...Why did I ever get my hopes up?) After clearing all Converse options: Sholmes: Thank you for everything you have shared with us, Mrs Vigil. I believe I have all the information I need to begin my investigation. Evie: Oh, please report to me soon with good news, sir! Sholmes: Fear not, madam. In a day or two, I shall be contacting you with a heartening report, I'm quite sure. Evie: So soon? Oh, how splendid, Mr Sholmes! Sholmes: Good news should be delivered early, I always say. If you would be so kind as to leave the photograph of your husband in my possession...? The photograph of Mr Vigil has been entered into the Court Record. Sholmes: Thank you. Now, allow me to show you the door. Evie: I can't thank you enough, Mr Sholmes. You've been simply marvellous! Iris: You know, I think it every time, Hurley... ...but how do you come out with such nonsense? Good news in a day or two? Are you sure? Sholmes: I can't be sure, of course. But then I didn't swear on it. I merely gave the good woman some hope. I hope to be able to give her good news, one might say. After all, the rent must be paid by the end of day tomorrow. If by that time I've successfully located Mr Vigil, we shall be mutually relieved. Wouldn't you agree, Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: ...Don't look at me with those pleading eyes. Sholmes: Well, my dear fellow? Did you hear the details of the case? Ryunosuke: Yes...my hearing is surprisingly good, actually. Sholmes: Excellent! And what did you make of it? Ryunosuke: Well, I was surprised to learn where her husband worked. At Barclay Prison, I mean... Sholmes: Ah, so you noted that? Susato: Of course. Especially with the mention of Lowgate Cemetery... Drebber: Lowgate Cemetery as at the rear of Barclay Prison. So it was renowned among us students at the university for being haunted by the ghosts of condemned convicts. Susato: Barclay Prison is where that notorious man was incarcerated! Ryunosuke: The Professor... Sholmes: And now a warder from the prison has mysteriously disappeared, it would seem. Ryunosuke: It's all very peculiar... Sholmes: Indeed. But nothing you can't handle, I'm quite certain, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Sholmes: Run along to the prison and see what you can glean, would you? It's the prison governor you want. No doubt the man is equally worried. Ryunosuke: But...aren't you going to go yourself? Sholmes: Surely you needn't ask. I can't possibly be seen out with this hair! Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: ...But didn't you go to Lime Street with that hair? Sholmes: That was a quite different matter. So, I leave it in your capable hands. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm rather busy. Ryunosuke: (Of course you are...) 1st November, 10:24 a.m. Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy Barclay Prison is on the outskirts of London, backing onto a lonely burial ground. Its four high outer walls loomed quietly before us in the fog. Having requested a meeting, we were shown to the governor's office in the watchtower. 1st November Barclay Prison, Governor's Office ???: This place is full of hardened criminals. I cannae remember the last time a civilian was doon here. And you dinnae want to talk to an inmate, but to me? Caidin: D'you ken who I am? I'm the governor, Barry Caidin......... hm? Ryunosuke: Oh...yes...it's a pleasure. I'm Ryunosuke Naruhodo, defence lawyer. Caidin: And an Easterner, I see. Does that mean... Ryunosuke: Yes, I'm a visiting student of law from the Empire of Japan. Caidin: Japan?! Did ye say Japan? Ryunosuke: Um...yes? Caidin: Well there's no any of your kind in here, laddie! Maybe you should try the prison next door, eh? Susato: I didn't notice another prison next door, sir... Ryunosuke: Anyway, we came to ask you some questions about- Caidin: I dinnae like to be so direct, but... ...I've no intention of speaking wi' the likes o' you suspicious-looking Easterners. Now get oot of my hair. Ryunosuke: (So as soon as he finds out that we're from Japan, he reacts like this... That surely means...) Susato: I think...it's because of the Professor case. Ryunosuke: You think so too? (Ten years ago... ...Genshin Asogi - also known as the Professor - was incarcerated at this prison.) And then, after his execution, he apparently re-merged from his grave in the cemetery behind the prison. Caidin: I, I might 'ave known! You're sniffing around aboot that case, aren't ya? You're agents, eh? Part of the Professor's great web, no doubt. Ryunosuke: No! Not at all! We're just- Caidin: Get gone wi' ya! Before I punch yer lights oot! Ryunosuke: We're going, we're going! (Clearly the ghost of that killer still haunts this place... We're not going to get anywhere here. Unless we can somehow prove to this man that there's nothing suspicious about us...) Susato: Governor Caidin... Ryunosuke: What are you thinking, Miss Susato? Susato: I feel sure that name came up in conversation recently somewhere. I was wondering if whoever mentioned him might have some ideas to help us. Ryunosuke: (Come to think of it, I have the same feeling...) Great Waterloo Hotel Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Barclay Prison, Governor's Office Ryunosuke: If you'd just cast your eyes over this, Governor Caidin... Caidin: What's this then? You cannae pull the wool over my eyes, you good-fer-nothin' Japanese student! ......... Mikotoba? That, that young jock from the forensics laboratory? That Mikotoba? Ryunosuke: Yes! Exactly! Him! Susato: Oh dear, perhaps I should have said something sooner... I'm Yujin Mikotoba's daughter, Susato. Caidin: Jings! You're the young man's daughter? And ya did'nae think to mention that afore? Susato: I, I do apologise... Caidin: Aye, well, ye'd best take a seat then. Can I offer you a cup of tea, perhaps? And dinnae forget to try one of these wee handcuff biscuits! Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: Your father's influence is nothing short of amazing... Susato: I'm bitterly regretting not announcing who I was from the outset now. Caidin: So then...what can I do for you, hen? Susato: Well...we're currently investigating a case. Ryunosuke: It's one of your warders, you see. He's gone missing. Caidin: Missing? Susato: That's right. It's surely been reported to you as well, being the prison governor. Caidin: ......... I have'nae heard nothing of the sort. There's no missing persons in my prison! Susato: Oh! Ryunosuke: (But...how can that be?) Susato: It's Mr Daley Vigil, your chief warder... Caidin: Eh? Vigil? Ryunosuke: That's right. His wife came to us and asked us to investigate his disappearance. (Let's skip the part about him only going missing yesterday for now...) Caidin: ......... Ryunosuke: (Clearly that means something to him...) Susato: Would you be so kind as to tell us what you know, sir? Caidin: Aye... Aye, of course. After clearing all Converse options: Caidin: Well... ...I cannae tell you anything else. Susato: Thank you so much for your time, Governor. Caidin: Oh, one moment afore you're away, hen... I'm sure I have it here somewhere... Ah, found it. Here, take this as a wee souvenir of your visit to the prison. Susato: What is it? Caidin: That's Vigil's dismissal notice. It's ten years old now of course. Susato: Oh my! Are you sure? Caidin: Aye, it's no trouble at all. It's no the original, mind. Vigil's dismissal notice has been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: Thank you very much, Governor Caidin! Caidin: Well in return... ...do me a favour and never come back here. That case is closed. Susato: Well, I think we ought to return to Baker Street for the time being. Ryunosuke: Yes, I agree. We need to report back to Mr Sholmes with what we've found out about Mr Vigil. (What will he tell Mrs Vigil, I wonder?) 1st November Sholmes's Suite Ryunosuke: We're back! ???: Hello, you two! Iris: I thought you'd be back before long, so I baked some scones for us all. Ryunosuke: Ah! So that's what the delicious smell is. Sholmes: Greetings, my dear fellows! You've returned a good deal sooner than I was anticipating. Ryunosuke: Um...hello, Mr Sholmes. ......... Susato: Hello, Mr...Sholmes... ......... Sholmes: Say nothing. Your thoughts are written all over your faces in any case. It turns out that it may have been advisable to test my hair colour restoration tonic before application. Susato: Oh my... Sholmes: Pray, tell me. What of our warder friend? Have you garnered some new information? Ryunosuke: Oh, um...yes. Something very surprising, in fact. Though it's not a patch on your hair, to be honest. Susato: It most certainly isn't. But still, we discovered that- ???: SHOOOOOOOOOLMES!!! Gina: Drop everyfin', Sholmes! This is more important! Ryunosuke: Gina? Gina: I, I can't Adam an' Eve it... *Sniff, sniff...* Susato: What's happened? Sholmes: Clearly a very grave matter indeed. For Miss Lestrade made no mention of my hair whatsoever. Gina: It's...it's the boss... Ryunosuke: What do you mean? (Inspector Gregson?) Gina: The boss is... He's... He's dead. Ryunosuke: What...? Gina: They, they just found 'is body. Shot...wiv a pistol... Ryunosuke: WHAAAAAAAAAT?! Susato: But...but... Inspector Gregson?! Ryunosuke: (He was...murdered?!) Iris: No... Not Gregsy... Sholmes: Come in, my dear girl. Tell us the whole story. Gina: *Sniff, sniff...* After clearing all Converse options: Sholmes: ......... Thank you for informing us, Miss Lestrade. This really is most terrible news. I'm dreadfully sorry... Gina: Wot are you sayin' sorry for? You didn't do nuffin'! Sholmes: ......... Gina: Well...anyway... ...I'm takin' a cab over to the scene right now. Please come an' all! As soon as ya can! You've gotta 'elp! Sholmes: It's a detective's lot to appear wherever some sinister plot has unfolded. Little wonder we all look haggard. Sometimes these things are almost too much for the nerves. Ryunosuke: Mr Sholmes... Sholmes: What use is there in being a great detective if I fail to see something like this coming, hm?! How could I let this happen to Gregson?! To Gregson... Susato: ......... Sholmes: Mr Naruhodo, I shall leave at once to begin my investigations. Ryunosuke: Of course, yes. We will, too. Sholmes: It would be helpful... ...if you could talk to Mr Reaper and see what you can glean. I'm sure you were intending to do so anyway. Until later, then! Ryunosuke: (Inspector Gregson, dead... And Lord van Zieks arrested...) Iris: Runo! Susie! I've called you a hansom. It's waiting outside. Ryunosuke: Thanks, Iris. Shall we, Miss Susato? Susato: Yes! Naruhodo's Legal Consultancy 1st November Room on Fresno Street Ryunosuke: (This really is an out-of-the-way part of London. I doubt many people find their way down this back street. So this dust-ridden rented old room is where it happened then...) Susato: So this is...where poor Inspector Gregson lost his life. Ryunosuke: Yes... And the police are already hard at work investigating, it seems. (I don't see Mr Sholmes anywhere, though... Perhaps his investigations have taken him elsewhere.) Gina: Oi! Wot d'ya think yer doin' there?! Every one o' them drawers 'as gotta be taken right out so you can look underneath an' all! I want the space above this ceilin' checked, and don't forget to look inside the chimney stack, too! Blimey! Ain't you lot never gone over an 'ouse lookin' for dough when the owners are out o' town? Ryunosuke: (Gina's obviously got some unique investigative techniques she wants everyone to adopt...) Gina: Oh, so you've turned up at last. Mind you, I ain't been 'ere long meself. Ryunosuke: Hello again, Gina. Gina: Sholmes 'as only just left. Yer lucky ya missed that. 'E went prancin' around in 'ere, pointin' at stuff an' flickin' that 'at of 'is an' then just scarpered. Susato: Oh! He's finished investigating already, you mean? Gina: Yeah... 'E didn't stop to say nuffin' to no one. Not even me. Ryunosuke: Gina! Would you mind if we investigated, too? Gina: ......... Listen, 'Oddo... ...yer a lawyer, right? Ryunosuke: Um...yes. Why? Gina: Well, yer not thinkin' of...tryin' to 'elp that Reaper bloke, are ya? Ryunosuke: Oh! (Poor Gina... She's never going to forget, is she? That trial will haunt her forever.) Susato: Gina, if you don't mind me saying... If Lord van Zieks really is responsible for this crime... ...he will be duly and fairly judged in court. Gina: ......... I suppose yer right, yeah. Go on then, 'Oddo! Get investigatin'! I wanna know the truth about wot really 'appened 'ere! Ryunosuke: Thank you, Gina! 1st November Local Prison, Cell 1 Ryunosuke: (There he is. Lord van Zieks behind bars...) Susato: So it's true. He really was arrested... Ryunosuke: (He's sitting with his back to the wall, reading something. I don't think he's noticed us.) Erm...Lord van Zieks! Van Zieks: ...Fancy meeting you here. The last place on Earth I'd like to be, with the last person on earth I'd like to see. Ryunosuke: ...I couldn't very well not come. We heard what happened. That you... That Inspector Gregson was... Van Zieks: ......... Go home. This has nothing to do with you. Ryunosuke: But... Susato: Forgive me, Lord van Zieks, but I must disagree. Van Zieks: ......... Susato: Inspector Gregson was very helpful to us on a number of occasions. We're indebted to him. At the very least we owe it to him to find out the truth about his death. You must help us with our investigations, please! Van Zieks: ......... There's really nothing I can tell you. Ryunosuke: What were you just reading at the back of the cell there? Was it something related to the case? Van Zieks: ...This? The Yard isn't quite so cavalier with its information as to share case details with a suspect. This is...a letter from an old acquaintance. Susato: Oh. Who might that be? Van Zieks: Someone you know, as it happens. Albert Harebrayne. Ryunosuke: (Of course, yes. I keep forgetting they went to the same university.) Van Zieks: And I would like to read my correspondence in peace. So let's get this over with, shall we? What is it you want to know? Ryunosuke: (Strange... I mean, let's face it, Lord van Zieks never minces his words... ...but they seem to have less bite than usual somehow.) After clearing all Converse options: Van Zieks: ......... So. It appears our conversation has run dry. Ryunosuke: There was a two-second silence, that's all. Van Zieks: Well in any event, if you'll excuse me now. ...I wouldn't like to detain you. Ryunosuke: I was wondering, Lord van Zieks... If you'd like... ...I'd be happy to advocate for you. Van Zieks: ...! ...You trust me, do you? Ryunosuke: Yes. I've heard you speak many times in court. I've seen how you treat people. So I'm quite sure that you would never have taken another's life. ...It's just, my feelings can't be used as evidence in a court of law, sadly. Van Zieks: ......... It's a very gracious offer. However... ...I trust no one. Ryunosuke: What? Van Zieks: Not the police, not the judiciary...and not you Nipponese. Ryunosuke: But please... Van Zieks: I have no intention of engaging your services. Ryunosuke: ......... (The chasm between us is just too wide and too deep, it seems...) Van Zieks: ...I'd appreciate it if you don't visit again. Then neither of us will waste any more time. Ryunosuke: (Perhaps we need to dig a little deeper... ...and find out more about Lord van Zieks and what happened to Inspector Gregson.) After clearing all Converse options at Local Prison, Cell 1 and clearing all Converse options and examining portrait or desk, board, gun, red wig, chalk outline, candles, and figurine in Room on Fresno Street: 1st November, 10:24 a.m. British Supreme Court, Lord Chief Justice's Office Stronghart: ...You've made good time. ???: I took an express train back to London. Ryunosuke: I can hear Lord Stronghart. Can you? Susato: Yes, it sounds as though he's talking to someone. Stronghart: Is everything in place? ???: I had a private compartment on the train so I could check all the paperwork. Ryunosuke: I-It's... Susato: Kazuma-sama! Stronghart: Ah, your timing is impeccable! Ryunosuke: It, it is? Stronghart: No doubt you have heard the sickening news? About the Reaper's latest devilry. Ryunosuke: ...Yes. Susato: I'm sure you don't believe it of course, though, Lord Stronghart. That Lord van Zieks could have done such a thing to Inspector Gregson. Stronghart: ......... I believe only in the facts. And the facts in this case point to one thing: The unavoidable accusal of Lord van Zieks for this crime. We must bring charges against the Reaper for taking the life of our legendary detective. Susato: Oh no, surely not! Stronghart: It's a truly regrettable situation. Tomorrow the forensic science symposium finally begins. At the very least, though, we can show the world our justice system's swift and equitable processes. Ryunosuke: So does that mean...the trial is tomorrow? Stronghart: Precisely. In fact, this is a fine opportunity for introductions. Ryunosuke: Kazuma... Kazuma: ......... Stronghart: Ah, but of course! You're already acquainted, aren't you? Mr Asogi here will be present at tomorrow's proceedings... ...leading the prosecution. Ryunosuke: Wait... WHAAAAAAT?! (Kazuma...?) Stronghart: As I'm sure you're aware, he's a very capable practitioner of law. Susato: Kazuma-sama...a prosecutor...? After clearing all Converse options and examining Kazuma Asogi: Ryunosuke: (It doesn't look like we're going to glean much more here.) Well...thank you very much, Lord Stronghart. Stronghart: Remember, tomorrow's trial will go down in our empire's history. There's much you could learn...from the public gallery. Ryunosuke: ...Sorry to have taken up so much of your time. We'll see ourselves out. Kazuma: Kazuma: Before you go, Ryunosuke... Ryunosuke: Oh...what is it, Kazuma? Kazuma: I just wanted...to thank you. Susato: Kazuma-sama... What...? Kazuma: You took my determination to heart and brought it with you over the ocean in my stead. And you carried out my role to perfection. Susato: You always were intent on studying British law in order to change our own justice system. It was your dream, and Mr Naruhodo didn't want that to die with you! Kazuma: Yes. But I had another purpose for coming here. Susato: Oh! Kazuma: ......... I actually have a favour to ask. Ryunosuke: W-Which is...? Kazuma: This trial I'll be prosecuting tomorrow... I'd like you to be there to see how it ends. Right in front of me...as the defence counsel! Ryunosuke: ...! (Why? What's this all about?) Kazuma: I know you have what it takes. Ryunosuke: But...Lord van Zieks would never put his fate in my hands. Kazuma: On the contrary. He recognises your talent. Ryunosuke: He does? Kazuma: ...It's not easy to see behind the facade sometimes. Here, have a look at this... Ryunosuke: That's... Susato: That's Lord van Zieks and Inspector Gregson! Ryunosuke: (In a photograph that must have been taken some time ago by the look of it. And who's the third person?) Kazuma: It was displayed very prominently in the detective's office. Ryunosuke: In Gregson's office, you mean? Kazuma: Yes. What I'm trying to say is, if you really think you can trust the Reaper... ...you might find that some straight talking makes him take a different view. Take it. Gregson's photograph has been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: I don't understand. Why are you giving me this? Kazuma: Just hurry, Ryunosuke! Visiting hours at the prison are almost over. Ryunosuke: (What are you doing, Kazuma...?) 1st November Local Prison, Cell 1 Ryunosuke: Lord van Zieks is still reading that letter. Susato: We've been gone quite some time, though... Ryunosuke: Either he's an incredibly slow reader...or it's an incredibly long letter... I might even be able to read English faster than he can. Van Zieks: I was intending to ignore you entirely... ...but I can't turn a deaf ear to such an insulting Nipponese. Ryunosuke: Oh! Um...sorry. I didn't think you'd hear that. Van Zieks: I had the case notes brought to me in secret. I was reading them to pass the time. Susato: Yes, we heard that your trial is set for tomorrow. Van Zieks: Which is none of your business. Ryunosuke: So...have you found a lawyer? Van Zieks: How many times must I reiterate the same thing: this is nothing to do with you. Ryunosuke: (In other words, no.) Susato: We were just talking to Lord Stronghart and...the prosecutor for your trial has been decided. Van Zieks: I'd expect nothing less. Though I have no idea who it is. Ryunosuke: It's...going to be Kazuma Asogi. Van Zieks: ...! Asogi?! Ryunosuke: (That made the colour drain from his face...) Van Zieks: Haah, well then... ...it seems I'm going to have to engage in conversation with you again after all. After clearing all Converse options and presenting Gregson's Photograph: Van Zieks: ......... Mister...Naruhodo... Ryunosuke: Oh! (That's the first time he's ever used my actual name.) Van Zieks: I've lost all confidence in my country's justice system. I don't trust the police, the judiciary or lawyers. But there's still one thing I'm willing to believe in. Ryunosuke: What's that? Van Zieks: That which you see in the eyes of another across the courtroom: a simple determination to know the truth. Ryunosuke: L-Lord van Zieks... Van Zieks: From the very first time we clashed in the Bailey almost a year ago now... ...I couldn't deny it, even though I dearly wished I could. 'Here is a loathsome Nipponese...who has absolute integrity as a lawyer.' Ryunosuke: ...! Van Zieks: There are only two other men I've known with that same look in their eyes: My brother, Klint. ...And Genshin Asogi. Ryunosuke: (The man he idolised and the man who betrayed his trust in the most hideous way...) Van Zieks: ......... When you showed me that photograph just now, it reminded me... Ryunosuke: You mean, this photograph? Van Zieks: Back then I was able to laugh. I was free of the shackles of mistrust that plague me now. I looked to the future with hope. Since then I've protected myself against betrayal by refusing to trust anyone. But at times the mire into which I've sunk makes it almost impossible to breathe. Ryunosuke: I'm...so sorry... Van Zieks: ......... So Mr Naruhodo... ...I want to believe in that look in your eyes. I need to believe in it. ...In tomorrow's trial...will you advocate for me? Ryunosuke: ......... Of course I will. It would be an honour. Susato: I'm so pleased, Mr Naruhodo. Van Zieks: Then my life is in your hands. Ryunosuke: (For Lord van Zieks... ...that must have been an incredibly hard thing to ask. Which is why I simply cannot let the man down. Tomorrow...in the Old Bailey...against my old friend, Kazuma!) To be continued...\nVan Zieks: I was investigating Gregson, and my inquiries had led me to that address.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You were investigating the inspector? What on earth for? Van Zieks: ......... I'm not at liberty to say. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Van Zieks: I'd identified a distinct possibility that Gregson was involved in a case I was investigating. Regrettably, though...he was killed before I could secure the proof I needed. Judge: Is the court to understand then, that on the day in question you followed the victim to the scene? Van Zieks: ...No. I was privy to his movements in advance. Ryunosuke: How? Van Zieks: I stole into his office in the Yard and consulted his diary. The address on Fresno Street was noted in the 5 p.m. entry. Kazuma: You illegally entered the man's office? In Japan that alone would constitute a very serious offence. Judge: As it does in Great Britain, I assure you. Is that not the case, Lord van Zieks? Van Zieks: ...I was aware of the possible consequences. Kazuma: So, in summary, you were investigating the victim... ...and yet you refuse to tell the court why. Van Zieks: ......... Kazuma: I didn't realise British prosecutors enjoyed such freedom to choose what to divulge under oath. Ryunosuke: Ugh... (Why did I ever think I could defend this man?)Van Zieks: When I first entered the room that day, it was dark inside and I saw no one.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Had you ever been to the address before? Van Zieks: No, never. I only learnt of the place as a result of my investigations into Gregson's activities. There was no light inside when I entered, so it was all but impossible to make out anything. Ryunosuke: But at 5 p.m. the sun would only just have gone down. It would still have been reasonably light outside. Van Zieks: The room has a window, but it was boarded shut. Very little light found its way into the room from outside, so it was extremely murky inside. I wouldn't have noticed if the victim was already lying on the floor. Kazuma: There was no artificial light in the room, you say? You're quite sure? Van Zieks: I'm quite sure that the part of the room where the body was found was very dark. I have a feeling there was a small oil lamp burning on the desk, though I couldn't say for certain. Susato: Look, Mr Naruhodo... There is a small desk in the room just here. Ryunosuke: Yes, I remember. And there was an oil lamp on it. As well as the framed photograph. Van Zieks: When I entered the room, I closed the door behind me and started towards the desk to investigate. Ryunosuke: And what did you find? Van Zieks: Nothing. I never actually reached the desk.Van Zieks: A moment later, I heard the gunshot. I spun around, and saw the revolver on the floor.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So...who fired the gun? Van Zieks: I have no idea. I didn't see anybody else in the room. Ryunosuke: But you say it was very dark in there? Van Zieks: Yes, that's right. All I can tell you is, I didn't sense another's presence. Ryunosuke: Aha! Then could it be... ...that the gunshot actually originated from somewhere outside the room?! Van Zieks: No, that's out of the question. Ryunosuke: Oh. Van Zieks: Without doubt, the sound emanated from inside the room. I could smell the gunpowder. Ryunosuke: (Ugh, this is going from bad to worse...) Kazuma: And you say that's the point at which you noticed the revolver on the floor? Van Zieks: Correct. And I foolishly picked it up. That was carelessness on my part. Judge: Presumably, then, the gunshot you heard came from the firearm that you somewhat hastily took in your hands. Van Zieks: In point of fact, My Lord...I believe it did not. Ryunosuke: What? Van Zieks: The barrel of the revolver I picked up was cold, and there was no smell of spent powder. Ryunosuke: But, but then...where on earth is the gun that WAS fired? Van Zieks: Whilst I would like to oblige you with an answer... ...I'm afraid I can't. I, too, would dearly like to know that. Ryunosuke: Uuuuuugh...Van Zieks: Just as I picked the firearm up to examine it, the door flew open and I heard a man scream.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: A man, you say? One of the witnesses, I presume? Kazuma: That's right. One of the street merchants working on Fresno Street. Judge: Who are these merchants? Kazuma: A number of them had set up their stalls directly beneath the boarded window of the crime scene. A match-seller, a newsmonger and a pedlar. They've all given statements saying they heard the gunshot. And without thought of danger, they ran inside to see what had happened. Susato: Yes...Gina told us about that yesterday, didn't she? Kazuma: They burst through the door with some force, it would seem. Van Zieks: They did. And almost gave me a heart attack in the process. Ryunosuke: (But you're supposed to be the Reaper...) Van Zieks: The first man to come in immediately noticed the revolver in my hand and fled. Kazuma: A policeman patrolling on Fresno Street heard the commotion... ...and was able to arrest the accused shortly after the incident occurred. Van Zieks: Anyway, the man's scream drew my attention in that direction.Van Zieks: It was only then that the body of Inspector Gregson appeared before me.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Um...what do you mean by that? In what way did the body 'appear'? Van Zieks: I honestly can't explain it. But it's the truth. As far as I was concerned, the body hadn't been there until that point, and then suddenly...there it was. Ryunosuke: Did you perhaps hear the sound of the victim falling to the ground just beforehand? Van Zieks: ......... At that moment, what I heard... ...was the sound of the door flying open and the scream of the man who came inside first. Nothing more. Ryunosuke: I see... Van Zieks: After the man fled, I examined the body. I was stunned to find that it was Gregson. Judge: Hmmm... Most curious circumstances indeed. Van Zieks: How the inspector was killed, or how his body seemed to appear out of nowhere... ...I have no idea.Ryunosuke: (So...that's Lord van Zieks's account.)Susato: Do you have any thoughts, Mr Naruhodo?Ryunosuke: Yes...mainly that it really doesn't ring true in all sorts of ways. Who fired the gun if there was nobody else there? And how did the corpse just appear in front of him?Susato: So...you think that Lord van Zieks is lying?Ryunosuke: No, I don't think that. I mean, if he was going to lie... ...I would expect him to have come up with a more credible story, wouldn't you?Susato: Yes, I completely agree. I think he genuinely doesn't know what really happened himself. So we must do what we can to fill in the gaps.Ryunosuke: Yes, first and foremost, we need more information!After pressing all statements:Kazuma:Kazuma: Surely the court has heard enough!Ryunosuke: ...!Kazuma: My Lord, the cross-examination has clearly revealed... ...that the accused, Barok van Zieks...is lying on multiple fronts!Ryunosuke: Wha... What is THAT supposed to mean?!Judge: ...Good gracious, Counsel!The defendant is lying, you say?Kazuma: In his testimony just now... ...he claims that he failed to notice the victim's body because the room was dark.Van Zieks: That's correct.Kazuma: No...that's impossible. As proven by this candelabrum.Ryunosuke: How does that prove anything?Kazuma: If you examine the tip of the long candle, you can see it has been blown off by a powerful impact.Judge: One would assume that the projectile from the firearm passed through the victim and struck the candle.Kazuma: The problem comes when you consider the other two candles, which are clearly of a different length.Judge: Yes, I can see that only the candle that appears to have been struck by the bullet is long.Kazuma: We could reasonably expect someone to have lit all three candles together. Which begs the question of why only one has ended up longer than the others.Ryunosuke: That...must be because that particular candle was extinguished when the others were still burning... ...Ah!Kazuma: That's right. When the candle was hit by the bullet, it obviously went out. But the other two candles would still have been burning. So the fact is... ...the victim's body would have been illuminated by the light still thrown by the candelabrum! And the accused's claim that he couldn't see the body... clearly contradicts those facts!Van Zieks: ...!Kazuma: And now to the next lie.Ryunosuke: There's more?!Kazuma: The accused also claims never to have visited the scene of the crime before.Van Zieks: That's the truth.Kazuma: In that almost empty room, the police discovered something very unusual. A board covered from top to bottom in police documents and newspaper cuttings.Susato: Yes, that's right. We saw it, too.Kazuma: It goes without saying that the contents of the police documents cannot be divulged. However... ...they included a number of reports from various historical cases. The oldest of which...was from ten years ago.Ryunosuke: (Ten years ago? This is starting to sound familiar...)Kazuma: And there is a common thread linking all of the documents on that board.Judge: Indeed? What is this common thread, Counsel?Kazuma: They all relate to cases prosecuted in court by Barok van Zieks.Ryunosuke: All of them?Kazuma: And furthermore...all those cases are ones in which the defendant was acquitted.Judge: Good Lord!Kazuma: Interestingly, none of those defendants are alive today. Because all of them have been sent to their graves...by the Reaper.Ryunosuke: Ah!Susato: Oh no...Kazuma: In short! That dingy little room... ...is the Reaper's secret hideout...and his base of operations!Ryunosuke: The, the Reaper's hideout?!Kazuma: And yet the Reaper would claim never to have been to his own secret hideout? No one would believe that. No, the truth is...we've been looking at this backwards.Judge: Backwards? Explain, Counsel!Kazuma: Inspector Gregson was investigating the identity of the Reaper. When he discovered the location of the man's secret hideout...he was killed. As I'm sure everyone can imagine...by the Reaper's hand!Ryunosuke: Wha... WHAAAAAAAAAT?!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! Very well. I hereby state the current opinion of the court. Barok van Zieks is an outstanding prosecutor who has rendered great service to his country. However, it is with deep regret that I must concur with Prosecutor Asogi's contention... ...that the defendant's testimony exhibits a number of stark inconsistencies with the known facts.Van Zieks: All I have done is state the truth as I know it.Ryunosuke: (Kazuma's done a brilliant job as ever. He's drawing on his experience as a defence attorney to build his prosecution case...and it's formidable.)Judge: Counsel... ...you will submit the board that you just showed the court as evidence. I believe it to be fundamental in establishing the facts surrounding the Reaper's existence.Kazuma: Thank you, My Lord.The noticeboard has been entered into the Court Record.Kazuma: And now, the prosecution would like to call new witnesses to the stand. Witnesses who saw events unfold on the day in question.Examine evidence Noticeboard Front of board Susato: There are details of a whole raft of cases dating back years on here, aren't there? Ryunosuke: This paper from ten years ago is browning with age, look. Susato: Out of interest, the most recent thing appears to be this newspaper cutting here. Ryunosuke: Oh. It's the same Red-Headed League advertisement that Mr Sholmes had picked out. Susato: And do you remember? There was a red hairpiece at the scene, too. Ryunosuke: (Was Inspector Gregson an exponent of the Red-Headed League, then?) Bloody handprint on back Susato: ......... Oh. What's this...? Mr Naruhodo! Look! Ryunosuke: Oh yes. It's a smudge of some kind. In fact... ...it looks just like a handprint. Susato: And the colour... That's blood, isn't it? Oh dear... How disturbing... The details of the noticeboard have been updated in the Court Record. Bloody handprint on back (subsequent times) Susato: ......... Oh. What's this...? Mr Naruhodo! Look! Ryunosuke: Oh yes. It's a smudge of some kind. In fact... ...it looks just like a handprint. Susato: And the colour... That's blood, isn't it? Oh dear... How disturbing...Susato: They were mentioned in the previous testimony too, if you remember.Ryunosuke: Yes. The street sellers who heard the gunshot and went running into the room.Judge: Very well, lead the witnesses in! The defendant may step down from the witness stand.Van Zieks: Certainly, My Lord.Kazuma: So...witnesses. State your names and occupations for the court.???: Names?! We don't use names. Far too fancy for the likes of uz.???: We're just free an' easy. Sell what we like, live where we wanna live...???: I g-give them all a vacant stare as they w-walk down Fresno, and spin a few w-words into a verse for them.Judge: Ah... Would I be right in assuming that all three of you make your living by selling wares on the street?Gossip: Hehe, everyone calls me Gossip. I sell jaunty little titbits to passers-by, you know.Ryunosuke: Jaunty little titbits?Gossip: Got an absolute smasher for you, sir. Right up your ginnel, it is! Sixpence is the price, and not a penny less!Ryunosuke: ......... Wait! You're, you're actually trying to sell it to me now?Gossip: Oh, c'mon sir! Don't tell me you're not interested!Kazuma: Try the man.Susato: Give him the money and see what it is!Judge: Pay the man, Counsel.Ryunosuke: Alright, alright, sixpence it is.Gossip: You won't regret it, sir! Now, got your listenin' ears on? Just between uz...a young couple on Sleight Street have just had twins!Ryunosuke: .........Gossip: .........Ryunosuke: .........  Um...is that it?Gossip: No, that's not it. It's gossip, in't it? It wants to spread. But that bit's up to you and your mouth, of course. I've got more, you know. Want another juicy one? Sixpence a piece, it is. If you're curious...Ryunosuke: (I am curious, yes. About what's going on just under that fat bottom lip of yours. Namely that unusual bruise or whatever it is that's poking out from under your collar...)Kazuma: What about the next witness, then? What name do you go by and what do you sell?Venus: Me? I'm Venus. That's what everyone calls me. Funny, innit? I sell these lovely little fireworks to all the local school kids. Sixpence a pop! What d'you say?Ryunosuke: You weren't exaggerating with 'little'. Do they actually sell?Venus: Oh yeah. The second years can't get enough of my Venus firecrackers. 'Specially when I tell 'em that if they get a hundred they could blow up the school!Judge: Not the most savoury of ideas, young lady.Venus: What d'you say then, eh? Wanna part with sixpence for a pop?Ryunosuke: Wait, what?! You, you want me to buy one?Venus: Tell you what, I'll let you in on a little secret: If you get a hundred of 'em, you could blow up the whole courtroom!Kazuma: Try the woman.Susato: Give her the money and see if she's right!Judge: Pay the woman, Counsel.Ryunosuke: Alright, alright, I'll buy one.Venus: Lovely stuff! Right then...this is something a bit extra, just for you: The Venus Special! Only six 'undred pence!Ryunosuke: S-Six hundred!Venus: It's a hundred of my regular fireworks. Nothing 'little' about that, is there?Ryunosuke: (And there'd be nothing little about the punishment if I blew up the Old Bailey, either.)The Venus firecracker has been entered into the Court Record.Kazuma: And the last witness... What name do you go by and what do you sell?Examine evidence Venus Firecracker Fuse Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: Have you had an idea, Mr Naruhodo? You're staring at the end of the string of fireworks. Ryunosuke: Sorry. It's just that it's the 'Venus Special'. I was wondering what six hundred pence worth of fireworks would sound like. Susato: ......... Shall we find out? Ryunosuke: What? B-But...she said it could blow up the courtroom! ...*BANG!* Ryunosuke: ......... A-Alright, that was a fairly sizeable bang. Susato: My ears are still ringing, Mr Naruhodo. It sounded almost exactly like... The details of the Venus firecracker have been updated in the Court Record. Fuse (subsequent times) Ryunosuke: ......... Susato: Have you had an idea, Mr Naruhodo? You're staring at the end of the string of fireworks. Ryunosuke: Sorry. It's just that it's the 'Venus Special'. I was wondering what six hundred pence worth of fireworks would sound like. Susato: ......... Shall we find out? Ryunosuke: What? B-But...she said it could blow up the courtroom! ...*BANG!* Ryunosuke: ......... A-Alright, that was a fairly sizeable bang. Susato: My ears are still ringing, Mr Naruhodo. It sounded almost exactly like...???: I'm a th-thinker me. Think all sorts of thoughts. I think, therefore I am. I am, therefore I think...I think. Because I stand there on the street, w-watchin' the w-world go on about me, they call me 'The Observator'.Gossip: Get out if it, old man! Everyone calls you Sandwich and you know it.Kazuma: So...you don't actually sell anything?Sandwich: A p-p-problem shared is a problem halved, as they say. I give advice, I do. And think w-what it means. I d-don't actually sell anything, no...come to think of it.Kazuma: Pity.Ryunosuke: (No more purchases today...please.)Judge: Well, we have quite a cast here, it seems.Kazuma: They conduct their business on Fresno Street from morning until night, My Lord. And always in the same place: directly adjacent to the crime scene.Judge: I see. And thus they heard the gunshot, I suppose.Kazuma: Not only that, but they very bravely ran inside to see what was going on and witnessed the crime.Gossip: Well I'll be beggared, I thought! ...Just between uz.Venus: Venus de Milo, what am I to do? What a terrible thing I saw!Sandwich: W-What I think is...if all w-what we see is light and shadow, p-playing with our eyes...is any of it real?Judge: Very well. The court will hear the formal testimony of these three witnesses now. You will describe in detail what you witnessed and heard at the time of the incident.Witness Testimony - The Witnesses' Account -Gossip: We saw the whole thing from start to finish, we did. Everything from the moment they went in the building.Venus: It was less than a minute after the Reaper had gone inside that we all 'eard a big bang.Sandwich: Seems to m-me that quick-to-talk is quick-to-walk. Gossip couldn't wait to go and see what had happened.Gossip: I ran into the room and there he woz. The Reaper, gun in hand, standin' over the dead body!Venus: I was scared 'alf to death, me. So I ran off to find a copper.Ryunosuke: If these witnesses were there the whole day and saw everything... ...who did they see going inside the building?Kazuma: Only the victim, Inspector Gregson, and the accused, Barok van Zieks.Gossip: I've seen pictures of that Reaper in the paper. I know what he looks like. And just between uz...folk love stories like this. I've made meself a tidy sum already.Ryunosuke: But wait! The room was just one of several flats in the building. Someone from another flat could have done it!Kazuma: All those flats on Fresno Street are unoccupied.Gossip: 'Course they are. They're small, damp, dirty and expensive to boot.Kazuma: The room in which the inspector was found is the only property in the building that's currently leased.Susato: And we know the leaseholder's name, don't we. It's...Hugh Boone.Judge: Hmmm... The testimony the court has just heard would appear to leave little room for doubt. It's becoming increasingly difficult to see how anyone other than the defendant could have committed the crime.Ryunosuke: No!Kazuma: Thank you for your candour, My Lord.Judge: Counsel for the Defence, you may proceed to cross-examine the witnesses.Ryunosuke: Yes, My Lord! (In a closed court like this without a jury, the judge is the only person whose opinion matters. I have to break down this testimony. Somehow!)Cross-Examination - The Witnesses' Account -Gossip: We saw the whole thing from start to finish, we did. Everything from the moment they went in the building.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: When you say 'they', who do you mean exactly? Inspector Gregson and the defendant, Lord van Zieks? Gossip: I suppose so. The likes of uz don't know the names of the high and mighty. But I'll tell you one thing...it was the old Reaper that went in last, that's for sure and certain. Ryunosuke: Just behind Inspector Gregson? Did they arrive at the same time as each other? Gossip: No no, not at all! The first fella must have gone inside a good fifteen minutes before we heard that gunshot. Ryunosuke: The victim arrived fifteen minutes before?! Are you sure about that? Gossip: Am I sure? Am I sure?! Doz it seem likely that I'd have forgotten a fella with bright red hair like that, doz it? Venus: Yeah, 'is hair really were red, weren't it? Redder than my flamin' fireworks, even. Sandwich: That, that fiery red mop's still b-burnt on the inside of my eyelids, it is. Ryunosuke: Wait a minute! You're saying the man was a red-head? Gossip: Weren't you listenin', chum? Aye, he woz a red-head. And he had a big trunk with him, as well. Susato: But Inspector Gregson's hair isn't red. Not by any stretch of the imagination! Ryunosuke: It seems likely that the person you saw wasn't in fact Inspector Gregson at all, but some other third party. Kazuma: No. I hate to break it to you, but the witnesses are correct. Ryunosuke: What?! Kazuma: Just have a look at this photograph of the victim taken at the scene. Ryunosuke: Y-Yes, that's... (That's Inspector Gregson alright.) Susato: And...a red hairpiece. Ryunosuke: Ah! Susato: Of course! We saw one on the floor when we investigated the scene, didn't we? Ryunosuke: I still refuse to believe Inspector Gregson wore a hairpiece, though... (So then why on earth would he have been wearing something like that?) Judge: Hm...the colour does seem to suit the man, one might say... The photograph will be submitted as evidence, please, Counsel. The photograph of the victim has been entered into the Court Record. Ryunosuke: And what became of the trunk that the red-headed victim was supposedly carrying? Kazuma: ...I was informed that no trunk was found at the scene. Ryunosuke: (So it just disappeared?) Gossip: What, do you expect uz to have been watchin' the buildin' every second, do you? Venus: We definitely saw 'im in the dock goin' in, though. No question about that!Press (subsequent times) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: When you say 'they', who do you mean exactly? Inspector Gregson and the defendant, Lord van Zieks? Gossip: I suppose so. The likes of uz don't know the names of the high and mighty. But I'll tell you one thing...it was the old Reaper that went in last, that's for sure and certain. Ryunosuke: Just behind Inspector Gregson? Did they arrive at the same time as each other? Gossip: No no, not at all!

Venus: We definitely saw 'im in the dock goin' in, though. No question about that!Venus: It was less than a minute after the Reaper had gone inside that we all 'eard a big bang.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: By which presumably you mean the gunshot? Venus: I sell these little things, don't I? How would I know what a gunshot sounds like? But I've always thought it probably sounds a bit like this... doesn't it? Ryunosuke: And you say that you heard the noise almost as soon as you saw the defendant here enter the building? Venus: That's right. It was almost straight away. 'Bang!' it went. Just like that. Gossip: Well he's the Reaper, in't he? It's what the French call a fait accompli. When the Reaper's around, people are goin' in the ground! I mean, that's what he doz, in't it? Ryunosuke: I think we get the message. Kazuma: The Reaper couldn't allow the inspector to live after he'd discovered his secret hideout. There can be no clearer motive for the crime. Judge: Hmmm...yes... It's certainly an eminently credible motive. Ryunosuke: (Great.) Kazuma: And at that point, you ran inside. Is that correct?Sandwich: Seems to m-me that quick-to-talk is quick-to-walk. Gossip couldn't wait to go and see what had happened.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So, when Gossip ran to see what had happened, did you go, too? Sandwich: W-Well me... I'm a b-bit hampered, see. All the signs are that, that I c-can't move very well. Kazuma: You were a way behind, presumably. With that sandwich board around your neck and that big sign in your hand. Ryunosuke: ...What a great burden you bear. Pardon me for asking, Mr, erm...Sandwich, but... ...is it possible you and I have met before? Sandwich: ...! I-I'm not anybody, me. The signs are w-what make me who I am right now. I sign, therefore I am. Ryunosuke: So...you weren't employed as an omnibus driver just under a year ago then? Sandwich: ......... Susato: I might be mistaken, but I believe his trembling has intensified, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Yes, I agree. He's clearly been through a lot. Sandwich: 'Turn down King Henry Street and the Black Widowers Arms is just there.' Susato: Oh dear. You've made him hide behind his sign. Ryunosuke: (Life is full of surprises...)Gossip: I ran into the room and there he woz. The Reaper, gun in hand, standin' over the dead body!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So then you were the first person to arrive on the scene. Is that right? Gossip: That I woz! Kicked the door open like a professional, I did! And yelled out, 'What's goin' off 'ere?!' Susato: Lord van Zieks claims all he heard was a man's scream, though. Ryunosuke: And was it dark inside the room? Gossip: No, not dark at all! There were candles burnin' on the wall. Ryunosuke: Really?! Gossip: And there was a fella collapsed on the floor. Just between uz...it's the first thing I noticed when I got inside. Ryunosuke: Ah. I, I see... (Even though Lord van Zieks claims not to have seen any such lights on the wall...) Gossip: The next thing I noticed was someone standin' right beside the body. Kazuma: The accused, Barok van Zieks... Gossip: That's right! The pale-faced Reaper himself! I woz a little shocked, I won't deny it. But I'm no lily-livered coward. I stood my ground and gave that Reaper a cold, hard stare myself! Pursue \"Sandwich\" (after pressing first statement) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Do you have something to add, Mr Sandwich?! Sandwich: ......... There's, there's really n-n-nothing to me. Empty in the head, I am. Just two slices with no middle. S-So I don't know what you could w-w-want with me. Ryunosuke: I think that maybe you just remembered something? Having heard Mr Gossip's last statement, I mean. Sandwich: W-What I think is...we're all nothings really. We try to d-dress ourselves up as something else, but at the end of the day, w-we're all just street sellers. Gossip: That's enough out of you, Sandwich. Keep your trap shut now. Unless you want uz to make you into a real sandwich! Sandwich: W-When he saw the Reaper, he f-f-fell clean over on his backside! Ryunosuke: ...That's it? Gossip: Oh, you rotten beggar! I told you to keep that a secret! Sandwich: He screamed, he did. Screamed and s-scrambled off on all fours. ...That's all I w-w-wanted to say. Ryunosuke: Mr Gossip! Is this true? Gossip: The floor was dead slippery, that's why. Planted my hand in a filthy pool of blood, didn't I? Yuck! Ryunosuke: Wha...?! (A pool of blood?) Gossip: But listen here! Even when I woz sprawled on the floor... ...I still kept giving that Reaper a cold, hard stare! And don't you forget it! Ryunosuke: Let's just go back a little. Did you say you got blood on your hand? Gossip: I, I did, aye. Happens to the best of uz at times, dozn't it? So I was scared! So I slipped over! ...We can keep it just between uz, can't we? Ryunosuke: No, Mr Gossip! I'm going to have to ask you to add that information to your formal testimony. Gossip: Oh... If I must. Judge: The witness will amend his testimony to include the aforementioned details at once. Kazuma: ......... Changes statement from \"I ran into the room and there he woz. The Reaper, gun in hand, standin' over the dead body!\" to \"I slipped over and got blood on my hand, so I quickly wiped it off on the floor.\" Ryunosuke: And was there anyone else in the room at the time? Gossip: No, of course not. Not at first. But then this old stiff came waddlin' along behind me, of course. Only him, mind. Sandwich: I, I can't handle stairs so well, as you can imagine. Especially on the w-w-way up. Ryunosuke: And you couldn't have just failed to see someone? Gossip: It was a bit dingy in there, I grant you. But there were the candles on the wall. And the lamp on the table. Sandwich: There was n-nowhere anyone c-could have been hiding. You m-mark my eyes! Ryunosuke: (Ugh...)Gossip: I slipped over and got blood on my hand, so I quickly wiped it off on the floor.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You wiped your hand on the floor? Gossip: Well...who wants blood on his hand, eh? Horrible stuff. And they might have thought I'd done it. Hmph! No ta! Ryunosuke: And you didn't think that might be a problem? Gossip: Doz it really matter if I left a few grubby handprints on the floor? They'll get cleaned up in the end, won't they? Don't make such a fuss, that's the message from all of uz! Kazuma: ......... Judge: Is something wrong, Counsel? Kazuma: No, My Lord. I didn't remember anything in the report about a bloody handprint on the floor, that's all. Gossip: D-Don't come at me with all that! You can't intimidate me! I know what I did! I wiped it off! On the floor! The blood! Ryunosuke: ......... (I wonder... Could that be what happened...?) Susato: Mr Naruhodo? Ryunosuke: I don't have all the answers yet... ...but I think we may have just uncovered a vital clue!Present Noticeboard (after examining bloody handprint on back) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"So you wiped off the blood from your hand on the floor of the room...\"Venus: I was scared 'alf to death, me. So I ran off to find a copper.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So you didn't run into the room with your friends? Venus: ......... I'm not that sort of girl. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Venus: I'm a timid little thing, me. I was too scared to go in there. Ryunosuke: Ah, right... I see. Venus: Old Lippy and the 'Wich ran in there, an' then I 'eard a sort of old lady scream. Gossip: Well that wozn't me, I swear. If I were a gentleman, I'd stake my honour on it. Venus: I wondered what on earth was goin' on. Ryunosuke: Which is when you went to find a policeman? Venus: And I ran into a copper as soon as I turned the corner. So I brought him straight back to the place. ...Didn't I do well, eh? Gossip: Just between uz...that copper's eyes nearly popped out of his head when he saw the Reaper. Sandwich: I've n-n-never felt more uncomfortable in, in all my life. Judge: And the defendant was arrested on the spot, I believe. Kazuma: Considering the catalogue of killings the Reaper had carried out... ...it was a particularly inauspicious end.Ryunosuke: (...If I can't find any holes in this testimony...)Susato: I'm afraid the judge will give a ruling of guilty, Mr Naruhodo.Ryunosuke: (The truth is, though, their combined testimony is fairly damning.)Susato: Unfortunately, there don't seem to be any obvious problems with their statements, do there?Ryunosuke: Still...if Lord van Zieks really is innocent, then I'm almost certain... ...that we'll find something in there that doesn't quite add up.Susato: You don't think... ...that one of these three could be the true culprit, do you?Ryunosuke: I don't know. But what I do know... ...is that there's more to this case that has yet to be brought to light!Ryunosuke: So you wiped off the blood from your hand on the floor of the room... Are you quite sure about that?Gossip: Well, well what else d'you expect me to have done, eh? Doz it really matter?Kazuma:Kazuma: The police found no such handprint on the floor during their investigations. What exactly is the defence asserting?!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: If you listen, you'll find out...Prosecutor Asogi.Kazuma: ...!Ryunosuke: Certainly, there was no bloody handprint found...on the floor.Kazuma: What are you trying to say?Ryunosuke: There was a handprint in blood left very clearly at the scene... ...on the back of this noticeboard.Gossip: Ah...ah...AAAAAAAAAAAAH!Judge: Ah yes, indeed. Indisputably a handprint in the distinctive colour of blood.Gossip: Aye, you're dead right! That's my right hand! I'd know it anywhere!Kazuma:Kazuma: The witness very definitely testified that he wiped his hand on the floor. Any handprints on the back of the board are irrelevant!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: Not if the board itself had fallen over onto the floor. In that case, it's quite possible for the witness's handprint to have ended up there.Kazuma: ...Just look at the floor plan of the room. The noticeboard was in the opposite corner of the room to the victim, and in an upright position. Even if it had somehow been toppled and was lying on the floor at the time... ...it would have been a considerable distance from the body.Gossip: I fell over when I came across the body. So I woz basically right next to the corpse. Not on the other side of the room!Kazuma: In other words, the defence's assertion is contradictory!Ryunosuke: Yes...it is.Kazuma: ...!Ryunosuke: There's a very definite contradiction here...for which there must be a reason.Judge: I take it that you've formulated a proper hypothesis, Counsel? Regarding this apparent discrepancy between the witness's account and the handprint found at the scene.Ryunosuke: I have, My Lord. This discrepancy between the witness's account and the location of the handprint is explained by...Another handprint Ryunosuke: If Mr Gossip ended up with blood on his hand and wiped it off on the floor as he says... ...it must have left behind a mark somewhere. Just as a mark has been left behind on the back of the noticeboard. Kazuma: Kazuma: The prosecution has already established that the handprint on the board is irrelevant. Ryunosuke: Exactly! Which means there must be another handprint somewhere! Kazuma: No! The police report made no mention of a handprint anywhere on the floor! And I understand that you've examined the scene in person, too. If you'd come across something the police had missed... how do you explain the cold sweat? Judge: Quite. The defence counsel's cold sweat is a sure indication that a penalty is due. Ryunosuke: That sweat was just from the warm-up. Kazuma: What? Ryunosuke: There should be a bloody handprint on the floor. So where did it go...? I'm ready to give the proper explanation to the court now, My Lord! Leads back to: \"I take it that you've formulated a proper hypothesis, Counsel?\"The board moving Leads to: \"The real contradiction here is the handprint itself, not where it was found.\"False testimony Ryunosuke: The witness claims to have wiped his bloody hand on the floor, yet no sign of that remains at the scene. The simplest explanation is that the witness is lying. Kazuma: Kazuma: Just because it's the simplest explanation doesn't make it the correct one...Ryunosuke Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Ah. Kazuma: Positing perjury simply because it suits you... You bring shame on your Japanese heritage! Ryunosuke: AAAAAAAAARGH! Judge: I would ask you not to oversimplify matters again, Counsel. Kazuma: I don't remember fostering that kind of simplistic thinking in you. Ryunosuke: ...Since when were you my father? Anyway, I was always taught to consider all possibilities. Kazuma: Then show me. Ryunosuke: There should be a bloody handprint on the floor. So where did it go...? I'm ready to give the proper explanation to the court now, My Lord! Leads back to: \"I take it that you've formulated a proper hypothesis, Counsel?\"Ryunosuke: The real contradiction here is the handprint itself, not where it was found. As the court can see...it's upside down.Judge: Good gracious! So it is! If the witness had put his hand against the board, the fingers should be pointing upwards.Kazuma: What, what does that tell us?Ryunosuke: It tells one simple fact! When this handprint was made... ...the board must have been lying on the floor as I previously suggested. Which means that after the incident...it must have been moved!Kazuma: What?!Kazuma:Kazuma: You're claiming that somebody moved the noticeboard after the shooting? Then tell the court who!Ryunosuke: I, I don't know that yet! But the point is... ...when you consider all the testimony we've heard so far, we can now be very clear on one point!Judge: And that would be...?Ryunosuke: The position of the noticeboard at the time of the incident, My Lord.Judge: So, Counsel, I must ask you to clarify your assertion for the court. At the time of the incident, where do you maintain the noticeboard was situated?Present area between doorway and victim Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"This is the only possible location!\"Present anywhere else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: It was right here, My Lord! Judge: Goodness! Hm, no...I'm afraid I don't quite see your logic. Kazuma: I'm disappointed, Ryunosuke. In Japan, we're taught to have patience and respect for our elders. So until His Lordship sees your logic, you will know your place and not move from that spot! Ryunosuke: UAAAAAAGH! Susato: How brilliant of Kazuma-sama! That almost sounded unreasonable at first, but he was just thinking of you. Ryunosuke: Unreasonable? Try unfathomable. Anyway, I think I have the answer now. I know my place! ...Or rather, I know the board's place! Leads back to: \"So, Counsel, I must ask you to clarify your assertion for the court.\"Ryunosuke: This is the only possible location!Judge: Immediately adjacent to the doorway...?Ryunosuke: If the court would think back to the testimony given by the defendant earlier... ...he said that when he entered the room it was dark, and he couldn't see the body.Gossip: By 'eck!Ryunosuke: If the noticeboard had been here, the body would have been completely hidden from view. And the light from the candles would have been blocked, making the room appear darker.Kazuma:Kazuma: But the accused also claims that the victim's body simply 'appeared' before him.Susato: That's true. Or, in his precise words...Van Zieks: Just as I picked the firearm up to examine it, the door flew open and I heard a man scream. It was only then that the body of Inspector Gregson appeared before me.Gossip: I don't know about callin' it a 'scream', but he woz talkin' about me and no mistake. Cos it woz me that kicked the door open.Ryunosuke: If you look again at the floor plan... ...consider what would happen if the door to the room was thrown open with force.Kazuma: That, that can't...Ryunosuke: The door struck the noticeboard, knocking it over, and making the victim's body visible.Judge: Good gracious!Ryunosuke: My client has told nothing but the truth! He has simply described what he saw.Kazuma: Argh!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Counsel, how has this not come to light before now?Ryunosuke: After the incident, somebody must have righted the board and moved it... ...into the position where the police, myself and my colleague saw it when investigating the room.Judge: Witness! What have you to say for yourself?Gossip: Whaaaaaat? Me, My Lord?Ryunosuke: You and your fellows were there at the scene before anybody else. It goes without saying that you must know something about the position of the noticeboard!Judge: The witnesses in the stand will testify again. You will each explain exactly what you did upon arriving at the scene of the crime!Gossip: Eh, stop lookin' over your glasses at me! I get the message.Witness Testimony - The Mystery of the Moving Board -Gossip: I don't know anythin' about that there noticeboard! I just wiped my hand on it, that's all.Venus: Well don't look at me. I 'aven't got a clue about it. I was doin' business with some second years at the time.Sandwich: I, I don't know anything about anything. I'm j-just a bystander, me. J-Just a sign at the crossroads of life.Gossip: It woz that Reaper, I bet. He's got a face that screams 'board'.Sandwich: I c-can't see how this changes anything anyway. The detective still died w-when we heard the gunshot.Judge: Hmmm... So none of you can elaborate further...Kazuma: Shaken by the crime they witnessed, and with only the light of a few candles and an oil lamp by which to see... ...we can't expect these witnesses to be able to give a more precise account of what happened.Venus: That's right, yeah. It don't pay to expect too much.Sandwich: It's m-man's endless quest for knowledge that's d-d-destroying the world. That's w-what I think.Ryunosuke: ...Do you? Really.Kazuma: In any case, as the testimony shows... ...even if the noticeboard was moved by somebody following the incident, it makes no difference. When the gunshot rang out, the accused was the only person at the scene.Ryunosuke: ...!Kazuma: In short, the only person who could possibly have committed this crime...is Barok van Zieks! None of this wrangling over the board changes that simple fact.Judge: Quite so, quite so. Does the defence still wish to cross-examine the witnesses despite the circumstances?Ryunosuke: Most certainly, My Lord.Judge: Very well. Then you may proceed, Counsel.Cross-Examination - The Mystery of the Moving Board -Gossip: I don't know anythin' about that there noticeboard! I just wiped my hand on it, that's all.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: So you admit that it was the board you wiped your bloody hand on? Gossip: Admit it? What's to admit? It's there plain as day for all to see: a smashing print of my right hand! Ryunosuke: Perhaps you wanted to hide that handprint... ...so you righted the noticeboard and pushed it into the corner, did you? Gossip: No no! Imagine the weight of that great lump! Do I look like a powerful and well-nurtured man? Ryunosuke: Well did you see anybody else moving the board? Gossip: I've got nerves of steel, I can tell you, but even I have my limits. There woz a body on the floor in front of me, and the grim Reaper himself standin' over it. And there woz precious little light inside, either. My bottom lip was all aquiver. Kazuma: In other words...this witness is unable to give definite testimony on that point. Judge: Hm, yes...so it would seem.Venus: Well don't look at me. I 'aven't got a clue about it. I was doin' business with some second years at the time.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: When you say you were doing business with them, you mean you were selling them fireworks? Venus: Yeah, what else? There's the Priory School just round the corner, see. Those cheeky little so-and-sos 'ave got a plan to blow their school to kingdom come. Ryunosuke: Haah... Venus: So I've been tellin' on them. Lettin' their teachers know what they're up to. Ryunosuke: Oh...you have? Venus: Yeah, wouldn't want anyone to get 'urt. So I let the school know the kids are playin' with dodgy toys. Then - praise the Lord - the teachers take all the fireworks off 'em. And then - praise the Lord again - the kids all come back to me to buy more. Everyone's 'appy, see? Ryunosuke: ...What a racket. Venus: 'Course. And sometimes the teachers give me a little bonus to thank me for lettin' 'em know. It's a busy old life, sellin' explosives. Judge: Venus is a guileful goddess indeed... Venus: Well, tellin' bare-faced lies is kind of my thing, really. I'm ever so good at it. Pursue \"Sandwich\" Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Something wrong, Mr Sandwich? Sandwich: If, if I said it was, could we just l-leave it at that? Would that be the end of it? Ryunosuke: Um...no. Did Miss Venus's statement just now bring something to mind, perhaps? Sandwich: ......... Philosophical thoughts. Deep, philosophical thoughts. Ryunosuke: Hm? Sandwich: L-Let's say there was a great liar. And that g-great liar said, without batting an eye... 'Tellin' bare-faced lies is kind of my thing. I'm ever so good at it.' W-Would those words of hers be a lie, too? Or the truth? In which case...she's n-not a liar. Ooh, it's a h-hellish paradox, that one. Don't you think? Ryunosuke: ......... I'm not entirely sure, to be honest. But...it seems to me you're suggesting Miss Venus has been lying...are you? Sandwich: .................. Venus: What are you on about, old man? Tryin' to cause trouble, are you? Keep on like that... ...and I'll wrap your whole body in firecrackers and set 'em off. That'll give you somethin' to tremble about! Judge: You have a startlingly disturbing mind behind that sweet and innocent face, young lady. Ryunosuke: So Miss Venus HAS lied in her testimony! Is that what you're saying, Mr Sandwich? Sandwich: ......... Well...if it m-means I'll be burnin' in hellfire for the r-rest of my days...so be it. Yes, that's what I'm saying. Kazuma: Can you elaborate, please, sir? Sandwich: ......... Old b-blabbermouth here headed for the r-room where the g-gunshot seemed to come from... ...but there w-w-was someone else who crept up the stairs b-behind him, too. That's right! That rotten liar over there! Venus: Heh heh... Ryunosuke: ......... Kazuma: ......... Judge: Do you mean to say... ...that you did in fact betake yourself to the scene of the crime after all? Venus: ......... What did I tell you, eh? I said I was good at tellin' bare-faced lies, didn't I? Ryunosuke: (Yes, you mentioned it...) Susato: Well... ...that revelation rocked the whole courtroom, didn't it? Ryunosuke: Who knew firecrackers packed such a punch? Judge: So you did indeed visit the scene of the crime, did you, young lady? Good grief! Venus: Well, now you come to mention it... ...I suppose perhaps I do clearly remember climbin' the stairs to the room, yeah. Ryunosuke: Either you clearly remember it or you don't. Judge: Well...I shall consider a fitting punishment for this perjurious act later. For the time being, you will immediately amend your testimony to reflect the truth! Venus: Oh yes, My Lord. Of course! Changes statement from \"Well don't look at me. I 'aven't got a clue about it. I was doin' business with some second years at the time.\" to \"Maybe I did sneak along behind Gossip and 'ave a little peek into the room where it all 'appened.\" Ryunosuke: (Ugh...scary.) Kazuma: ...The important point is, you didn't go inside the room where the inspector was killed, isn't that right? Venus: Definitely not. Wouldn't 'ave dreamed of it, would I?Venus: Maybe I did sneak along behind Gossip and 'ave a little peek into the room where it all 'appened.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You make a habit of lying, do you, Miss Venus? Venus: Well...I s'pose so. ...I don't really know, to be fair. If you want my advice, though, I'd take everythin' I say with a big pinch of salt. Ryunosuke: Alright, but you did in fact go to the room where the victim was killed on the day in question, didn't you? Venus: Oh, please! As if I would! I can't think of anythin' more terrifyin'! Kazuma: The truth, please. Venus: Well alright, just a bit then. I mean, a girl my age is curious about stuff, ya know! Ryunosuke: Did you touch anything at the scene? Venus: Oh, please! As if I would! I mean, there was a dead body on the floor! Kazuma: The truth, please. Venus: Well alright, just a bit then. I 'ad a look to see if there was anythin' I could sell. So I did give the place a once-over. But it was nothin' to write 'ome about. Ryunosuke: Right. Now, I hesitate to ask, but... ...you didn't move the noticeboard by any chance, did you? Venus: Oh, please! As if I would touch anythin' like that! Just a few bits of loose change is all I 'ad! Kazuma: The truth, please. Venus: Well alright then. I thought there might be somethin' worth 'avin' underneath it. So I blasted the flippin' thing- Sorry, flipped the blasted thing. Ryunosuke: ...! Kazuma: ...! Judge: ...! Kazuma: You're, you're telling us... ...that you DID move that board?! Venus: I think that did slip out, didn't it? Gossip: Wha...? You daft barmpot! Sandwich: I, I don't believe it... The girl doesn't think. Ryunosuke: So! Did you find anything then? Something that you might have taken, perhaps? To sell? Venus: Oh, please! I should be so lucky! In my imagination- Kazuma: The TRUTH now! Venus: ...I might 'ave found this old pocket watch under the noticeboard, I s'pose. But a bit o' junk like this can't be worth much, if you ask- ???: AAAAAAAAAH! Gina: So it was you, was it? You're the one wot took it! Ryunosuke: G-Gina?! Judge: Young lady! May I remind you where you are?! Gina: That watch... That watch there... That was a present to Inspector Gregson from the Yard for a big case 'e solved ten years ago! Susato: The Professor case, no doubt. Gina: The boss used to wind it up every evenin' wivout fail when 'e was waitin' for 'is grub to come at the pub. Ryunosuke: ...I see. Gina: I swiped it off 'im once an' blimey was 'e upset! 'E gave me a right earful. Said 'e 'adn't missed a day in the last ten years, polishin' it an' windin' it. It meant the world to 'im, that watch did. Ryunosuke: (Possibly not the best thing to go diving for, then...) Venus: It's not all that, though. I took it to Jabez's that night to ask 'ow much it was worth. But the old dealer wouldn't touch it. Wouldn't give me a penny for it. Said it wasn't workin'. Knocked about and worthless he called it. Gina: Agh! I knew I should've lifted it! Kazuma: That watch must be submitted as evidence at once! Venus: Oh, please! Just, just so long as you promise to give it back when we're done! Gina: Not a chance! I'll swipe it from ya if you try to get your grubby mitts on it again! Judge: That's enough. Hand the watch to the bailiff forthwith! Ryunosuke: (Now now, children, watch your manners...) Judge: ......... Good Lord! The glass appears to be broken. Kazuma: More than likely, it shattered when the inspector was shot. Venus: It doesn't tick any more, either. Which is why Jabez didn't want it. What a waste, eh? Judge: Yes, indeed. It appears to have stopped at the hour of five. Ryunosuke: (Exactly when the gunshot was heard, then...) Susato: Which supports the prosecution's claim, of course... Gregson's pocket watch has been entered into the Court Record. Judge: Well, it would appear that the mystery of the moving noticeboard has been solved at least. Kazuma: And as predicted, it had very little bearing on the case. Ryunosuke: Ugh... Judge: Now then, continue with your cross-examination, please, Counsel.Press (subsequent times) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You...certainly know how to lie... Venus: Oh, it was nothin' really. Just a little porky. Ryunosuke: With not-so-little implications... Venus: Did you know? Everythin' in the world apart from the truth is a big fat lie! ...If you believe that, of course. Ryunosuke: ...I'm lost. Judge: As am I. This desecration of the truth is really rather disturbing. I think perhaps we should move on to the next witness, hm?Examine evidence Gregson's Pocket Watch Cracked glass Ryunosuke: The glass over the face really is badly cracked, look. Susato: What a shame when the inspector clearly looked after it so carefully. Ryunosuke: I imagine Mr Sholmes could repair it, don't you? Susato: Yes, I should think so. Ryunosuke: (He's very adept at things like this. A useful man to have around, in fact.) Susato: But kindly remember that he's a great detective, Mr Naruhodo! Not an odd-job man. Stub on top Ryunosuke: There's a tiny little stub sticking out from this small hole here, look. Susato: I suppose there must have been a little knob or something on that for setting the time. Ryunosuke: In that case, seeing as we know the inspector took such good care of this watch... ...it probably broke when the incident occurred, didn't it? Susato: Yes! Of course! Ryunosuke: Which could mean that there's a small part of the watch still at the scene, maybe... Keyhole at bottom Ryunosuke: Ah... There's a tiny little keyhole here. Can you see? Susato: Oh yes. That's probably for the winder used to wind up the mechanism. Ryunosuke: It looks a little unusual, don't you think? Susato: Yes, you'd need just the right key to wind it, I imagine. Ryunosuke: ......... (Why do I feel as though I've seen something...? Something a bit like a key that's about the right size to fit in this hole...) Susato: It would be wonderful if we had the key... Let's check carefully over what we've already found. Keyhole at bottom (after examining key on Policeman Figurine) Ryunosuke: So this is where the little policeman figurine's key goes in to wind the watch. Winding it up every single day for ten years without fail... Susato: Yes, it was obviously a thing of great importance to the inspector. Ryunosuke: (Or a reminder of the past, lest he forget...) Policeman Figurine Head of figurine, then key (after examining keyhole on Gregson's Pocket Watch) Ryunosuke: Miss Susato! Do you think perhaps this key... ...could be the key for Inspector Gregson's watch? Susato: Oh! Yes, it could be! Let's try it at once! There's not a moment to lose! Ryunosuke: (I knew it! A perfect fit!) Susato: And look! The inspector's watch has started going again! Ryunosuke: Ah, so it has obviously just not been wound up, that's all. Susato: ......... Ryunosuke: What is it, Miss Susato? Susato: Well...if the watch isn't actually broken after all... ...I have a feeling it could have profound implications! ......... Ryunosuke: (She's deep in thought now. Perhaps I'd better start thinking deeply, too...) The details of Gregson's pocket watch have been updated in the Court Record. Key (subsequent times) Ryunosuke: So this is the little key used to wind the inspector's pocket watch. Susato: It was a mystery at first. Why it should be a policeman, I mean. But it's because it was a gift from Scotland Yard, in recognition of Inspector Gregson's hard work. Ryunosuke: ...If its head did fall off from overuse, it might seem a little inappropriate, don't you think? Susato: That's...the British sense of humour for you, I think. Head of figurine (after examining key) Susato: The helmet of this charming policeman appears to be a little worse for wear. Ryunosuke: I'm not convinced about the 'charming' part, but yes, you're right... ...the head part looks like it's been fairly heavily manhandled. Which stands to reason, really, doesn't it? I mean, it gets turned around and around every day. Susato: ...I hope it doesn't fall off in the end.Sandwich: I, I don't know anything about anything. I'm j-just a bystander, me. J-Just a sign at the crossroads of life.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But...you did go to see what had happened in the room, didn't you? Sandwich: Fresno Street is my whole w-w-world. It's all I know. And I know all of it. I have to make it my b-business to know, if I want to h-hold my sign up high. Kazuma: So you did go to see what had happened. Sandwich: It's not the d-destination that's important...it's h-how you get there, isn't it? Ryunosuke: Did you notice the noticeboard in the room? Sandwich: ...If you think about it, we're b-both the same species, aren't we? Both different members of the sign family. So if I'd spotted it, I m-might have tried to t-trip it up out of a sense of rivalry, I admit. Ryunosuke: (Someone really needs to tell you that you're Homo sapiens not Homo signiens...) Kazuma: Does that mean that you didn't notice the board? Sandwich: I, I can only r-r-repeat what I said before: I, I don't know anything about anything. I'm j-just a bystander, me. J-Just a sign at the crossroads of life. Judge: ...In which case, just who was responsible for moving the noticeboard?Gossip: It woz that Reaper, I bet. He's got a face that screams 'board'.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What exactly do you mean by that? Gossip: Oh, come on now, don't tell uz you've not noticed. He looks like he hates everythin' in the world, that fella. But not noticeboards. They're the one thing he likes. You can see it in his eyes. Ryunosuke: ...I can't say I'd ever noticed. Gossip: I'll tell you one thing for free, though: I never took my eyes off that man on the floor. Or off the Reaper. Not for a second. Ryunosuke: Sorry? Gossip: Well, I was that scared, I couldn't. You never know what a fiend like that might do if you look away, do you? Ryunosuke: ......... If you didn't take your eyes off the defendant... ...you should be able to confirm categorically whether or not he was the one who moved the noticeboard. Gossip: ......... Aye, that I can. The Reaper did nothin' of the sort. I can swear to that! I couldn't have missed it if he'd heaved the thing upright again and dragged it into the corner! Ryunosuke: Right...glad we've cleared that up. Kazuma: What happened to the face that screams 'board'? Ryunosuke: (I feel your pain, Kazuma.)Sandwich: I c-can't see how this changes anything anyway. The detective still died w-when we heard the gunshot.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: ...It was five o'clock in the afternoon that you all heard the loud bang, wasn't it? Sandwich: Maybe the n-noticeboard fell over, or maybe it d-didn't. Maybe I fell over, or m-m-maybe I didn't... But the Reaper's f-fate is sealed either way, because of that gunshot w-we all heard. So your fate's sealed, too. Ryunosuke: My fate?! Kazuma: That's right. The defence is fated to lose. And the prosecution to win. Ryunosuke: (In other words, it all hinges on that single gunshot. So if I could just find some problem with that part of their story...) Susato: It may be possible to change all our fates! Sandwich: Of course...n-none of that changes the fact that I heard what I heard...does it?Present Gregson's Pocket Watch (after examining keyhole on Gregson's Pocket Watch, then examining key on Policeman Figurine) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"I'm afraid that's not necessarily the case.\"Ryunosuke: (Not much to go on...)Susato: As you've pointed out, Mr Naruhodo... ...there's no question that the noticeboard was moved. So somebody must have done it.Ryunosuke: But it did happen after the event, so... ...maybe Kazuma is right and it's not relevant to the case.Susato: But it seems to have been deliberately positioned so as to hide the body from view. So I feel sure that there's some deeper significance to all of this.Ryunosuke: Yes, I know what you mean.Susato: I've no doubt there are more clues to be uncovered. You're on the right track, I can feel it. So follow your instincts!Ryunosuke: ...Alright, then.Ryunosuke: I'm afraid that's not necessarily the case.Sandwich: Oh...Ryunosuke: At the scene, we found this key to the winder of the inspector's pocket watch.Kazuma: A key...?Ryunosuke: And having wound the pocket watch, we discovered that it in fact still works. You see, the watch didn't stop because it was broken at all. And that fact... ...completely undermines one of the most fundamental premises on which this entire case has been built!Kazuma: What?!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! B-But Counsel... ...the watch was stopped at almost exactly five o'clock.Venus: Yeah, which is just when we 'eard that gunshot.Gossip: It is. Exactly the hour.Ryunosuke: The time that was showing on the watch tells us nothing other than when it wound down. It's merely a coincidence that it happened to be at five o'clock.Kazuma:Kazuma: Even if that's true... ...the three witnesses here all heard the gunshot at five o'clock. So that's obviously when this crime was committed!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: No, that doesn't hold!Kazuma: Why not?Ryunosuke: Recall what Inspector Lestrade said only moments ago:Gina: The boss used to wind it up every evenin' wivout fail when 'e was waitin' for 'is grub to come at the pub. Said 'e 'adn't missed a day in the last ten years, polishin' it an' windin' it. It meant the world to 'im, that watch did.Ryunosuke: The victim was in the habit of winding his watch once a day...in the evening. We can reasonably assume, therefore, that he wound the timepiece on the evening before he died as well.Judge: Yes, that would be entirely reasonable.Ryunosuke: But if that's the case... ...you wouldn't expect the watch to have completely wound down by five o'clock the following day.Gossip: Oh! Aye...Venus: Well 'ow do you explain it then?!Ryunosuke: In summary, the evening before the day of the incident, when the gunshot rang out in that room... ...the inspector was already unable to wind his watch.Kazuma: You, you can't mean...Ryunosuke: What would stop a man winding his watch if he's been in the habit of winding it every single evening for ten years? The obvious answer...is that he was already dead!Judge: Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! Counsel, that is a most extraordinary claim!Kazuma:Kazuma: Extraordinary isn't the word! It's absurd! You claim he was already dead the night before? Do you really think that Scotland Yard's coroner would have overlooked something like that?!Ryunosuke: Ah! W-Well, um...Susato: On that subject, there is something rather surprising... There's actually an omission in the coroner's report. The time of death is not noted.Ryunosuke: Ah! That's, that's right!Gossip: Wait a minute! You're forgetting that my legs went from under me when I kicked the door in.Ryunosuke: What do you mean?Gossip: Like I said, I planted my hand in a dirty great puddle of blood.Kazuma: Yes. So the victim's blood hadn't dried. It was fresh.Gossip: He catches on fast, dozn't he?Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: But that blood could be explained in any number of ways! It could have been put there afterwards. Some fresh blood could have been poured over the victim's body after he-Kazuma:Kazuma: Does my learned friend think that fresh blood is available on every street corner?Ryunosuke: Ah!Susato: Well, it needn't necessarily have been human blood, of course.Kazuma: ...!Susato: We've been told previously that Scotland Yard has no way to identify blood as human.Judge: The problem is currently being researched. At present, you are correct. It is beyond our abilities.Ryunosuke: So then...a chicken's blood could have been used, for example.Susato: It's certainly a possibility that it wasn't the inspector's blood at all.Kazuma:Kazuma: But the gunshot was heard at five o'clock that afternoon. That's beyond question!Ryunosuke: Is it, though?Kazuma: What?!Ryunosuke: Given that the time of death of the victim has already been called into question... ...it isn't beyond the realms of possibility that what these witnesses heard wasn't a gunshot at all.Venus: Oh, please! What are you tryin' to say?Gossip: Uz lot know what we heard! And it woz a loud bang that came from that there room!Sandwich: Now y-you listen to me! A street seller's ears are his l-l-livelihood.Ryunosuke: I don't doubt your ears, sir. But all you can state with certainty is that you heard a noise.Gossip: Eh?Judge: Explain yourself then, Counsel.Ryunosuke: A noise that sounds like a gunshot could have been made with...Present Venus Firecracker (after examining fuse) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Something like this. The culprit could have set off one of these to fake a gunshot.\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Well, the culprit could have used something like this, for example. Judge: Oh really? A demonstration is in order then, I feel. Ryunosuke: Wha...? Kazuma: Yes, please, show the court how you could use that to create a noise like a gunshot. Judge: ...We're waiting, Counsel. Ryunosuke: ......... I may have been mistaken. Kazuma: It looks like you've been making a lot of noise yourself... Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: Ah! (Ugh...Kazuma's got a devastating way with words in English, too.) Susato: I realise it may be difficult to retract what you said and present some different evidence, but perhaps... Ryunosuke: (Yes, I was thinking the same thing myself.) That's because I'm convinced there is some evidence that could produce a similar noise! Leads back to: \"Explain yourself then, Counsel.\"Ryunosuke: Something like this. The culprit could have set off one of these to fake a gunshot.Judge: Good gracious! The very fireworks that are sold by the witness?Venus: ...Now 'old on a minute! Are you sayin' I did it?! My pretty little firecrackers only make a little pop anyway. See?Ryunosuke: Not a hundred of them together. The Venus Special that you sell for six hundred pennies sounds like this:...*BANG!*Ryunosuke: As the court can now attest...it sounds very much like a gunshot in fact.Venus: Agh agh agh agh agh!Kazuma: You're trying to suggest that somebody set one of those fireworks off at the scene?Ryunosuke: I'm suggesting that somebody knew the defendant was in the room at five that day... ...and sought to implicate him by creating a sound like a gunshot for these pedlars on Fresno Street to hear!Kazuma:Kazuma: But even the accused himself has testified that he saw no one else in the room at the time. Whether it was a gun or a firecracker, the only person present to cause that bang was Barok van Zieks!Venus: One whiff of a match and my firecrackers go pop. See? It's why people like 'em.Judge: I fear for your fingers, young lady.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: Recently during my time here in Britain, I've learnt of a very useful invention indeed. Something called a, um...a time bomb.Judge: Good heavens! A bomb?!Ryunosuke: Yes, a device that allows you to blow up whatever you like, whenever you like.Susato: Mr Naruhodo. I worry that your unfortunate phrasing there...may lead to yet another international incident.Ryunosuke: Ah! No no no! Wait! ...It's, it's the 'whenever you like' part that's important.Kazuma: A timed device?Ryunosuke: Yes! Exactly! A timed device! Something of that nature could have been planted at the scene. A device that was able to produce the sound of a gunshot long after the culprit had left.Judge: Your extravagant claim will have to be substantiated with evidence, Counsel. What proof do you have to suggest in any way that a timed device was employed to create the gunshot sound?Present Candelabrum Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"As the court has already discussed, the tip of one of the candles in this candelabrum has been blown off.\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Judge: You're suggesting this could have been used as some sort of 'time delay' device? Ryunosuke: I...did think so, My Lord. But it's becoming increasingly clear... ...that we've all been very misguided here. Kazuma: Kazuma: Yes, by you. Ryunosuke: Wha...? Judge: No, Counsel, the time has come for a penalty. Without delay. Ryunosuke: (Ugh...no time to clear the area before the blast...) Leads back to: \"Your extravagant claim will have to be substantiated with evidence, Counsel.\"Ryunosuke: As the court has already discussed, the tip of one of the candles in this candelabrum has been blown off.Judge: Indeed. Because it was struck by the bullet, which presumably passed through the victim.Ryunosuke: I don't think that's possible, My Lord.Kazuma: Not possible? Why?Ryunosuke: Because of the scorching. There are gunpowder scorch marks clearly visible on the broken candle.Judge: There are? ...Goodness, yes! But is it not the case... ...that there was also scorching on the victim around the bullet entry wound?Ryunosuke: That's right, there was. But as we heard earlier... ...scorching like that only occurs when the target is at very close range - a matter of centimetres from the gun.Judge: Ah!Ryunosuke: Which means that the scorching on the candle can't possibly be the result of a gunshot.Kazuma: You're suggesting it came from the fireworks?Gossip: How can that be, eh?Ryunosuke: The fact that there's such visible scorching on the candle... ...suggests that the fireworks must have been right next to it when they exploded. Or to put it another way...the candle and firecrackers were joined together.The culprit somehow attached the firecrackers at a point partway down the candle. After the killer had left the scene... ...the candle slowly burnt down along with the other two... ...until eventually it ignited the fuse of the firecrackers generating a loud......*BANG!*.........Ryunosuke: And that is how these three witnesses came to believe they'd heard a gunshot at five o'clock.Judge: ......... Well...what a plot... And this implies that the victim could have died earlier than we've been led to believe. The previous day, even.Gossip: Now...now...now just hold your horses! All uz lot here saw the victim goin' into the building, remember?Sandwich: I, I couldn't forget that flame-coloured hair even if I w-wanted to.Ryunosuke: The person you saw entering the building wasn't the victim at all. ...Consider this.Gossip: Ah!Ryunosuke: Obviously anybody can wear a wig. So the person that these witnesses saw entering the building fifteen minutes before the incident occurred... ...could easily have been someone else entirely wearing the red hairpiece.Judge: Someone else?! Do, do you mean to say...?Ryunosuke: It was the same person who contrived the firecracker trick. In other words...Inspector Gregson's killer!???:Pfft...Examine evidence Candelabrum Scorch marks Ryunosuke: So the candle was used as a sort of timer device to set off the firecrackers... That's a really ingenious idea...though obviously it's a shame it was used for such a wicked purpose. Susato: I wonder if there aren't some more positive uses for a timer device such as that... Ah, I have the perfect application! It would be a wonderful way of waking you in the mornings, Mr Naruhodo. Ryunosuke: ...I think I'd prefer that you continue to wake me in person, if it's all the same to you.Kazuma: Ha ha ha ha ha ha hah! Oh, very impressive, Ryunosuke Naruhodo.Ryunosuke: K-Kazuma?!Kazuma: I'm really quite amazed you've come this far. But after all, wasn't I the one who told you... ...that you had all the makings of a great defence lawyer?Ryunosuke: ...!Kazuma: I also noted the lack of a time of death in this report. A stark omission. But as far as I'm concerned...this whole country's justice system leaves a lot to be desired!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! Prosecutor Asogi! What do you mean by that statement?Kazuma: I hear that many of the leading members of Britain's judiciary are present to observe this trial today. So we cannot allow even the slightest doubt to be overlooked.Judge: ...!Kazuma: The defence's assertion about the time of death based on the victim's stopped watch is just conjecture. But...while the possibility exists that my learned friend may be correct...we have a duty to explore it.Judge: Hmmm... Well, certainly...I would agree with you.Kazuma: And what immediately comes to mind is of course... ...what was Inspector Gregson doing and where did he go on the day before the incident?Ryunosuke: Do you know?Kazuma: The inspector always carried out his investigative work alone. His movements were treated as confidential within Scotland Yard.Judge: Even within the Yard?Kazuma: However, considering the evidence we've been presented with so far... ...I'd say it's fairly apparent what case the man was pursuing. Wouldn't you, my learned friend?Susato: I do have a feeling about what case he might have been investigating.Ryunosuke: Yes, I agree. Surely... My Lord! The defence believes it can explain to the court... ...the case that was being investigated by Inspector Gregson at the time of his death!Judge: Very well, Counsel. Present your argument to the court. What evidence is suggestive of the case being investigated by the inspector on the day prior to the incident?Present Red-Headed League Article or Red Hairpiece Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"I believe this red hairpiece points to the answer.\"Present anything else Ryunosuke: Judge: Hm... I can't say that I find your answer suggestive of anything in particular. Other than perhaps that it is utterly wrong. That much you have clarified most expertly. Ryunosuke: Wha...? Kazuma: Congratulations, Ryunosuke Naruhodo. You deserve a reward for that expert display! Ryunosuke: AAAAAARGH! (Did, did you just draw Karuma on me, my friend?) Susato: I think, Mr Naruhodo, that there's one particular piece of evidence... ...that really does stand out in showing what case Inspector Gregson was investigating. Ryunosuke: My Lord! I have the answer now! Leads back to: \"Very well, Counsel.\"Ryunosuke: I believe this red hairpiece points to the answer.Kazuma: ...!Ryunosuke: We might assume it was part of a disguise used to carry out an undercover investigation.Judge: Surely not! Such a brightly coloured hairpiece would only serve to make the inspector more noticeable.Ryunosuke: Yes, that's quite true. It would definitely have made him stand out in a crowd. Except, that is...in a crowd of gentlemen from the Red-Headed League.Judge: The, the Red-Headed League?Kazuma: So...you'd already worked it out.Judge: What on earth is this all about? Is there such an extraordinary league of gentlemen?Kazuma: The Red-Headed League is currently under investigation for a grand deception.Judge: A deception of what nature, Counsel?Kazuma: They've been targeting red-headed men across all of London and tricking them out of small sums of money. Two men were arrested for the misdemeanour only yesterday, in fact.Ryunosuke: My Lord! The defence calls for those two men to be summoned at once!Judge: T-Two red-heads?!Ryunosuke: Inspector Gregson clearly infiltrated the Red-Headed League using this hairpiece. So it's very likely that he had direct contact with these criminals. And it's quite possible that such contact led to...more serious events.Kazuma: .........Judge: I concur that we cannot in good conscience leave this new avenue unexplored.Susato: Well done, Mr Naruhodo!Ryunosuke: Well...it's another possible line of enquiry for us at least.Judge: The prosecution will make immediate arrangements for the charged men to appear. Bring these two Red-Headed League conspirators before me, Prosecutor Asogi!Kazuma: At once, My Lord.Judge: Very good. We will have a thirty-minute recess. Court is adjourned!To be continued...2nd November, 12:33 p.m. The Old Bailey, Defendants' AntechamberGina: Oh, there you are, 'Oddo!Sholmes: What kept you, my dear fellow?Ryunosuke: Hello, Mr Sholmes. Gina.Gina: You sure about wot you said in there? That the boss...you know...actually died the day before? It's pretty 'ard to swallow.Susato: Yes, I was shocked by the revelation too, Gina.Sholmes: As was I! Possibly more shocked than both of you!Ryunosuke: ...It's not a competition, Mr Sholmes. (But I was more shocked than all of you put together.)Sholmes: This is the autopsy report in question, is it?Ryunosuke: Yes. It's strange that there's no time of death noted. I suppose there's a simple explanation. Or perhaps...it was a deliberate omission.Susato: Oh dear... If it was deliberate... ...it puts me in mind of the last case we worked on...and Dr Sithe.Ryunosuke: I know. Anyway, it seems that on the day before Lord van Zieks discovered his body... ...Inspector Gregson was investigating the Red-Headed League. So perhaps something happened with them. Come to think of it... ...you had trouble with those league men too, didn't you, Mr Sholmes? You were taken in by their trick.Sholmes: No no no! Naturally, I wasn't 'taken in' as you put it. My sleuth-hound interest was merely piqued slightly by the rare scent of a weekly four-pound income.Ryunosuke: ...And that scent masked the underlying scent of deception, I suppose.Susato: The two criminals in question are the pair we saw being arrested yesterday, aren't they? In Mr Sholmes's suite, I mean.Gina: That's right, Sooze! An' it was me wot took 'em in! Thanks to a tip-off by a good, law-abidin' citizen.Sholmes: Indeed. Yours truly.Ryunosuke: (So it's going to be that pair in the witness stand next, is it?) Something doesn't quite make sense to me, though. The day before Inspector Gregson was found, you hadn't had trouble with the Red-Headed League yet, had you? Why would the inspector have been investigating them?Sholmes: Well, the likely explanation would be... ...that Gregson's own sleuth-hound interest was piqued by the rare scent of a weekly four-pound income.Gina: Don't tar 'im wiv the same brush as you, Sholmes!Ryunosuke: Yes, well... Then there's the whole issue of Inspector Gregson being investigated by Lord van Zieks for some reason.Susato: The Reaper...the Red-Headed League... Inspector Gregson...Lord van Zieks...Ryunosuke: ...And Kazuma.Susato: ...!Ryunosuke: I feel as though he knew we'd arrive at this point somehow.Susato: Gosh! I, I think you're right...Ryunosuke: (What's he really trying to achieve here today?)Sholmes: All the answers will soon be revealed. ...Observe the time, my dear fellow. This recess will be over very shortly.Ryunosuke: Yes, you're right. (Kazuma was determined that he should be the one to prosecute this trial. And he was determined that I should take the defence. Just what is it that he's hoping to make me see, I wonder? I get the feeling we're a long way from the end of this trial yet...) Are you ready then, Miss Susato?Susato: Yes!2nd November, 1:00 p.m. The Old Bailey CourtroomJudge: In the name of Her Majesty the Queen, I hereby declare this court to be in session again. We resume the closed court hearing of Barok van Zieks, here present, who stands accused of murder. Now then, Prosecutor Asogi...Kazuma: My Lord?Judge: Have you summoned the witnesses as requested?Kazuma: Yes. The two members of the Red-Headed League who planned and carried out the deception. They arrived not long ago from the local prison by police carriage.Judge: Very good. Bailiff, usher the two men into the courtroom!Kazuma: These two men are currently being held by the police on suspicion of attempted extortion. You may omit your occupations. But please state your names now for the court.De Rousseau: I am Fabien de Rousseau. A descendant of ze great de Rousseau family from Nice, en France.De Rossi: And my-a name is Peppino de Rossi! I am the third son of the great familia de Rossi - the landowners from Napoli!Kazuma: The two men first became acquainted at a boarding school for European nobility.De Rousseau: Zose who graduate from Temsik are ze future leaders of Europe. ...But! Do you 'ave any idea 'ow boring it is to be born wiz noble blood? ...Alors! I make it my mission to get ze better of ze world by employing ze little grey cells of my brain. Zat is all I am trying to do, uh.Ryunosuke: So...that's the only reason for this whole grand deception you've been carrying out?De Rousseau: ...Oui. You could say zat.De Rossi: Not bad, ay? He has the grand ideals, but the petty plans! This strange combination is-a the charm of the Hairlarious Brothers! Si, capo?De Rousseau: ......... Listen to me, Peppino. I 'ave two sings to say to you:De Rossi: Eh? Che? Are you about to tell me one of your grandi anecdotes? Evviva!De Rousseau: Firstly, I want you to stop calling me zis 'capo'. And secondly... ..we are not ze 'Airlarious Brothers. Zis is serious business.De Rossi: Che bello! There it is! The capo's trump-a card: the furrowed brow! It is deep, uh, capo? The furrow, and the meaning of your words!Judge: The court has been led to believe that under the banner of the 'Red-Headed League'... ...you have conspired to swindle money from unsuspecting members of the public. Is this true?De Rousseau: Oui. C'est ça.Judge: And what exactly was the nature of this deception by which you planned to defraud?De Rousseau: ...Alors, I will explain it.De Rossi: No, capo! Leave it to-a me! As you see, we both have the vivid red hair, no? At school, we were teased for this without pity. The capo here, he was many times behind the schoolhouse, crying like the Trevi Fountain. 'Uèèè! Zose dogs! One day ze world will respect us red-'eads!' Every night, he would bury his-a head in his-a pillow and weep for the injustice.De Rousseau: C'est bien, Peppino! Enough! I will explain ze rest. Ze first step was ze newspaper advertisement. About one week before ze plan was put into operation, we listed ze same notice in every paper in London.Ryunosuke: Yes, we saw that notice. It was this one, I believe. Entitled 'To the Red-Headed League'.De Rousseau: Oui. C'est ça. I am honoured zat you 'ave seen it.Ryunosuke: It states that the only condition for joining the league is having flame-coloured hair. And that if you satisfy the interview panel and are admitted into the league... ...you could receive a weekly income of four pounds.Kazuma: On the date specified, red-headed hopefuls gathered in droves at a park specified in the advertisement. And from each person present, this pair took an application fee of five shillings.De Rousseau: And wiz ze money, to France! It was a plan most elegant, non?Kazuma: No, it was most dishonourable. But to be frank, I'm stunned anybody was foolish enough to be taken in by such an obvious trick.Susato: The park was described by one witness as 'choked with red-headed folk, like a coster's orange barrow'.Kazuma: And the day on which all these men gathered to apply was the day before the victim was discovered. Crucially, these two men spoke face to face with every single person present that day.De Rousseau: Oui. I 'ave seen more red-'eaded people in one day zan I will see in ze rest of my life.De Rossi: Si, si. And-a now, every time I see the capo's hair, I feel sick to my stomach!De Rousseau: Anyway, why 'ave we been summoned 'ere today?Ryunosuke: Sorry?De Rousseau: Ze date for our trial was not until tomorrow, I was told.Kazuma: Naturally, neither of these men have been told any details about this trial. They've only been shown this photograph.Judge: Very good. So, Mr de Rousseau and Mr de Rossi, you will now give your formal testimony for the court... ...on the subject of the gentleman pictured in this photograph.De Rousseau: Of course. We are always ready to 'elp wiz ze law.Witness Testimony - The Man in the Photograph -De Rousseau: We 'ad more zan one thousand red-'eaded people assemble in ze park on Lime Street zat day.De Rossi: But I don't recall the man in this-a photograph. Ay, capo?De Rousseau: Non, I don't remember 'im. Obviously 'e is dead now. But I assure you, 'e was not in ze park.De Rossi: Allora! This victim is-a nothing to do with us!De Rousseau: You 'ave a lot to answer for, Peppino. It is your fault zat we got caught in ze first place.Kazuma: You've given sworn testimony that this man in the photograph was not present. Can you be certain?De Rousseau: Oui, oui. I am quite certain. We did not interview zis man.De Rossi: Nobody looking like-a this came to the park. This, I can promise!Judge: It must be noted that you have been arrested for a grand deception, however. Accordingly, this court has little confidence in your assurances.De Rossi: ...!  ...Uffa! With this attitude, we get-a nowhere, uh?Ryunosuke: (He's really-a sulking now...)Kazuma: This confidential document was obtained directly from Scotland Yard. It records an entry from the inspector's private diary dated the day before the incident. It reads, 'Lime Street, Red-Headed League, Undercover.'De Rossi: Ah! I have the answer! Maybe there was another, similar event in the park on the day in question, ay?De Rousseau: Zat is ridiculous.Ryunosuke: (There's no question that Inspector Gregson was investigating the Red-Headed League. Which means it's quite possible that's when he was killed!)Judge: Very well. The defence may proceed with the cross-examination now.Ryunosuke: Ah. Yes, My Lord!Cross-Examination - The Man in the Photograph -De Rousseau: We 'ad more zan one thousand red-'eaded people assemble in ze park on Lime Street zat day.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: A thousand people? That's a very big crowd. De Rousseau: It was quite a spectacle. Red-'eads 'ad come from all over ze capital. De Rossi: Si, the capo here, he has the magnetismo animale, ay? Nobody else could attract-a so many people. If I could be born again, I would be the capo! De Rousseau: All zose people wanted was ze money, Peppino. Ze four pounds per week. Judge: Are you suggesting that you spoke personally with all one thousand applicants? De Rousseau: Oui, oui, zat we did. Because every one of zem paid us five shillings. De Rossi: We take-a their names and we take-a their money! And we take-a their addresses as well. Then I tell them we take-a some days to let them know by-a post, e finito! Maybe...two minuti a person? We start early in the morning, and we stop late in the night. Ryunosuke: So...you earnt five thousand shillings in one day?! (That's a small fortune!) Kazuma: Who'd have thought there were a thousand such gullible red-heads in London to start with. Ryunosuke: (One of whom was a great detective with chemically altered hair...)De Rossi: But I don't recall the man in this-a photograph. Ay, capo?Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: He doesn't look at all familiar? De Rossi: No, I don't-a think so. And this is a wig, ay? He was trying to trick us! I do not like the people who are trying to trick the other people! Ryunosuke: ...Says the con artist. Kazuma: If between them they interviewed a thousand people with red hair... ...it would be unreasonable to expect them to remember every face. De Rossi: No no, signore. I may be small... ...but my memory is very large! I never forget a thing! In my opinion, I do not think this-a man was in the park. Ryunosuke: (But he's not going to give the court a definite, it seems.) De Rossi: Eh, capo? You didn't see a man like this, uh?De Rousseau: Non, I don't remember 'im. Obviously 'e is dead now. But I assure you, 'e was not in ze park.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But according to what you've said, you spoke with a thousand or more people that day. De Rousseau: Oui, zat's true. My eyes were burning by ze end of ze day. Ryunosuke: Surely then, you can't actually remember every single face. How are you so certain... ...that this particular man wasn't present? De Rossi: Normally, the red hair is very distinctive, ay? But not when you have one thousand red-heads crowding around. Then it is just an eyesore! But if there was some other information you could-a give us, maybe then we would recall. De Rousseau: Zat is not ze line, Peppino. Remember, we do not remember 'im. We are sure of zat fact, uh? If zere was a man wiz a red 'airpiece, but 'is moustache did not match ze colour... ...zen I do not sink I could 'ave forgotten 'im. Ryunosuke: (Kazuma said these two had only been shown that photograph and they'd been told nothing else at all. But what if I fed them just one other detail about the victim. For example...) His name Ryunosuke: I can certainly appreciate that just knowing the man had red hair wouldn't help you remember in this situation. But what if I told you that the man's name was Gregson? De Rousseau: Ze man in ze photograph is a Monsieur Gregson? Ryunosuke: Yes. De Rossi: Names, they are boring! I did not-a listen to any of them. Ryunosuke: ...Oh. De Rossi: It was not a real interview, uh? It was just for-a show. Why would I remember the names? De Rousseau: Zat's right. Zis changes nothing. Ze man in ze photograph was not zere. As we 'ave already said. Ryunosuke: I see... Judge: Hm... It seems there's little to be gained from pursuing this point further. De Rousseau: Tell zem again what you said before, Peppino. De Rossi: Si, capo, si! I say it again and again! Leads back to cross-examination His profession Ryunosuke: I can certainly appreciate that just knowing the man had red hair wouldn't help you remember in this situation. But what if I told you the man in the red hairpiece was actually a detective? De Rousseau: Ze man in ze photograph? A detective? Ryunosuke: Yes. Kazuma: It would appear he found your notice in the paper suspicious and decided to investigate incognito. De Rousseau: ......... ...Sorry, but zis changes nothing. No detective came to ze park. I am certain of zat. Pursue Peppino de Rossi (before Inspector's Identification is added to the Court Record) Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Something to add, Mr de Rossi?! De Rossi: ......... Che? Si, I am always adding something! Parmesan, olive oil, pepper... Ryunosuke: What I mean is...did you not agree with your friend's last remark by any chance? De Rossi: Eh? What-a did he just-a say? About the detective? Ryunosuke: Yes, that. De Rousseau: Keep your mouth shut, Peppino! You 'ave said enough already. De Rossi: But-a why, capo? What is the problem? There was a man who said-a, 'I am an inspector from Scotland Yard.' Ryunosuke: What?! Kazuma: ...! Judge: Good Lord! Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! Explain this volte-face in your testimony, witness! De Rossi: Is simple. A man who was at-a the park said to us that he was an inspect- De Rousseau: Zere was no such man. De Rossi: Ma dai! What are you saying, capo? Have you forgotten, ay? De Rousseau: I 'ave forgotten nothing. Nobody like zis came to ze park. De Rossi: Basta, capo, basta! You beat me at-a many things, but not two: the memory and the meals! Like I said, when is time to eat-a the pasta, no one is-a faster! De Rousseau: But you are inferior to me in every other way... so shut up! Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: ......... Kazuma: ......... De Rousseau: Uuurgh... Trop tard... Ze damage is done... Judge: Indeed it is, sir. De Rousseau: Oui, zere was a man who came to ze park and 'e said 'e was an inspector from Scotland Yard. 'Owever! 'E looked nothing like ze man in ze photograph. 'E was someone else! Ryunosuke: How can you be so sure? De Rousseau: Because! To start wiz, 'is face was completely different. De Rossi: Si...is true, is true. The man who came was-a younger. His-a face was clean-shaven. His-a eyes were sadder. His-a chin was thinner. Judge: No resemblance whatsoever, then! De Rousseau: Anyway, I was not going to be fooled. I took ze obvious precaution and said to 'im... ...'If you are really a detective, show us ze proof!' De Rossi: Si, si, the capo here, he doesn't take-a no nonsense, ay? De Rousseau: But 'e was well prepared. 'E said 'e 'ad identification. Ryunosuke: I-Identification? You mean, official police inspector's identification? Judge: That is most unconvincing. Ryunosuke: Sorry, My Lord? Judge: Counsel, no incognito inspector would offer his identification for inspection. It's quite out of the question. Kazuma: Definitely. Why would he expose his true identity? De Rousseau: Clearly ze papers were fake. De Rossi: Certo, capo! You are a genius! As we say in-a Italia, it takes a thief to recognise another, ay? Ryunosuke: And what happened after he announced that he was a detective? De Rousseau: 'E became very annoying. 'E said, 'You are under investigation.' So I took 'is papers from 'im and chased 'im out of ze park. De Rossi: It was fantastico! And look, here is-a the identification! Kazuma: So you stole it from the man? De Rossi: He had it-a coming! He made us very scared. But he was-a not who he said-a he was! Judge: Indeed, the person described does not appear to have behaved as a true inspector would. However, I believe it would be prudent for these identification papers to be entered into evidence. De Rossi: Hmph. But I-a like them! The inspector's identification has been entered into the Court Record. Judge: Now, let us return to the witnesses' testimony. Leads back to cross-examination Ryunosuke: I see... De Rousseau: In any case, if such a man 'ad come incognito... ...'e wouldn't 'ave just said, 'I am a detective,' would 'e? Ryunosuke: Well...no, I suppose not. Judge: Hm...sound logic, I must agree. Kazuma: ......... De Rousseau: Tell zem again what you said before, Peppino. De Rossi: Ay? Ah! Si, capo, si! Is-a best we move on! Leads back to cross-examination His fish and chips Ryunosuke: I can certainly appreciate that just knowing the man had red hair wouldn't help you remember in this situation. But what if I told you the man was always munching on a packet of fish and chips? Do you remember a man who was eating incessantly? De Rousseau: Not really. I was looking only at ze 'eads of ze applicants. I wouldn't 'ave noticed ze fish and chips any more zan ze caviar and smoked salmon. De Rossi: Or-a spaghetti! Me, I love the spaghetti! Ryunosuke: Really? I had no idea... De Rousseau: Tell zem again what you said before, Peppino. De Rossi: Si, capo, si! I say it again and again! Leads back to cross-examinationExamine evidence Inspector's Identification Latch on back Ryunosuke: Well, I suppose we should see what this inspector's identification looks like inside... Writing inside Ryunosuke: Yes, it definitely looks fake, doesn't it? Susato: Out of interest, what name is given? Ryunosuke: Probably just something plucked out of the air. It's...'Tobias Gregson'... Wait, what? Susato: ......... This Scotland Yard insignia... ...looks genuine to me. Ryunosuke: But how?! Susato: And the department and identification number details are all correct as well. Ryunosuke: (Since when have you known those?) Do, do you mean to say...? Susato: I know it seems incredible, but yes... ...I think this is a genuine identification book issued by Scotland Yard. Ryunosuke: But that's... That's unbelievable! (This is the real thing after all?!) The details of the inspector's identification have been updated in the Court Record. Writing inside (subsequent times) Ryunosuke: This Scotland Yard insignia looks genuine to me. Susato: And the department and identification number details are all correct as well. There's no doubt that this really is Inspector Gregson's identification.De Rossi: Allora! This victim is-a nothing to do with us!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: But we only have your word for that. De Rossi: Si, but what else can we do, uh? Ryunosuke: (True...) De Rossi: Uffa! We are not having much-a fun these days! First we are arrested, then we are shown the horrible picture of a dead man... ...and now you question every single-a thing we say! WE are the victims here! Ay, capo? Ryunosuke: No, you were caught carrying out a plot to swindle hundreds of innocent people. De Rossi: ...! Hmph! You had to bring that up, ay? It's not fair! Ay, capo?Present Inspector's Identification (after examining writing inside) Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"I wonder if I could ask you to examine this identification book very closely...\"De Rousseau: You 'ave a lot to answer for, Peppino. It is your fault zat we got caught in ze first place.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: What do you mean by that? De Rossi: Cavolo! You promised not to say! Ay, capo? De Rousseau: After we 'ad taken all ze money zat day, we should 'ave left ze country. Zat was my plan. I left ze purchasing of ze tickets for ze ferry to Dunkerque to my companion 'ere. But 'e bought zem for ze wrong day. Ryunosuke: Oops. De Rossi: Si, but is an easy mistake-a to make-a, uh? The first, the thirty-first... De Rousseau: Bof! I 'ave no sympathy for you! We were an 'ole day late for ze boat because of your stupidity! And it's only because of zis, zat ze so-called 'great red-'eaded detective' caught us! De Rossi: Capo...you know what I think? This is the work of God! Is a holy punishment, ay? De Rousseau: Peppino, for ze last time... ...zis is not 'oly punishment. Zis is 'olly your fault! De Rossi: Ah! De Rousseau: Don't blame God for your unholy mistakes. You are makin' me sick wiz anger! De Rossi: Hmph. Maybe I make-a mistake-a. But when is time to eat-a the pasta, no one is-a faster! Ryunosuke: (And I've seen the evidence...)Ryunosuke: (They haven't told us much we didn't already know...)Susato: What do you think, Mr Naruhodo?Ryunosuke: Well, if it was in the inspector's diary, it seems likely that he must have gone to Lime Street that day. And yet these two both claim they didn't see him...Susato: I have to say... ...they don't appear to be telling lies.Ryunosuke: Well, they are experts in deception, don't forget. Sounding plausible is their specialty. They may be lying simply to avoid being implicated in this case as well.Susato: Surely if they were truly experts in deception, they wouldn't have been caught.Ryunosuke: (Well, yes, you do have a point there...) ...It seems to me like we need more information.Susato: Definitely!Ryunosuke: I wonder if I could ask you to examine this identification book very closely... ...Miss Lestrade?Kazuma: Why Miss Lestrade?Judge: What is your intention here, Counsel?Ryunosuke: Is this really a fake, or is it genuine? That's the question. ...Which we can't answer ourselves.Kazuma:Kazuma: Don't be ridiculous. No Scotland Yard detective would allow his - or her - identification to be stolen.???:Gina: That...that... That IS the boss's! ...No question about it.Kazuma: It can't be!Ryunosuke: As I suspected. The 'undercover detective' who attended the Red-Headed League's enrolment on the day in question... ...was the real Inspector Gregson carrying out an incognito investigation!De Rousseau: Zu... Zut aloooooors!Judge: O-Ordaaar! Ordaaar!Gina: But...if the boss 'ad 'is identification stolen... ...'e would've reported it straight away. I mean, 'e was always on at me about it. If ya lose summat, report it at once, 'e'd say.Ryunosuke: Could it be, then... ...that the inspector was physically unable to report it?De Rossi: Physically... Ay?! What are you-a saying?Kazuma: Unable to...? You're, you're not suggesting...?Ryunosuke: Yes! It's quite possible that he was killed before he had the chance to report his identification stolen!Kazuma: No!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!!Ryunosuke: The defence posits that the victim was killed the day before his body was discovered, at a different location. Do you two...have anything to say about that?!De Rossi: Uèèèèèèèèèèèè! I know-a nothing! Uèèèèèèèèè! I done-a nothing! Uèèèèèèèèè!De Rousseau: Pull yourself together, Peppino! Mon Dieu! You can behave a little more like a master criminal zan zat, non?De Rossi: Uèèèèèèèèè! Now I wish I had-a returned to Italia! Uèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèè!De Rousseau: S-Stop crying, Peppino, please! Otherwise I...I...Gina: Lumme! Stop yer whinin' an' start talkin'!Judge: Well...I believe the court will need to hear your story in considerably greater detail.De Rossi: I know-a nothing! Uèèèèèèèèè! I done-a nothing! Uèèèèèèèèè!Kazuma: But you will tell everything! ...Or face the worst possible outcome.De Rousseau: Ugh... Uuuuuugh...Judge: You will dry your eyes and testify again... ...about these identification papers, and the precise circumstances under which you came by them!De Rossi: Uèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèèè!Ryunosuke: (For crying out loud...)Witness Testimony - The Detective and the Identification -De Rousseau: Ze, ze truth is, we took 'im prisoner and kept 'im for ze night at our secret 'ideout. Even though I didn't sink 'e was a real detective, I, I was too scared to let 'im go zat day, just in case.De Rossi: We took the man's identification from him and shut-a him in the room next to ours!De Rousseau: Zere might 'ave been a little tussle, but we did 'im no 'arm. And ze next mornin', we let 'im go.De Rossi: He spent-a the night in a nice room! It was-a nothing like prison really! Uèèèèèè!Judge: This, this is outrageous! You imprisoned the man?!De Rossi: But! No! Si! No! It, it was not-a like a prison! He was-a very comfortable and-a calm and-a happy! Ay, capo?De Rousseau: ......... It, it was never part of my plan! I swear it!De Rossi: Uffa! So...so you think it was-a my fault, ay? Just because I got the date of the ferry wrong... by one-a little-a day!De Rousseau: I do not sink it was your fault, Peppino. I know it!De Rossi: No no no no! Per favore, capo. Is not-a fair.Judge: You shall have plenty of time for squabbling back at the prison, gentlemen.De Rousseau: Uff! I don't believe zis... 'Ow could 'e 'ave been a real detective...?Judge: Counsel for the Defence, proceed with the cross-examination!Ryunosuke: (So on the day before the incident... ...Gregson spent the night confined in this pair's hideout...)Cross-Examination - The Detective and the Identification -De Rousseau: Ze, ze truth is, we took 'im prisoner and kept 'im for ze night at our secret 'ideout.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Do, do you realise what you're saying?! De Rousseau: You 'ave to believe me! I never intended for zat to 'appen. And I'm sure ze detective did not intend it, either. Ryunosuke: ...Do you think? De Rousseau: But, but zere was nothing else I could do! De Rossi: Si! Nothing else! This was-a the first crime for the capo! He was at the end of his-a wits! De Rousseau: I 'ave told you before, Peppino. Zat is not ze way to describe a criminal mastermind! Kazuma: What about this hideout of yours? De Rousseau: ...An old, empty 'ouse behind ze park on Lime Street. De Rossi: We rented the place for-a two days. It was an inspired idea by the capo here. Judge: An impulsive idea, I would say. De Rossi: No no no! Not impulsive! Inspired! Ay, capo? De Rousseau: What am I supposed to say to zat, uh, Peppino? Ryunosuke: And it was in the house described that you confined Inspector Gregson, was it? De Rousseau: Ugh...oui. But you 'ave to remember: I was under ze impression zat 'e was a pretender. Not a real inspector! Ryunosuke: That doesn't quite add up, though. If you didn't think the man was a real inspector... ...there would have been no reason to take him prisoner, would there? De Rousseau: Non, you are right. But we couldn't be completely certain.De Rousseau: Even though I didn't sink 'e was a real detective, I, I was too scared to let 'im go zat day, just in case.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Too scared? Why? De Rousseau: Because! Why 'ad 'e come to ze park? We didn't know. Zere was a chance zat 'e 'ad seen through my plan. De Rossi: And if that was-a the case, he would go straight to the police station to blow-a the whistle on us! Even if he was just-a feigning to be an inspector, he was up to no good, uh? Without-a doubt-a. Kazuma: I think most people would agree that it's you two who were up to no good. De Rossi: Well-a...si, you may be right. Ay, capo? De Rousseau: Ze point is, we were not able to escape from England immediately. Zat is why we 'ad no choice but to take ze man prisoner. Ryunosuke: What I don't understand is why the inspector felt the need to show you his identification in the first place. De Rossi: Si! I ask myself the same question! De Rousseau: We were writing down ze names and addresses of all ze people who we took five shillings from zat day. I have forgotten what name 'e said, but ze address, it startled me. De Rossi: Si si! 'Address: Scotland Yard, Homicide Division,' he said! Ryunosuke: What?! De Rousseau: 'E probably didn't like your face, Peppino. Anyway, I was not rude. I just politely asked 'im why 'e 'ad said it... ...and zat's when 'e started to say 'e was an inspector. Not long afterwards, 'e took out 'is identification. Ryunosuke: (What was Inspector Gregson playing at?) Kazuma: Tell the court what happened next. You took him back to your hideout, you say? De Rossi: Si! We did-a, we did-a!De Rossi: We took the man's identification from him and shut-a him in the room next to ours!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: That being this identification book here, correct? De Rossi: Si! That is-a the one! Judge: What made you believe that it was a forgery? De Rossi: I never seen a real one, of course. But he was so suspicious, this-a man. Allora, I was-a thinking, it must be false! Ay, capo? De Rousseau: Oui, it is just as Peppino said. We were convinced it was not genuine. De Rossi: And so together, the Hairlarious Brothers, we took-a the man captive! De Rousseau: All we did was shove 'im inside a locked room. Zen we made preparations to transport all of ze money. Judge: Hmm... Ryunosuke: In for a penny, in for a pound...De Rousseau: Zere might 'ave been a little tussle, but we did 'im no 'arm. And ze next mornin', we let 'im go.Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Um...what do you mean by 'a little tussle' exactly? De Rousseau: Hm? Bof! It was nothing. Just a minor incident. De Rossi: The falso inspector, he was a real piece of-a the work! Ay, capo? Ryunosuke: What happened? De Rossi: Uffa! It was a disaster! We give him a nice room, and what does he-a do, uh? In the middle of the night, he tries to escape-a through the ventilatore! Ryunosuke: ...Can you blame him? De Rousseau: We chased 'im, bien sûr. And we caught 'im again. De Rossi: ...Can you-a blame us? Ryunosuke: ......... Wait! You, you didn't... ...shoot the man in your haste, did you? De Rousseau: Zut! Who do you sink we are?! Of course not! I simply caught 'old of 'im again and took 'im back to ze room. Zere was really nothing more to it zan zat. Pursue Peppino de Rossi Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Mr de Rossi! Is something wrong? De Rossi: Ay?! Me? Ryunosuke: Something Mr de Rousseau just said seemed to make you, um... Well, it seemed to make you act even more strangely than usual. What was that all about? De Rossi: Cavolo! At times like that, you don't-a wanna have the capo after you, believe me! And I speak-a from personal-a esperienza! Ryunosuke: Personal experience? De Rousseau: Zat is enough, Peppino. Zere is no need to say more. De Rossi: The truth is, the night-a before we put the Red-Headed League plan into action, I was-a scared. It was not-a fair to the capo, but...I tried to run away. Ryunosuke: It's a shame you didn't manage it. De Rossi: But the capo here, he came after me like-a the turbine, uh? And he dragged me back to the house, kicking and-a screaming. I still have-a the bruises to prove it! Ay, capo? Judge: Bruises, you say? De Rossi: Ah...you wanna see, uh? You wanna see my-a fantastico bruises! De Rousseau: Zat's enough now, Peppino. No one wants to look at any part of you. De Rossi: What-a to do, uh? I-a show you, or I-a don't...? I-a show you, or I-a don't...? Kazuma: You do! NOW! De Rossi: Allora, if everybody wants to see, then I-a do it! Ecco! You see? Is still very-a visible, ay? Ryunosuke: That, that red ring around your neck? You got that when you were dragged back to the house? De Rossi: Si! The capo, sometimes he is-a very rough! And- De Rousseau: I said zat's enough! Peppino's neck is nothing to do wiz what we are talking about 'ere. You 'ave my word. Judge: Hm, yes... What is your opinion, Counsel? Ryunosuke: (About this red ring around Mr de Rossi's neck? I wonder... Does it matter?) It's important Ryunosuke: Mr de Rossi! I'm going to have to ask you... ...to amend your testimony with details about that mark on your neck! De Rossi: Ay, capo? You see? Everyone is interested in what I say, uh? De Rousseau: Uuugh... Judge: Very well. You will amend you [sic] testimony as requested, Mr de Rossi. De Rossi: Si si, if you really want-a to know! Changes statement from \"Zere might 'ave been a little tussle, but we did 'im no 'arm. And ze next mornin', we let 'im go.\" to \"He tried to escape, but the capo put-a the collare on him and dragged him back...like what he did-a to me, see?\" Wait and see Ryunosuke: (I don't suppose there's any cause for alarm. I'm sure it'll heal up in time.) Susato: I'm not quite sure that's what His Lordship meant, Mr Naruhodo. De Rossi: So! If you have-a seen enough, then I go back to what I was-a saying before. Leads back to cross-examination Ryunosuke: And the following morning, you let him go, you say? De Rousseau: Correct! And it was an amicable parting. Zere was no trouble. De Rossi: Si si. We shake-a the hands and say let's-a do it again, uh! Ryunosuke: (Not a whiff of perjury here...)De Rossi: He tried to escape, but the capo put-a the collare on him and dragged him back...like what he did-a to me, see?Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: Are, are you saying that red mark was caused by... De Rossi: Si si! A big collare made from-a the leather! Ryunosuke: A leather collar... Kazuma: Is this true, Mr de Rousseau? De Rousseau: What? We 'ad a St Bernard at 'ome when I was younger. It is a souvenir from zat time, wiz a very strong chain. Kazuma: A strong chain? Ryunosuke: And you put that around your friend's neck? De Rousseau: I'm sorry! I was so angry zat 'e was leaving me alone. De Rossi: You did not have to tie the chain to the leg-a of the bed-a, though, uh? I would not have tried to run again. Ryunosuke: You...you didn't do that to Inspector Gregson as well, did you? De Rossi: 'Treat-a the people-a equal-a!' Is the capo here's motto, ay? Kazuma: It's starting to sound a lot more like a prison all of a sudden. De Rossi: The capo is-a tough! But the capo is-a rough! De Rousseau: Uuugh... I, I shouldn't 'ave done it... Ryunosuke: So...the following morning when you released the inspector... De Rossi: He had-a the red ring around his neck just like-a me! De Rousseau: Peppino, s'il vous plaît... Leave it now. De Rossi: Now you know, uh? The capo here, you don't-a wanna tangle with him, ay? But for the inspector, is not so bad...Present Photograph of the Victim Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"So the day before his body was discovered, Inspector Gregson was taken prisoner while working incognito...\"De Rossi: He spent-a the night in a nice room! It was-a nothing like prison really! Uèèèèèè!Press Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: You took away the man's freedom! However comfortable you make it sound, you were still holding him prisoner. De Rossi: If you say-a that, then I say-a this: There is something that takes away our freedom too. The lack of-a money! So we are the prisoners as well, uh? All of us! Ryunosuke: Huh? De Rossi: No money, no freedom. This is the truth! It-a makes me mad! And it-a makes me sad! What can-a we do? Ryunosuke: Um...well... Kazuma: If you feel so disenfranchised, take 'money' to court. ...Though it'll cost you, of course. De Rossi: Uffa, there you-a have it! You see? That is why we need the Red-Headed League, to fight for the justice! Ryunosuke: (Hm...perhaps he has a point.) Susato: No, Mr Naruhodo. De Rossi: All we did-a was to give the man a comfortable place to sleep for the night. And you say it was a prison, uh? UH?! Ryunosuke: (Hm...perhaps he has a point again.) Susato: No again, Mr Naruhodo. De Rossi: You should have heard him-a snoring! Ma dai! If anyone was disturbed, it was us!Ryunosuke: (Not much to go on, really...)Susato: Their testimony does make me wonder, you know. About this pocket watch belonging to the inspector, I mean.Ryunosuke: (Ah yes, the one he treasured so much, apparently.)Susato: If he was confined but not restrained, as the witnesses are implying... ...he would still have been able to wind his watch.Ryunosuke: That's very true, yes. (So did Inspector Gregson actually die while he was being held captive by these red-heads?)Susato: In which case, is it possible that these two young men are responsible for Inspector Gregson's...?Ryunosuke: To be honest...I find that hard to believe. Perhaps we should try to find out exactly what happened.Susato: Very wise, Mr Naruhodo, yes.Ryunosuke: So the day before his body was discovered, Inspector Gregson was taken prisoner while working incognito...De Rousseau: Non non! It was not like zat! It was 'ardly a prison. It was an...invitation to stay. It was 'omely.Ryunosuke: However you describe it, there's one glaring inconsistency that remains.Judge: What inconsistency is this, Counsel?Ryunosuke: I would ask the court to look closely at this photograph of the victim, Inspector Gregson. You will see...that there is no red ring visible around his neck!De Rossi: Eh?! But, but that-a makes no sense! It was me who took-a the collare off the man in the morning. And I saw the red bruises on his-a neck, just like I have!Ryunosuke: Given that the mark is still clearly visible on this witness's neck... ...we'd expect to see bruising on the victim, who put in the collar more recently than Mr de Rossi!Judge: I-Indeed! That is most peculiar...De Rossi: But what we-a tell you, uh? Uh? We say this...from-a the beginning... Many times! Uèèèèèèèèèèèè!De Rousseau: Oui, Peppino is right. Ze man in ze photograph... ...'e is someone different to ze man we 'eld captive zat niiiiiiiiight!Judge: Ordaaar! Ordaaar! Ordaaaaaar!!!Kazuma: It would appear then, that on the day before the incident... ...the man who visited the park on Lime Street posing as an incognito inspector... ...was not Inspector Gregson at all!Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: If that's true, however, how do you explain the inspector's identification?Kazuma: ...!Ryunosuke: This is a genuine identification book, issued by Scotland Yard. It's inconceivable that someone could have stolen such an important item from the inspector. The prosecution made that assertion itself!Kazuma: ...!Susato: And we also know that the inspector had made a note about the Red-Headed League in his diary for that day. Which surely means we can't divorce the two events completely.Judge: The inconsistency noted by the defence is most troubling. If it were the real Inspector Gregson whom these two red-headed gentlemen encountered... ...the fact that no bruising can be seen around his neck defies explanation.Kazuma: But equally, if they actually encountered an imposter... ...how did that person come to be in possession of the real inspector's identification?Judge: Does the defence have some plausible explanation, Counsel?Ryunosuke: (The whole thing defies explanation.)Susato: It is for precisely these occasions that we keep meticulous notes in the Court Record, Mr Naruhodo. Because those are the facts, and the facts cannot lie!Ryunosuke: (No, the facts can't lie... ...even when they point to something so incredible, it's almost unbelievable!) Well, My Lord, the true identity of the person who turned up in the park for the Red-Headed League's enrolment... ...is revealed by information in the Court Record, I believe.Judge: Good gracious!Kazuma: Very tantalising, Mr Naruhodo. So, why don't you help us all to see whatever truth it is that you've apparently seen? Who exactly was this 'inspector' that appeared before Mr de Rousseau and Mr de Rossi?Gregson himself Ryunosuke: Obviously there's nothing to deliberate here. It was Inspector Gregson himself! There's no other explanation, since he was in possession of genuine Scotland Yard identification! Judge: ......... Kazuma: ......... ......... Kazuma: In that case, I believe I speak for everyone here present when I ask... ...how do you explain the lack of bruising around the victim's neck, which you yourself brought up? Ryunosuke: ......... Ah, yes...that is the burning unresolved question, isn't it? Judge: You claim there's nothing to deliberate, Counsel. However... ...I would implore you give your answers a little more thought in future! Ryunosuke: (It's possible I oversimplified that...) Susato: It seems to me that the lack of bruising around the victim's neck is the hardest discrepancy to reconcile. Ryunosuke: Yes, I...think I can see how to tackle this now... Leads to: \"Though it seems incredible, I admit, the undeniable facts point to only one thing:\"An imposter Leads to: \"Though it seems incredible, I admit, the undeniable facts point to only one thing:\"Ryunosuke: Though it seems incredible, I admit, the undeniable facts point to only one thing: Since no bruising can be seen on the victim's neck... ...the person who these two red-headed men took prisoner that day cannot have been Inspector Gregson.Kazuma: In other words, your whole argument up to now has been a waste of time.Ryunosuke:Ryunosuke: On the contrary. I haven't finished.Kazuma: What?Ryunosuke: There's no bruising on the victim's neck, so the question immediately posed next is... ...who exactly was this man in the park on Lime Street found to be carrying Inspector Gregson's identification?De Rossi: Si... Si! That's-a right! We tell the same story every time: Whoever this man was, the capo dragged him from-a pillar to-a post with the dog collare!De Rousseau: Mon Dieu, Peppino! I was not so 'arsh as you say, uh?De Rossi: So who was that-a falso inspector, ay? Who was he?!Kazuma: Clearly the defence has an idea about that. About the true identity of the man these two imprisoned that night...Judge: I must ask the counsel for the defence to elaborate posthaste. Who did the witnesses encounter in the park posing as Inspector Gregson?Present Gossip profile Ryunosuke: Leads to: \"Goodness me! Isn't...isn't that...?\"Present anyone else Ryunosuke: Ryunosuke: It's surely no secret! THIS is the identity of the imposter! Kazuma: ...Oh really? On what grounds? Ryunosuke: Well...I said it was no secret, but...that part is! Judge: Dear me. If ever a penalty was in order, it's now, I feel. De Rossi: Like-a the punishment? The capo can lend you his collare if you want, uh? Kazuma: Perhaps my learned friend needs to experience what it feels like to be dragged around the streets by the neck? Ryunosuke: ...I'll use my imagination, thanks. Susato: Well, Mr Naruhodo, the red ring produced by the collar is clearly the crux of the matter here... Ryunosuke: (Yes, the bruising around the neck...) Leads back to: \"I must ask the counsel for the defence to elaborate posthaste.\"Judge: Goodness me! Isn't...isn't that...?Ryunosuke: One of the witnesses who was in the stand in this very courtroom earlier today! A nameless man, whose only occupation appears to be peddling hearsay to passers-by.Kazuma:Kazuma: What on earth would a street seller be doing with a police inspector's identification papers? Witnesses! Is this the man or not?!De Rousseau: What 'as 'appened to 'is lip?Ryunosuke: Ah!De Rossi: Si, this-a man is not for the Red-Headed League, ay? He's-a looking for the Twisted Lip League, no?Kazuma: Perhaps rather than making such a rash claim next time... you should bite your lip instead.Ryunosuke: It seems improbable, yes. But one undeniable fact remains! During his testimony earlier... ...I noted something around the man's neck: a red ring of bruising!De Rousseau: Eh?Kazuma: What?!Ryunosuke: The defence demands that Mr Gossip be brought back to the stand!Judge: Ordaaar! Orrrdaaar! ...Bailiff! Bring the aforementioned witness back into the courtroom! Immediately!Judge: Well I never... An undeniable ring of bruising indeed. And identical...to that of the witness beside him!Gossip: Now what's going on here, eh? I've always had this, me. It's a birthmark, in't it?Ryunosuke: A birthmark, you say?Kazuma: I assume the reason you've been recalled to the stand has been explained to you?Gossip: Aye, um...summat about an inspector again. But I'm telling you, you've got it all wrong as usual.Ryunosuke: You're denying all knowledge of it?Gossip: Well of course I am! Are you trying to kill me with all this nonsense, eh?Kazuma: Well...at least you'll have more stories to peddle back on Fresno Street, won't you? Now, we're going to need you to testify again.Ryunosuke: And you, Mr de Rousseau and Mr de Rossi. I'm sure you'll cooperate, won't you?De Rousseau: Do we 'ave any choice?De Rossi: We are in big-a trouble, ay, capo?Judge: That's quite enough dilatory chatter. Proceed with the testimony!Witness Testimony - The Inspector and the Identification Revisited -De Rousseau: Ze man who claimed to be an inspector zat day... was definitely not zis man.De Rossi: Is right, si! You think we would-a forget these grand lips, uh?Gossip: I never leave Fresno Street, alright? I've no interest in any Red-Headed League. I'm all alone in the world, me. I've no kinfolk or nothing. Why would I be involved in something like that? Just look at me, eh. Doz it look like I could carry off a disguise with a face like this?Judge: It would certainly appear that we have the wrong man.De Rousseau: What 'ave I been telling you, uh? Zere was no need for zis pointless testimony.Ryunosuke: Uuugh...Gossip: That's right. I'm just a simple pedlar, remember. Fresno Street's all I know. How would I have come by a police inspector's identification book, eh?Ryunosuke: Well, yes, that's hard to explain, but...Judge: Hmph. A brief cross-examination, I think, Counsel. Very brief.Ryunosuke: (Ugh. Isn't there anyone in this courtroom who thinks I might be on to something?)Susato: I stand steadfastly at your side as always, Mr Naruhodo!Kazuma: .........Cross-Examination - The Inspector and the Identification Revisited -\nCharacters:\nCharacter 0\nName: Susato Mikotoba\nDescription: A judicial assistant sent to Britain on a study tour.

You think we would-a forget these grand lips, uh?\nPerson: De Rossi\nTestimony 2\nTestimony: I never leave Fresno Street, alright? I've no interest in any Red-Headed League.\nPerson: Gossip\nTestimony 3\nTestimony: Aye, I rent the room where that fella was found, it's true. For what difference it makes.\nPerson: Boone\nTestimony 4\nTestimony: I'm all alone in the world, me. I've no kinfolk or nothing. Why would I be involved in something like that?\nPerson: Gossip/Boone\nTestimony 5\nTestimony: Just look at me, eh. Doz it look like I could carry off a disguise with a face like this?\nPerson: Gossip/Boone\n\nWhich evidence and testimony contradict each other? You must only answer one pair. You may output an explanation, but your answer must end with a JSON format like so: {\"evidence\": 2, \"testimony\": 3}. The answer JSON should strictly be the last line, followed by nothing else.",
    "cot": "Let's look at Testimony 3: \"Aye, I rent the room where that fella was found, it's true. For what difference it makes.\" This is attributed to Boone, but from the context given, Boone is the current leaseholder of the room where Gregson's body was found. However, if you compare this with Evidence 2: \"Photograph of Mr Vigil\" – which is a photo of Mr Daley Vigil, the missing man and previous chief warder – this isn't the direct contradiction. Let's look more closely at the remaining testimonies and evidence.\n\nTestimony 2: \"I never leave Fresno Street, alright? I've no interest in any Red-Headed League.\" (Gossip)\nIf Gossip never leaves Fresno Street, how could he have been the imposter who appeared as Inspector Gregson at the Red-Headed League event (in a park on Lime Street) and subsequently had a red ring on his neck (indicating he was the one impersonating Gregson and caught by de Rousseau and de Rossi)? The contradiction here is that Gossip claims he never leaves Fresno Street, but the evidence that supports he was the fake inspector is the Inspector's Identification (Evidence 17), which was used by the impostor DJ at the Red-Headed League event. Furthermore, the photograph of Mr Vigil (Evidence 2) would not be relevant; but the Inspector's Identification (Evidence 17) is directly relevant.\n\nHowever, let's focus on the testimonies and evidence provided.\n\nTestimony 2: \"I never leave Fresno Street, alright? I've no interest in any Red-Headed League.\"\nEvidence 17: Inspector's Identification -- \"The identification of a man claiming to be a detective inspector, confiscated by Mr de Rousseau and Mr de Rossi. Inspector Gregson's police identification. It's the official warrant card issued to him by Scotland Yard.\"\nThe Inspector's Identification was handed over by the Red-Headed League conmen, testifying it belonged to the Inspector they took captive. But it turns out Gossip had a bruised red collar on his neck, indicating he was the imposter taken captive at the Red-Headed League event, so for him to claim he \"never leaves Fresno Street\" is a lie. The contradiction is between Testimony 2 and Evidence 17.\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n",
